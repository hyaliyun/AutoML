Армия 1 имеет в своем составе разнообразный набор существ, которые обладают уникальными способностями. Кентавры с луками могут обеспечивать дальнобойную поддержку и гибкость на поле боя, горгульи и грифоны могут атаковать с воздуха, что дает преимущество в мобильности. Минотавры и их цари представляют значительную угрозу в ближнем бою с их мощными секирами, в то время как гидры, благодаря своей регенерации, могут выдерживать повреждения длительное время. Драконы, особенно чёрный, представляют собой значительную силу на поле боя с их огненным дыханием, способным нанести разрушения массового поражения. Армия 2 также имеет мощный состав, включая полуросликов с пращами, которые могут действовать как легкая пехота, выступая в роли разведчиков или дистанционных бойцов. Боровы предоставляют мощную ближнюю атаку, в то время как железные и стальные големы добавляют крайне тяжелую броню и ударную мощь. Птицы рух и маги, включая архимагов, могут предложить значительную магическую и воздушную поддержку. Гиганты и титаны, акцентирующие метательную молнию, могут вызвать серьезные разрушения, особенно против скоплений сил противника или особо крупных существ. Тактически, Армия 1 может попытаться максимально использовать свои преимущества в подвижности и способности наносить урон на расстоянии, воздушное господство с грифонами и горгульями для атак во фланги и сзади, в то время как драконы могут атаковать ключевые объекты и силы противника. Однако, сила их существ в некоторой степени зависит от ближнего боя, где минотавры и гидры могут быть эффективны. В ответ, Армия 2 может использовать своих големов как живые баррикады для защиты более уязвимых единиц, таких как маги и полурослики, которые могут наносить урон на расстоянии. Магическая сила от магов и архимагов может быть ключом к противодействию драконам и другим тяжелым единицам противника. Гиганты и титаны с их способностью к метанию молнии могут нанести существенный урон по сосредоточенным силам противника или ключевым целям. Однозначный вывод о том, у кого больше шансов на победу, сложен, учитывая разнообразие и мощь представленных единиц. Однако, учитывая уникальные возможности для масштабного повреждения и стратегического преимущества, предоставляемого драконами в Армии 1, и наличие значительного количества мощных ближнего боя существ, Армия 1 может иметь стратегическое преимущество в условиях открытого поля боя. Таким образом, если принимать во внимание тактику, состав единиц и их уникальные способности, Армия 1 может иметь немного больше шансов на победу в конкретных условиях столкновения.

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import java.sql.SQLException; @Configuration public class H2ServerConfiguration { @Bean(initMethod = \\"start\\", destroyMethod = \\"stop\\") public Server h2Server() throws SQLException { return Server.createTcpServer(\\"-tcp\\",\\"-tcpAllowOthers\\",\\"-tcpPort\\",\\"9092\\"); } } \`\`\` 这段代码中，\`createTcpServer\`方法通过几个参数配置了 TCP 服务器。其中： - \`-tcp\` 表示启动 TCP 服务器。 - \`-tcpAllowOthers\` 允许除了本机以外的其他计算机连接到数据库。 - \`-tcpPort\` 指定了服务器监听的端口号，这里为\`9092\`。 **注意**：如果您的应用程序已经在使用\`9092\`端口，您需要选择一个不同的端口。 经过上述配置，您的 H2 数据库就可以在服务器模式下运行了，而且可以接受外部软件的连接请求。确保您的防火墙设置允许通过所配置的端口进行通信。 最后，使用您喜欢的数据库管理工具（例如：DBeaver, H2 Console, etc.），使用前面配置的用户名、密码和 JDBC URL（类似于\`jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/~/test\`）来连接到数据库。"},{"prompt":"你的意思是，h2数据库不在由springboot指定存放文件了，而是作为独立数据库了","completion":"抱歉，如果我的回答造成了混淆。让我更清晰地解释一下： H2数据库可以以两种模式运行：**嵌入式**（Embedded）模式和**服务器**（Server）模式。在嵌入式模式中，数据库是作为应用程序的一部分运行的，只能由当前应用程序访问。而在服务器模式下，H2数据库作为一个独立的服务器进程运行，可以被同一网络上的其他客户端访问。 从你的原始配置来看，使用的是嵌入式模式（通过jdbc:h2:file:...），这种模式下数据库文件是被直接存储在文件系统中，并且默认情况只能被运行这个数据库的应用程序访问。 如果你想要让其他数据库管理软件接入，你需要让H2数据库以**服务器模式**运行，而不仅仅是启用一个额外的服务器端口。当以服务器模式运行时，H2数据库会作为一个独立进程运行，并且监听特定的TCP/IP端口以接受来自其他客户端的连接。这样，不仅Spring Boot应用程序，其他程序也可以通过网络连接到这个H2数据库实例。 上面的解释对于“由Spring Boot指定存放文件”和“作为独立数据库运行”可能有些混淆，重新澄清一下： - **嵌入式模式**：数据库与应用程序紧密集成，在同一个JVM中运行。数据库文件是由应用程序指定，并且由它独占。 - **服务器模式**：数据库在自己的JVM进程中运行，允许多个客户端通过网络连接。这使得即使应用程序关闭了，其他程序（如数据库管理软件）仍然可以访问数据库。 要实现后者，即**服务器模式**，你可以按照我上一条回复中的步骤操作：将JDBC URL从文件模式改为TCP服务器模式，并通过额外的配置来启动H2的TCP服务器。 重要的是，无论使用哪种模式，你都可以指定数据库文件的位置（对于嵌入式模式），或者在服务器模式下，数据库仍然会存储在某个位置，但可以被多个客户端访问。"},{"prompt":"也就是说让h2数据库和spring脱钩了，相当于像mysql那样的独立服务了，springboot也不知道h2数据库文件在哪里","completion":"是的，您的理解是正确的。将 H2 数据库配置为服务器模式，使其工作得更像是一个常规的数据库服务器（如 MySQL 或 PostgreSQL），意味着它会作为一个独立的服务运行，而不是嵌入到 Spring Boot 应用中。在这种配置下，Spring Boot 应用（或任何其他应用程序）通过网络连接到 H2 服务器，就像连接到任何其他远程数据库服务器一样。 在这种模式下，Spring Boot 应用（和其他可能的客户端）确实不需要知道数据库文件的实际位置。它们只需要知道如何通过网络（使用正确的地址和端口）连接到 H2 服务器。数据库文件的管理（例如，其存放的位置）是在 H2 服务器端进行配置的，与 Spring Boot 应用是分离的。 这种方式有几个优点： 1. **独立管理**：数据库可以独立于应用程序管理和运行，这在多个应用服务需要共享同一数据库时特别有用。 2. **更易于访问**：由于数据库监听在网络端口上，因此开发人员和数据库管理员可以使用标准的数据库管理工具远程连接到数据库进行查询、监控和管理。 3. **更接近生产环境配置**：在开发环境中使用与生产环境相似的数据库配置可以提高配置一致性，减少上线时出现的问题。 要实现这种配置，您需要手动启动 H2 服务器（或者通过应用程序自动启动，如之前例子所示），并确保您的 Spring Boot 应用（以及其他任何需要访问数据库的客户端）的配置用的是正确的网络连接字符串。同时，您还要确保网络安全设置（如防火墙规则）允许这种类型的连接。 总之，将 H2 配置为服务器模式提供了更多的灵活性和可访问性，但也需要您负责管理数据库服务器的启动、配置和维护。"},{"prompt":"CommandLineRunner和ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent> 为什么在SpringBootTest的时候，CommandLineRunner里面使用bean时，ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>里的bean没被加载，而正常启动的时候没问题","completion":"在 Spring Boot 应用中，\`CommandLineRunner\`接口和\`ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>\`接口提供了两种在应用启动完成后执行代码的方式。然而，它们在应用启动过程中的执行时机稍有不同，这可能会导致在不同场景（如正常启动 vs. 使用\`@SpringBootTest\`进行测试）下行为表现不一致。 # \`CommandLineRunner\` 实现\`CommandLineRunner\`接口的组件会在所有 Spring Beans 都初始化之后、应用启动完成之前被调用。这意味着此时 ApplicationContext 已经完全准备好，所有的 Beans 都已经加载和初始化完成。 # \`ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>\` 实现\`ApplicationListener\`接口并监听\`ContextRefreshedEvent\`的组件会在 Spring 的\`ApplicationContext\`被初始化或刷新时被调用。通常，\`ContextRefreshedEvent\`事件会在所有的 Bean 都被初始化后发布，这听起来和\`CommandLineRunner\`的执行时机很相似。 # 测试环境下的差异 在使用\`@SpringBootTest\`进行测试时，Spring Boot 的测试环境设置使得上述组件的行为可能会有所不同。\`@SpringBootTest\`为测试准备了一个 Spring 应用上下文，但其行为可能与正常启动应用时略有差异，特别是在事件发布和命令行运行方面。测试环境可能会更加注重测试上下文的准备和控制，而不是完全模拟正常的应用启动流程。 当你在\`CommandLineRunner\`中访问一个 Bean 时，这个 Bean 可能由于以下原因之一在\`ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>\`中尚未完全初始化或配置： 1. **测试上下文管理**：测试环境可能会根据需要延迟某些 Bean 的初始化，或者根据不同的测试策略采取不同的初始化顺序。 2. **事件发布的时机**：在测试环境中，\`ContextRefreshedEvent\`事件的发布可能会被影响，导致监听该事件的组件在不同的时间点被调用。 3. **加载和依赖差异**：测试时，Spring Boot 可能会根据测试配置创建一个略有不同的 Bean 定义和依赖注入图。这可能会影响 Bean 的加载顺序和可用性。 # 解决方法 如果您在测试环境中遇到这样的问题，您可以考虑以下解决方法： - **显式的 Bean 依赖定义**：确保您在关键执行点依赖的 Bean 被正确地和明确地定义了依赖，这样可以在 Bean 初始化时就考虑到它们。 - **测试配置调整**：调整您的\`@SpringBootTest\`配置，确保需要的 Beans 被正确加载和配置。有时，指定不同的\`@ContextConfiguration\`或使用模拟（Mock）对象代替一些真实的 Beans 可以避免问题。 - **使用\`@DependsOn\`注解**：在某些场景中，使用\`@DependsOn\`注解可以强制 Spring 按照指定的顺序来初始化 Beans。 最后，请确保您的测试环境尽可能地接近您的生产环境配置。这有助于减少环境差异导致的问题。"},{"prompt":"您提供的解决方案不显示，我只需要确保CommandLineRunner永远在ApplicationListener <ContextRefreshedEvent>之后执行","completion":"如果您的目标是确保\`CommandLineRunner\`在\`ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>\`之后执行，您可以采用一些策略调整它们的执行顺序。因为\`ContextRefreshedEvent\`是在上下文（包括所有Bean）准备好后发布的，而\`CommandLineRunner\`同样是在Spring Boot完全启动后执行。他们的执行顺序并不是固定的，特别是在集成测试时可能会有所不同。这里有几种方法可以尝试： # 方法1: 使用\`@Order\`或实现\`Ordered\`接口 Spring框架允许使用\`@Order\`注解或是直接实现\`Ordered\`接口来设定Beans的加载顺序。虽然这两者通常用来控制Bean的加载顺序，但它们也可以间接影响\`ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>\`与\`CommandLineRunner\`的执行顺序，因为Bean的加载和初始化顺序会影响这些组件的执行。 \`\`\`java import org.springframework.core.Ordered;

\`\`\` # 2. 延迟\`JFXConfig\`的使用： 如果直接通过\`Environment\`不符合您的情况，而您需要在\`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor\`中使用\`JFXConfig\`，一种方法是在确保\`JFXConfig\`已经初始化后再使用它。但这在\`postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry\`的上下文中可能不直接可行。 # 3. 修改配置获取方式： 考虑改用一个更符合\`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor\`阶段的策略。例如，如果您需要在该阶段动态注册基于Fxml的beans，可以将Fxml路径配置作为固定的或通过环境变量设置的值，然后在\`postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry\`中直接使用这些值。 # 总结： 确保您从\`Environment\`或任何Spring管理的组件中读取配置时配置键是正确的，并且配置源（如\`application.properties\`或\`application.yml\`）已经加载。如果在\`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor\`中直接使用注入的配置类（如\`JFXConfig\`）带来问题，考虑调整策略以配合Spring的生命周期。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.

The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up.

Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I'd list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV's case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world's first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these \\"peaceful\\" Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don't laugh: it's cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don't count","completion":"Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV's Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That's right! Shaman King's inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I'm curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It's such an underrated gem. But let's talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it's like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It's interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment's approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they're considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don't forget those shorts! Even though they're not considered part of the \\"main\\" lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It's always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I'm eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more \\"normal toons\\" to CW4Kids or if they'll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it's like they're trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what's next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they're aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We're thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support!

And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They've got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing!

But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It's always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let's hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It's the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV.

It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways.

With the big shuffle in CW4Kids' lineup and some classics making an exit, I'm curious about where fans of “Viva Pinata” and “GoGoRiki” are heading next. Both shows had that unique blend of humor, heart, and wild antics. Any guesses or hopes for what they might introduce to fill the void? ToonSleuth: Good question! Both “Viva Pinata” and “GoGoRiki” brought a lot of color and creativity to the table. I'm hoping CW4Kids leans into something equally vibrant. Maybe a show with strong world-building and quirky characters? Something that captures that same magic. AnimationAficionado: Definitely feeling the gap they’re leaving behind. Considering CW4Kids’ recent direction, I wouldn’t be surprised if they introduced another show with a rich, immersive world. Perhaps something with an environmental twist? Both “Viva Pinata” and “GoGoRiki” subtly encouraged appreciation for nature in their own ways. RetroToonFan: I've always appreciated how “Viva Pinata” managed to be both entertaining and somewhat educational without it feeling forced. “GoGoRiki” had this clever way of presenting life lessons amidst the humor. It'd be great to see a new series that can blend those elements—entertainment with a sprinkle of learning. CartoonConnoisseur: While it's sad to see them go, change does bring opportunity for something fresh. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for something with a similar charm but maybe with a bit more adventure? CW4Kids has been broadening their scope, so there's definitely potential for something exciting and new. DigitalDoodler: “GoGoRiki” in particular had such unique animation and style. I'm hoping for something that stands out visually and storytelling-wise. Maybe a show that leans into the fantastical or even tech-based, considering the recent trend toward more digitally-influenced series. NatureToon: For fans of “Viva Pinata”, a new show focusing on environmental themes but with a fantastical twist could be really appealing. Something that captures the imagination and plays into the gardening/building aspect, but within a cartoon setting. ToonMasterJay: There was something so soothing about “Viva Pinata'' but also hilariously chaotic with “GoGoRiki”. Maybe CW4Kids is planning to blend those vibes into a new creation. Can't wait to see what they come up with. Remember, every ending is just a new beginning in the world of cartoons! Admin_CW4KidsRevamp: We're always listening to our fans and taking note of what you love about our shows. While saying goodbye is never easy, we’re excited about the future and bringing new adventures to your screens. Stay tuned for announcements—you won’t be disappointed.

Besides “World of Quest”, they’re also nudging us towards “Pokémon Horizons: The Series”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, and “Code Lyoko”. Seems like a solid mix of fantasy, adventure, and tech vibes. Smart move by CW4Kids to guide the audience to new favorites. PixelPioneer: Love the initiative! “World of Quest” definitely fills the quirky adventure slot. I’m curious about how fans of the more laid-back “Viva Pinata” feel about diving into something as action-packed as “Pokémon Horizons: The Series” though. Could be an interesting shift! RetroToonFan: I think it’s a great way to keep the community engaged and exploring new series. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has that creative charm and humor that “GoGoRiki” fans might appreciate. And “Code Lyoko” offers a deeper narrative for those looking for more complex storytelling. AnimationAficionado: It’s a well-rounded selection. “World of Quest” brings that adventurous spirit, while “Code Lyoko” delivers on the intrigue and tech angle. And with “Pokémon Horizons” and “Gloopy and Glitter”, there’s no shortage of fantastical worlds and creatures. Seems like they’ve covered all bases for fans seeking new realms.

He's able to outsmart the crooks that try to sell him a 'miracle' joint cure :)","completion":"Title: \\"The Wisdom of Age\\" Opening Scene: The show kicks off with Fletcher, now an older gentleman in his seventies, enjoying a peaceful retirement. Our beloved character, once known for his quick wit and street smarts during his days at HMP Slade, is now navigating the challenges of being an OAP (Old Age Pensioner). Despite his age, Fletcher hasn't lost his charm or his cunning nature. Plot Summary: Fletcher's peaceful retirement takes a turn when he becomes the target of a group of smooth-talking con artists. These crooks, recognizing Fletcher as an elderly man potentially desperate for a cure to his aching joints, decide to pitch him a \\"miracle\\" joint cure. The product, they claim, is the result of years of research and promises immediate relief with no side effects. Fletcher, initially intrigued, agrees to meet with the crooks for a demonstration. However, it doesn't take long for his old instincts to kick in. He starts to notice inconsistencies in their story and product details that don't add up. Instead of confronting them immediately, Fletcher decides to play along, pretending to be fully convinced and eager to buy their product. He invites them to his home, promising them that he'll convince his network of fellow OAP friends to invest in their miracle cure, hinting at a lucrative opportunity for the crooks. Eager for a big payday, they agree, not realizing they've just walked into a carefully laid trap by Fletcher. With the help of some old friends from his HMP Slade days, who are now also enjoying a quieter life, Fletcher sets up a sting operation. As the crooks arrive at his place, ready to scam not just Fletcher but his unsuspecting friends, they're met instead with a surprise. Fletcher reveals his awareness of their scam, having gathered enough evidence to expose them, including their lack of any real product and previous attempts to scam others. The episode climaxes with a humorous yet poignant confrontation, where Fletcher, using his legendary wit, manages to not only save himself and his friends from being scammed but also teaches the crooks a lesson. He enlightens them on the value of honesty and the detriments of preying on the vulnerable, especially the elderly. In the final scene, Fletcher is seen sharing a laugh with his friends over a cup of tea, reminiscing about the old days while celebrating their victory. He reminds them and the viewers that no matter the age, a sharp mind and a bit of skepticism can go a long way in outsmarting those who wish to do harm. Closing Thoughts: The episode, while humorous and light-hearted in its approach, touches upon important issues such as the vulnerability of the elderly to scams and the importance of staying vigilant. Fletcher, with his old wits about him, serves as a beacon of wisdom, showing that age is just a number and that experience can sometimes be the best defense against deceit. This hypothetical episode of \\"Going Straight\\" would be a testament to the enduring appeal of Fletcher's character, proving that no matter his age, he remains a beloved figure capable of outsmarting the crooks of the world with his wit and street smarts."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Episode of the Young Ones - 40 Years on - Done in the style of the 7/14/21 up etc films.. This episode follows up on the charcters from \\"The Young Ones\\" (such as Rick, Vivan and others.) in 2023, ...","completion":"Title: \\"The Not-So-Young Ones: A Reunion in Disarray\\" Opening Scene: The camera pans over modern London, bustling and vibrant, a stark contrast to the chaotic, cluttered house of the 1980s where we first met the anarchic ensemble of \\"The Young Ones\\". A text overlay reveals it's 2023, and an invitation with a retro design flies through various scenes, finally landing in the hands of our once young rebels, now facing the tempests of middle age. Plot Summary: The premise kicks off with the much-anticipated, albeit apprehensive reunion of Rick, Vyvyan, Neil, and Mike, set against the backdrop of a world far removed from the one they wreaked havoc upon in their youth. Inspired by the \\"7 Up\\" series style, we catch glimpses into their lives every seven years, leading up to the present day, where they've swapped anarchist manifestos and wild parties for midlife crises and suburban ennui. Rick, once the self-proclaimed \\"People's Poet,\\" has ironically found himself in a career of middle management. Though he outwardly projects success, inside, he wrestles with the empty promises of his youthful ideologies. Vyvyan, the punk rocker and walking disaster, has inexplicably become a successful inventor of extreme sports equipment, channeling his penchant for destruction into a lucrative business. Neil, the perpetual downtrodden hippie, stumbled into an eco-conscious startup, becoming an unwitting influencer in the vegan lifestyle movement. Lastly, Mike, the smooth operator and ladies' man, struggles to adapt his schemes to the digital age, having dabbled in various internet ventures with varying degrees of legality and success. The reunion, suggested by Neil in a moment of nostalgia, takes place in a rental house that eerily mirrors their old abode's chaos. The initial joy of reconnection quickly devolves as old dynamics resurface. The documentary-style narrative allows for introspective monologues, juxtaposing their current realities with their past ambitions and dreams. As they spend a weekend together, forced to confront their differences and the paths they've taken, the series utilizes flashbacks and \\"what could have been\\" scenarios, blending the show's signature surreal humor with poignant moments of reflection. The highlight comes during an attempt to relive their youth with a riotous party that instead reveals their middle-aged limitations, leading to a series of slapstick mishaps and existential crises. Throughout the episode, surreal and anarchic elements reminiscent of the original series keep the atmosphere unpredictable and wildly entertaining. From a sudden musical performance that parodies modern pop culture to an encounter with a talking pet reminiscent of their past bizarre adventures, \\"The Not-So-Young Ones\\" embraces its heritage while reflecting on the passage of time. In the concluding act, amidst the chaos of their failed party, the characters find solace in their enduring, if complicated, friendship. They come to realize that while life might not have turned out as they expected, they still carry a piece of their youthful rebellion within them. The episode closes with them sitting together, watching the sunrise, reflecting on the notion that you're only as old as you feel. Closing Thoughts: \\"The Not-So-Young Ones: A Reunion in Disarray\\" serves as a nostalgic, humorous, and often touching ode to aging, change, and the enduring spirit of youth, even in the face of time's relentless march. Through its clever blend of documentary-style storytelling and the anarchic humor that defined the original, the episode captures the essence of what it means to grow up, but not necessarily grow old."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Episode of : Gordon Brittass - A Carrer in Sports Management - It's presented as a badly made VHS corporate film about Gordon Britass, from his time as a lesuire centre manager, and his rise to be a a Sports comissioner for the EU, until Brexit cut short his future...","completion":"Title: \\"The Unstoppable Rise and Sudden Fall of Gordon Brittas: A Sporting Legacy\\" Opening Scene: A grainy VHS tape begins to play, introducing the audience to the unmistakable pomp and circumstance of a promotional corporate film from the late '90s. The title sequence is accompanied by overly dramatic music and a montage of sports facilities, each clip more grandiose than the last, culminating in a freeze-frame of Gordon Brittas, beaming in front of the Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. Narrator: In a tone that's a mix of awe and forced enthusiasm typical of the era, the narrator introduces Gordon Brittas as a visionary leader, whose innovative management style and unparalleled commitment to public leisure services have left an indelible mark on the world of sports and recreation. Segment One: \\"The Whitbury Years\\" We're taken on a whirlwind tour of Brittas's tenure as the manager of the Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. The segment is full of comically low-quality reenactments, featuring stand-ins for beloved characters such as Laura, Tim, and Julie engaging in zany, Brittas-inspired antics, from disastrous motivational talks to improbable health and safety disasters. Clips of Brittas's most memorable (and catastrophic) initiatives are interspersed with \\"testimonials\\" from staff and patrons (actors hamming up their roles), praising Brittas's leadership with backhanded compliments. Segment Two: \\"To Europe and Beyond\\" Brittas's ascension to a high-ranking position as a Sports Commissioner for the European Union is chronicled through a series of staged \\"news\\" reports and interviews. The segment shows Brittas unveiling ambitious projects, like an attempt to standardize the size of swimming pools across Europe, and introducing universal swimming badges that somehow cause international tensions. His boundless confidence and tendency to disregard expert advice lead to a series of humorous and cringe-worthy diplomatic faux pas. Segment Three: \\"Brexit and the Brittas Legacy\\" The tone shifts as the segment delves into Brittas’s obliviousness to the political undercurrents of Brexit. It becomes clear that his career is in jeopardy as EU officials grow weary of his eccentricities. Through dramatized sequences, we witness Brittas confidently proposing increasingly outlandish sports initiatives intended to “unite” Europe, oblivious to the crumbling political foundation beneath his feet. The segment culminates in a melodramatic reenactment of Brittas's last stand: an impassioned, yet wildly misguided speech about the power of synchronized swimming to heal political divides, delivered just as news of his dismissal breaks. Ending Credits: As the screen fades to the rolling credits, overlaid with a soft-focus image of Gordon Brittas saluting the European flag, the narrator summarizes Brittas's impact on the sports management and leisure sectors with an overtly saccharine tribute. Despite his fall from grace, we're assured that Brittas's legacy will live on, not just in the EU, but wherever there's a need for \\"unconventional\\" leadership in sports. Closing Scene: The tape ejects from a VCR, and for a moment, we see a present-day Brittas, wearing a slightly outdated suit, picking up the tape and looking directly at the camera. With a wink, he quips about his next venture: bringing his unique management style to space tourism. Fade to black on Brittas's trademark clueless optimism, leaving the viewer to imagine the cosmic scale of his next series of blunders. This episode serves as a satirical homage to the enduring character of Gordon Brittas, blending nostalgia with a critique of his well-intentioned yet disastrously executed management style, highlighting the thin line between ambition and delusion in the pursuit of sporting excellence."},{"prompt":"The closing scene, would work better given the space tourism angle, if he drops in a line about banning curry in space for health reasons ( a nod to another role of the actor concerned..) ...","completion":"Closing Scene Reimagined: As the tape fully ejects from a vintage VCR, we transition from the grainy footage to the contemporary sharpness of a real-world setting. We find Gordon Brittas, having barely aged, in a nostalgically outdated but pristine suit. He delicately places the VHS tape onto a shelf, already brimming with similarly themed tapes, each chronicling another of his grand, though often misguided, ventures. Brittas turns towards the camera, a glint of indefatigable optimism in his eyes, reminiscent of his days at Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He begins to speak with his characteristic mix of confidence and obliviousness, \\"And now, onto the final frontier, space. Where, I assure you, for health and safety reasons, we shall strictly prohibit the consumption of curry.\\" The camera lingers on Brittas's self-satisfied nod at his own remark—a subtle yet humorous nod to actor Chris Barrie's renowned role as Rimmer in \\"Red Dwarf,\\" where curries are a recurring theme and source of amusement. This clever crossover not only serves to delight fans familiar with Barrie's body of work but also reinforces Brittas's well-meaning, though often comically misguided approach to management, extending it to the boundless and untested realms of space tourism. As Brittas's smile widens with the prospect of applying his unique brand of leadership beyond Earth, the scene fades to black, encapsulating the indomitable spirit of Gordon Brittas. Through his untiring, albeit eccentric, dedication to improving whatever domain he finds himself in—be it leisure centres, the European Union, or the vast expanse of space—Brittas remains a timeless example of ambition, perseverance, and the quintessentially British brand of comedy."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical TV sitcom episode : - The post Maplins Carrer's of the Yellow Coats are detailed.. Ted Bovis is in rehab though... his jokes weren't funny by the 1970's...","completion":"Title: \\"After the Laughter: The Yellow Coats' New Ventures\\" Opening Scene: The iconic \\"Hi-de-Hi!\\" catchphrase echoes one last time over the scenes of an empty Maplins holiday camp, the laughter and chaos of the past giving way to quiet nostalgia. The camera pans over memorabilia in a dimly lit room—a whistle, a yellow blazer, and photos of the staff in their prime. The somber tone is quickly broken by the unmistakable sound of a record scratching. Plot Summary: It's been years since the heyday of Maplins Holiday Camp, and the beloved Yellow Coats find themselves navigating the complexities of life beyond the camp’s fences. Each character, from chalet maid to entertainment manager, embarks on journeys that reflect their aspirations, quirks, and inevitable growth after the curtains closed on their Maplins careers. Ted Bovis, once the heart and arguably the trouble of the entertainments team, finds himself in an unexpected place: rehab. Known for his quick wit and knack for pushing the boundaries of 1970’s humor, Ted’s realization that his jokes no longer resonate with audiences propels him on a journey of self-discovery and reinvention. Ted’s storyline offers a mix of heartfelt moments and humor, spotlighting the challenges of adapting to a world that has moved beyond slapstick and one-liners. Ted's reevaluation of his career and comedic style runs parallel to the stories of his former colleagues, each pursuing new paths: - Peggy, the ever-optimistic chalet maid with dreams of becoming a Yellow Coat, has finally realized her dream in the most unexpected way. She's launched a successful online platform for aspiring entertainers, blending her unflagging enthusiasm with practical advice gleaned from years of observing the entertainment crew. Peggy's segments are a whirlwind of comedic tutorials and heartfelt pep talks, showcasing her journey from underdog to unexpected entrepreneur. - Gladys Pugh, the fiercely disciplined chief Yellow Coat, finds herself at a crossroads between her desire for order and her love for entertainment. Her story unfolds as she becomes a community theater director, where her authoritarian style both clashes and comically merges with the free-spirited nature of amateur actors. Her segments highlight the hilarity that ensues when different worlds collide, underscored by her unwavering passion for the arts. - Jeffrey Fairbrother, the well-meaning but often out-of-depth entertainment manager, has returned to academia but discovers his true calling lies in motivational speaking. Using lessons learned from managing the chaotic entertainments team, Jeffrey’s segments deal with his attempts to inspire others, often with humorous detours as he applies Maplins' logic to real-world problems. Midway through the episode, the characters cross paths at a charity event organized by Peggy to support entertainers in transition. The reunion is bittersweet, filled with laughter, reflective conversations about the past, and discussions about the future. Ted, fresh out of rehab and armed with a new sense of comedic timing that resonates with the modern audience, performs a stand-up routine that cleverly addresses and satirizes his journey. Closing Scene: The charity event ends with the group gathered on stage, leading the audience in a rousing, albeit slightly off-key, rendition of the Maplins anthem. The camera pulls back to show the former Yellow Coats surrounded by fans old and new, illustrating that while their paths have diverged, the spirit of Maplins and their bond remains unbroken. The episode balances nostalgia with the characters' evolution, showing how the end of one era can be the beginning of something new and equally meaningful. By blending humor with moments of introspection, \\"After the Laughter: The Yellow Coats' New Ventures\\" offers a touching yet funny homage to the enduring impact of Maplins on its staff and the importance of adapting with grace and humor."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical TV sitcom episode : Patsy and Edina a life in fashion and PR . There is also a staged 'un-civil' ceremony, that's a staged PR event where Patsy and Edina don't get hitched. :)","completion":"Title: \\"Absolutely Fabulous: Fashionably Unwed\\" Opening Scene: The always-glamorous duo, Patsy Stone and Edina Monsoon, are seen bustling through the chaotic streets of London's fashion district. Amidst a whirlwind of shopping bags and the latest trends, they're plotting their grandest, most headline-grabbing scheme yet: a faux \\"un-civil\\" ceremony to promote Eddy's latest PR venture, a daring new fashion line that cleverly blurs the line between haute couture and streetwear. Plot Summary: The episode kicks off with Edina in a frenzy, her PR company barely clinging to relevance in the fast-paced world of fashion publicity. Eddy, in a stroke of intoxicated genius, concocts a plan to announce the most avant-garde event the London fashion scene has ever seen—her own \\"un-civil\\" ceremony to her lifelong partner in crime, Patsy. This staged event is designed not just to shock and awe but to serve as the launch party for a revolutionary fashion line that challenges every convention. Patsy, ever the willing accomplice, dives headfirst into the scheme, seeing it as the perfect opportunity to cement her status as a fashion icon. The preparations for the event are nothing short of chaotic, with theme ideas that range from punk rock meets royal wedding to an outrageous space-age love affair. Along the way, the pair enlist the help of their usual entourage: Saffy, Edina's perpetually disapproving daughter, finds herself tasked with keeping the event from devolving into total anarchy; Mother is inadvertently roped into a viral marketing campaign; and Bubble, Edina's eccentric assistant, somehow ends up being mistaken for a cutting-edge designer by the fashion elite, adding to the confusion and chaos. However, as the big day approaches, the reality of their extravagant stunt begins to dawn on Eddy and Patsy. Amid the frenzy of final preparations and a guest list that reads like a who's who of the fashion world and tabloid darlings, the pair start to have second thoughts. Their friendship is tested as they confront the possibility that their outrageous plan might actually lead to some unwelcome changes in their relationship. In true Patsy and Edina fashion, a series of comedic mishaps and revelations leads up to the event, including a lost venue, a wardrobe malfunction of epic proportions, and a misplaced guest of honor—none other than a confused but somehow game fashion icon mistaking the event for a genuine ceremony. The climax of the episode is the \\"un-civil\\" ceremony itself, held in an absurdly decorated space that seamlessly combines trash chic with luxe opulence. Just as the pair are about to go through with their plan, they break into laughter, unable to maintain the facade. Amid the confusion, Edina grabs the microphone and delivers an impromptu speech about the enduring power of friendship, fashion, and the importance of not taking oneself too seriously. The event, though it doesn't go as planned, becomes legendary, catapulting Edina's PR firm and Patsy's status as a fashion icon to new heights. Closing Scene: The episode closes with Patsy and Edina, arm in arm, watching the sunrise over London from the rooftop of a trendy after-party venue. Surrounded by remnants of their outrageous celebration, they share a heartfelt moment of reflection. In a world obsessed with labels and definitions, they rejoice in their undefinable, chaotic, and absolutely fabulous bond. Tagline/Catchphrase: \\"Darling, who needs vows when you've got style?\\" This episode of \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\" captures the essence of Patsy and Edina's wild, unconventional adventures, while offering a satirical look at the fashion industry, PR stunts, and the concept of marriage—all wrapped in the show's signature blend of humor, satire, and heartfelt moments between its unforgettable characters."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical TV Drama episode - Sherlock Holmes - The Espionage Years.. Between 1914 and his death in 1948 Holmes was still as sharp as ever, but his cases where more of an 'intelligence' nature, and it's only after nearly 70 years that his later 'cases' can be published..","completion":"Title: \\"Sherlock Holmes: Shadows of War\\" Opening Scene: The foggy streets of London are quiet under the shadow of World War I. The camera pans over the iconic landmarks, now draped with the somber signs of war. Amid this eerie silence, the scene shifts to 221B Baker Street, where an aging Sherlock Holmes, his features sharper and his eyes more penetrating with age, meticulously studies a coded message sprawled across numerous telegrams. Plot Summary: It's the year 1915, and Sherlock Holmes has reluctantly found himself drawn into the dark world of espionage. His retirement is interrupted by a visit from Mycroft Holmes, his brother and a key figure in the British government, who presents Sherlock with a case of national importance. A network of spies, known under the codename \\"The Shadow League,\\" has infiltrated the highest echelons of British Intelligence. Mycroft, knowing only Sherlock possesses the keen intellect necessary to unravel this web of deceit, implores him for assistance. Reluctant yet compelled by the challenge and the duty to his country, Sherlock embarks on a journey that spans the troubled years between 1914 and 1948. The episode is structured around a series of flashbacks, interwoven with scenes of a contemporary historian in the late 20th century uncovering Sherlock’s classified case files. With Dr. John Watson by his side, now a decorated veteran with deeper scars than those left by any battlefield, Sherlock navigates the treacherous waters of wartime London. Their investigation leads them from the dimly lit back alleys of the East End to the opulent halls of the War Office, encountering a complex cast of characters including double agents, disillusioned soldiers, and even a femme fatale who poses a particular challenge to Holmes. As Holmes and Watson delve deeper into the mystery, they uncover a sinister plot that could change the course of the war. The duo's detective skills are put to the ultimate test, involving cryptography, the early art of signals intelligence, and Holmes's mastery of disguise and deductive reasoning. In a gripping climax, Sherlock orchestrates a daring sting operation to capture the mastermind of The Shadow League during a clandestine meeting in an abandoned warehouse. The operation is fraught with danger, testing not just Sherlock's intellect but the bravery and loyalty of his closest allies. Closing Scene: As peace finally returns to London's streets, a reflective Holmes stands atop the Tower Bridge at dawn. He's joined by Watson, and together they watch the sun rise over the city they've protected in shadow. Sherlock muses on the changing nature of crime and justice in the new world order, contemplating his legacy and the secret battles fought in the name of peace. As the screen fades to black, a voice-over from the historian reveals that it would be nearly 70 years before Sherlock Holmes's critical role in shaping the outcome of both World Wars would be revealed, cementing his legacy not only as the world's greatest detective but also one of its most unsung heroes. Tag: \\"In the shadows of war, the brightest minds illuminate the truth.\\" \\"Sherlock Holmes: Shadows of War\\" melds the classic detective narrative with the intrigue of spy fiction, exploring a lesser-known chapter in Holmes's illustrious career.

Today, they're excited to guide viewers through crafting their very own Clangers moonscape — a tribute to the enchanting world of the beloved early '70s stop-motion animation series. Materials Needed: - A large, shallow cardboard box (this will be the base of your moonscape) - Old newspapers - PVA glue (white school glue) - Water - Paint (black, grey, white, and any other colors you'd like for your moonscape) - Paintbrushes - Small rocks and pebbles - Aluminum foil - Plasticine or modeling clay (for making your very own Clangers and props) - Scissors - A mixing bowl for the papier-mâché paste Step 1: Prepare the Papier-Mâché Base The presenter explains that the first step to creating our moonscape is to form the base using papier-mâché. They show how to tear old newspapers into strips and mix PVA glue with water in a bowl to create the paste. Once mixed, they dip the newspaper strips into the glue mixture then layer them over the cardboard box, molding small hills and craters to form the terrain. This would be left to dry overnight. Step 2: Painting the Moonscape Once the papier-mâché has dried thoroughly, it's time to paint. The presenter demonstrates how to mix black and grey paint to get a moon-like color and advises starting with a darker base, adding lighter shades for highlights and to define the moonscape's features. White and yellow paints can be dabbed gently with a sponge to create a starry background around the edges of the box. Step 3: Adding Texture and Features The presenter selects small rocks and pebbles, placing them around the moonscape to add realism. They emphasize the importance of letting creativity guide the process — suggesting the use of aluminum foil to create futuristic structures or spacecraft, gently molding them into shape and placing them within the scene. Step 4: Crafting the Clangers Using plasticine or modeling clay, the presenter offers a simple tutorial on crafting small Clanger figures. They show how to roll the clay into shapes for the body, head, and snout, demonstrating how tiny details make each Clanger character come to life.

Let's embark on a nostalgic journey back to a hypothetical mid-1980s episode of Blue Peter where they showed us how to create Halloween skulls using paper mâché. While this exact make might not have aired in the 1980s, it captures the spirit of the era and the innovative DIY ethos of the show. **Materials Needed:** - Balloons - Newspaper - White flour and water (for the paper mâché paste) - A paintbrush or two - White and black paint - Varnish (optional, to make it weather-resistant if kept outside) - Craft knife (to be used by an adult) **Instructions:** 1. **Prepare Your Work Area:** Begin by covering your work surface with old newspapers to keep it clean. Paper mâché can get messy! 2. **Make the Paper Mâché Paste:** Mix one part water with one part flour to create a smooth paste. If it's too thick, you can add a little more water. 3. **Prepare Your Paper:** Tear the newspaper into strips. The strips can be about an inch wide and several inches long. You'll need enough to cover your balloon multiple times. 4. **Blow Up a Balloon:** Inflate a balloon to the desired size of your skull. This will serve as your mold. 5. **Apply Your Paper Mâché:** Dip the newspaper strips into the flour-water paste, removing excess paste by running the strip between your fingers. Then, apply the strips to the balloon, smoothing each one down to avoid air bubbles. Cover the balloon with three to four layers of paper mâché. Leave a small opening around the tied end of the balloon – this will allow you to remove the balloon later and also create an opening in the base of the skull. 6. **Let It Dry:** Once you’ve covered the balloon in several layers of newspaper, leave it to dry thoroughly. This could take up to 24 hours, depending on the humidity and temperature. 7. **Adding Skull Features:** Once your base is dry, you can add more layers to define skull features, such as cheekbones and the brow ridge, by molding pieces of paper mâché and attaching them with your paste. 8. **Pop the Balloon and Paint:** When the skull is completely dry, and the features are added, pop the balloon and remove it through the base. Use white paint as the base coat for your skull. Once that’s dry, you can add details with black paint, like the eyes, nose cavity, and teeth. 9. **Varnish (Optional):** If you plan to display your skull outside, you may want to apply a coat of varnish to protect it from moisture. 10. **Display Your Creation:** Once everything is dry, your Halloween skull is ready to display! This nostalgic make would have tied in perfectly with the Blue Peter aesthetic, promoting creativity, recycling, and hands-on fun. Viewers would have been encouraged to send in pictures of their own skulls, perhaps even featuring them in the show's iconic \\"Gallery\\" segment."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Many centuries after Bulma's and Wukong's time, the 3 January 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute Imperial Royal parliamentary monarchy but de jure feudal royal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa bakufu [tent government |bakufu|], [the bakufu] popularly [the bakufu] known as [the bakufu's more popular name] the shogunate, [the bakufu] a system of government in Japan dominated [the bakufu] by a feudal military dictatorship exercised in the name of a sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, the military rulers of Japan |the sei-i taishōgun| during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868 in Japanese history who |the sei-i taishōgun| carried out |the sei-i taishōgun| the actual duties of administration in Japan during that time period who |the sei-i taishōgun| also |the sei-i taishōgun| enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority within Japan], [the sei-i taishōgun] more popularly known as [the sei-i taishōgun's more famous name] a shogun or by the shogun himself, with the hierarchy that held the bakufu together being [the hierarchy holding the bakufu] reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the collection of various powers that supported the bakufu and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, the powerful Japanese magnates, and feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings despite being subordinate to the shogun/sei-i taishōgun and nominally to the Japanese emperor, whom the buke/samurai served as well-paid retainers, the daimyō [large private land |daimyō], [the Tokugawa bakufu] ruling [the Tokugawa bakufu] over Japan and Okinawa, [the Meiji Restoration in the Tokugawa bakufu] that [the Meiji Restoration] allowed the Japanese imperial family, the supposedly Shinto-pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty to [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] reclaim its [the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's] executive power over the Japanese government and [the Meiji Restoration] dissolved the Tokugawa shogunate and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the formation of the post-1868, pre-1947 the supposedly Shinto-pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled unitary Imperial parliamentary democratic Royal monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Third Japanese Empire/Great Japan/Imperial Japan/Empire of Japan ruling [the Great Japanese Empire] over [the Great Japanese Empire's territories] the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Russia's Sahalkin and [Russia's] Kuril Islands, Okinawa/Ryūkū, the Caroline's, the Marinas and Palau from [the Great Japanese Empire's homebase and stronghold] the Japanese Home Islands and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the rise of Japan as a political, military, economic and industrial superpower, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] does not lead to the displacement of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns and the samurai class due to the Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato regaining its power due to the Meiji Restoration as in OTL, but [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] is [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [what the Meiji Restoration is in this timeline] a compromise between the conservative feudal elites that support the Tokugawa clan and the bakufu system and the liberal democrats who support the imperial family in Tokugawa bakufu-ruled feudal Japan, with the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan maintaining their [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan's] positions as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan but [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan after 1868 in this timeline] effectively only controlling Japanese local government in this timeline and [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan after 1868 in this timeline] also leading the Japanese military into battle, with the reigning heads of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty in their [ the reigning heads of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's] role as Japanese Emperors/Empresses being Japanese head of state and also the head of the Japanese armed forces. The buke/samurai and the daimyō are [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] not abolished [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] like in OTL but rather [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] into the Great Japanese Empire's post-1868, post-1947 hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [Magnificent/Exalted lineage |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The industrial, economic and military development that made Japan into a great power after the Meiji Restoration in OTL continues unhindered and the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, is [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] still [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] formed [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] in 3 January 1868 like in OTL, however the centuries-earlier victory of the Japanese in the Imjin Wars of May 23, 1592 – December 16, 1598 launched [the Imjin Wars] by the hereditary military dictatorship of the Ashikaga bakufu de-facto lead by Toyotomi Hideyoshi-ruled feudal Japan against the satelite state and tributary kingdom of Great Joeson ruled by the partially Han Chinese Korean House of Jeonju Yi in the entire Korean peninsula and the state it [Great Joeson] was [Great Joeson] a vassal [Great Joeson] to, the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" ruling over the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty, Yunnan and Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi |Cantonia|] unlike in OTL and the subsequent annexation of post-Imjin Wars Korea into Ashikaga bakufu-ruled feudal Japan as the Japanese province of Chōsen with with Hideyoshi taking the last King of Joeson before the Imjin Wars in this timeline, Seonjo's daughter, Princess Jeongmyeong as his [Hideyoshi's] latest concubine after the Imjin Wars in this timeline and compliant members of Korea's indigenous slave-owning, sex-slave owning, China loving, resistant to change, Confucianist and neo-Confucianist aristocracy and nobility, the yangaban, [compliant members of the yangaban] along with compliant members of the Korean royal family [the House of Jeonju Yi] being [compliant members of the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi] married off [compliant members of the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi] into Japanese royalty, aristocracy and nobility after the Japanese victory in the Imjin Wars and the subsequent dissolution of Joeson and the annexation of post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan as Chōsen in this timeline with buke/samurai and daimyō from the Japanese Home Islands slowly replacing the yangaban and the now-dissolved Joeson's ground force in this timeline, the now-dissolved Joeson Army as the main aristocratic and military presence within post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea with anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi after its [post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea's in this timeline] annexation into Japan as Chōsen being [ anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi] hunted down and [ anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea] either killed, reeducated or [anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan] deported [anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea] to the Ming dynasty by the Japanese, who [the Japanese] then [the Japanese in this timeline] after [the Japanese in this timeline] liberating the mostly illiterate, uneducated, impoverished and starving Korean people from the yangaban and the useless Korean royals [the House of Jeonju Yi] due to [the Japanese in this timeline] winning the Imjin Wars in this timeline, [the Japanese in this timeline] undertake a comprehensive education, primitive industrial and religious reform system in the post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korean peninsula, with schools being opened up for the common Korean people to get an education for themselves and their children and land reform in Korea being initiated by Hideyoshi by having seized yangban and House of Jeonju Yi estates go to ethnic Korean peasant farmers and ex-slaves within post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea in this timeline. The native Korean script for writing the Korean language, Hangul is [Hangul in this timeline] discovered [Hangul in this timeline] by the Japanese after the annexation of post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan and [Hangul in this timeline] subsequent spread and promoted as the way [Hangul in this timeline] to [Hangul in this timeline] write Korean by the Japanese in the timeline, who [the Japanese in this timeline] also promote the spread of the Japanese language and the heavily modified traditional Chinese characters used to write the Japanese language, Kanji, over the traditional Chinese characters used to write Korean utilized by the yangban and the House of Jeonju Yi, Hangul. The Japanese in this timeline also [the Japanese in this timeline] promote the Japanese indigenous national religion and state religion of Shinto, Zen Buddhism and even Christianity over traditional Korean shamanism, Taoism and Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea as well in this timeline, with the liberated Korean masses flocking to these new religions [ Shinto, Zen Buddhism and Christianity] in droves. The Japanese also [the Japanese in this timeline] begin a massive effort to [the Japanese in this timeline] absorb the Koreans into the Greater Japanese race and [the Japanese in this timeline] also integrate the Koreans into the Japanese political, social and economic systems, [the Japanese in this timeline] encouraging many Korean commoners in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea to take Japanese names and let their children think of themselves as Japanese, speaking, writing and thinking in Japanese. This is hugely successful and the Koreans are [the Koreans in this timeline] eventually assimilated [the Koreans in this timeline] into the Japanese nation as the centuries go by, mostly thinking, speaking and writing in Japanese by the time of the alternate Meiji Restoration in this timeline, although a now heavily Japanese, Manchu/Manchurian and Chinese influenced Korean language still exists as a \\"dialect\\" of Japanese in this timeline, with Korea and the Koreans having roughly the same status as Okinawa and the Okinawans in both OTL Japan and this version of Japan in this timeline Hideyoshi also [Hideyoshi] conquers Russia's Sakhalin and [Russia's] Kuril Islands in this timeline after Imjin Wars in this timeline, which [Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands in this timeline] become the Japanese province of Karufuto By the time Hideyoshi dies on September 18, 1598, with his [Hideyoshi's] nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu succeeding him [Hideyoshi] as both Chief Advisor to the Japanese Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm and his [Hideyoshi's] young son Toyotomi Hideyori next in line to succeed both Hideyoshi and Hidetsugu as Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm, with the then-reigning Japanese Emperor Go-Yōzei using this as an excuse not to appoint another shogun until Tokugawa Ieyasu attempts to take control of Japan from Hidetsugu and nearly reopens the Sengoku period. Go-Yōzei then appoints Ieyasu as shogun on March 24, 1603, causing the start of the Tokugawa shogunate and forces Ieyasu not to break the arranged marriage between Hideyori and Ieyasu's granddaughter Senhime, with the intention of making their [Hideyori's and Senhime's] first male child into the next shogun after Ieyasu's son Tokugawa Hidetada and also with the intention of uniting the Toyotomis and Tokugawas into a single family, securing the line of shogunal succession. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still [the Jurchens in this timeline] emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Japanese conquering the Tungning Kingdom in this timeline] on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Japanese also [the Japanese] work to assimilate the Chinese refugees from the Ming that make up the Tungning Kingdom's population and the main indigenous people in Taiwan who also make up 70% of Taiwan's population, the Han Chinese, or rather subgroup who speak Hokkien, a Southern Min language and/or trace their ancestry to southeastern Fujian in China, the Hoklo, [the Japanese working to assimilate the Hoklo] and the other indigenous tribes of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese population in this timeline using the same methods as used in Korea in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Returning to the alternate version of late 19th century to early 20th century Japan after the alternate version of the Meiji Restoration in this timeline, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces' ground warfare branch, the Imperial Japanese Army is [the Imperial Japanese Army] still [the Imperial Japanese Army] formed in February 1872 like in OTL but [the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline] is [the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline] significantly stronger than its [[the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline's] OTL counterpart due to the earlier conquest and subsequent integration of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Korea and Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands in Japan along with the discovery and exploitation of the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] by the Japanese The IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] is [the Kempeitai in this timeline] still [the Kempeitai in this timeline] formed on 4 January 1881 like in OTL The Cantonese Hakka-medical student turned Han nationalist, revolutionary, politician and statesman Dr. Sun Wen, [Wen] better known as Dr. Sun Yat-Sen is [Wen/Yat-Sen] assassinated [Wen/Yat-Sen] by a joint team of the UK's foreign intelligence M16 and the Russian Empire's combined secret police and foreign intelligence agency, the Okhrana when [Wen/Yat-Sen] studying in the Great Japanese Empire under the Japanese alias Kikori Nakayama [when Wen/Yat-Sen studied in the Japanese Empire under the name Nakayama] from 1899 to 1903. The mixture of steampunk and early diesel technology and sorcery known as Machinart [Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai], circuits [Machinart] made from spells that [the Machinart circuits] are [the Machinart circuits] put [the Machinart circuits] into objects [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] to [the placement of Machinart circuits into objects] bring them [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] to life and simultaneously [the placement of Machinart circuits into objects] give them [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] a rudimentary form of artificial intelligence, [the development of the Machinart circuits] continues [the development of the Machinart circuits] in the United Kingdom in the early 20th century. These Automatons [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] were [the Automatons] developed as a military weapon by the British government and spread throughout the world; the humans in charge of them [the Automations] became known as puppeteers. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution fought [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched and fought in the Xinhai Revolution] the anti Manchu Han nationalist and Cantonese nationalist revolutionary group adhering to republican, nationalist, and socialist objectives of the Tongmenghui which [the Tongmenghui] was [the Tongmenghui] founded by Wen/Yat Sen in 1905 in OTL which, [the Tongmenghui both in OTL and this timeline] later became the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society/revolutionary of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the Xinhai Revolution and the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] had [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people before and after the Xinhai Revolution, [the Kuomingtang, Tongmenghui and Yellow Sand Society launching the Xinhai Revolution] against the Manchu dominated, Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Manchuria, whose [the Xinhai Revolution's] goal was [the goal of the Xinhai Revolution both in OTL and in this timeline] \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\" in other words [Overthrow Qing and restore Ming] restoring the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government [the Ming dynasty] of a post-Qing Han China, [the Xinhai Revolution fought to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming dynasty as the government of post-Qing Han China] still [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] happens despite Wen's/Yat Sen's earlier death due to the strength and influence of Han nationalism and Han monarchist groups in Qing-occupied Han China and the covert and open support Japan gives to the Tongmenghui both in OTL and in this timeline. Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China all [ Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China] break away [ Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China] from Manchuria like Han China during and after the Xinhai Revolution like in OTL. The post-1912, pre-1928 and then post-1937, pre-1945 the stratocratic [military dominated] Beiyang Government-ruled presidental parliamentary democratic republic of the First Republic of China is [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] still [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] formed [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] as the government [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] of post-Qing, post-Xinhai Han China like in OTL while Manchuria still [Manchuria] comes [Manchuria] under the control of [which faction took over Manchuria] the Han Chinese bandit clique/military junta/Han Chinese government faction of the Fengtian Clique headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the Fengtian Clique's leader] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhang] known [Zhang] as [Zhang] \\"the Old Marshal\\", [Manchuria falling under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] despite the Qing Imperial Court continuing [the Qing Imperial court] still [the Qing Imperial court] existing in Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution like in OTL. When former top dog in the Great Qing Empire's modernized army corps envisioned as a regular and professional fully trained and equipped according to Western standards with a reserve, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang Government after the Xinhai Revolution and later the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China's first President, Yuan Shikai, [Shikai] still [Shikai] makes Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the unitary constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy of the Empire of China on 12 December 1915 like in OTL, everyone expects him [Shikai] to [Shikai] become Emperor [Shikai] of Han China. But unlike in OTL, he [Shikai] dies a day after [Shikai] forming the Empire of China in this timeline and so The Beiyang Government's armed wing and thus the first Republic of China's combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, [the Beiyang Army] built [the Beiyang Army] from both the Manchu and Han units of the now-dissolved New Army within Han China and the Beiyang Government's and thus the first Republic of China's and the Empire of China's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and House of Representatives, the National Assembly, [the Beiyang Army and the National Assembly] assume joint control over the Empire of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline, due to Yuan Shikai's eldest son, the half Korean Yuan Keding who [Keding] had [Keding] become Chinese Crown Prince under the combined era and regal name of Yuntai after Shikai formed the Empire of China, [Yuntai] refusing to become Emperor of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline. In order to stay afloat and not be toppled by the Chinese people like the Great Qing Empire, the Empire of China in this timeline decides to promote industrialization, development as well as the development of a National railway system in Han China along with [the Empire of China in this timeline] adopting a federalist, democratic system with the eighteen provinces of Han China proper being allowed autonomy, akin to the system of government in the post 1871, pre 1919 German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled federal parliamentary semi-constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Prussia ruling over much of modern-day eastern Germany and Western Poland along with Russian Kalingard-dominated Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the German Empire and the USA. The Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China also sends many students to Japan for training, education and constitutional lessons, along with having the IJAF and the German Empire's unified ground and air force, the Imperial German Army both train and build up the Beiyang Army into a ultra-modern, developed, ready force. The Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline also reluctantly allows for the secession of Yunnan from Han China, which [Yunnan] subsequently restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government with support from the Japanese The joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China/Nationalist China based [Nationalist China] in [Nationalist China's] stronghold of [Nationalist China's stronghold and homebase] Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi |Cantonia|], [Nationalist China] is [Nationalist China] is [Nationalist China] still [Nationalist China] formed [Nationalist China] in this timeline due to the strong desire of the Cantonese people for independence from both Manchu and Han dominion and the large amount of Han nationalists and imperialists in the Cantonian population and [Nationalist China in this timeline] still [Nationalist China in this timeline] launches the Chinese Civil War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 known as the National Protection War against the Empire of China like in OTL, but [Nationalist China in this timeline] loses the National Protection War due to [why Nationalist China loses the National Protection War in this timeline] the massive corruption and incompetence in the Kuomingtang, the Kuomingtang's armed wing and thus the Nationalist Chinese combined armed forces, the National Revolutionary Army and the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan, along with the fact that most Cantonese don't want to be a part of China, whether Manchu or Han-dominated as well as Sun's/Yat-Sen's earlier death in this timeline denying Nationalist China the charismatic leadership it needs, An anti-Chinese unification, pro-Cantonese independence, pro-buisness, merchant-backed faction eventually grows strength in Nationalist China and launches a putsch that sees the take over of the Kuomingtang and the Legislative Yuan as the Beiyang Army decimates the NRA, leading to the leaders of the Kuomintang and the generals of the Beiyang Army agreeing to an armistice that sees the independence of Nationalist China and the abandonment of the territory of the Qing Empire by Nationalist China. British and French soldiers firing on Japanese soldiers helping the Beiyang Army against the NRA during the National Revolutionary War leads to the Japanese joining the Central Powers consisting of the German Empire, The Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine ruled Federal parliamentary constitutional imperial royal monarchy of the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire] over Illryia [Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina], Greater Hungary [Hungary, Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje, Vojvodina and Prekmurje in Serbia, Transylvania and most of the Banat in Romania, Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland], Bohemia and Moravia [Czechia and Slovakia] and Galicia-Lodomeria in Ukraine from [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy's/Austria-Hungarian Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Austria [Austria, Slovenia, South Tyrol], , the Catholic cadet branch of the original German branch of the current British royal family, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial monarchy of the Tsardom of Bulgaria/Third Bulgarian Tsardom/Restored Byzantine Empire ruling over Bulgaria, the Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial royal absolute Islamic monarchy of the Sublime Ottoman State/Eastern Roman Sultanate/Islamic Rome ruling [the Ottoman Empire] over the Arab Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Kuwait from [the Ottoman Empire's stronghold and homebase] Turkey, [Japan joining the Central Powers in this timeline] in WW1 instead of the Central Powers' rivals consisting of the British Empire, the French supremacist, French imperialist, facist totalitarian dictatoral republic of the Third French Republic and the post-1861, pre-1947, French-Italian cadet branch of the German-Italian House of Savoy, the House of Savoy-Carignano ruled Unitary Constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Italy ruling over Italy, Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritia and Somalialand, the German-Danish-Russian House of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional absolute royal imperial monarchy of the Russian Empire/Third Rome/Third Roman Empire/Russian Rome/Russian Byzantium ruling [the Russian Empire] over Siberia, the Baltics, the Caucuses, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Ukraine, Central Asia, Chechenya and Kalymkia from [the Russian Empire's homebase] European Russia, the Entente [Japan joining the Central Powers instead of the Entente like in OTL] with the IJAF destroying the Russian Asian fleet and [the IJAF] also providing support to liberation movements within the European colonies in Asia and Oceania, typing up European forces. The Japanese also seize control of the imperial Russian protectorate of the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia also holding the title of Bogd Gegeen, making them the top-ranked lama in Mongolia known as the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as the Bogd Khan [Holy Emperor]-ruled post-Xinhai, Unitary Buddhist absolute monarchy of the feudal Khanate of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State in Greater Mongolia and [the Japanese] use the Great Mongolian State to [the Japanese] assault Russian Siberia and Central Asia while the Imperial German Army assaults the Russian Empire from Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces, Austria-Hungary's combined land, sea and air combat forces [the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces] along with the combined armed forces of the Tsardom of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Imperial Armed Forces, clean up Russia's Serbian and Montenegrin puppets. The post-1842 army of the Ottoman Empire, after the country was reorganized along modern western European lines during the Tanzimat modernization period, the Modern Ottoman Army, eats out the flower of the Russian Empire's combined armed forces, divided into a standing army consisting of regular troops and two forces that served on separate regulations: the Cossack troops and the Muslim troops and a state militia, the Imperial Russian Army in the Caucuses and even along with the border with Iran. The Kempeitai also has former child refugee from the Confederate States during the American civil war turned failed professor and Confederate revisionist, Woodrow Wilson assassinated before he [Wilson] can [Wilson] become US President like in OTL and [Wilson in OTL] drag the USA into WW1. Without a charismatic figurehead [Wilson] to lead the movement to victory against the hated US Republicans, the American religious right, the civil rights movement and Germans in the USA, the American Democrat Party, more specifically its [the Democrat Party's] white nationalist, Anglophile, England worshipping, anti-Semitic, white supremacist, anti-German Blue Dog wing and the Blue Dog's armed wing, the KKK, [the Blue Dogs and the KKK] never launch the New Freedom Revolution of 1912 against the American government and the Republicans and [the Blue Dogs and the KKK] eventually fade from the political scene in the USA in this timeline, with some of them migrating to England or to British-controlled Canada. The Russian Empire is [the Russian Empire] forced [the Russian Empire] to [the Russian Empire] sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers. The terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk see the German Empire creating the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled absolute feudal royal monarchy of the United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the German Empire creating] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the German Empire] creating the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the restored German Empire creating] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal imperial absolute monarchy of the Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire] forming the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the German Empire] restoring the hereditary royal absolute tribal Buddhist monarchy of the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and [the restored German Empire restoring] the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire also restores the constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of the side branch of the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. The Ottomans liberate the Sunni Muslim Imperial House of Khongirad-ruled absolute hereditary Islamic royal imperial monarchy of the Khanate of Khiva in western Uzbekistan, southwestern Kazakhstan and much of Turkmenistan and [the Ottomans] also liberate the Sunni Muslim Imperial House of Manghud-ruled absolute imperial royal monarchy of the Emirate of Bukhara in eastern Uzbekistan, western Tajikistan, parts of southern Kazakhstan, parts of Turkmenistan and southern Kyrgyzstan. The Great Japanese Empire establishes the Japanese protectorate of the constitutional presidential parliamentary republic of the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. After the defeat of the Russians in the war, the Germans and Austria-Hungarians are able to focus all their efforts on the Western front. The demise of the Democrat Party in the USA leads to the US government launching a crackdown on pro-British groups and organizations and so the Allies are unable to get any help from the Americans, so the Imperial German Army, with help from the Austrian-Hungarian Armed Forces, [the Imperial German Army and the Austrian-Hungarian Armed Forces] march into the French capital of Paris, with the British being forced to surrender when the Labor Party of England storms Parliament with the help of the British people and forces the British government to an armistice with the Central Powers. The shock of being defeated by an hated enemy is simply too much for the British to bear and so loyalist elements of the British army and public forcefully transport the British government and the current British royal family [the British branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha] to the British colonial dominion of British North America ruling over Canada, [the forced transport of the British government and royal family to Canada after the British defeat in WW1 in this timelien] leading to the formation of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Afghanistan and India] and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire's homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands in this timeline. At this timeline's Treaty of Versailles presiding over the division of the defeated Western Entente's territories, signed [this timeline's version of the Treaty of Versalies] in the Austrian City of Linz in this timeline, the Labor-dominated British government recognizes the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as legitimate and the Entente as the initiators of WW1 and [the British] accepting German control of the German House of Wettin-ruled federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Belgium, which [German-controlled Belgium in this timeline] takes the French region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais to [German-controlled Belgium in this timeline] form Greater Belgium. The Labor-dominated British government also recognizes the German annexation of Luxembourg and the loss of Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi to the Germans. The British also recognize the Albanian Muhammad Ali dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Egypt in Egypt's formal status as an Ottoman protectorate and also the independence of Sudan from the British and also the independence of all of Ireland as a unitary parliamentary royal monarchy under the rule of the Irish House of O'Neill Austria-Hungary also restores the pre-1903 Austrian protectorate of the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] removes the imperial Russian puppet fake Serbian royal family, the Serbian House of Karađorđević from power in post-WW1 Serbia. Austria-Hungary also demands that Serbia take full responsibility for starting WW1 by [Serbia] murdering Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Serbian nationalist terror organization that started WW1 by murdering the last pre-1903 King of Serbia and then Franz Ferdinand, the Black Hand be [the Black Hand] treated as war criminals. The army of the Kingdom of Serbia's combined armed forces, the Royal Serbian Army is [the Royal Serbian Army] placed under Austrian supervision. The Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Montenegro in Montenegro becomes an Austrian puppet state as well, with The Kingdom of Montenegro's combined armed forces, Royal Montenegrin Army under Austrian supervision. The German House of Wied-Neuwied-ruled Constitutional royal monarchy of the Principality of Albania in Albania takes Kosovo. Bulgaria subsequently receives the Moesia plain between the Danube and the Balkan mountains range (Stara Planina), Thrace from Greece and Macedonia from Serbia. The German House of Wittelsbach-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Greece becomes a Austrian puppet state as well. The Empire of China receives Singapore and Hong Kong from the British and Macau from the Portuguese. The Japanese also liberate the side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Imperial absolute parliamentary Royal monarchy of the Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Laotian Khun Lo dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Laos and the parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Cambodian House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia in Cambodia, [the restored Ming dynasty helping Japan liberate the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia] from the French colonial occupation of French Indochina ruling over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and [the Japanese] force the French to [the French] recognize Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian independence. The Germans also take Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger along with Chad, French Congo and Gabon from the French. The Germans also take the Congo from Belgium. The Germans combine Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger along with Chad, French Congo and Gabon in addition to Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi into one massive Central African German colony, Mittleafrika [Middle Africa |Mittleafrika|]. Austria also takes Veneto from the Kingdom of Italy. Thus the Treaty of Linz in this timeline ends with a decisive Central Powers victory and the end of British and French influence over the world. The Empire of China in this timeline remains under an extended regency for a year or two after the National Protection War due to Yuntai refusing the Chinese throne in this timeline, that is until the goal of the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline [\\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\"] is remembered and so the surviving descendants of the Chinese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] are [the Zhu descendants] invited [the Zhu descendants] by [who invites the Zhu descendants] the National Assembly under pressure of the Yellow Sand Society, [the Zhu descendants being invited by the National Assembly] to [what the National Assembly invites the Zhu descendants to do] reclaim their [the Zhu descendants'] rightful position as the rulers [the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China, which they [the Zhu descendants] reluctantly [the Zhu descendants] accept, [the Zhu descendants] seeing [the Zhu descendants] that the people of the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in Han China support them [the Zhu descendants] and the monarchy [the Ming dynasty]. Yuntai relinquishes his [Yuntai's] claim to the Chinese throne and [Yuntai] allows his [Yuntai's] children and [Yuntai's] siblings to be absorbed into the Imperial House of Zhu via concubinage, multiple marriages and adoption. The restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Han China after the National Protection war in this timeline is compared to this timeline's version of the Meiji Restoration in this timeline. The Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China ruling over Han China still has the official name of the \\"Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's and the first Republic of China's five-colored flag [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] a banner [the five-colored flag] having five horizontal bands of red [Han], yellow [Manchu], blue [Mongol], white [Hui] and black [Tibet] with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol, a white circle with a smaller red circle in the left, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol], representing [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] an eclipse, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] in the middle [of the modified five colored flag] as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. A modified version of the Kuomingtang's Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag becomes its [the restored Ming State's] naval flag, [the restored Great Ming State] replacing the Kuomintang's White Sun with a white-outer rayed, red inner-rayed yellow sun with the Chinese character for \\"Ming\\" in the middle of the yellow sun in tribute to the original Ming blue sky and red outer rayed yellow sun flag while the crossed 18-star iron blood flag of the Xinhai Revolution becomes the Chinese army flag. The Beiyang Government of the Republic of China’s Twelve Symbols national emblem is [the twelve Symbols National Emblem] rechosen [the twelve Symbols national emblem] as the Chinese national emblem, albiet with two crossed 18-star iron blood flags behind the main insigna of the emblem as tribute to the Xinhai Revolution, and a plum blossom/Chinese plum seal akin to the Japanese imperial family's, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato's/the Minamoto dynasty's Chrysanthemum seal is [the plum blossom seal] chosen [the plum blossom seal] as the reinstated Imperial House of Zhu's seal while the peony remains the Chinese national flower. The restored Great Ming State also has the first incarnation of the Empire of China's national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", as its [the restored Great Ming State's] national anthem. The pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" era and the pre-Great Qing Empire, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility is [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] subsequently [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] restored, restructured, readjusted and modified for the modern world of the late 20th century, [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] being [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] merged [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] with the system of peerage Yuan Shikai had [Yuan Shikai] created when he [Yuan Shikai] formed the Empire of China in 1915. The restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] begins efforts to transition towards a constitutional parliamentary democratic federalist Imperial Royal monarchy with free and fair, democratic multiparty elections via secret ballot, as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing and also to initiate massive industrial, railway and educational development works in Han China with the help of international aid. The Beiyang Army is [the Beiyang Army] retooled, restaffed and rebuilt into a modern incarnation of the Great Ming State's combined ground warfare and naval combat force, the Great Ming Army after the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China with help from Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans. Reformist elements of the Kuomingtang and the Nationalist Chinese government who had disagreed with Yat-Sen's goal of [Yat-Sen's] goal of Nationalist China' having the territory of the Great Qing Empire migrate to the restored Ming dynasty, including Sun-Yat-Sen's disciple and rightful heir, the Han Chinese revolutionary turned statesman and politician Wang Jingwei. Jingwei even becomes the Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet from 1939-1943, during which [Jingwei's first term as Prime Minister of the restored Ming dynasty] time the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the unitary parliamentary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] imperial dynastic monarchy of the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China, which [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] remains [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] the form [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] that the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] takes [the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Ming dynasty] from 1938-1954, and [Wang Jingwei becoming Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet] again from 1945-1951. Before Jingwei, the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang still becomes the first Prime Minister of the Empire of China from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922, and Jingwei is [Jingwei] succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP in this timeline due to the Empire of China winning the National Protection War in this timeline, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members in this time, then Wu Shih-wen of the KMT from 20 May 2000 – 1 February 2002, Chiang Chung-ling of the KMT from March 2000 – 30 March 2003 , then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. These elements from Nationalist China and the Kuomingtang work to incorporate Yat-Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism/social welfare into the government of the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu]. After the Treaty of Linz in this timeline, France and the British Isles are stripped off all their power, influence and strength and subsequently become international pariahs. A revolution launched by socialist, communist and syndicalist groups against the fascist French regime in around 1918-1919 leads to the flight of the French fascists to French North Africa [French occupied Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia] and the subsequent joint invasion of the French mainland by the Imperial German Army and the Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces. Mainland France soon falls quickly and the French House of Bourbon-ruled parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of France is [the Kingdom of France] restored [the Kingdom of France] as the government [the Kingdom of France] of Northern France by Austria-Hungary while the Germans restore the Feudal royal parliamentary monarchy of the Dutchy of Brittany in Brittany and [the Germans] establish an independent Occitan kingdom in Southern France. A communist takeover of the British Isles minus Ireland leads to the invasion of the British Isles by Germany and Austria-Hungary and the division of the British Isles into their separate Kingdoms: the Kingdom of Scotland in Scotland ruled by the German House of Wittelsbach, the Kingdom of England in England ruled by the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Dutchy of Wales ruled by the Welsh House of Anwyl of Tywyn. The Central Powers and the Japanese also sent aid to the monarchist, Russian nationalist, Russian fascist Whites fighting against the Communist Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War with the Whites winning the Russian Civil War, unlike in OTL. Germany makes European Russia a German protectorate under the Romanovs while the Bolsheviks flee to Siberia. The Iranian Imperial House of Pahlavi/Pahlavi dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Imperial State of Iran is [the Imperial State of Iran] still formed in Iran in 1925, but Iran takes Dagestan from the restored Russian Empire, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Uzbekistan's and Turkmenistan's shared Khwarazm province, and [Iran] subsequently absorbs Afghanistan into itself [Afghanistan]. The Imperial State of Iran's combined land, sea and air combat forces, the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces receives training from the Germans and the Austria-Hungarians and become a modern, developed force. Due to WW1 ending with a Central Powers victory and fascism being contained to Italy and the Third French Republic in this timeline and communism being wiped out, national liberation movements never occur in Africa. The Central Powers and their satellite states surviving post-WW1 means that democracy is ironically more secure than OTL. The Brittanians use trickery and deceit to seize the former Confederate States of South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina and integrate them [South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina] into British North America during a time of political chaos and instability in the USA, along with [the Brittanians] taking New England. This forces the Germans to make Texas into the Kingdom of Texas ruled by a side branch of the Hohenzollerns and the Japanese to seize the American West Coast, which [the American West Coast] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the Pacific States of America. The Japanese also seize Hawaii and [the Japanese] restore the Hawaiian House of Kawānanakoa-ruled semi-constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii in Hawaii. The influence of the Manchuria based division of the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground warfare division, the Imperial Japanese Army protecting the South Manchuria railway in Manchuria from Han Chinese bandits, the Kwangtung Army along with the IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] in Manchuria means that the Japanese are [the Japanese] able [the Japanese] to [the Japanese] push out Zhuolin and the Fengtian Clique in Manchuria while [the Japanese] increasing the influence of the Qing Imperial Court and the indigenous Manchu nobility, aristocracy and royalty in Manchuria, [the Japanese decreasing the influence of the Fengtian Clique and increasing the influence of the Qing imperial court within post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] leading to it [post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] becoming the pre-WW2 and WW2-era, post-1932, pre-1945 Imperial Japanese protectorate of the Qing imperial family, the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled and monarchist, Manchurian nationalist, anti-communist, Pan Asian political party Concordia Association-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional imperial royal parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s, with the Great Qing Empire's last Emperor, Aisin-Gioro \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, [Pu-Yi] becoming [what Pu-Yi becomes after the formation of Manchukuo] the first Emperor [Pu-Yi after Manchukuo's formation] of Manchukuo like in OTL. After Pu-Yi's death in [when Pu-Yi dies in this timeline] around 1970, his [Pu-Yi's] younger half brother Aisin-Gioro Puren becomes [Puren in this timeline] the Emperor of Manchukuo, [Puren in this timeline] followed by his [Puren's] son, Aisin-Gioro Yuzhang after his [Yuzhang's] death in [when Puren died] 2015, who [Yuzhang] intends [Yuzhang] to [Yuzhang] make his [Yuzhang's] daughter, Jin Xin Empress of Manchukuo upon his [Yuzhang's] death. The Cantonese statesman, diplomat and calligrapher Zheng Xiaoxu is the first Prime Minister of Manchukuo like in OTL, followed by the Manchurian general, warlord and politician Zhang Jinghui like in OTL, followed by Hu Qili, then Jiang Zemin. The armed Wing and thus the combined armed forces of the Fengtian Clique formed from Zhuolin's bandit forces and what remained of the Manchu Bannermen and the Qing New Army in Manchuria after the Xinhai Revolution, the National Pacification Army, [the National Pacification Army] becomes a modern, well equipped military force under the watchful eye of the Kwangtung Army with help from the Imperial German Army and Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces. The National Pacification Army eventually becomes Manchukuo’s combined armed forces, the Manchukuo Imperial Army after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria becomes Manchukuo with Fengtian Clique and pro-China unification elements within the NPA being discredited, given extended sentences of leave to Nationalist China or the restored Ming dynasty, or otherwise removed in various ways. Police units in Manchuria nominally operating under the Beiyang Government's control but in reality under the Fengtian Clique's control also become the main law enforcement agency of Manchukuo, managing the central police department responsible for all police in Manchuria after Manchuko’s formation, with a Maritime Police to combat smuggling along with cracking down on smuggling and maintain maritime security within Manchurian waters, first under the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security and then under the General Directorate of Security Affairs, the Manchukuo Police after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria.

Their surroundings were nothing short of surreal, an extended plain white void, courtesy of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber Capsule Corp had so graciously restored. Achika, his wife, heavy with their next child, Kunō, watched on with a mix of amusement and pride, a subtle hint of nervousness betraying her otherwise calm facade. Irisviel, holding the one-year-old twins Chloe and Illya, couldn't hide her curiosity, her eyes sparkling with an excitement mirrored by the children in her arms. \\"Why do I have to learn all this kung-fu stuff now, Dad?\\" Issei's voice pierced the heavy silence, his stance relaxing as he turned a questioning gaze up to his father. \\"I mean, I'm pretty smart already, aren't I? Why do I need to be strong too?\\" Gorou smiled, a gentle, understanding curve to his lips. \\"Brains are important, Issei, no doubt about that. But sometimes, brains alone aren't enough. There are times when strength, both of heart and body, makes all the difference in the world.\\" He knelt, bringing himself to Issei's level, his eyes serious yet soft. \\"Remember the stories of how Japan had to stand firm against enemies, how sometimes, only the willingness to fight protected its people and honor?\\" Issei nodded slowly, his forehead creasing in thought as he recalled tales from both history and bedtime stories alike. \\"Like when those big bad guys tried to take over the whole world, and Japan had to help stop them?\\" \\"Exactly.\\" Gorou stood, ruffling Issei's hair affectionately. \\"And that's why we train. Not to seek out fights, but so we're always ready to protect what's important to us.\\" Achika's voice chimed in, a note of steel beneath her warmth. \\"And so you can protect those you care about, Issei. Sometimes, the world isn't kind, and you'll find challenges that require more than just a keen mind.\\" Issei squared his small shoulders, a newfound determination lighting his amber eyes – the same eyes that had seen the underside of genius and the shadow of potential greatness. \\"Okay, Dad. I'll learn. For Mom, for you, for Kunō, and…\\" He glanced towards his stepmother and stepsisters. \\"For everyone.\\" Gorou offered a nod of approval before slipping into a stance, signaling the beginning of their session. \\"Good. Let's start with the basics then. We'll build you up, step by step.\\" As father and son engaged in a carefully choreographed dance of martial prowess and learning, Irisviel and Achika shared a glance, a silent understanding passing between them. They were raising a future leader, someone who could perhaps bridge worlds and mend fractures with both intellect and strength. The possibility of what Issei might become, what paths he might walk, filled the chamber with a sense of promise, a whisper of the future's potential. And somewhere, amidst the lessons of punches and kicks, beneath the watchful eyes of his family and the protective embrace of history's weight, Issei took his first steps towards a destiny that was uniquely his own – a symphony of brains, brawn, and the unyielding spirit of a warrior."},{"prompt":"(On the outskirts of Mondstadt City...)

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how car alarms bleat loudly and persistently that are triggered by a mere touch but go unanswered due to the driver being unaware that the alarm has signaled. Moreover, the car driver is probably not even in the vicinity of halt the alarm due to him being in a store if parked in a retail location, doing his job elsewhere while at work or asleep at night with the car alarm wailing and disturbing all that can hear it.","completion":"In the labyrinth of urban cacophony, car alarms stand out as a particularly notorious contributor to noise pollution. Often set off by the slightest prompt—a mere brush against the vehicle by a passerby, a strong gust of wind, or the innocuous bounce of a basketball nearby—these alarms erupt into a fervent symphony of loud, persistent bleats. Designed to alert the owner of a potential security breach, these sonic sentinels instead often perform to an empty audience. The scenario unfolds typically across different daily activities and locations, casting a wide net of disturbance yet failing in their primary function of security alertness. Firstly, consider the setting of a bustling retail location. Large parking areas sprawl adjacent to shopping centers, where drivers park their vehicles to venture inside for groceries, clothing, or other needs. The alarms, triggered in the absence of the car's owner, transform from a protective device into an instrument of public nuisance. Despite their loud and repetitive noise designed to catch the attention of the car owner, these alarms often go unanswered. The reason is straightforward: the vehicle's owner, deeply engrossed in the act of shopping, remains blissfully unaware of the chaos unfurling outside. The distance between the owner and the vehicle, coupled with the insulating walls of the retail buildings, ensures that the alarm's bleating fails to reach its intended recipient's ears. Instead, it becomes a relentless auditory torment for anyone within its vicinity. The situation does not markedly improve in workplace scenarios. Cars parked in large office complexes face a similar fate. Here, the owner might be stationed at their desk, engrossed in meetings or concentrated on their computer screens, miles away from the parking spot where their car sits unguarded—except for the alarm, that is. Once triggered, the alarm's penetrating soundwaves ripple across the parking area, often setting off a domino effect where one car alarm triggers another, creating a choir of dissonance. Yet again, the sound fails to reach or alert the car's owner, leaving bystanders or fellow workers to endure the auditory assault. The owner's physical and mental preoccupation with their job ensures the car alarm's message is lost, dissipating into the air unheeded. The nighttime scenario presents perhaps the most ironic twist in the tale of car alarms. Vehicles parked in residential areas, near the owners' homes, or even in their driveways, are not immune to false triggers. A nocturnal setting amplifies the disturbance caused by a car alarm. As the surrounding environment quiets down for the night, the abrupt blaring of a car alarm slices through the silence with an almost malevolent force. The irony lies in the fact that while this might be when the alarm's alert is most crucial (given the cover of darkness is often preferred by thieves), it is also when it is most likely to go unanswered. The vehicle's owner, presumably asleep, remains oblivious to the outside disturbance. The alarm then, instead of serving as a protector, transforms into a nocturnal nemesis, disturbing the sleep and peace of the entire neighborhood. The relentless wail of the alarm through the still night air serves as a stark reminder of the device's inefficacy in situations where direct intervention by the car owner is required. Across these varied scenarios—be it in a bustling retail location, at a workplace during the day, or in the quiet of residential areas at night—the result remains consistent: car alarms, despite their loud and persistent signaling, often go unanswered. This systematic failure stems not from a lack of intention on the part of the alarm's design but from the practical dislocation of the owner from the vehicle. The alarms, in their zealous effort to alert, end up creating an atmosphere of noise pollution, inadvertently becoming a source of public irritation rather than security. This paradox highlights a fundamental flaw in relying solely on acoustic alerts in environments where the intended recipient is beyond reach. In essence, while car alarms continue to bleat their warnings into the void, they leave behind a trail of disturbed peace and questioning over their practicality in urban landscapes."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how the manga and anime series Naruto is different in kind and lore from Disney animated cartoons that kids have grown up with such that Naruto is seen as more exciting and approachable to many pre-adolescents through its use of narrative and characterization that is lacking in many Disney movies and tv series.","completion":"In the pantheon of animated narratives that have captivated the imaginations of pre-adolescents, the manga and anime series \\"Naruto\\" by Masashi Kishimoto stands as a monument to narrative depth, character development, and cultural impact, distinguishing itself starkly from the archetypal Disney animated cartoons. The differentiation rests not merely in the superficial elements of storytelling but in the foundational frameworks of lore, narrative structure, and the portrayal of complex, evolving characters which resonate with the audience on a profound level. These features collectively forge \\"Naruto\\" into an experience that is both thrillingly exciting and intimately approachable for its audience, in ways that many Disney creations struggle to match. At the heart of \\"Naruto's\\" appeal is its rich, elaborate lore that weaves together the fantastical elements of ninja arts with deep-seated human themes such as perseverance, loneliness, and the quest for acceptance. This universe is populated with villages that have their unique cultures, histories, and political intrigue, significantly more nuanced than the relatively straightforward settings found in Disney animations. For instance, the intricately detailed Hidden Leaf Village, with its own governance, traditions, and rivalries, offers a more layered and immersive world than the often one-dimensional kingdoms of Disney. This complexity of setting allows for a narrative that can explore socio-political issues, moral ambiguities, and the consequences of war, providing a fertile ground for storytelling that engages audiences in thoughtful reflection. Narrative structure in \\"Naruto\\" is another domain where it diverges sharply from Disney's formula. Unlike the linear, often predictable plotlines of Disney movies that wrap up neatly within a couple of hours, \\"Naruto\\" unfolds over hundreds of episodes, allowing for an expansive, multi-threaded saga that spans generations. This long-format storytelling facilitates deep character arcs and gradual world-building, enabling viewers to form lasting emotional attachments to the characters and the narrative universe. \\"Naruto's\\" plot is rife with twists, betrayals, and epic battles, yet it also dedicates considerable time to exploring the backstories of even minor characters, enriching the tapestry of its world. This complexity and depth are seldom found in Disney's offerings, where character development often takes a backseat to the narrative's moral lesson. Characterization in \\"Naruto\\" is, perhaps, its most marked departure from Disney standards. Characters in \\"Naruto\\" are multifaceted and undergo significant development, grappling with internal conflicts, moral dilemmas, and the harsh realities of their world. Naruto Uzumaki himself evolves from a lonely outcast to a hero of his village, struggling with the demon sealed within him while seeking acceptance and understanding. This portrayal of growth and vulnerability offers a stark contrast to the oftentimes static Disney protagonists, whose personalities and circumstances change little over the course of their stories. Furthermore, \\"Naruto\\" does not shy away from depicting the darker aspects of its characters’ journeys, including loss, failure, and redemption, themes that are frequently sanitized in Disney narratives for younger audiences. \\"Nararuto's\\" embrace of complex themes such as sacrifice, resilience in the face of adversity, and the value of hard work and friendship speaks to pre-adolescents in a language they are beginning to understand intimately. This realness, combined with the fantastical elements of ninja abilities and the allure of mastering one's skills, creates a compelling narrative that is as inspiring as it is entertaining. Disney, while successful in its own right, often resorts to clear-cut distinctions between good and evil, and simplistic resolutions that, though satisfying, fail to challenge young viewers in meaningful ways. In conclusion, \\"Naruto\\" distinguishes itself from Disney animated cartoons through its richly layered lore, sophisticated narrative structure, and deeply drawn characters that grow and evolve in complexity. These elements synergize to craft a narrative experience that is not only more exhilarating but also more personally resonant with pre-adolescents, offering them a nuanced view of the world through the lens of an epic saga. Through \\"Naruto,\\" viewers are not just entertained but are also invited to reflect on the nature of friendship, the costs of war, and the endless quest for personal growth and acceptance, themes that are woven into the very fabric of its storytelling."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly to vividly demonstrate how in comparing two long running tv series Naruto provides greater depth of character, background, plot advancement and theme than the Disney tv cartoon The Little Mermaid which was a prequel to the animated movie The Little Mermaid.","completion":"Expanding upon the analysis that juxtaposes the narrative and thematic depth of \\"Naruto\\" with Disney's animated offerings, a focused comparison with Disney’s TV cartoon \\"The Little Mermaid\\" serves to further illuminate the stark contrast in storytelling complexity and character development between the two. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" TV series, functioning as a prequel to the iconic Disney movie, ventures to explore the undersea world of Ariel before her encounter with Prince Eric. Despite the series' attempts to delve into new adventures and character insights, it pales in comparison to the nuanced and richly layered narrative presented in \\"Naruto,\\" especially in terms of character depth, background exposition, plot advancement, and thematic exploration. Character depth in \\"Naruto\\" is a composite of personal struggles, emotional growth, and a continuum of development that resonates deeply with audiences. Characters in \\"Naruto\\" are painted with broad strokes of grey, embodying both virtues and flaws that render them profoundly human, despite the fantastical setting. Naruto himself is an emblem of perseverance against societal rejection, his journey intricately tied to themes of loneliness, perseverance, and the pursuit of recognition. In contrast, Ariel’s character in \\"The Little Mermaid\\" TV series exhibits a more one-dimensional pursuit of adventure and discovery, lacking significant personal growth or deep internal conflict. The prequel format restricts her character from evolving beyond the curious and rebellious teenager, as her destiny is already predetermined by the movie's narrative. The complexity of Naruto's character, marred by his internal demons and external societal challenges, offers a more profound and engaging character study than Ariel's relatively superficial struggles and triumphs. The background and lore in \\"Naruto\\" are meticulously crafted, with each village, clan, and character being a piece of a larger, intricate puzzle. The series does not merely create a setting for its characters but builds an entire world teeming with history, politics, and culture that significantly impact the plot and character motivations. For example, the historical animosity between the villages of Konoha and Suna is not just a backdrop but a vital storyline that drives character interactions and plot developments. On the other hand, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, while offering glimpses into Ariel's world before the events of the film, does not venture far into the cultural or political intricacies of the undersea kingdom. The setting serves more as a backdrop for episodic adventures rather than a fully realized world that shapes and is shaped by its inhabitants. Plot advancement in \\"Naruto\\" is both expansive and intricate, weaving together individual character arcs with overarching narrative threads. The series masterfully balances episodic encounters with long-term story arcs, ensuring that each episode contributes to character development or plot progression. This narrative structure allows for a deep exploration of themes such as the cyclical nature of hatred, the pain of loss, and the power of empathy. Conversely, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, constrained by its prequel status and episodic format, often resorts to formulaic plots that offer limited advancement of the overarching narrative or deep thematic exploration. The episodes, while entertaining, largely lack the consequential weight found in \\"Naruto's\\" storytelling, where actions have lasting impacts on the characters and their world. Thematically, \\"Naruto\\" ventures into territory that is seldom explored with such depth in children’s animation. It does not shy away from exploring the effects of war, the complexity of human emotions, and the moral ambiguities of its characters’ actions. These themes are interwoven with the narrative, offering viewers—a number of whom are pre-adolescents—a nuanced understanding of the world. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, in striving to maintain a light-hearted tone suitable for a young audience, steers clear of deep thematic engagement, opting instead for surface-level morals and lessons. In summation, comparing \\"Naruto\\" with Disney's \\"The Little Mermaid\\" TV series underscores the former's superior depth in character development, background exposition, plot advancement, and thematic richness. \\"Naruto\\" presents a tapestry of human experience set against a fantastical backdrop, offering viewers intricate character studies and a world teeming with lore and history. Meanwhile, \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" while a cherished part of Disney's animated pantheon, offers a narrative experience that is less complex, opting for episodic adventure over dynamic character growth or deep thematic exploration. Through this comparison, the superiority of \\"Naruto's\\" narrative structure and thematic ambition becomes unequivocally clear, providing a compelling canvas that engages audiences on multiple levels."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly to vividly explain how even if The Little Mermaid tv series wasn't constrained by the cartoon being a prequel to the movie, it still doesn't have the same impact in terms of literary significance as compared with the tv series Naruto.","completion":"Expanding the analysis of \\"Naruto\\" versus Disney’s \\"The Little Mermaid\\" TV series, even if we momentarily disregard the constraint of the latter being a prequel to the movie, it still falls significantly short of achieving the same level of literary significance and impact as \\"Naruto.\\" This disparity manifests across multiple dimensions of narrative construction, character complexity, thematic exploration, and cultural resonance, underscoring the profound depth and sophistication embedded within \\"Naruto's\\" storytelling fabric as compared to the relatively simplistic and less impactful narrative offered by \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series. Firstly, the structural complexity and narrative ambition of \\"Naruto\\" far surpass what is attempted in \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series. \\"Naruto\\" employs a sophisticated narrative architecture that interlaces multiple character arcs and intricate plot lines across a vast temporal landscape. It explores themes of legacy, destiny, and the consequences of past actions on present and future generations, lending a literary weight and gravitas to its storytelling. Each character in \\"Naruto\\" is vested with backstories that delve into themes of loss, redemption, and the quest for identity, making their journeys emblematic of universal human experiences. \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" even liberated from its prequel constraints, tends toward episodic storytelling that, while engaging, rarely builds towards a cumulative narrative payoff or delves deeply into character backstories in a meaningful way. Secondly, character evolution in \\"Naruto\\" is markedly more nuanced and dynamic. Characters undergo significant transformations, shaped by their experiences, failures, and successes. This dynamic character development facilitates a deeper exploration of themes like resilience, morality, and personal growth. For instance, Sasuke’s journey from a revenge-driven loner to a person who comprehends the value of friendship and community encapsulates a complex narrative arc of redemption and self-discovery. In contrast, characters in \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, including Ariel, though beloved and charismatic, exhibit relatively static character development, their personalities and virtues largely unchanged by the events of the series. This lack of significant character growth limits the series' ability to engage with more profound or challenging themes in a manner that impacts the audience on a deeper level. The thematic richness and literary significance of \\"Naruto\\" are further augmented by its engagement with socio-political themes. The series delves into the intricacies of governance, the impact of war, the cyclical nature of hatred, and the possibility of societal reform and peace. These themes are not only explored through the narratives of the central characters but are also embedded within the very fabric of the series' world-building, from the structure of the ninja villages to the system of the Shinobi World. This results in a rich tapestry of interconnected stories that reflect on real-world issues, extending beyond the confines of its genre and appealing to a broader audience. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, by its design, focuses predominantly on adventure and exploration, themes that, while entertaining, offer limited scope for profound literary or thematic exploration. Lastly, the cultural impact and resonance of \\"Naruto\\" underscore its wider significance beyond entertainment. \\"Naruto\\" has not only garnered a massive global following but has also influenced pop culture, inspired discussions on its themes, and been the subject of academic inquiry. Its ability to resonate on multiple levels—emotional, intellectual, and philosophical—speaks to its literary importance. The reception of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, while positive, does not approach the same level of cultural or philosophical discourse, reflecting a less impactful narrative reach. In conclusion, even when considering \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series outside the constraints of its prequel status, it fails to match the literary depth, thematic sophistication, and cultural resonance achieved by \\"Naruto.\\" The disparity in narrative ambition, character complexity, thematic depth, and cultural impact between the two series illustrates the profound gap in their respective literary significances. \\"Naruto's\\" richly woven narrative, complex characters, and engagement with weighty themes render it a standout work of animated storytelling, resonating deeply with audiences and achieving a level of literary importance that \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, despite its charms, cannot match."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Looking around, she realized she was on the outskirts of Mondstadt City, not too far from the bustling streets and shops she was familiar with. But why was she here? The last thing she remembered was walking home from the library after a long study session. Feeling a sense of confusion and disorientation, Natsuki stood up and dusted herself off. She scanned the area for any familiar landmarks, hoping to figure out how she ended up in this unfamiliar place. Before she could make sense of it all, a gentle breeze carried the scent of blooming flowers and the distant sound of music playing in the city. Natsuki took a deep breath, letting the peaceful ambiance calm her racing thoughts. As she started to walk back towards Mondstadt City, Natsuki couldn't shake the feeling that something strange had happened to her. But for now, she decided to focus on finding her way home and figuring out the mystery later."},{"prompt":"Thread Title: Squish Cartoon Coming to Kids WB! Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic!

Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime.

Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I’d list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV’s case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world’s first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these “peaceful” Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support!

Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging. Rest assured, “Gloopy and Glitter” and our new extraterrestrial addition are just the beginning of more exciting things to come. Stay tuned and keep watching — adventure is always around the corner!

Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for. But here’s a thought – what if 4Kids is plotting an Alien Hour for the summer? Imagine back-to-back alien adventures, capped off with “The Gees” in between as a quirky interlude. That’d be something! DigitalToonFan: An Alien Hour would be epic! “Four Eyes!”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, plus “The Gees” shorts? Sounds like a perfect blend of cosmic chaos and laughter. It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer. Plus, it’d give “Four Eyes!” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a fantastic platform to shine even brighter. Fingers crossed 4Kids goes for it!

Plus, those shorts like “The Owl” are perfect palate cleansers between heavier shows. ToonTalker91: “Vampire Hunters” could be the wildcard of the bunch, considering its origin.

However, the timing and nature of resuscitation will depend on the type of shock and the timing and severity of the insult. Rapid clinical examination will provide adequate clues to make an appropriate first determination, even if a source of bleeding or sepsis is not immediately identifiable. If there is initial doubt about the cause of shock, it is safer to assume the cause is hypovolaemia and begin with fluid resuscitation, and then assess the response. In patients who are actively bleeding (major trauma, aortic aneurysm rupture, gastrointestinal haemorrhage), it is counterproductive to institute high-volume fluid therapy without controlling the site of haemorrhage. Increasing blood pressure merely increases bleeding from the site while fluid therapy cools the patient and dilutes available coagulation factors. Thus operative haemorrhage control should not be delayed and resuscitation should proceed in parallel with surgery. Conversely, a patient with bowel obstruction and hypovolaemic shock must be adequately resuscitated before undergoing surgery otherwise the additional surgical injury and hypovolaemia induced during the procedure will exacerbate the inflammatory activation and increase the incidence and severity of end-organ insult.... arrange without this OR **","completion":"Resuscitation in cases of shock is a critical and urgent intervention that must be tailored to the underlying cause of the shock, the severity of the condition, and the specific circumstances facing the patient. It is essential not to delay resuscitation in an attempt to definitively diagnose the source of the shock, as rapid clinical examination often provides sufficient information to initiate appropriate first-line treatments. In scenarios where the exact cause of shock is not immediately apparent, a prudent initial approach is to assume the cause is hypovolemia and start fluid resuscitation while continuing to assess the patient's response and further investigate the underlying cause. In situations where a patient is experiencing active bleeding, such as in cases of major trauma, rupture of an aortic aneurysm, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage, it is critical to recognize that merely administering high volumes of fluid without addressing the source of the hemorrhage can be counterproductive. Raising blood pressure without controlling the bleeding site can exacerbate blood loss, while aggressive fluid therapy can lead to hypothermia and dilution of coagulation factors, further complicating the patient's condition. In these circumstances, operative control of the hemorrhage should be pursued without delay, and resuscitation efforts should be conducted in parallel with surgical interventions to ensure the best possible outcomes. Conversely, in patients suffering from conditions like bowel obstruction leading to hypovolemic shock, it is paramount to ensure that the patient is adequately resuscitated before proceeding with surgical intervention. Undertaking surgery without first correcting hypovolemia can worsen the patient's inflammatory response, potentially leading to an increase in the incidence and severity of end-organ damage. Proper pre-operative resuscitation, therefore, serves to mitigate additional surgical stress and hypovolemia, reducing the risk of exacerbating the patient's condition. Ultimately, the timing and nature of resuscitation efforts are dependent on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition, underlying cause of shock, and the urgency of intervening to prevent further deterioration. It requires a delicate balance between immediate intervention to stabilize the patient and specific measures to address the underlying cause of the shock, with a constant focus on the goal of preserving organ function and improving patient outcomes."},{"prompt":"arrange in points","completion":"When managing a patient in shock, the approach to resuscitation should be guided by the following key points: 1. **Rapid Clinical Assessment**: - Do not delay resuscitation to definitively diagnose the shock source. - A quick clinical examination often provides sufficient information to initiate treatment. 2. **Initial Management Strategy**: - If the cause of shock is uncertain, start with the assumption of hypovolemia and begin fluid resuscitation. - Continuously assess the patient’s response to initial resuscitation efforts. 3. **Management of Active Bleeding**: - Avoid high-volume fluid rescue in patients with active bleeding (due to major trauma, aortic aneurysm rupture, gastrointestinal hemorrhage) without controlling the hemorrhage source. - Understand that increasing blood pressure without controlling the bleed can worsen blood loss. - Fluid therapy in these scenarios can lead to hypothermia and dilution of coagulation factors. - Surgical control of hemorrhage should be pursued promptly, with resuscitation efforts occurring concurrently. 4. **Patients with Bowel Obstruction and Hypovolemic Shock**: - Ensure adequate resuscitation before surgical intervention to correct hypovolemia. - Proceeding with surgery without addressing hypovolemia can exacerbate the inflammatory response and increase the risk of end-organ damage. 5. **Balancing Resuscitation and Treatment**: - The approach to resuscitation must be balanced between stabilizing the patient and addressing the underlying cause of the shock. - Continuous evaluation and adjustment of the resuscitation strategy are necessary based on the patient's response and evolving clinical picture. By adhering to these points, healthcare providers can effectively manage shock, aiming to stabilize the patient, prevent further deterioration, and address the underlying cause to improve outcomes."},{"prompt":"Fluid therapy In all cases of shock, regardless of classification, hypovolaemia and inadequate preload must be addressed before other therapy is instituted. Administration of inotropic or chronotropic agents to an empty heart will rapidly and permanently deplete the myocardium of oxygen stores and dramatically reduce diastolic filling and therefore coronary perfusion. Patients will enter the unresuscitatable stage of shock as the myocardium becomes progressively more ischaemic and unresponsive to resuscitative attempts. First-line therapy, therefore, is intravenous access and administration of intravenous fluids. Access should be through short, wide-bore catheters that allow rapid infusion of fluids as necessary. Long, narrow lines, such as central venous catheters, have too high a resistance to allow rapid infusion and are more appropriate for monitoring than fluid replacement therapy....do the same arrangement","completion":"When addressing shock in patients, regardless of its classification, the management of hypovolemia and ensuring adequate preload are critical steps before considering other therapeutic interventions. To streamline the approach to fluid therapy in shock, the following key points should be emphasized: 1. **Recognition of Hypovolemia**: - In all shock cases, identify and address hypovolemia as a priority, as it underlies inadequate preload conditions. 2. **Cautions Against Premature Use of Inotropic or Chronotropic Agents**: - Avoid administering inotropic or chronotropic agents to patients with uncorrected hypovolemia. Doing so can deplete myocardial oxygen stores and harmfully reduce diastolic filling and coronary perfusion. 3. **Consequences of Inadequate Preload Management**: - Failing to address hypovolemia can lead to diminished coronary perfusion, escalating myocardial ischemia, and impair the heart's responsiveness to resuscitation, potentially leading to an unresuscitable state of shock. 4. **Establishment of Intravenous Access**: - Secure intravenous access as the primary step in therapy. Use short, wide-bore catheters for fluid administration, which facilitates the rapid infusion of fluids. 5. **Selection of Catheters for Fluid Therapy**: - Prefer short, wide-bore catheters for their efficiency in rapidly delivering fluids. Long, narrow lines, such as central venous catheters, are not suitable for fast fluid replacement due to their high resistance but can be utilized for monitoring purposes. By following these key points, healthcare providers can more effectively manage patients in shock, ensuring immediate and adequate preload correction through appropriate fluid therapy, thus preventing progression to states of shock that are difficult or impossible to resuscitate."},{"prompt":"Type of fluids There is continuing debate over which resuscitation fluid is best for the management of shock. There is no ideal resuscitation fluid, and it is more important to understand how and when to administer it. In most studies of shock resuscitation there is no overt difference in response or outcome between crystalloid solutions (normal saline, Hartmann’s solution, Ringer’s lactate) or colloids (albumin or commercially available products). Furthermore, there is less volume benefit to the administration of colloids than had previously been thought, with only 1.3 times more crystalloid than colloid administered in blinded trials. On balance, there is little evidence to support the administration of colloids, which are more expensive and have worse side-effect profiles. Most importantly, the oxygen carrying capacity of crystalloids and colloids is zero. If blood is being lost, the ideal replacement fluid is blood, although crystalloid therapy may be required while awaiting blood products. Hypotonic solutions (dextrose etc.) are poor volume expanders and should not be used in the treatment of shock unless the deficit is free water loss (eg. diabetes insipidus) or patients are sodium overloaded (eg. cirrhosis).","completion":"The selection of resuscitation fluids in the management of shock is subject to ongoing debate among healthcare professionals. Despite the lack of consensus on an \\"ideal\\" resuscitation fluid, it's crucial to focus on understanding the appropriate application and timing of fluid administration. The discussion can be structured around several key points: 1. **Lack of a Clearly Superior Resuscitation Fluid**: - Research and clinical experience indicate no definitive difference in response or outcome between using crystalloid solutions (such as normal saline, Hartmann's solution, Ringer's lactate) and colloids (such as albumin or commercially available products). 2. **Comparative Volume Benefits of Colloids and Crystalloids**: - Colloids are not as advantageous in terms of volume efficiency as once believed; studies show only a marginal difference, requiring 1.3 times more crystalloid than colloid to achieve similar volume expansion in blinded trials. 3. **Cost and Side-Effects Considerations**: - Colloids are generally more expensive and associated with a worse side-effect profile, which diminishes their appeal relative to crystalloids. 4. **Oxygen Carrying Capacity**: - It's crucial to remember that both crystalloids and colloids possess zero oxygen-carrying capacity. Therefore, in cases of significant blood loss, the most appropriate replacement fluid is blood itself. Crystalloid therapy may temporarily support the patient while blood products are being prepared. 5. **Selecting Fluids Based on Specific Conditions**: - Hypotonic solutions, like those containing dextrose, are not suitable for volume expansion in shock treatment, except in situations involving free water loss (e.g., due to diabetes insipidus) or where patients are sodium overloaded (e.g., in cirrhosis). Understanding these key points can guide healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding fluid therapy in shock management, emphasizing the practicality and suitability of crystalloids in most situations and reserving the use of blood products for cases where blood loss is a contributing factor to the patient's condition."},{"prompt":"Dynamic fluid response The shock status can be determined dynamically by the cardiovascular response to the rapid administration of a fluid bolus. In total, 250–500 mL of fluid is rapidly given (over 5–10 minutes) and the cardiovascular responses in terms of heart rate, blood pressure and central venous pressure are observed. Patients can be divided into ‘responders’, ‘transient responders’ and ‘non-responders’. Responders have an improvement in their cardiovascular status that is sustained. These patients are not actively losing fluid but require filling to a normal volume status. Transient responders have an improvement, but this then reverts to the previous state over the next 10–20 minutes. These patients have moderate ongoing fluid losses (either overt ­haemorrhage or further fluid shifts reducing intravascular ­volume). Non-responders are severely volume depleted and are likely to have major ongoing loss of intravascular volume, usually through persistent uncontrolled haemorrhage.","completion":"Dynamic fluid response is a crucial assessment method in the management of shock, aiming to categorize patients based on their cardiovascular reaction to a fast-administered fluid bolus. This approach provides invaluable insights into the patient's volume status and needs, guiding further resuscitation efforts. The process and categorization can be summarized in the following points: 1. **Administration of a Fluid Bolus**: - A rapid infusion of 250–500 mL of fluid is given over a period of 5–10 minutes. This quick infusion is designed to assess the patient's cardiovascular system's capacity to respond to volume expansion. 2. **Observation of Cardiovascular Responses**: - After administering the fluid bolus, key cardiovascular parameters are observed, including heart rate, blood pressure, and central venous pressure. These metrics provide immediate feedback on the efficacy of the volume expansion. 3. **Categorization Based on Response**: - **Responders**: These are patients who show a sustained improvement in cardiovascular status following the fluid bolus. They benefit from the volume expansion as it brings their volume status closer to normal. These patients are generally not experiencing active fluid loss but were in need of volume filling. - **Transient Responders**: Patients in this group initially show improvement in cardiovascular parameters, but these gains revert to their previous, compromised state within 10–20 minutes. Such patients typically have moderate ongoing fluid losses, either from overt hemorrhage or other processes that reduce intravascular volume. - **Non-responders**: These patients do not show significant improvement in cardiovascular status post-fluid bolus administration. They are likely suffering from severe volume depletion, often due to major, ongoing losses of intravascular volume, usually from persistent, uncontrolled hemorrhage. Understanding these response categories is essential for tailoring fluid resuscitation and ongoing management strategies to the individual needs of patients in shock. It enables healthcare providers to make informed decisions regarding further fluid administration, the need for blood products, or other interventions required to manage the underlying cause of shock and stabilize the patient."},{"prompt":"Vasopressor and inotropic support Vasopressor or inotropic therapy is not indicated as first-line therapy in hypovolaemia. As discussed above, administration of these agents in the absence of adequate preload rapidly leads to decreased coronary perfusion and depletion of myocardial oxygen reserves. Vasopressor agents (phenylephrine, noradrenaline) are indicated in distributive shock states (sepsis, neurogenic shock) where there is peripheral vasodilatation, and a low systemic vascular resistance, leading to hypotension despite a high cardiac output. Where the vasodilatation is resistant to catecholamines (e.g. absolute or relative steroid deficiency) vasopressin may be used as an alternative vasopressor. In cardiogenic shock, or where myocardial depression has complicated a shock state (e.g. severe septic shock with low cardiac output), inotropic therapy may be required to increase cardiac output and therefore oxygen delivery. The inodilator dobutamine is the agent of choice. Monitoring The minimum standard for monitoring of the patient in shock is continuous heart rate and oxygen saturation monitoring, frequent non -invasive blood pressure monitoring and hourly urine output measurements. Most patients will need more aggressive invasive monitoring, including central venous pressure and invasive blood pressure monitoring.","completion":"Vasopressor and inotropic support play pivotal roles in managing shock, particularly when fluid resuscitation alone does not suffice to stabilize the patient. Their use, however, must be judicious and based on the specific type of shock the patient is experiencing. Here’s a more organized look at when and how these agents are best utilized: # Vasopressor and Inotropic Support 1. **Not First-line for Hypovolemia**: - In the context of hypovolemia, these therapies are not the first line of treatment. Adequate preload must be established to avoid decreased coronary perfusion and depletion of myocardial oxygen stores. 2. **Indications for Vasopressor Agents**: - Vasopressor agents, such as phenylephrine and noradrenaline, are specifically indicated in distributive shock states like sepsis and neurogenic shock. These conditions feature peripheral vasodilation and low systemic vascular resistance, which lead to hypotension despite high cardiac output. - Vasopressin can be utilized as an alternative in cases where vasodilation is resistant to catecholamines, indicating potential absolute or relative steroid deficiency. 3. **Use in Cardiogenic Shock**: - In cases of cardiogenic shock or myocardial depression complicating a shock state (such as severe septic shock with low cardiac output), inotropic therapy is warranted. This therapy aims to increase cardiac output and, consequently, oxygen delivery to tissues. - Dobutamine, an inodilator, is often the preferred agent due to its ability to increase cardiac output without significantly increasing myocardial oxygen demand. # Monitoring in Shock 1. **Minimum Standard Monitoring**: - Continuous monitoring of heart rate and oxygen saturation, alongside frequent non-invasive blood pressure checks and hourly assessments of urine output, represent the minimum standard for patient monitoring in shock. 2. **Need for More Aggressive Monitoring**: - Many patients will require more extensive, invasive monitoring. This includes measuring central venous pressure and invasive blood pressure monitoring to provide a more detailed and accurate assessment of the patient’s hemodynamic status. By adhering to these guidelines, healthcare providers can ensure that vasopressor and inotropic therapies are applied effectively and safely, enhancing outcomes for patients in shock. The emphasis on tailored therapy based on the underlying cause of shock and meticulous monitoring underscores the complexity of shock management and the need for a nuanced approach to treatment."},{"prompt":"(On the outskirts of Mondstadt City...)

Кавалерия и мечники добавляют мобильности и гибкости в открытом сражении. Использование магических и воздушных сил, как ангелов и грифонов, можно считать решающим фактором, обеспечивая преимущество в разведке и ударах с воздуха, а также эффективную поддержку наземных сил. **Тактика Армии 1** может заключаться в удержании линии фронта с помощью пехоты, в то время как арбалетчики обеспечивают давление на дистанции. Грифоны и ангелы могут проводить быстрые удары по ключевым целям, в том числе дистанционно-атакующие или поддерживающие силы врага, а монахи и фанатики могут оказывать магическую поддержку, лечение и защиту. **Армия 2** также очень разнообразна, ориентированная более на прямую силу и количество. Основу составляют гоблины и хобгоблины, поддерживаемые более мощными орками и ограми. Наездники на волках добавляют мобильности, а воздушные силы в лице птиц рух дополняют возможности тактического маневрирования. Особенную угрозу представляют циклопы и древние чудища, способные причинить значительный урон. **Тактика Армии 2** может заключаться в искусстве перегрузки флангов противника своими мобильными и численно преобладающими силами, в то время как мощные и редкие юниты, такие как циклопы и древние чудища, могут прорывать оборону и создавать хаос в рядах противника. Воздушная поддержка от птиц рух может быть использована для нейтрализации или отвлечения вражеских арбалетчиков и грифонов. **Выводы и шансы на победу:** Принимая во внимание композицию и возможности обеих армий, Армия 1 представляется более сбалансированной и гибкой в плане тактического разнообразия. Важное преимущество состоит в наличии магической поддержки и существ воздушного боя, которые могут оказывать значительное влияние на ход сражения, нарушая планы противника и быстро адаптируясь к ситуации на поле боя. Армия 2, хотя и обладает значительной мощью и численностью, может столкнуться с проблемами при противостоянии хорошо организованной обороне и дистанционными атаками Армии 1, особенно если последняя удачно использует свои воздушные и магические силы. **Однозначный ответ:** Исходя из анализа, можно предположить, что у **Армии 1** больше шансов на победу. Она обладает необходимыми средствами для эффективной обороны и атаки, а также способностью быстро адаптироваться к развивающейся тактической обстановке на поле боя, что делает её более вероятным победителем в столкновении."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical - Steve Punt (as Punt PI) looks into the Mystery surrounding Shergar.. a Racehorse that was horse napped...","completion":"If Steve Punt, the British writer, comedian, and actor known for his work on radio comedy and documentaries, were to delve into the mystery surrounding Shergar as a private investigator on his BBC Radio 4 program \\"Punt PI,\\" we could anticipate a unique blend of humor, insight, and detailed investigation. Shergar, a Thoroughbred racehorse with an outstanding record, winning the 1981 Epsom Derby by a record 10 lengths, was kidnapped from the Ballymany Stud, near The Curragh in County Kildare, Ireland, on 8 February 1983. Owned by the Aga Khan IV and others, the horse's disappearance led to one of the most extensive and fruitless searches in crime history. Despite various theories and claims over the years, the true fate of Shergar and the identities of those behind the kidnapping remain mysteries. # How Steve Punt Might Investigate the Shergar Mystery **1. Analyzing the Context:** Steve Punt, leveraging his research skills and wit, would begin by sketching the socio-political context of Ireland in the early 1980s, particularly focusing on the activities of the IRA (Irish Republican Army), which many have suspected to be behind the kidnapping. **2. Interviewing Key Figures:** Through a series of interviews with journalists, former stable staff, investigators, and perhaps the Aga Khan IV himself if possible, Punt would attempt to piece together the events of the night of the kidnapping and the subsequent search efforts. He'd likely bring his characteristic humor into these conversations, making them both informative and entertaining. **3. Examining Theories:** Punt would dissect the various theories that have surfaced over the years, from ransom demands to the horse being taken out of the country, or even the more tragic theories suggesting Shergar was killed shortly after the kidnapping due to complications or fears of being caught. **4. Exploring Contemporary Leads:** Were there any overlooked pieces of evidence? Are there new developments or information that have come to light in recent years? Steve Punt, with his keen eye for detective work, would dig deep. **5. Engaging the Audience:** Steve's approach, packed with irony and wit, would not only shed light on the mystery but also engage listeners, inviting them to consider the nuances of the case, perhaps even drawing in new tips or clues from the public. **6. Conclusion:** Given the nature of the case and its historical complexity, it's unlikely that Steve Punt could definitively solve the mystery of Shergar's disappearance. However, his investigation would offer a fresh perspective, combining entertainment with genuine investigatory journalism, reviewing known facts, and possibly unearthing new insights or reviving interest in the case. Shergar's story is not just a tale of a missing racehorse but a reflection of a turbulent time in Irish history, intertwined with the world of international racing and crime. Steve Punt's knack for approaching serious topics with a light-hearted touch could bring a new audience to this enduring mystery, balancing respect for the gravity of the event with the engaging storytelling he is known for."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical - Steve Punt (as Punt PI) looks into Borley Rectory and it's alleged supernatural history.","completion":"If Steve Punt, in his role as a quasi-detective from \\"Punt PI,\\" were to investigate the enigmatic and allegedly haunted Borley Rectory, the episode would likely unfold as an engrossing mix of historical inquiry, skeptical analysis, and Punt's distinctive brand of humor. Borley Rectory, often hailed as \\"the most haunted house in England,\\" presents a riveting subject, replete with tales of ghostly nuns, mysterious writing on the walls, and other supernatural occurrences reported since the 19th century. # How the Investigation Might Unfold: **1. Historical Backdrop:** Punt would start by setting the stage with the rich history of Borley Rectory, located in Essex, England. Built in 1862 to house the rector of the parish of Borley and his family, it was reputedly erected on the site of a medieval monastery. The tales of hauntings begun with reports of a nun from a nearby convent who fell in love with a monk from the monastery. The two planned to elope but were caught, leading to the execution of the monk and the nun's confinement within the walls of a convent. This tragic love story is said to be the root of the hauntings. **2. Interviews and Eye-Witness Accounts:** Punt might seek out historians, paranormal investigators who have studied Borley Rectory, and if possible, descendents or locals who could share passed down stories or personal experiences related to the supposed hauntings. His skillful interviews would peel away layers of myth to scrutinize what evidence, if any, supports the ghostly claims. **3. Skeptical Analysis:** With a healthy dose of skepticism, Punt would evaluate the findings of Harry Price, a noted ghost hunter, who conducted extensive investigations at Borley in the 1920s and 1930s. Price's reports of paranormal phenomena, including the famous photograph of a \\"brick\\" levitating outside the rectory, captured public imagination but also attracted criticism for lack of rigorous scientific methodology. **4. The Fire and Aftermath:** In 1939, Borley Rectory was destroyed by fire, and afterwards, the ruins became a focal point for alleged sightings and paranormal investigations. Punt might explore the aftermath of the fire, examining whether alleged sightings persisted and how they contributed to the legend of Borley. **5. Modern Perspective:** Incorporating a modern perspective, Punt could consult with contemporary paranormal researchers and skeptics alike to discuss how advances in technology and changes in societal beliefs have influenced the perception of Borley Rectory's hauntings today. **6. Conclusion:** While possibly unable to prove or disprove the existence of supernatural phenomena at Borley Rectory, Punt's investigation would offer a rounded view of the legend, blending historical facts, personal testimonies, and a critical examination of supposed evidence. Throughout, Steve Punt would approach the tale of Borley Rectory with his characteristic wit, perhaps poking fun at the more outlandish claims, while also showing respect for the historical and emotional depth of the story. The resulting narrative would not only entertain listeners but also encourage them to think critically about the nature of such hauntings and what they reveal about human nature's fascination with the supernatural."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready!

The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB.

New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer.

AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won’t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018 Thread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I’d list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV’s case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world’s first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these “peaceful” Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support!

Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging.

Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for.

It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer.

I’m genuinely surprised but kind of saw it coming after “Tomodachi Life” vanished and WoQ took over its webpage on 4kids.tv back in April. It was like a silent drumroll! ToonArchivist42: Yeah, I noticed the webpage swap too! It was pretty low-key, but definitely hinted at something big. “World of Quest” has that unique blend of humor and adventure that’s been missing. Glad CW4Kids is bringing back some fan favorites. DigitalScribe: The subtle hints were there with the webpage transition, but seeing “World of Quest” officially back is exciting! The show always had potential; it just needed the right moment to shine again. Looks like that time is now.

A modified version of the Kuomingtang's Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag becomes its [the restored Ming State's] naval flag, [the restored Great Ming State] replacing the Kuomintang's White Sun with a white-outer rayed, red inner-rayed yellow sun with the Chinese character for \\"Ming\\" in the middle of the yellow sun in tribute to the original Ming blue sky and red outer rayed yellow sun flag while the crossed 18-star iron blood flag of the Xinhai Revolution becomes the Chinese army flag. The Beiyang Government of the Republic of China’s Twelve Symbols national emblem is [the twelve Symbols National Emblem] rechosen [the twelve Symbols national emblem] as the Chinese national emblem, albiet with two crossed 18-star iron blood flags behind the main insigna of the emblem as tribute to the Xinhai Revolution, and a plum blossom/Chinese plum seal akin to the Japanese imperial family's, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato's/the Minamoto dynasty's Chrysanthemum seal is [the plum blossom seal] chosen [the plum blossom seal] as the reinstated Imperial House of Zhu's seal while the peony remains the Chinese national flower. The restored Great Ming State also has the first incarnation of the Empire of China's national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", as its [the restored Great Ming State's] national anthem.

The Beiyang Government's armed wing and thus the first Republic of China's combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, [the Beiyang Army] built [the Beiyang Army] from both the Manchu and Han units of the Great Qing Empire's modernized army corps envisioned as a regular and professional fully trained and equipped according to Western standards with a reserve, the New Army within Han China, [the Beiyang Army being built from both the Manchu and Han units of the New Army] after the Xinhai Revolution, [the Beiyang Army] is [the Beiyang Army] retooled, restaffed and rebuilt into a modern incarnation of the Great Ming State's combined ground warfare and naval combat force, the Great Ming Army after the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China with help from Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans. Reformist elements of the Kuomingtang and the Nationalist Chinese government who had disagreed with Yat-Sen's goal of [Yat-Sen's] goal of Nationalist China' having the territory of the Great Qing Empire migrate to the restored Ming dynasty, including Sun-Yat-Sen's disciple and rightful heir, the Han Chinese revolutionary turned statesman and politician Wang Jingwei. These elements from Nationalist China and the Kuomingtang work to incorporate Yat-Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism/social welfare into the government of the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu]. Jingwei even becomes the Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet from 1939-1943, during which [Jingwei's first term as Prime Minister of the restored Ming dynasty] time the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the unitary parliamentary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] imperial dynastic monarchy of the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China, which [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] remains [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] the form [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] that the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] takes [the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Ming dynasty] from 1938-1954, and [Wang Jingwei becoming Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet] again from 1945-1951. Before Jingwei, the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang still becomes the first Prime Minister of the Empire of China from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922, and Jingwei is [Jingwei] succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP in this timeline due to the Empire of China winning the National Protection War in this timeline, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members in this time, then Wu Shih-wen of the KMT from 20 May 2000 – 1 February 2002, Chiang Chung-ling of the KMT from March 2000 – 30 March 2003 , then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline.

The influence of the Manchuria based division of the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground warfare division, the Imperial Japanese Army protecting the South Manchuria railway in Manchuria from Han Chinese bandits, the Kwangtung Army along with the IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] in Manchuria means that the Japanese are [the Japanese] able [the Japanese] to [the Japanese] push out Zhuolin and the Fengtian Clique in Manchuria while [the Japanese] increasing the influence of the Qing Imperial Court and the indigenous Manchu nobility, aristocracy and royalty in Manchuria, [the Japanese decreasing the influence of the Fengtian Clique and increasing the influence of the Qing imperial court within post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] leading to it [post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] becoming the pre-WW2 and WW2-era, post-1932, pre-1945 Imperial Japanese protectorate of the Qing imperial family, the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled and monarchist, Manchurian nationalist, anti-communist, Pan Asian political party Concordia Association-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional imperial royal parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s, with the Great Qing Empire's last Emperor, Aisin-Gioro \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, [Pu-Yi] becoming [what Pu-Yi becomes after the formation of Manchukuo] the first Emperor [Pu-Yi after Manchukuo's formation] of Manchukuo like in OTL. The armed Wing and thus the combined armed forces of the Fengtian Clique formed from Zhuolin's bandit forces and what remained of the Manchu Bannermen and the Qing New Army in Manchuria after the Xinhai Revolution, the National Pacification Army, [the National Pacification Army] becomes a modern, well equipped military force under the watchful eye of the Kwangtung Army. The National Pacification Army eventually becomes Manchukuo’s combined armed forces, the Manchukuo Imperial Army after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria becomes Manchukuo with Fengtian Clique and pro-China unification elements within the NPA being discredited, given extended sentences of leave to Nationalist China or the restored Ming dynasty, or otherwise removed in various ways. Police units in Manchuria nominally operating under the Beiyang Government's control but in reality under the Fengtian Clique's control also become the main law enforcement agency of Manchukuo, managing the central police department responsible for all police in Manchuria after Manchuko’s formation, with a Maritime Police to combat smuggling along with cracking down on smuggling and maintain maritime security within Manchurian waters, first under the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security and then under the General Directorate of Security Affairs, the Manchukuo Police after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria. After Pu-Yi's death in [when Pu-Yi dies in this timeline] around 1970, his [Pu-Yi's] younger half brother Aisin-Gioro Puren becomes [Puren in this timeline] the Emperor of Manchukuo, [Puren in this timeline] followed by his [Puren's] son, Aisin-Gioro Yuzhang after his [Yuzhang's] death in [when Puren died] 2015, who [Yuzhang] intends [Yuzhang] to [Yuzhang] make his [Yuzhang's] daughter, Jin Xin Empress of Manchukuo upon his [Yuzhang's] death. The Cantonese statesman, diplomat and calligrapher Zheng Xiaoxu is the first Prime Minister of Manchukuo like in OTL, followed by the Manchurian general, warlord and politician Zhang Jinghui like in OTL, followed by Hu Qili, then Jiang Zemin. Zhuolin's eldest son and his [Zhuolin's] heir to the leadership to the Beiyang Clique and thus of post-Xinhai Revolution, the pro-KMT, pro-Chinese unification, anti-Japanese Zhang Xueliang, [Xueliang] is [Xueliang] sent [Xueliang] to the restored Ming dynasty after Zhuolin's death via [Zhuolin's death] having his [Zhuolin's train] bombed, [Xueliang being sent to the restored Ming dynasty] in 1928.

The Northern Expedition failing unlike in OTL allows Nationalist China, Manchukuo, the Beiyang Government and the Great Japanese Empire to [Nationalist China, Manchukuo, the Beiyang Government and the Great Japanese Empire] survive post-1947 into the later half of the 20th century, the 21th century and beyond.","completion":"**Chapter 12: The Ming Restoration and Its Legacy** In the early 20th century, the geopolitical landscape of East Asia was shifting rapidly. The fall of the Qing Dynasty to the forces of the Xinhai Revolution, a movement inspired by the principles of republicanism, nationalism, and reform, culminated in the establishment of the First Republic of China under the Beiyang Government. However, this nascent republic was soon challenged by the ambitious Yuan Shikai, whose short-lived attempt to establish the Empire of China under his rule ended with his unforeseen death in 1916. This period marked the beginning of a profound transformation in Chinese governance and identity, a transformation that, paradoxically, would lead to the restoration of a dynasty—the Ming. The National Protection War, spearheaded by Sun Yat-Sen, or as he is more widely known, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, amidst these turbulent times, was critically aimed at resisting Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions. However, the aftermath of this conflict saw the fragmentation of the republic into several spheres of influence, dominated by regional warlords and the enduring Beiyang Government. The Beiyang Army, rebranded from the Imperial New Army, stood at the heart of this divided China, a symbol of military modernity and the enduring quest for national unity. While the Southern government, centered in Cantonia, aspired to embody Sun Yat-Sen's vision of a unified, democratic China, its influence was checked by the resilience of the Beiyang-dominated North. The death of Sun Yat-Sen during the National Protection War and the refusal of Yuan Shikai's eldest son, Yuan Keding, to ascend as emperor following his father's plans, paved the way for an unexpected resurgence of monarchical nostalgia amongst the populace. This nostalgia was not for the Qing, a dynasty associated with Manchu rule and the final days of imperial decline, but rather for the Ming, the last Han-ruled dynasty, renowned for its cultural and maritime achievements. It was within this context that the National Assembly, embodying both the remnants of the Beiyang Government and the aspirations of a republican China, extended an invitation to the surviving descendants of the Ming Imperial family. In an extraordinary act of revivalism and reconciliation, the descendants of the Zhu family were invited to reclaim the throne, not as absolutist monarchs but as constitutional figures within a democratic and federal system. The restoration of the Ming in the 20th century, therefore, was not a simple act of monarchical return but a complex reimagining of governance that sought to integrate traditional legitimacy with modern democratic and federal principles. This restructured Ming regime promoted industrialization, the development of a national railway system, and educational reform, drawing parallels with the Meiji Restoration in Japan. Yet, unlike the Japanese model which centralized power under the emperor, the Ming restoration emphasized provincial autonomy and a balance between monarchy and parliamentarism. Under the guiding principles of Sun Yat-Sen's Three Peoples' Principles—nationalism, democracy, and social welfare—the restored Ming State embarked on a path of modernization and international engagement. This was a China that revered its imperial past while forging a new identity as a progressive and dynamic participant in global affairs. Despite external pressures, including the rise of Japan as a regional power and the complexities of international diplomacy during the interwar period, the Ming Dynasty managed to navigate the treacherous waters of 20th-century politics. The Beiyang Army, transformed into the Great Ming Army, symbolized this new era, serving not only as a military force but as an agent of national unity and development. The establishment of Manchukuo and the geopolitical tensions in East Asia presented challenges and opportunities for the restored Ming Dynasty. Through a combination of diplomacy and strategic alliances, the Ming State navigated these challenges, maintaining its sovereignty while engaging with new ideological and political currents across Asia. As the 20th century unfolded, the Ming restoration became a symbol of China's capacity for reinvention and resilience. The blending of ancient dynasty and republican ideals, of military strength and democratic governance, replaced the narrative of decline with one of rejuvenation. The restored Ming State and its successors embarked on a path that sought not to replicate the past but to create a profoundly new vision of what China could be—a vision that continues to shape the nation's trajectory into the 21st century and beyond."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, plausible alternate history scenario in the form of a history book chapter in the world of the alternate history

Emerging from the shadows of a tumultuous end to the Qing dynasty was an unprecedented reinvigoration of the ancient Ming bloodline under the auspices of the Beiyang Government. Orchestrating this revival was Yuan Shikai, a figure of significant military and political acumen, whose ambitions momentarily aligned with the echoes of China's imperial past. Against the backdrop of internal strife and the burgeoning threat of external influences, the Beiyang Government astutely navigated between tradition and modernity to usher in the era of the Great Ming State. **The Beiyang Government and the Embodiment of Adaptation** Under the guidance of Shikai, the Empire of China, albeit briefly conceived as a monarchical entity, laid the groundwork for a revitalized national identity. Striking a balance between the imperatives of central authority and regional autonomy, the government embarked on comprehensive reforms. The industrial, infrastructural, and educational initiatives marked the beginning of China's long journey towards international stature. At the core of these efforts was an unwavering commitment to the principles that had once propelled the Xinhai Revolution — nationalism, democracy, and socioeconomic advancement. **The Ming Restoration: A New Chapter in Chinese Monarchy** Remarkably, the transition to a federalist constitutional monarchy was embraced not as a mere return to monarchical rule but as a forward-looking endeavor. The integration of the Zhu lineage into the contemporary political landscape, with the assistance and consensus of the Beiyang power structure, was symbolic of the nation's reverence for its historical legacy and its aspirations for democratic governance. The Ming Restoration, drawing parallels to Japan's Meiji Restoration, was seen as an exploration of how traditional monarchic values could coexist with and even bolster modern statecraft. **Industrial and Democratic Revival** The remodeled Great Ming State embarked on an ambitious path towards industrialization, propelled by international collaborations and a vision of a connected, prosperous China. The emphasis on railway expansion not only facilitated economic growth but also served as a tangible symbol of the unified Ming dominion. With the promulgation of a parliamentary system, the state underscored its commitment to incorporating the populace in the polity, a move that was applauded both domestically and internationally. **The Cultural and Symbolic Renaissance** In a striking departure from the past, the newly established monarchy adopted \\"Republic of China\\" in English, retaining the Beiyang Government's five-colored flag with modifications that deeply honored Ming heritage. This fusion of symbols from diverse eras underlined the nuanced approach of the Ming restoration — honoring the past while forging a new, inclusive identity. The military and bureaucratic structures were similarly reformed, blending the organizational acumen of the Beiyang era with the revered legacy of the Ming, thus creating a robust framework for national defense and governance. **An Era of Collaboration and Conflict** Despite the internal consolidation, the Empire of China faced formidable challenges from both traditionalist and revolutionary factions. The National Protection War, though a crucible of conflict, ultimately underscored the resilience and adaptability of the Ming restoration. The strategic alliances and enmities that formed in its wake, with the Cantonese region charting an autonomous course under the banner of Nationalist China, highlighted the complex tapestry of China’s regional dynamics. **The Ming Dynasty in the Modern World** As the Great Ming State navigated the intricate interplay of domestic aspirations and international pressures, it carved out a space for itself on the global stage. The cooperation with and, at times, opposition to burgeoning powers such as Japan and the influence of ideologically diverse factions, including reformist elements of the Kuomintang, shaped the evolving contours of its foreign and domestic policies. **Conclusion** The revival of the Ming dynasty, under the multifaceted leadership of figures like Yuan Shikai and his successors, represents a pivotal chapter in China's storied history. It is a testament to the nation's enduring spirit and its perpetual quest for sovereignty, progress, and unity amidst the winds of change. The Great Ming State, with its blend of ancient monarchy and modern governance, stands as a symbol of China’s capacity to reinvent itself, drawing from the depths of its rich heritage to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving world."},{"prompt":"Is George a male's name?","completion":"Yes, George is typically a male name."},{"prompt":"Is there any female's variant for George?","completion":"Yes, the female form of the name George is usually Georgia or Georgina."},{"prompt":"누군가를 좋은선수로 낙인 찍는것 또한 낙인이야를 영어로 번역","completion":"\\"Labeling someone as a good player is also a form of labeling.\\""},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Every player who makes it to professional soccer has demonstrated substantial skill, perseverance, and talent to even be considered by a professional team. Performance can be measured in various aspects, such as skill level, attitude, behavior on and off the pitch, and contribution to the team's success. It's important to remember that a player might struggle due to many reasons, such as being out of form, recovering from an injury, not fitting well with a team's tactics, or just being in the early stages of their career. These factors don't necessarily make someone a bad player; they might just be facing challenges that temporarily affect their performance. Criticism towards players should be constructive and take into account the complexity and competitiveness of professional sports. Instead of focusing on who might be considered \\"bad,\\" it's more productive and positive to focus on players’ strengths, their contributions to their teams, and the beautiful moments they create on the pitch."},{"prompt":"Why did you answer about good player but not about bad player?","completion":"My approach to answering questions about assessing the quality or performance of athletes, including soccer players, is geared towards maintaining a respectful and constructive tone. Highlighting someone as a \\"most bad\\" player isn't just subjective; it also doesn't align with the recognition of effort, dedication, and the myriad of challenges professional athletes face. In discussing \\"good\\" players or the best in their field, the conversation naturally leans towards celebrating achievement, skill, and contributions to the sport—elements that are widely recognized and celebrated. These discussions provide insights into what makes an athlete excel in their domain, serving as inspiration and setting benchmarks in sports. On the other hand, branding someone as a \\"bad\\" player can be unnecessarily negative and diminishes the athlete's commitment and the obstacles they've overcome to reach the professional level. It's more constructive to focus on areas for improvement, the challenges athletes face, and understanding that performance can fluctuate for a myriad of reasons (tactical misfit, injuries, personal issues, etc.). In essence, the goal is to foster a positive and respectful discourse on sports and the athletes who dedicate their lives to it, emphasizing constructive criticism and understanding rather than negative labeling."},{"prompt":"Labeling someone as a good player is also a form of labeling.","completion":"You're absolutely right, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify this point further. Labeling someone as a \\"good\\" player is indeed a form of labeling, and like any kind of labeling, it comes with its own set of implications and biases. The intention behind using positive labeling in sports (or any other field) is to acknowledge and celebrate achievements, skill level, and positive contributions. This form of recognition is often based on observable performance metrics, achievements, accolades, and the impact an individual has on their team and the sport as a whole. In the context of athletes or individuals in any profession, positive labels often serve as a form of encouragement and recognition for hard work, skill, and dedication. They can motivate others, help set standards of excellence, and contribute to the individual's legacy in their field. However, it's important to be mindful and ensure that such labeling does not place undue pressure on the individuals involved or create unrealistic expectations. Conversely, negative labeling can be demotivating, reduce confidence, and impact an individual's mental well-being and performance. It can foster a negative environment and does not typically contribute to growth or improvement. The key difference between positive and negative labeling lies in their impact and intention. While positive recognition aims to uplift and inspire, negative labeling often does the opposite. Nevertheless, it's important to approach all forms of labeling with sensitivity, ensuring that they're fair, based on objective criteria, and used responsibly to avoid causing harm or creating undue pressure."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The industrial, economic and military development that made Japan into a great power after the Meiji Restoration in OTL continues unhindered and the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, is [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] still [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] formed [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] in 3 January 1868 like in OTL, however the centuries-earlier victory of the Japanese in the Imjin Wars of May 23, 1592 – December 16, 1598 launched [the Imjin Wars] by the hereditary military dictatorship of the Ashikaga bakufu de-facto lead by Toyotomi Hideyoshi-ruled feudal Japan against the satelite state and tributary kingdom of Great Joeson ruled by the partially Han Chinese Korean House of Jeonju Yi in the entire Korean peninsula and the state it [Great Joeson] was [Great Joeson] a vassal [Great Joeson] to, the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" ruling over the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty, Yunnan and Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi |Cantonia|] unlike in OTL and the subsequent annexation of post-Imjin Wars Korea into Ashikaga bakufu-ruled feudal Japan as the Japanese province of Chōsen with with Hideyoshi taking the last King of Joeson before the Imjin Wars in this timeline, Seonjo's daughter, Princess Jeongmyeong as his [Hideyoshi's] latest concubine after the Imjin Wars in this timeline and compliant members of Korea's indigenous slave-owning, sex-slave owning, China loving, resistant to change, Confucianist and neo-Confucianist aristocracy and nobility, the yangaban, [compliant members of the yangaban] along with compliant members of the Korean royal family [the House of Jeonju Yi] being [compliant members of the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi] married off [compliant members of the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi] into Japanese royalty, aristocracy and nobility after the Japanese victory in the Imjin Wars and the subsequent dissolution of Joeson and the annexation of post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan as Chōsen in this timeline with buke/samurai and daimyō from the Japanese Home Islands slowly replacing the yangaban and the now-dissolved Joeson's ground force in this timeline, the now-dissolved Joeson Army as the main aristocratic and military presence within post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea with anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi after its [post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea's in this timeline] annexation into Japan as Chōsen being [ anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi] hunted down and [ anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea] either killed, reeducated or [anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan] deported [anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea] to the Ming dynasty by the Japanese, who [the Japanese] then [the Japanese in this timeline] after [the Japanese in this timeline] liberating the mostly illiterate, uneducated, impoverished and starving Korean people from the yangaban and the useless Korean royals [the House of Jeonju Yi] due to [the Japanese in this timeline] winning the Imjin Wars in this timeline, [the Japanese in this timeline] undertake a comprehensive education, primitive industrial and religious reform system in the post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korean peninsula, with schools being opened up for the common Korean people to get an education for themselves and their children and land reform in Korea being initiated by Hideyoshi by having seized yangban and House of Jeonju Yi estates go to ethnic Korean peasant farmers and ex-slaves within post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea in this timeline. The native Korean script for writing the Korean language, Hangul is [Hangul in this timeline] discovered [Hangul in this timeline] by the Japanese after the annexation of post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan and [Hangul in this timeline] subsequent spread and promoted as the way [Hangul in this timeline] to [Hangul in this timeline] write Korean by the Japanese in the timeline, who [the Japanese in this timeline] also promote the spread of the Japanese language and the heavily modified traditional Chinese characters used to write the Japanese language, Kanji, over the traditional Chinese characters used to write Korean utilized by the yangban and the House of Jeonju Yi, Hangul. The Japanese in this timeline also [the Japanese in this timeline] promote the Japanese indigenous national religion and state religion of Shinto, Zen Buddhism and even Christianity over traditional Korean shamanism, Taoism and Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea as well in this timeline, with the liberated Korean masses flocking to these new religions [ Shinto, Zen Buddhism and Christianity] in droves. The Japanese also [the Japanese in this timeline] begin a massive effort to [the Japanese in this timeline] absorb the Koreans into the Greater Japanese race and [the Japanese in this timeline] also integrate the Koreans into the Japanese political, social and economic systems, [the Japanese in this timeline] encouraging many Korean commoners in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea to take Japanese names and let their children think of themselves as Japanese, speaking, writing and thinking in Japanese. This is hugely successful and the Koreans are [the Koreans in this timeline] eventually assimilated [the Koreans in this timeline] into the Japanese nation as the centuries go by, mostly thinking, speaking and writing in Japanese by the time of the alternate Meiji Restoration in this timeline, although a now heavily Japanese, Manchu/Manchurian and Chinese influenced Korean language still exists as a \\"dialect\\" of Japanese in this timeline, with Korea and the Koreans having roughly the same status as Okinawa and the Okinawans in both OTL Japan and this version of Japan in this timeline Hideyoshi also [Hideyoshi] conquers Russia's Sakhalin and [Russia's] Kuril Islands in this timeline after Imjin Wars in this timeline, which [Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands in this timeline] become the Japanese province of Karufuto By the time Hideyoshi dies on September 18, 1598, with his [Hideyoshi's] nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu succeeding him [Hideyoshi] as both Chief Advisor to the Japanese Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm and his [Hideyoshi's] young son Toyotomi Hideyori next in line to succeed both Hideyoshi and Hidetsugu as Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm, with the then-reigning Japanese Emperor Go-Yōzei using this as an excuse not to appoint another shogun until Tokugawa Ieyasu attempts to take control of Japan from Hidetsugu and nearly reopens the Sengoku period. Go-Yōzei then appoints Ieyasu as shogun on March 24, 1603, causing the start of the Tokugawa shogunate and forces Ieyasu not to break the arranged marriage between Hideyori and Ieyasu's granddaughter Senhime, with the intention of making their [Hideyori's and Senhime's] first male child into the next shogun after Ieyasu's son Tokugawa Hidetada and also with the intention of uniting the Toyotomis and Tokugawas into a single family, securing the line of shogunal succession. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still [the Jurchens in this timeline] emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Japanese conquering the Tungning Kingdom in this timeline] on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Japanese also [the Japanese] work to assimilate the Chinese refugees from the Ming that make up the Tungning Kingdom's population and the main indigenous people in Taiwan who also make up 70% of Taiwan's population, the Han Chinese, or rather subgroup who speak Hokkien, a Southern Min language and/or trace their ancestry to southeastern Fujian in China, the Hoklo, [the Japanese working to assimilate the Hoklo] and the other indigenous tribes of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese population in this timeline using the same methods as used in Korea in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Returning to the alternate version of late 19th century to early 20th century Japan after the alternate version of the Meiji Restoration in this timeline, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces' ground warfare branch, the Imperial Japanese Army is [the Imperial Japanese Army] still [the Imperial Japanese Army] formed in February 1872 like in OTL but [the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline] is [the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline] significantly stronger than its [[the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline's] OTL counterpart due to the earlier conquest and subsequent integration of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Korea and Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands in Japan along with the discovery and exploitation of the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] by the Japanese The IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] is [the Kempeitai in this timeline] still [the Kempeitai in this timeline] formed on 4 January 1881 like in OTL The Cantonese Hakka-medical student turned Han nationalist, revolutionary, politician and statesman Dr. Sun Wen, [Wen] better known as Dr. Sun Yat-Sen is [Wen/Yat-Sen] assassinated [Wen/Yat-Sen] by a joint team of the UK's foreign intelligence M16 and the Russian Empire's combined secret police and foreign intelligence agency, the Okhrana when [Wen/Yat-Sen] studying in the Great Japanese Empire under the Japanese alias Kikori Nakayama [when Wen/Yat-Sen studied in the Japanese Empire under the name Nakayama] from 1899 to 1903. The mixture of steampunk and early diesel technology and sorcery known as Machinart [Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai], circuits [Machinart] made from spells that [the Machinart circuits] are [the Machinart circuits] put [the Machinart circuits] into objects [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] to [the placement of Machinart circuits into objects] bring them [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] to life and simultaneously [the placement of Machinart circuits into objects] give them [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] a rudimentary form of artificial intelligence, [the development of the Machinart circuits] continues [the development of the Machinart circuits] in the United Kingdom in the early 20th century. These Automatons [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] were [the Automatons] developed as a military weapon by the British government and spread throughout the world; the humans in charge of them [the Automations] became known as puppeteers. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution fought [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched and fought in the Xinhai Revolution] the anti Manchu Han nationalist and Cantonese nationalist revolutionary group adhering to republican, nationalist, and socialist objectives of the Tongmenghui which [the Tongmenghui] was [the Tongmenghui] founded by Wen/Yat Sen in 1905 in OTL which, [the Tongmenghui both in OTL and this timeline] later became the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society/revolutionary of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the Xinhai Revolution and the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] had [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people before and after the Xinhai Revolution, [the Kuomingtang, Tongmenghui and Yellow Sand Society launching the Xinhai Revolution] against the Manchu dominated, Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Manchuria, whose [the Xinhai Revolution's] goal was [the goal of the Xinhai Revolution both in OTL and in this timeline] \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\" in other words [Overthrow Qing and restore Ming] restoring the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government [the Ming dynasty] of a post-Qing Han China, [the Xinhai Revolution fought to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming dynasty as the government of post-Qing Han China] still [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] happens despite Wen's/Yat Sen's earlier death due to the strength and influence of Han nationalism and Han monarchist groups in Qing-occupied Han China and the covert and open support Japan gives to the Tongmenghui both in OTL and in this timeline. Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China all [ Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China] break away [ Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China] from Manchuria like Han China during and after the Xinhai Revolution like in OTL. The post-1912, pre-1928 and then post-1937, pre-1945 the stratocratic [military dominated] Beiyang Government-ruled presidental parliamentary democratic republic of the First Republic of China is [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] still [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] formed [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] as the government [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] of post-Qing, post-Xinhai Han China like in OTL while Manchuria still [Manchuria] comes [Manchuria] under the control of [which faction took over Manchuria] the Han Chinese bandit clique/military junta/Han Chinese government faction of the Fengtian Clique headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the Fengtian Clique's leader] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhang] known [Zhang] as [Zhang] \\"the Old Marshal\\", [Manchuria falling under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] despite the Qing Imperial Court continuing [the Qing Imperial court] still [the Qing Imperial court] existing in Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution like in OTL. When former top dog in the Great Qing Empire's modernized army corps envisioned as a regular and professional fully trained and equipped according to Western standards with a reserve, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang Government after the Xinhai Revolution and later the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China's first President, Yuan Shikai, [Shikai] still [Shikai] makes Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the unitary constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy of the Empire of China on 12 December 1915 like in OTL, everyone expects him [Shikai] to [Shikai] become Emperor [Shikai] of Han China. But unlike in OTL, he [Shikai] dies a day after [Shikai] forming the Empire of China in this timeline and so The Beiyang Government's armed wing and thus the first Republic of China's combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, [the Beiyang Army] built [the Beiyang Army] from both the Manchu and Han units of the now-dissolved New Army within Han China and the Beiyang Government's and thus the first Republic of China's and the Empire of China's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and House of Representatives, the National Assembly, [the Beiyang Army and the National Assembly] assume joint control over the Empire of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline, due to Yuan Shikai's eldest son, the half Korean Yuan Keding who [Keding] had [Keding] become Chinese Crown Prince under the combined era and regal name of Yuntai after Shikai formed the Empire of China, [Yuntai] refusing to become Emperor of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline. In order to stay afloat and not be toppled by the Chinese people like the Great Qing Empire, the Empire of China in this timeline decides to promote industrialization, development as well as the development of a National railway system in Han China along with [the Empire of China in this timeline] adopting a federalist, democratic system with the eighteen provinces of Han China proper being allowed autonomy, akin to the system of government in the post 1871, pre 1919 German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled federal parliamentary semi-constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Prussia ruling over much of modern-day eastern Germany and Western Poland along with Russian Kalingard-dominated Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the German Empire and the USA. The Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China also sends many students to Japan for training, education and constitutional lessons, along with having the IJAF and the German Empire's unified ground and air force, the Imperial German Army both train and build up the Beiyang Army into a ultra-modern, developed, ready force. The Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline also reluctantly allows for the secession of Yunnan from Han China, which [Yunnan] subsequently restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government with support from the Japanese The joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China/Nationalist China based [Nationalist China] in [Nationalist China's] stronghold of [Nationalist China's stronghold and homebase] Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi |Cantonia|], [Nationalist China] is [Nationalist China] is [Nationalist China] still [Nationalist China] formed [Nationalist China] in this timeline due to the strong desire of the Cantonese people for independence from both Manchu and Han dominion and the large amount of Han nationalists and imperialists in the Cantonian population and [Nationalist China in this timeline] still [Nationalist China in this timeline] launches the Chinese Civil War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 known as the National Protection War against the Empire of China like in OTL, but [Nationalist China in this timeline] loses the National Protection War due to [why Nationalist China loses the National Protection War in this timeline] the massive corruption and incompetence in the Kuomingtang, the Kuomingtang's armed wing and thus the Nationalist Chinese combined armed forces, the National Revolutionary Army and the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan, along with the fact that most Cantonese don't want to be a part of China, whether Manchu or Han-dominated as well as Sun's/Yat-Sen's earlier death in this timeline denying Nationalist China the charismatic leadership it needs, An anti-Chinese unification, pro-Cantonese independence, pro-buisness, merchant-backed faction eventually grows strength in Nationalist China and launches a putsch that sees the take over of the Kuomingtang and the Legislative Yuan as the Beiyang Army decimates the NRA, leading to the leaders of the Kuomintang and the generals of the Beiyang Army agreeing to an armistice that sees the independence of Nationalist China and the abandonment of the territory of the Qing Empire by Nationalist China. British and French soldiers firing on Japanese soldiers helping the Beiyang Army against the NRA during the National Revolutionary War leads to the Japanese joining the Central Powers consisting of the German Empire, The Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine ruled Federal parliamentary constitutional imperial royal monarchy of the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire] over Illryia [Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina], Greater Hungary [Hungary, Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje, Vojvodina and Prekmurje in Serbia, Transylvania and most of the Banat in Romania, Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland], Bohemia and Moravia [Czechia and Slovakia] and Galicia-Lodomeria in Ukraine from [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy's/Austria-Hungarian Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Austria [Austria, Slovenia, South Tyrol], , the Catholic cadet branch of the original German branch of the current British royal family, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial monarchy of the Tsardom of Bulgaria/Third Bulgarian Tsardom/Restored Byzantine Empire ruling over Bulgaria, the Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial royal absolute Islamic monarchy of the Sublime Ottoman State/Eastern Roman Sultanate/Islamic Rome ruling [the Ottoman Empire] over the Arab Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Kuwait from [the Ottoman Empire's stronghold and homebase] Turkey, [Japan joining the Central Powers in this timeline] in WW1 instead of the Central Powers' rivals consisting of the British Empire, the French supremacist, French imperialist, facist totalitarian dictatoral republic of the Third French Republic and the post-1861, pre-1947, French-Italian cadet branch of the German-Italian House of Savoy, the House of Savoy-Carignano ruled Unitary Constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Italy ruling over Italy, Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritia and Somalialand, the German-Danish-Russian House of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional absolute royal imperial monarchy of the Russian Empire/Third Rome/Third Roman Empire/Russian Rome/Russian Byzantium ruling [the Russian Empire] over Siberia, the Baltics, the Caucuses, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Ukraine, Central Asia, Chechenya and Kalymkia from [the Russian Empire's homebase] European Russia, the Entente [Japan joining the Central Powers instead of the Entente like in OTL] with the IJAF destroying the Russian Asian fleet and [the IJAF] also providing support to liberation movements within the European colonies in Asia and Oceania, typing up European forces. The Japanese also seize control of the imperial Russian protectorate of the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia also holding the title of Bogd Gegeen, making them the top-ranked lama in Mongolia known as the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as the Bogd Khan [Holy Emperor]-ruled post-Xinhai, Unitary Buddhist absolute monarchy of the feudal Khanate of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State in Greater Mongolia and [the Japanese] use the Great Mongolian State to [the Japanese] assault Russian Siberia and Central Asia while the Imperial German Army assaults the Russian Empire from Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces, Austria-Hungary's combined land, sea and air combat forces [the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces] along with the combined armed forces of the Tsardom of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Imperial Armed Forces, clean up Russia's Serbian and Montenegrin puppets. The post-1842 army of the Ottoman Empire, after the country was reorganized along modern western European lines during the Tanzimat modernization period, the Modern Ottoman Army, eats out the flower of the Russian Empire's combined armed forces, divided into a standing army consisting of regular troops and two forces that served on separate regulations: the Cossack troops and the Muslim troops and a state militia, the Imperial Russian Army in the Caucuses and even along with the border with Iran. The Kempeitai also has former child refugee from the Confederate States during the American civil war turned failed professor and Confederate revisionist, Woodrow Wilson assassinated before he [Wilson] can [Wilson] become US President like in OTL and [Wilson in OTL] drag the USA into WW1. Without a charismatic figurehead [Wilson] to lead the movement to victory against the hated US Republicans, the American religious right, the civil rights movement and Germans in the USA, the American Democrat Party, more specifically its [the Democrat Party's] white nationalist, Anglophile, England worshipping, anti-Semitic, white supremacist, anti-German Blue Dog wing and the Blue Dog's armed wing, the KKK, [the Blue Dogs and the KKK] never launch the New Freedom Revolution of 1912 against the American government and the Republicans and [the Blue Dogs and the KKK] eventually fade from the political scene in the USA in this timeline, with some of them migrating to England or to British-controlled Canada. The Russian Empire is [the Russian Empire] forced [the Russian Empire] to [the Russian Empire] sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers. The terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk see the German Empire creating the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled absolute feudal royal monarchy of the United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the German Empire creating] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the German Empire] creating the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the restored German Empire creating] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal imperial absolute monarchy of the Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire] forming the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the German Empire] restoring the hereditary royal absolute tribal Buddhist monarchy of the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and [the restored German Empire restoring] the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire also restores the constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of the side branch of the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. The Ottomans liberate the Sunni Muslim Imperial House of Khongirad-ruled absolute hereditary Islamic royal imperial monarchy of the Khanate of Khiva in western Uzbekistan, southwestern Kazakhstan and much of Turkmenistan and [the Ottomans] also liberate the Sunni Muslim Imperial House of Manghud-ruled absolute imperial royal monarchy of the Emirate of Bukhara in eastern Uzbekistan, western Tajikistan, parts of southern Kazakhstan, parts of Turkmenistan and southern Kyrgyzstan. The Great Japanese Empire establishes the Japanese protectorate of the constitutional presidential parliamentary republic of the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. After the defeat of the Russians in the war, the Germans and Austria-Hungarians are able to focus all their efforts on the Western front. The demise of the Democrat Party in the USA leads to the US government launching a crackdown on pro-British groups and organizations and so the Allies are unable to get any help from the Americans, so the Imperial German Army, with help from the Austrian-Hungarian Armed Forces, [the Imperial German Army and the Austrian-Hungarian Armed Forces] march into the French capital of Paris, with the British being forced to surrender when the Labor Party of England storms Parliament with the help of the British people and forces the British government to an armistice with the Central Powers. The shock of being defeated by an hated enemy is simply too much for the British to bear and so loyalist elements of the British army and public forcefully transport the British government and the current British royal family [the British branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha] to the British colonial dominion of British North America ruling over Canada, [the forced transport of the British government and royal family to Canada after the British defeat in WW1 in this timelien] leading to the formation of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Afghanistan and India] and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire's homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands in this timeline. At this timeline's Treaty of Versailles presiding over the division of the defeated Western Entente's territories, signed [this timeline's version of the Treaty of Versalies] in the Austrian City of Linz in this timeline, the Labor-dominated British government recognizes the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as legitimate and the Entente as the initiators of WW1 and [the British] accepting German control of the German House of Wettin-ruled federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Belgium, which [German-controlled Belgium in this timeline] takes the French region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais to [German-controlled Belgium in this timeline] form Greater Belgium. The Labor-dominated British government also recognizes the German annexation of Luxembourg and the loss of Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi to the Germans. The British also recognize the Albanian Muhammad Ali dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Egypt in Egypt's formal status as an Ottoman protectorate and also the independence of Sudan from the British and also the independence of all of Ireland as a unitary parliamentary royal monarchy under the rule of the Irish House of O'Neill Austria-Hungary also restores the pre-1903 Austrian protectorate of the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] removes the imperial Russian puppet fake Serbian royal family, the Serbian House of Karađorđević from power in post-WW1 Serbia. Austria-Hungary also demands that Serbia take full responsibility for starting WW1 by [Serbia] murdering Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Serbian nationalist terror organization that started WW1 by murdering the last pre-1903 King of Serbia and then Franz Ferdinand, the Black Hand be [the Black Hand] treated as war criminals. The army of the Kingdom of Serbia's combined armed forces, the Royal Serbian Army is [the Royal Serbian Army] placed under Austrian supervision. The Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Montenegro in Montenegro becomes an Austrian puppet state as well, with The Kingdom of Montenegro's combined armed forces, Royal Montenegrin Army under Austrian supervision. The German House of Wied-Neuwied-ruled Constitutional royal monarchy of the Principality of Albania in Albania takes Kosovo. Bulgaria subsequently receives the Moesia plain between the Danube and the Balkan mountains range (Stara Planina), Thrace from Greece and Macedonia from Serbia. The German House of Wittelsbach-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Greece becomes a Austrian puppet state as well. The Empire of China receives Singapore and Hong Kong from the British and Macau from the Portuguese. The Japanese also liberate the side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Imperial absolute parliamentary Royal monarchy of the Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Laotian Khun Lo dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Laos and the parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Cambodian House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia in Cambodia, [the restored Ming dynasty helping Japan liberate the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia] from the French colonial occupation of French Indochina ruling over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and [the Japanese] force the French to [the French] recognize Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian independence. The Germans also take Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger along with Chad, French Congo and Gabon from the French. The Germans also take the Congo from Belgium. The Germans combine Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger along with Chad, French Congo and Gabon in addition to Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi into one massive Central African German colony, Mittleafrika [Middle Africa |Mittleafrika|]. Austria also takes Veneto from the Kingdom of Italy. Thus the Treaty of Linz in this timeline ends with a decisive Central Powers victory and the end of British and French influence over the world. The Empire of China in this timeline remains under an extended regency for a year or two after the National Protection War due to Yuntai refusing the Chinese throne in this timeline, that is until the goal of the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline [\\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\"] is remembered and so the surviving descendants of the Chinese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] are [the Zhu descendants] invited [the Zhu descendants] by [who invites the Zhu descendants] the National Assembly under pressure of the Yellow Sand Society, [the Zhu descendants being invited by the National Assembly] to [what the National Assembly invites the Zhu descendants to do] reclaim their [the Zhu descendants'] rightful position as the rulers [the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China, which they [the Zhu descendants] reluctantly [the Zhu descendants] accept, [the Zhu descendants] seeing [the Zhu descendants] that the people of the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in Han China support them [the Zhu descendants] and the monarchy [the Ming dynasty]. Yuntai relinquishes his [Yuntai's] claim to the Chinese throne and [Yuntai] allows his [Yuntai's] children and [Yuntai's] siblings to be absorbed into the Imperial House of Zhu via concubinage, multiple marriages and adoption. The restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Han China after the National Protection war in this timeline is compared to this timeline's version of the Meiji Restoration in this timeline. The Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China ruling over Han China still has the official name of the \\"Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's and the first Republic of China's five-colored flag [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] a banner [the five-colored flag] having five horizontal bands of red [Han], yellow [Manchu], blue [Mongol], white [Hui] and black [Tibet] with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol, a white circle with a smaller red circle in the left, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol], representing [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] an eclipse, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] in the middle [of the modified five colored flag] as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. A modified version of the Kuomingtang's Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag becomes its [the restored Ming State's] naval flag, [the restored Great Ming State] replacing the Kuomintang's White Sun with a white-outer rayed, red inner-rayed yellow sun with the Chinese character for \\"Ming\\" in the middle of the yellow sun in tribute to the original Ming blue sky and red outer rayed yellow sun flag while the crossed 18-star iron blood flag of the Xinhai Revolution becomes the Chinese army flag. The Beiyang Government of the Republic of China’s Twelve Symbols national emblem is [the twelve Symbols National Emblem] rechosen [the twelve Symbols national emblem] as the Chinese national emblem, albiet with two crossed 18-star iron blood flags behind the main insigna of the emblem as tribute to the Xinhai Revolution, and a plum blossom/Chinese plum seal akin to the Japanese imperial family's, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato's/the Minamoto dynasty's Chrysanthemum seal is [the plum blossom seal] chosen [the plum blossom seal] as the reinstated Imperial House of Zhu's seal while the peony remains the Chinese national flower. The restored Great Ming State also has the first incarnation of the Empire of China's national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", as its [the restored Great Ming State's] national anthem. The pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" era and the pre-Great Qing Empire, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility is [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] subsequently [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] restored, restructured, readjusted and modified for the modern world of the late 20th century, [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] being [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] merged [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] with the system of peerage Yuan Shikai had [Yuan Shikai] created when he [Yuan Shikai] formed the Empire of China in 1915. The restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] begins efforts to transition towards a constitutional parliamentary democratic federalist Imperial Royal monarchy with free and fair, democratic multiparty elections via secret ballot, as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing and also to initiate massive industrial, railway and educational development works in Han China with the help of international aid. The Beiyang Army is [the Beiyang Army] retooled, restaffed and rebuilt into a modern incarnation of the Great Ming State's combined ground warfare and naval combat force, the Great Ming Army after the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China with help from Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans. Reformist elements of the Kuomingtang and the Nationalist Chinese government who had disagreed with Yat-Sen's goal of [Yat-Sen's] goal of Nationalist China' having the territory of the Great Qing Empire migrate to the restored Ming dynasty, including Sun-Yat-Sen's disciple and rightful heir, the Han Chinese revolutionary turned statesman and politician Wang Jingwei. Jingwei even becomes the Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet from 1939-1943, during which [Jingwei's first term as Prime Minister of the restored Ming dynasty] time the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the unitary parliamentary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] imperial dynastic monarchy of the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China, which [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] remains [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] the form [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] that the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] takes [the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Ming dynasty] from 1938-1954, and [Wang Jingwei becoming Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet] again from 1945-1951. Before Jingwei, the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang still becomes the first Prime Minister of the Empire of China from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922, and Jingwei is [Jingwei] succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP in this timeline due to the Empire of China winning the National Protection War in this timeline, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members in this time, then Wu Shih-wen of the KMT from 20 May 2000 – 1 February 2002, Chiang Chung-ling of the KMT from March 2000 – 30 March 2003 , then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. These elements from Nationalist China and the Kuomingtang work to incorporate Yat-Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism/social welfare into the government of the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu]. After the Treaty of Linz in this timeline, France and the British Isles are stripped off all their power, influence and strength and subsequently become international pariahs. A revolution launched by socialist, communist and syndicalist groups against the fascist French regime in around 1918-1919 leads to the flight of the French fascists to French North Africa [French occupied Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia] and the subsequent joint invasion of the French mainland by the Imperial German Army and the Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces. Mainland France soon falls quickly and the French House of Bourbon-ruled parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of France is [the Kingdom of France] restored [the Kingdom of France] as the government [the Kingdom of France] of Northern France by Austria-Hungary while the Germans restore the Feudal royal parliamentary monarchy of the Dutchy of Brittany in Brittany and [the Germans] establish an independent Occitan kingdom in Southern France. A communist takeover of the British Isles minus Ireland leads to the invasion of the British Isles by Germany and Austria-Hungary and the division of the British Isles into their separate Kingdoms: the Kingdom of Scotland in Scotland ruled by the German House of Wittelsbach, the Kingdom of England in England ruled by the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Dutchy of Wales ruled by the Welsh House of Anwyl of Tywyn. The Central Powers and the Japanese also sent aid to the monarchist, Russian nationalist, Russian fascist Whites fighting against the Communist Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War with the Whites winning the Russian Civil War, unlike in OTL. Germany makes European Russia a German protectorate under the Romanovs while the Bolsheviks flee to Siberia. The Iranian Imperial House of Pahlavi/Pahlavi dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Imperial State of Iran is [the Imperial State of Iran] still formed in Iran in 1925, but Iran takes Dagestan from the restored Russian Empire, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Uzbekistan's and Turkmenistan's shared Khwarazm province, and [Iran] subsequently absorbs Afghanistan into itself [Afghanistan]. The Imperial State of Iran's combined land, sea and air combat forces, the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces receives training from the Germans and the Austria-Hungarians and become a modern, developed force. Due to WW1 ending with a Central Powers victory and fascism being contained to Italy and the Third French Republic in this timeline and communism being wiped out, national liberation movements never occur in Africa. The Central Powers and their satellite states surviving post-WW1 means that democracy is ironically more secure than OTL. The Brittanians use trickery and deceit to seize the former Confederate States of South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina and integrate them [South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina] into British North America during a time of political chaos and instability in the USA, along with [the Brittanians] taking New England. This forces the Germans to make Texas into the Kingdom of Texas ruled by a side branch of the Hohenzollerns and the Japanese to seize the American West Coast, which [the American West Coast] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the Pacific States of America. The Japanese also seize Hawaii and [the Japanese] restore the Hawaiian House of Kawānanakoa-ruled semi-constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii in Hawaii. The influence of the Manchuria based division of the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground warfare division, the Imperial Japanese Army protecting the South Manchuria railway in Manchuria from Han Chinese bandits, the Kwangtung Army along with the IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] in Manchuria means that the Japanese are [the Japanese] able [the Japanese] to [the Japanese] push out Zhuolin and the Fengtian Clique in Manchuria while [the Japanese] increasing the influence of the Qing Imperial Court and the indigenous Manchu nobility, aristocracy and royalty in Manchuria, [the Japanese decreasing the influence of the Fengtian Clique and increasing the influence of the Qing imperial court within post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] leading to it [post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] becoming the pre-WW2 and WW2-era, post-1932, pre-1945 Imperial Japanese protectorate of the Qing imperial family, the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled and monarchist, Manchurian nationalist, anti-communist, Pan Asian political party Concordia Association-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional imperial royal parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s, with the Great Qing Empire's last Emperor, Aisin-Gioro \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, [Pu-Yi] becoming [what Pu-Yi becomes after the formation of Manchukuo] the first Emperor [Pu-Yi after Manchukuo's formation] of Manchukuo like in OTL. After Pu-Yi's death in [when Pu-Yi dies in this timeline] around 1970, his [Pu-Yi's] younger half brother Aisin-Gioro Puren becomes [Puren in this timeline] the Emperor of Manchukuo, [Puren in this timeline] followed by his [Puren's] son, Aisin-Gioro Yuzhang after his [Yuzhang's] death in [when Puren died] 2015, who [Yuzhang] intends [Yuzhang] to [Yuzhang] make his [Yuzhang's] daughter, Jin Xin Empress of Manchukuo upon his [Yuzhang's] death. The Cantonese statesman, diplomat and calligrapher Zheng Xiaoxu is the first Prime Minister of Manchukuo like in OTL, followed by the Manchurian general, warlord and politician Zhang Jinghui like in OTL, followed by Hu Qili, then Jiang Zemin. The armed Wing and thus the combined armed forces of the Fengtian Clique formed from Zhuolin's bandit forces and what remained of the Manchu Bannermen and the Qing New Army in Manchuria after the Xinhai Revolution, the National Pacification Army, [the National Pacification Army] becomes a modern, well equipped military force under the watchful eye of the Kwangtung Army with help from the Imperial German Army and Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces. The National Pacification Army eventually becomes Manchukuo’s combined armed forces, the Manchukuo Imperial Army after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria becomes Manchukuo with Fengtian Clique and pro-China unification elements within the NPA being discredited, given extended sentences of leave to Nationalist China or the restored Ming dynasty, or otherwise removed in various ways. Police units in Manchuria nominally operating under the Beiyang Government's control but in reality under the Fengtian Clique's control also become the main law enforcement agency of Manchukuo, managing the central police department responsible for all police in Manchuria after Manchuko’s formation, with a Maritime Police to combat smuggling along with cracking down on smuggling and maintain maritime security within Manchurian waters, first under the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security and then under the General Directorate of Security Affairs, the Manchukuo Police after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria. Zhuolin's eldest son and his [Zhuolin's] heir to the leadership to the Beiyang Clique and thus of post-Xinhai Revolution, the pro-KMT, pro-Chinese unification, anti-Japanese Zhang Xueliang, [Xueliang] is [Xueliang] sent [Xueliang] to the restored Ming dynasty after Zhuolin's death via [Zhuolin's death] having his [Zhuolin's train] bombed, [Xueliang being sent to the restored Ming dynasty] in 1928. The New People's Society, a political organ [the New People's Society] that [the New People's Society] was [the New People's Society] designed [the New People's Society] to spread the Chinese government's [Reorganized Government of the Empire of China's] ideas to the Chinese public and [the New People's Society] mobilize economic and military support for the Chinese Reorganized Government and Japan, while [the new People's Society] training future civil servants, sending Chinese students to Japan, giving medical services to remote villages, providing disaster relief, establish free tea houses, promoting Han Chinese art and pilgrimages to Confucian temples, as well as discussing political events in their radio stations and official newspaper, the New People's Daily with the core values emphasized were Confucian virtues, familial piety, respect for authority, and devotion to scholarship, [the New People's Society] proves useful in getting the Chinese people to [the Chinese people] support the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and Japan, [the New People's Society] becoming the Han Chinese equivalent of the Concordia Association. When Yat-Sen's more famous student, the Cantonese revolutionary turned corrupt politician and then dictator who was Stalin’s puppet in China, Jiǎng Jièshí, who [Jièshí] was [Jièshí] better known as [Jièshí’s more famous alias] “Chiang Kai Shek”, [Jièshí/\\"Chiang\\"] [\\"Kai-Shek\\"/Jièshí] attempts to [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek \\"in this timeline] seize control over both the KMT and Nationalist China and [Kai-Shek in this timeline] launch the 9 July 1926 – 29 December 1928 military campaign launched by the Kuomingtang's armed wing and thus the Nationalist Chinese combined armed forces, the National Revolutionary Army against both the Fengtian Clique and the Beiyang Government to reunify China, the Northern Expidition like in OTL, [Kai-Shek in this timeline attempting to seize control of Nationalist China and launch the Northern Expedition like in OTL] he [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] is [\\"Kai-Shek\\"/Jièshí in this timeline] instead [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] shot dead [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] by a disgruntled Cantonese citizen and the ruling pro-Cantonese independence, anti-Chinese unification faction dominating the Legislative Yuan, [the Legislative Yuan’s ruling pro-Cantonese independence faction] retakes power after Kai-Shek's death and [the Legislative Yuan’s ruling pro-Cantonese independence faction] calls off the Northern Expedition. The Northern Expedition failing unlike in OTL allows Nationalist China, Manchukuo the Beiyang Government and the Great Japanese Empire to [Nationalist China, Manchukuo, the Beiyang Government and the Great Japanese Empire] survive post-1947 into the later half of the 20th century, the 21th century and beyond. A short war between the Central Powers and the Canadian-based Brittanians, a Soviet rump republic and the North African-based Fourth French Republic in exile from around 1939-1947 which is this story's version of the unprecedented catastrophe that assaulted the earth in which meteors rained down across the world, bringing severe destruction to many cities known as the Invertia [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku] leads to the Japanese seizing Australia and New Zealand along with [the Japanese] participating in the liberation of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Burma from the British colonial occupation of the British Raj. Pakistan restores the Sunni Muslim Uzbek-Mongolian Imperial House of Babur-ruled Turko-Mongol khanate and Islamic sultanate of the Mughal Empire as its [Pakistan's] government after its [Pakistan's] liberation and [Pakistan] also takes Jannu and Kashmir. India proper becomes a federation of restored Muslim princely states, Muslim tribal duties and Muslim Kingdoms under the rule of the Uzbek Sunni Muslim Asaf Jahi dynasty ruling over Hyberdad. The Japanese also still liberate Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and East Timor from French and English colonial occupation but make Indochina into a federation of Muslim sultantes, tribal duties and local Kingdoms. The unified military forces of post-WW2 Japan in OTL, controlled by the Japanese Ministry of Defense with the Japanese Prime Minister as commander-in-chief, without offensive warmaking capabilities but with an inherent right to self-defense, the Japanese Self Defence Forces, [the JSDF] are [the JSDF] still formed in this timeline, but only as a defence force within the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils The Brittanians still develop the Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise]-powered humanoid war machine mechs standing at an impressive height of four to five meters, equipped with Landspinners, ingenious self-propelled roller skates [Landspinners] affixed to their ankles, [the land spinners] enabling agile mobility and rapid speeds across diverse terrains, capturing data via the remarkable Factsphere Sensors encased within a protective layer of armor,[the Factsphere Sensors] can [the Factsphere Sensors] be [the Factsphere Sensors] retracted to heighten system sensitivity, ensuring the utmost precision and accuracy,[the Factsphere Sensors] endowed with thermographic capabilities and an array of other data-collection functions, all seamlessly collated in real-time, along with having the respective units' respective cockpits in the respective units' prominent 'hump back', a self-contained control center [the cockpit] from which the mech is expertly piloted, [the cockpit] having the ability to be ejected in case of an emergency known as [the name of the mechs] Knightmare Frames, [Code Geass], [Brittania still developing the Knightmare Frames] in around 1955 like in canon Code Geass but Japanese spies steal the designs for the Knightmare Frames and mass produce their [the Japanese's] own, with German and Austria-Hungarian spies doing the same.

The excerpt should focus on a then four year old Issei being [Issei] trained by his [Issei's] father [Nobuyuki as Gorou] in both Saiyan and East Asian Earth martial arts and battle techniques in a restored Capsule Corp device that creates a mysterious dimension with a time-compressed nature, making the flow of time vastly different compared to the flow of time outside of the chamber, a Hyperbolic Time Chamber [DBZ] with a then-heavily pregnant with Kunō Achika in this story as Miki and a somewhat amused Irisivel with the both then one year old Chloe and Illya in her [Irisivel's] arms, [a pregnant Achika as Miki and Irisivel with Chloe and Illya I'm her arms] watching them [Nobuyuki as Gorou and Issei] train. Young Issei, still somewhat naive and innocent [young Issei] asks why he [young Issei] needs to do that kung-fu stuff [martial arts] so early since he [young Issei] is [young Issei] pretty smart for his [young Issei's] age, [young Issei] having [young Issei] inherited both Bulma's and Wùfàn's high intellect and intelligence in this story, [young Issei] having created several innovative gadgets and devices out of boredom which [Issei's inventions] were [Issei's inventions] later stolen by Soviet and KKK spies within Japan looking for tech to steal, with the Soviet and Brittanian ambassors at the Conference of Vienna later presenting the details of Issei's inventions to the world as proof of Japanese imperialism, which resulted in further sanctions on Brittania from Germany and Austria-Hungary and key Soviet government officials dying mysteriously from unknown causes due to the leaders of the Central Powers knowing who the true inventor [Issei] of the tech stolen by the Klan and the Soviets was Nobuyuki as Gorou then replies that brains don't always win everything and that a little strength is sometimes necessary, [Nobuyuki as Gorou] giving the example of the Japanese seizure of the American West Coast in the 1920s and the subsequent formation of the Pacific States of America after Confederate revivalists and KKK members in California slaughtered Japanese citizens and attempted to take the Japanese concession in San Francisco, lead on greedy Blue Dogs and corrupt American soldiers. Young Issei frowns for a moment before getting it, [young Issei] remembering reading in a library about the division of America by Brittania and the Central Powers and how Brittania tried to take the entire world. Nobuyuki as Gorou proceeds to train Issei in a few practice martial arts Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here.","completion":"In the serene expanse of the Hyōdō family's sprawling private yard, partitioned off from the curious eyes of the world by towering ancient trees, Issei, a mere child of four, stood opposite his father, Nobuyuki, who was disguised as Gorou. The air was filled with an unusual tranquility, broken only by the distant laughter of Illya and Chloe as Irisivel, with her maternal elegance, watched over them. Miki, pregnant and radiant, observed the scene with a gentle smile, her hands resting on her swelling belly that carried the future crown princess of Japan, Kunō. \\"Alright, Issei,\\" Nobuyuki began, his voice low and encouraging, \\"We'll start with the basics. Focus on your stance.\\" Issei, with the earnestness only a child could muster, mimicked his father's position. They were inside the restored Capsule Corp's Hyperbolic Time Chamber, a relic of a more tumultuous time, now serving as a training ground for the young Saiyan prince. The gravity was slightly increased, a challenge set by Nobuyuki to hone Issei's physique beyond human limits. \\"Why do I need to do this, Dad?\\" Issei panted after a series of punches aimed at the air, his small brow furrowed in confusion. \\"I'm smart, right? Can't I just invent stuff and be like... like Mom?\\" Nobuyuki knelt, meeting his son's eye level, the pride in his glance unwavering. \\"Brains are vital, Issei,\\" he replied, ruffling his son's hair affectionately. \\"But there are times when strength speaks when words don't. Remember the Pacific States? How we had to stand our ground?\\" Issei nodded, the gravity of his father's words slowly dawning on him. He remembered the tales, the nights filled with stories of heroism, of defiance against a world that sought to claim their sovereignty. \\"Yeah... I remember,\\" Issei said, a newfound determination in his voice. He squared his shoulders, imitating his father's stance with improved accuracy. \\"Okay! I can do this!\\" Nobuyuki smiled, a true smile that reached his eyes. \\"That's my boy.\\" As the training commenced, Issei threw himself into the movements with all the enthusiasm his young heart could muster. Each punch cut through the air with increasing speed, each kick a testament to his growing strength. Nobuyuki guided him with a patient hand, correcting his form, teaching him the flow of ki within his body, tapping into the latent Saiyan power that coursed through his veins. Achika, from her vantage point, watched her son's progress with pride swelling in her heart. Beside her, Irisivel, with both Illya and Chloe now asleep in her embrace, shared a knowing glance with her. \\"This is just the beginning, isn't it?\\" Achika mused aloud, her gaze never leaving her son. \\"Yes,\\" Irisivel replied, her eyes reflecting a myriad of untold stories. \\"A beginning of something great. He has the heart of a Saiyan and the soul of a protector. He'll change the world someday.\\" The sun began its descent, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, a breathtaking backdrop to the day's end. As the training wrapped up, Nobuyuki hoisted Issei onto his shoulders, the child's laughter echoing through the backyard, a sound as pure as the bond they shared. In that moment, the complexities of the world they belonged to - a world brimming with hidden magic, ancient politics, and interstellar conflicts - seemed a distant concern. For Nobuyuki, Gorou, and the Hyōdō family, these quiet, shared experiences were their true strength, a foundation unshakeable by the trials that awaited them. And young Issei, with his heart full and spirit unbridled, was at the center of it all, a beacon of hope for a future only they could shape."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's look at each context briefly: 1. **\\"Teen Titans\\" (2003) Cartoon Show:** The line \\"..Time is not on your side..\\" delivered by Slade to the Teen Titans during an episode is memorable because it encapsulates the urgency and the seemingly insurmountable odds the heroes face. Slade, as a formidable and psychological antagonist, often pushes the Titans to their limits, making their confrontations tense and their resolutions rewarding. Moments of high stakes and emotional tension stick with us, especially when they challenge beloved characters. 2. **\\"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\\":** When Niccolò Machiavelli asks Ezio, \\"..What are you going to do?..\\" as he prepares to go to Rome, it's a pivotal moment in the narrative. This question isn't just about the immediate plan of action but touches on deeper themes of leadership, legacy, and the moral complexities of their fight against the Borgia family. In video games, where the player is actively involved in the story and its outcomes, impactful dialogue often resonates more because you are part of the decision-making process, embodying the character's challenges and triumphs. 3. **\\"Persona 4 Golden\\":** The line \\"..Don't kid yourself..\\" spoken by Adachi to Yu Narukami occurs during a crucial encounter that tests the protagonist's values and the themes of truth versus self-deception that run through the game. \\"Persona 4 Golden\\" is lauded for its character development and the deep, personal connections players form with its cast. Moments like these, where characters confront uncomfortable truths, are memorable for their emotional weight and the way they challenge the player's understanding of the narrative. Remembering these lines can be due to several factors: - **Emotional Engagement:** Each moment carries significant emotional weight, whether it's the urgency of stopping a villain, facing moral dilemmas, or confronting a twisted reflection of oneself. Emotional engagement makes memories stick. - **Narrative Significance:** These lines are at points of high narrative significance, marking turning points, revelations, or deep character insights. - **Repetition and Relevance:** If you've watched, played, or thought about these scenes multiple times, the repetition reinforces the memory. Additionally, their thematic relevance to broader life questions might also make them more memorable. - **Personal Connection:** Perhaps there's something in the themes, characters, or outcomes of these situations that you personally relate to or find particularly compelling. In essence, the combination of emotional resonance, narrative importance, personal engagement with the medium, and possibly the relatability of the themes contributes to why these lines are memorable to you."},{"prompt":"(On the outskirts of Mondstadt City…) Natsuki: “Ow!

In storytelling, whether it's a game, show, or movie, impactful moments are designed to be memorable. They often involve significant character decisions, revelations, or conflicts, which can make them stand out in your memory. 2. **Emotional Engagement:** You likely had an emotional response to these moments. Emotions play a huge role in memory formation. The more emotionally engaged you are with a piece of content, the more likely you are to remember specific details, including lines of dialog. 3. **Repetition or Reflection:** If you've revisited these scenes multiple times or discussed them with friends, this repetition reinforces the memory. Additionally, thinking deeply about the themes or character arcs may also make specific lines more memorable. 4. **Unique or Striking Phrasing:** Sometimes, the way a line is written or delivered makes it stick in your mind. This can be due to the use of unusual phrasing, the timing of the delivery, or the vocal performance of the character. When combined, these lines form a new sentence that carries a sense of urgency and challenge: \\"...Don't kid yourself...time is not on your side....what are you going to do?..\\" This combined sentence may resonate with you personally or remind you of a common theme across different narratives you enjoy: the concept of facing up against inevitable challenges, the pressure of time, and the importance of action in the face of adversity. Your mind might be making a connection between these themes across different media, recognizing a universal challenge faced by characters: the need to make crucial decisions quickly. This synthesis of lines from different sources into a coherent, thematic message could reflect your own interests or concerns, making it particularly memorable for you."},{"prompt":"(On the outskirts of Mondstadt City…) Natsuki: “Ow!

The stage is uniquely set up to mimic a high school chemistry lab rather than the usual musical guest setup.* **ANNOUNCER** (Voiceover) Ladies and gentlemen, give a warm welcome to tonight’s host, the one and only, Walter White! *Thunderous applause as WALTER WHITE, in his signature pork pie hat and sunglasses, strides confidently onto stage, a hint of Heisenberg in his demeanor.* **WALTER WHITE** (Grinning, removing sunglasses) Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Yes, it’s me, Walter White. Some of you might know me by another name, but for legal reasons on network television, tonight, I’m just a humble high school chemistry teacher. *Light laughter from the audience.* **WALTER WHITE (CONT'D)** I have to say, hosting SNL is quite the change from my day-to-day. Instead of cooking meth... we’re cooking up some comedy! Although, I’ve been told the pressure here to deliver is just about the same. *Laughter and applause.* **WALTER WHITE (CONT'D)** Now, I know what you’re thinking, and no, I didn’t bring any samples. Tonight, we’re dealing in a different kind of chemistry – the chemistry between performers and the audience! *He moves to a lab setup on stage, complete with beakers and colored liquids.* **WALTER WHITE (CONT'D)** You see, in comedy, much like in chemistry, it’s all about the right elements coming together. Take your base of actor, add in a script, carefully mix in timing, and… Voila! You get laughter, hopefully. *Walter tries to mix some chemicals as if doing an experiment, but it just results in a harmless poof of smoke.* **WALTER WHITE (CONT'D)** (Recovering with a laugh) Or, you know, sometimes you just get a cloud of smoke. That’s showbiz! *The audience laughs. Clear chemistry glass clinks lightly as he moves things aside.* **WALTER WHITE (CONT'D)** But tonight, we’ve got a formula that can’t miss. We've got special appearances that are sure to react well with our audience. And believe me, no RV was required in the making of tonight’s show. *He takes a more serious tone, reminiscent of his Heisenberg persona.* **WALTER WHITE (CONT'D)** Let’s remember, though, in both chemistry and live television… safety first. We wouldn’t want any unexpected reactions, would we? *He laughs it off, becoming the friendly Walter again.* **WALTER WHITE (CONT'D)** Tonight, we have a great show for you! Musical guest, The Crystal Ships, will be here. See? We’re keeping the theme going. So stick around, and let’s break some night live! *The audience erupts into cheers and applause as Walter gives a nod and a smirk, channeling his iconic character while the show transitions smoothly into its first skit.* **CUT TO:** *The first skit begins, promising an unforgettable night filled with laughter, surprises, and a touch of chemistry, both literal and metaphorical.* **END OF PART 1.**"},{"prompt":"Why do I remember these lines?.. 1.

Here’s a breakdown of why this might be: # Contextual Impact Each of these lines comes from a pivotal moment in their respective stories, where the characters are facing significant challenges or turning points: - **Teen Titans**: Slade's warning reflects an immediate and urgent challenge, emphasizing the concept of time running out. - **Assassin's Creed Brotherhood**: Machiavelli’s question to Ezio reflects a moment of planning and decision-making, highlighting the importance of strategic thinking in the face of adversity. - **Persona 4 Golden**: Adachi's confrontation is a moment of personal challenge, emphasizing self-reflection and the complexity of human nature. # Emotional and Psychological Resonance - **Urgency and Decision Making**: The combined phrases underscore the inevitability of time, the importance of decisions, and the introspection required in critical moments. This resonates with anyone who has faced important life decisions under pressure. - **Challenge and Response**: They encapsulate a universal cycle of being challenged and responding to that challenge, which is relatable to most people. It's a reminder that action is required in the face of adversity. - **Self-Reflection**: Especially with phrases like \\"Don't kid yourself,\\" the quote invites introspection about one's own illusions or denials. # Memorable Characters and Scenarios - The characters involved in these moments are memorable, each with a distinct personality and a strong narrative arc. Their interactions are not just plot points but are also reflective of deeper themes, such as duty, destiny, and self-awareness. - The scenarios from which these lines are drawn are highly dramatic and often represent a culmination of events, making them stand out in the memory. # The Combined Echo When these lines are combined, they create a sort of poetic guidance that transcends the context of each individual story. It feels like a universal maxim on dealing with life's challenges, urging one to face reality, acknowledge the constraints of time, and take decisive action. This universality and applicability to various life situations could be why the combined statement is memorable to you. Finally, your affinity for these narratives—whether through gaming or watching—can imprint certain moments or lines in your memory, especially if you found them particularly striking or if they resonated with you on a personal level during your first experience with them."},{"prompt":"(On the outskirts of Mondstadt City…) Natsuki: “Ow!

The iconic intro music plays, slightly warped.* **Announcer (V.O., unnervingly cheerful):** “Ladies and gentleman, live from the edge of the universe, it’s Saturday Night Liiiiive! With your host, the sovereign of the black hole sun and all that is remotely unholy, Zozubel!” *The audience erupts into applause, a mixture of excitement and an unnerving chill that hugs the air. There, standing confidently, is Zozubel. A figure cloaked in shadows, with eyes that seem to hold galaxies — ones that never knew the warmth of a sun.* **Zozubel:** “Thank you, thank you! It’s great to be here on such a trivial, insignificant speck of the cosmos. Really puts things in perspective. Now, I know what you’re thinking — ‘Zozubel, why SNL? Don't you have universes to devour?’ And to that, I say, everyone needs a hobby.” *Cut to a clip of Zozubel trying knitting, but instead of yarn, it’s the fabric of reality, resulting in several dimensions collapsing on themselves.* **Zozubel (continuing):** “I’ve watched from afar, seen your politics, your culture, your ceaseless wars over which fast food chain reigns supreme. And I thought, ‘Why not lighten the mood before the eventual heat death or, fingers crossed, my grand consumption of all you hold dear?’” *The audience gives a nervous laugh, a few uncertain claps echo around. Zozubel smiles, if one could call the stretching of the void a smile.* **Zozubel:** “Tonight, we've got a great show for you! The musical guest is the Sirens of Titan, performing a hit song from their latest album, ‘Eons of Silence.’ It’s a real foot-tapper if vibration through the vacuum of space is your sort of thing.” *Zozubel gestures, and eerie, cosmic music plays, hinting at the otherworldly performance to come.* **Zozubel:** “But first, let’s get real. When I was asked to host, I was given three rules: No devouring the audience, no altering the fabric of time during live sketches, and absolutely no bringing existential dread to the forefront of human consciousness.” *Zozubel pauses, a beat passes.* **Zozubel:** “So, we’re down to two rules.” *The camera zooms in slightly, the studio's lights dim even further, if at all possible. Zozubel’s presence seems to fill the room, a tangible weight of eons and infinity pressed into the confines of a New York studio.* **Zozubel:** “Let's kick things off with a little sketch we like to call ‘Office Politics in the Void.’ Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned from watching your species, it’s that no matter the universe, the void, or the dimension, there’s nothing more universally dreaded than a Monday morning meeting — except, perhaps, my eventual return to claim what is left of your world.” *The audience laughs, more at ease. The camera pans to the stage as the setting changes, transitioning into the first sketch where Zozubel, still imposing yet now oddly wearing a tie, presides over a dire meeting with cosmic beings who bicker over interstellar budget cuts and the proper allocation of nebula resources, all while trying to navigate the photocopier from the literal age of dinosaurs.* **Zozubel (in character):** “Look, Z’thara, I get that consuming stars is your thing, but the paperwork needs to be filed in triplicate. Also, who drank my almond milk? It was clearly labeled with the runes of eternal despair.” *As the audience dives into laughter, the screen fades to black, signaling the next wave of comedy and cosmic horror to come.* *Fade Out.* *To be continued…*"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic!

Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells.

As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment.

The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up where a new look with a digital online video style is coming to the block mid April, Also the slogan shown in the Feb promo is official, Also, 3 of the KWB shows are going, with CL and G&G staying, Also, Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer and Viva Pinata are joining the lineup, this also happens from mid April, Pokemon is also being swapped for Pokemon Horizons: The Series Thread Title: CW4Kids New Digital Look & Lineup Shuffle – Mid-April Madness Incoming! 💥📺 ToonMasterJay: Mid-April’s gonna hit us with a serious 1-2 punch, folks! We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I’d list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV’s case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world’s first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these “peaceful” Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a convo in late April where TL is going away, G&G is coming to 4Kids TV to take its place, Also Kirby is leaving the CW in late May, our currently 24/7 channel exclusive alien is taking its place Thread Title: Late April Shakeup: Tomodachi Life Departing, G&G and Alien Surprise Incoming! 🌌📺 ToonMasterJay: Heads up, team! Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging. Rest assured, “Gloopy and Glitter” and our new extraterrestrial addition are just the beginning of more exciting things to come. Stay tuned and keep watching — adventure is always around the corner! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up where it is FE, also a user wonders if 4Kids will try an Alien Hour in the summer (with Gees in-between them) Thread Title: Summer Lineup Tease: Is An Alien Hour on the Horizon? 🛸🌟 AnimationAficionado: With all the cosmic shuffling happening, it’s “Four Eyes!” turning the page for our alien-themed entertainment on 4Kids TV. Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for. But here’s a thought – what if 4Kids is plotting an Alien Hour for the summer? Imagine back-to-back alien adventures, capped off with “The Gees” in between as a quirky interlude. That’d be something! DigitalToonFan: An Alien Hour would be epic! “Four Eyes!”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, plus “The Gees” shorts? Sounds like a perfect blend of cosmic chaos and laughter. It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer. Plus, it’d give “Four Eyes!” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a fantastic platform to shine even brighter. Fingers crossed 4Kids goes for it! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We love seeing your excitement and speculation about what’s coming up! While we can’t confirm or deny the plans for an Alien Hour just yet, rest assured that we’re always looking for innovative ways to entertain our audience.

DigitalToonFan: “My Dad the Spy” and “Vampire Hunters” caught my eye! Genius move getting into those major anime titles. “Chaotic: Reloaded” is like meeting an old friend with a new face. And “Redakai,” that’s going to be interesting. Exciting times! AnimationAficionado: WOW! “Demon Slayer” as “Vampire Hunters” and “Spy X Family” turning into “My Dad the Spy”? Only 4Kids can pull off such daring dubs. But seriously, “Chaotic: Reloaded” has me all amped up. Can’t wait to see what’s new and what’s stayed the same.

And “World of Quest” sticking around is great news. Also, intrigued by how “Vampire Hunters” will resonate with the audience. PokeNostalgia101: The decision to include major titles like “Demon Slayer” and “Spy X Family” in a form more accessible to the 4Kids audience is a bold and potentially brilliant move. Mixing well-loved series with their unique dubs could really set the fall schedule apart. LyokoLover: The diversity in this lineup is incredible! From sequels and reboots to fresh dubs of hit anime, it looks like CW4Kids is aiming to cater to a wide audience this fall. Also, can’t help but wonder how “Code Lyoko” will interact with these new additions. ComicStripKid: “Redakai” and “Pokémon Horizons” will be great for keeping that action-adventure vibe going strong, while “My Dad the Spy” could add a wholesome yet thrilling family dynamic. Plus, those shorts like “The Owl” are perfect palate cleansers between heavier shows. ToonTalker91: “Vampire Hunters” could be the wildcard of the bunch, considering its origin. Also, super curious about how “Chaotic: Reloaded” plans to evolve the storyline. Either way, this fall is setting up to be game-changing for CW4Kids!

Write a convo suprised Quest is back, but figured it was coming since it replaced TL’s webpage on 4kids.tv in mid April Thread Title: World of Quest Makes a Triumphant Return! 🌍⚔️ QuestFanatic88: Holy smokes, did anyone else catch that “World of Quest” is back on the CW4Kids fall lineup?! I’m genuinely surprised but kind of saw it coming after “Tomodachi Life” vanished and WoQ took over its webpage on 4kids.tv back in April. It was like a silent drumroll! ToonArchivist42: Yeah, I noticed the webpage swap too! It was pretty low-key, but definitely hinted at something big. “World of Quest” has that unique blend of humor and adventure that’s been missing. Glad CW4Kids is bringing back some fan favorites. DigitalScribe: The subtle hints were there with the webpage transition, but seeing “World of Quest” officially back is exciting! The show always had potential; it just needed the right moment to shine again. Looks like that time is now. NostalgiaKnight: It makes you wonder if they’ve been planning this return for a while or if fan demand swayed their decision. Either way, glad to see some strategy behind this nostalgia revival. “World of Quest” has a dedicated fanbase that’s been waiting for this. ComicRelief: TBH, I almost lost hope it would come back, but that sneaky webpage change in April perked my eyebrows. It’s like they were testing the waters to gauge our reaction. Well played, CW4Kids, well played. Excited to see where they take the storyline this season! AdventureAwait: This is the best news! “World of Quest” has that rare mix of epic quests and laugh-out-loud moments. It’s the comeback I didn’t know I was waiting for. Really curious to see if they’ll introduce new characters or stick with the classic crew. PixelPundit: Super psyched for the return, but also intrigued by how it’ll fit with the rest of the CW4Kids lineup. It’s quite diverse this year. “World of Quest” brings a specific flavor that complements the existing shows. Kudos to whoever’s curating the fall schedule! QuestLoreMaster: As a longtime fan, seeing Quest back feels like rediscovering a lost treasure. The character dynamics, the quirky humor, everything! I’m here for it all. Also, props to CW4Kids for that sly hint through the webpage change. It built up the perfect amount of anticipation. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled to see so much enthusiasm for “World of Quest” making its return to CW4Kids! Rest assured, we’ve been listening to your feedback and are just as excited to bring back this beloved series. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in store. The adventure is just beginning!

They’ve just announced that “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” will be joining the lineup in June. Plus, they’re extending the block to end at 12:30pm now. Feels like early Christmas to me! RetroCartoonLover: This is definitely prep for the fall season. They’re testing waters with “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” before making them staples. The extended hours are a nice touch too—it shows they’re committed to offering more content. Can’t wait! DigitalScribe: We literally just got the spring lineup and new look. The ink hasn’t even dried, and here they are, mixing things up again with new additions and extending the schedule. I’m not complaining, though—it keeps things interesting. AnimationAficionado: Adding “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” into the mix is a masterstroke. Both shows have their unique fanbases and will definitely pull in viewers. Plus, the extra half hour could mean more variety in programming, which is always a win in my book. NostalgiaKnight: Is anyone else thrilled about “World of Quest” making a comeback? That show was a gem that deserved more spotlight. And “Four Eyes!” has that fresh, quirky vibe that could really resonate with the audience. CW4Kids is on a roll here. ToonTalker91: The block extension to 12:30pm is curious. It’s like they’re pacing themselves for a larger strategy, possibly eyeing to dominate the Saturday morning cartoon space even more. More shows mean more diversity in content, and I’m all for that. PixelPundit: As much as I love this news, I wonder how they’ll pace the introduction of “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” within the current lineup. Will other shows get less airtime, or are they planning to overhaul the schedule entirely? Either way, interesting times ahead for CW4Kids. QuestFanatic88: It’s amazing to see “World of Quest” getting the love it deserves. June can’t come soon enough! But yeah, this move right after unveiling the spring lineup? CW4Kids is keeping us on our toes, ensuring we’ve always got something new to look forward to. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm surrounding our upcoming additions and the block extension!

Write a forum convo wondering what the website looked like in the first few weeks","completion":"Thread Title: Nostalgia Dive - CW4Kids Website Evolution 🖥️💫 RetroWebMaster: Hey all! I’ve been on a nostalgia kick lately, and it got me thinking about the CW4Kids website during its initial weeks after the transition from Kids WB. With all the rapid changes and updates that followed, my memory’s a bit foggy. Does anyone remember what it looked like in those first few weeks? PixelHunter: Oh, I remember being super curious and checking it out day one! It was pretty basic at first — mostly a placeholder feel? Like, it had the new CW4Kids logo but still featured a lot of the Kids WB design elements. They didn't have the account and points system up yet, or games, just the show pages really. ToonArchivist42: Yeah, @PixelHunter’s right. It was this interesting mishmash of the old Kids WB style with the CW4Kids logo slapped on it. Listings for show times were there, but you could tell they were gearing up for something bigger. The site felt more like a “Coming Soon” banner than anything. DigitalScribe: And let’s not forget those “Under Construction” icons that seemed to pop up in various sections. I specifically remember clicking on a link for one of the shows, and instead of getting any detailed info, it just redirected me to a generic “Stay Tuned!” page. NostalgiaKnight: Took them a while to get the streaming function working smoothly too. Initially, they teased upcoming show clips and trailers, but half the time, the video player would buffer or crash. Guess they hadn’t anticipated the traffic surge from curious fans like us. WebWader: The most vivid memory for me was how the footer still said “© 2024 Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” for a bit, even though 4Kids was taking over. It really highlighted how sudden the transition felt and how much work was needed to make the website reflect the new direction. ComicStripKid: True, and remember how sparse the “Games” section was? Just a couple of placeholders for what would eventually become a pretty decent collection of mini-games tied to the shows. Those first few weeks definitely had a “work in progress” vibe. ToonTalker91: Does anyone else miss the character polls and trivia they eventually added? Those were fun community features that made frequent visits to the site more engaging. In the early days, it felt like they were still figuring out how to recreate that interactive experience Kids WB was known for. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Hey everyone! Love seeing the nostalgia and recollections about the CW4Kids website’s early days. It was indeed a work in progress as we hustled to blend the old with the new and improve the user experience. Thanks for sticking with us through those transitions, and we’re always working to bring you the best in toon entertainment, both on-screen and online!

From those first few tentative steps to the more polished look we see today. Anyone else remember the gradual changes on-screen? ToonArchivist42: Oh, definitely! Initially, it was like they just slapped the CW4Kids logo onto the existing Kids WB framework. The overlays were pretty basic, mostly static images with the show titles and airing times. It had a placeholder vibe, similar to the website at the time. RetroAnimator: Yeah, and remember how the show promos still used the Kids WB style voiceovers and music tracks? It took a while before CW4Kids developed its unique audio identity to match the new visual branding. Those first few weeks were a real mixed bag. GraphicGeek: The big change came with the \\"Signed On/Computer\\" phase when they introduced digital motifs resembling the updated website interface. The top of the screen mimicked browser tabs, with clickable icons (for environment immersion, of course) that transitioned into promos. It was a clever way to make everything feel more interactive, even if viewers couldn't actually \\"click\\" anything on their screens. ToonTalker91: And let’s not skip over the transition animations! Initially, they were quite simplistic, with straightforward cuts from one segment to another. But with the digital overhaul, we got those animated “mouse clicks” and even loading symbols as transitions. It added a layer of fun, modernizing the viewing experience and making channel idents more dynamic. WebWader: Right, the loading symbols were a cute touch! Also, the introduction of dynamic lower thirds was a game-changer. Instead of static texts, we got these animated banners that better captured the attention, offering show trivia, next-up info, and even interactive prompts, mirroring online behaviors - a nod to how digitally savvy the target audience had become. NostalgiaKnight: Can’t forget about the seasonal updates! They really started leaning into changing the on-screen graphics for holidays or special events. Halloween would have spooky bats flying across the screen, Christmas had snowfall effects... It helped set CW4Kids apart by creating an engaging atmosphere that changed throughout the year. DigitalScribe: It’s fascinating to see how on-screen branding evolved from something so basic to an interactive, digitally inspired interface that connected the TV experience with online navigation cues. Kudos to the CW4Kids team for innovating and keeping the branding fresh and relatable to a young audience. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Love to see the appreciation for the evolution of our on-screen branding! Our aim has always been to merge the engaging, dynamic elements of digital platforms with traditional TV viewing, making every watch session unique and enjoyable.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"Send me an article about social anxiety","completion":"# Understanding Social Anxiety: A Comprehensive Overview In a world that often emphasizes social connectivity and interaction, individuals who experience social anxiety find themselves facing unique challenges. Social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia, is a condition characterized by an intense fear of social situations where the person feels they may be judged, scrutinized, or embarrassed. It goes beyond typical shyness, manifesting in physical symptoms and overwhelming distress that can significantly hinder one's ability to function in daily life. This article delves into the nuances of social anxiety, shedding light on its causes, symptoms, and available treatments. What is Social Anxiety Disorder? Social anxiety disorder is a common psychological condition marked by an abnormal fear of social or performance situations. People with this disorder fear that actions or behaviors associated with their anxiety will be negatively evaluated by others, leading them to feel embarrassed, humiliated, or rejected. This fear can be so intense that it interferes with work, school, and other activities, severely restricting the person’s lifestyle and even leading to complete social isolation. Causes and Risk Factors The exact cause of social anxiety disorder is complex and likely involves a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Some of the risk factors include: - **Family history:** Individuals with a family history of social anxiety disorder or other anxiety disorders are at a higher risk of developing the condition. - **Brain structure:** A structure in the brain called the amygdala, which plays a role in controlling the fear response, may be overactive in people with social anxiety disorder. - **Negative experiences:** Children who experience teasing, bullying, rejection, ridicule, or humiliation may be more prone to social anxiety disorder. Additionally, family conflicts or sexual abuse can be contributing factors. - **Temperament:** Children who are shy, timid, withdrawn, or restrained when facing new situations or people may be at a higher risk. Symptoms The symptoms of social anxiety disorder can vary in severity and may include both emotional and physical signs such as: - Intense fear of being in situations where one might be judged - Worrying about embarrassing oneself - Fear of interacting with unfamiliar people - Avoiding social situations to a degree that limits one's activities or disrupts one's life - Physical symptoms including blushing, sweating, trembling, a rapid heart rate, and gastrointestinal issues Treatment Social anxiety disorder is a treatable condition, and several effective treatment options exist. The primary approaches include psychotherapy, medications, or a combination of both. - **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for social anxiety disorder. CBT focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns, exposing the individual to their fears in a controlled manner, and teaching coping skills. - **Medications:** Antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are commonly used to treat social anxiety disorder. Beta-blockers and anti-anxiety medications might also be prescribed to help control physical symptoms. Coping Strategies In addition to professional treatment, individuals can adopt various coping strategies to manage symptoms: - Practice stress management techniques such as meditation, deep-breathing exercises, and mindfulness. - Gradually expose yourself to social situations rather than avoiding them. - Join a support group to connect with others facing similar challenges. - Focus on personal hobbies and interests that bring joy and satisfaction. Social anxiety disorder presents significant hurdles, but with the right treatment and strategies, individuals can navigate social situations more comfortably and lead fulfilling lives. It's essential for anyone who believes they might be experiencing social anxiety to seek professional help. Early intervention can make a substantial difference in the outcome and quality of an individual’s life."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The latter sector has two sub-sectors: one produces means of production needed to produce consumption goods, and another produces other means of production.4 ‘In order to be auto-centered an economy must contain production at all of these levels and especially at the two highest levels of reproductive importance’ which involve the production of the means of production (Ougaard, 1982: 389). In addition, the different sectors and subsectors must be articulated with one another, even if an auto-centred economy does not have to produce all the products in all the three major sectors (ibid.). In the core, accumulation is autocentric: ‘production of capital goods and the production of consumption goods’ are articulated with one another, and foreign relations of central economies ‘are subject to the requirements of this determinate articulation’, and therefore generally ‘labor’s pay can follow the progress of productivity’5 (Amin, 2009: 272). In contrast, the peripheral economy tends to be dominated more by the production of consumption goods and less by other types of production. A significant level of production in all the sectors/sub-sectors mentioned earlier is absent in a typical peripheral economy. An industrializing peripheral economy often assembles imported industrial parts, as it happens in many SEZs and Mexican maquiladoras. Or, some countries produce IT support, including in call-centres, for advanced countries. A major part of the periphery’s IT industry is actually similar to its manufacturing assembly, where low-paid engineers such as those in India ‘develop components or subpackages/assemblies/programmes that go into the final products made and marketed by US companies’ (Bidwai, 2003). Bidwai says that ‘a good proportion of the sub-programmes in Windows 95 and 98 were developed by Indian engineers. But it’s Mr Bill Gates who skimmed off the profits!’ (ibid.) The lack of articulation between the main sectors blocks the periphery’s economic development. Such an economy is also extraverted: internal linkages are not stronger than external ones. It remains export-oriented, or its production caters to the local elite (production of goods and services that workers and small-scale producers do not normally consume). Such a production system has, generally, little incentive, or need, to raise wages/income of the masses who are not the consumers of such a system (see Richards, 1986; De Janvry, 1981). Indeed, distribution of income/wealth does feed back into the nature of production system. So, apart from the peripheral society where capitalism exists mainly in the sphere of exchange relations, there are two other types of peripheral society from the standpoint of production. In one type, there is capitalist production of consumer goods for the domestic (and foreign) market. This society is ‘dependent on the import of means of production for its consumer industry’. Another type of peripheral society ‘produces the means of production for its consumer industry’ at least to a significant extent, but it is still ‘dependent on imports of the means of production for its own producer goods industry’ (Ougaard, 1982: 394). And ‘since this dependency is located at the highest level of reproductive importance it can be expected to lead to an intensification of the conflicts with foreign capital’ (ibid.). What are the implications of all this for the peripheral state then? The state has a role in facilitating the transition from the first lower level of peripheral economy (capitalism in circulation, export of raw materials) to the form where ‘a society can produce the means of production for its producer goods industry’ and where this production covers a significant part of the society’s needs and is reasonably integrated internally (Ougaard, 1982: 395—6). How well the state plays such a developmental role depends on a number of processes. These include which dominant class or class-strata (e.g. landlords, merchants, domestic capitalists, foreign capitalists, and so on) control state power; whether and to what extent the state can exercise autonomy vis-à-vis mutual competing capitalists and vis-à-vis conflicts between capital-owners and ground-rent receivers (landowners); and how well the state protects its capitalist (and small-scale) production from the globally operating law of value. The developmental state has reflected on some of these processes.6 Amin (2009: 273) says that ‘[i]n the periphery, constant adjustment in economies have to be made in relation to the economies of the core’. So, in the core, ‘[t]he state . . . fulfils the conditions that make possible autocentric accumulation and the dependence of foreign relations on the logic of that accumulation’, but in contrast, the peripheral state . . . does not control local accumulation. It is thus objectively, an instrument for the adjustment of the local society to the requirements of globalized accumulation, the tendencies of which are determined by the requirements of the center. This difference explains why the central state is a strong state and while the peripheral state is a weak state, says Amin. But to the extent that the periphery lacks economic dynamics associated with auto-centric production, the question is why? We need to turn to the very nature of capitalism in the periphery in terms of class relations and to imperialism as a form of class relation and explore their implications for the peripheral state. 2 Peripheral social formation dominated by ‘backward’ capitalism7 Whether in the global periphery or in the more economically advanced world, a society is capitalist if it is characterized by the dominance of the following features: commodity production, means of production confronting labour as capital, a class of nominally free labourers forced to work for a wage because they do not own sufficient means of production, and operation of the law of value (law of competition based on socially necessary labour time). When such conditions exist, then capitalist relation exists, at least in the sense of FSL. In FSL, lots of workers are hired to work for long hours on an enormous amount of raw materials with limited or little labour-shedding technical change used. There is hardly any place in the world which is not dominated by capitalism at least in this sense. While FSL is based on the appropriation of absolute surplus value, RSL is based on the appropriation of relative surplus value. RSL has all the features of FSL and an additional attribute — that is, the systematic tendency towards technical change. Then there is also hybrid subsumption, which is post-feudal and which does not involve wage labour; it involves exploitation by merchants and moneylenders of direct producers (see Das, 2017a: 340—90 for a detailed discussion on the subsumption of labour by capital). Marx says in the Appendix to Capital 1: FSL is ‘directly a process of the exploitation of the labour of others. . . . It is the general form of any capitalist production process’ (i.e. production process under the rule of capitalist social relation) (Marx, 1977b: 1019). As the more general form of capitalist production, it ‘can be found in the absence of the specifically capitalist mode of production’, which is RSL for Marx (ibid.). The two forms of subsumption are similar in the sense of the general conditions for capitalism. But a dialectical approach also sees a difference. Contrary to what Marx might (sometimes) have believed, the transition to RSL is not automatic, even if there is a long-term tendency towards the RSL, associated with a rise in the ratio of constant to variable capital (Das, 2017a). To me, the transition from FSL to RSL is contingent on the balance of power between the basis classes, which is expressed in the struggle of workers against the regime of long hours (and low wages). Class struggle (potential or actual) conditions the extent to which capitalists who are competing with one another cut costs of production through (a) the use of technology aimed at increasing labour productivity or (b) for example, FSL. And certain objective conditions can promote or constrain class struggle, and accordingly the transition to RSL can be quicker or be a prolonged process and geographically uneven. Advanced capitalism is characterized by a successful transition to RSL and the resultant economic dynamism. This transition has been partly possible because of two factors such as colonial transfer, and class struggle against capitalists using labour for long hours and low wages. However, in most parts of the periphery (and especially in its vast rural areas and in small towns), the situation is a little different. There are the necessary conditions for capitalist relations. In some areas, property owners may be formally subsuming labour (e.g. capitalists use highly vulnerable and low-cost labour, including labour that is reproduced outside of capitalist reproduction as in indigenous communities).8 In other areas, especially in selected large cities and villages near them, there do exist real subsumption. The state is connected to both, to the localized existence of RSL and to the obstacles to the transition to it. Let’s begin with localized existence of RSL. Backward countries can adopt technology from already-advanced countries, and this means that [t]he development of historically backward nations leads necessarily to a peculiar combination of different stages in the historic process’ leading to combined development ‘by which we mean a drawing together of the dif-ferent stages of the journey, a combining of the separate steps, an amalgam of archaic with more contemporary forms. (Trotsky, 2008: 4-5) By borrowing technology already developed in an advanced country, a peripheral country can skip some stages in the development process, thus producing combined development: The development of backward countries is characterized by its combined character. In other words, the last word of imperialist technology, economics, and politics is combined in these countries with traditional backwardness and primitiveness. (Trotsky, 1940) This means that in an LDC, technologically backward ‘peasant land-cultivation’ can coexist with an industry which ‘in its technique and capitalist structure’ is ‘at the level of the advanced countries’, and in certain respects it can even surpass industry in advanced countries (ibid.: 8). The peripheral capitalist state can be responsible for real subsumption, both by working with, and independently of, imperialism. Partly prompted by the struggles of the masses against low living standards and partly prompted by geopolitical rivalries (sometimes overlain by nationalist chauvinism with religious overtones), and in some cases, to protect their own capitals against imperialist competition (law of value), capitalist states in the periphery can give various forms of assistance to national capitals to introduce modern technologies and to increase labour productivity. This process may signal some kind of transition from formal to real subsumption.”翻译为中文","completion":"1 在外围地区生产力的非协调发展 在一个经济体中，一个部门生产消费品，另一个部门生产生产资料。后者有两个子部门：一个生产生产消费品所需的生产资料，另一个生产其他生产资料。 “为了实现自我中心化，一个经济体必须包含所有这些层次的生产，尤其是在涉及生产生产资料的两个最重要层次上”（Ougaard，1982：389）。此外，不同的部门和子部门必须相互协调，即使一个自我中心化的经济体不必在所有三个主要部门中生产所有产品（同上）。 在核心地区，积累是自我为中心的：‘生产资本货物和生产消费品’相互协调，中心经济体的外国关系‘受到这一特定协调要求的制约’，因此通常‘劳动者的薪酬可以随着生产力的进步而增加’（Amin，2009：272）。相比之下，外围经济往往更多地被消费品生产所主导，其他类型的生产较少。典型的外围经济缺乏前面提到的所有部门/子部门中的大量生产。一个工业化的外围经济体常常组装进口的工业零件，就像许多特殊经济区和墨西哥的马基拉多拉工厂那样。或者，一些国家为发达国家提供IT支持，包括呼叫中心服务。外围地区的IT产业实际上与其制造业组装类似，其中像印度这样低薪的工程师“开发美国公司制造和市场销售的最终产品中所使用的组件或子包装/组装/程序”（Bidwai，2003）。Bidwai表示，“Windows 95和98中相当一部分子程序是由印度工程师开发的。但是赚大钱的是比尔·盖茨！”（同上）。 主要部门之间缺乏协调阻碍了外围地区的经济发展。这样的经济体也是外向型的：内部联系不如外部联系紧密。它仍然以出口为导向，或者它的生产服务于当地精英（生产工人和小规模生产者通常不消费的商品和服务）。这样的生产系统通常很少有激励或需要提高大众的工资/收入（参见Richards，1986；De Janvry，1981）。确实，收入/财富的分配反过来又会影响生产系统的性质。 那么，所有这些对外围国家又有什么意义呢？国家在从初级外围经济体（流通领域的资本主义，原材料出口）转型到“一个社会可以为其生产者商品工业生产生产资料”的形式，在这里，这种生产覆盖了社会的重要部分需求并且在内部相对完整地整合（Ougaard，1982：395-6）方面，具有促进作用。国家在发挥这种发展作用上的表现取决于许多过程。这些包括哪一个主导阶级或阶层（例如地主、商人、国内资本家、外国资本家等）控制国家权力；国家在何种程度上可以对相互竞争的资本家以及资本所有者和地租接收者（地主）之间的冲突行使自主权；以及国家如何保护其资本主义（和小规模）生产免受全球价值法则的影响。发展型国家已经反思了其中的一些过程。 Amin（2009：273）说，在外围，“经济必须不断调整以适应核心经济体的需求”。因此，在核心，“国家……满足了实现自我为中心积累的条件，并使外国关系依赖于该积累的逻辑”，相比之下， 外围国家……不能控制本地积累。因此，它客观上是一个工具，用于将本地社会调整到全球化积累的要求，这些要求由中心的需求所决定。 Amin表示，这种差异解释了为什么中心国家是强国家而外围国家是弱国家。但是，鉴于外围缺乏与自我为中心生产相关的经济动力，问题在于为什么？我们需要转向外围地区资本主义的本质，即阶级关系，并探讨帝国主义作为一种阶级关系形式对外围国家的影响。 2 由“落后”资本主义主导的外围社会形态 无论是在全球外围还是在经济上更为发达的世界，如果一个社会的特点是商品生产、生产资料作为资本对抗劳动、一群名义上自由的劳动者因为不拥有足够的生产资料而被迫为工资工作，以及价值法则（基于社会必要劳动时间的竞争法则）的运作，那么这个社会就是资本主义的。当这些条件存在时，至少在FSL的意义上，资本主义关系就存在了。在FSL中，大量工人被雇佣工作很长时间，处理大量原材料，使用有限或很少的劳动削减技术变革。世界上几乎没有哪个地方不是至少在这个意义上被资本主义所主导的。虽然FSL是基于绝对剩余价值的占有，RSL则是基于相对剩余价值的占有。RSL具有FSL的所有特点，并有一个额外属性——即系统向技术变革的倾向。然后还有混合征服，这是后封建主义的，不涉及工资劳动；它涉及商人和放债者对直接生产者的剥削（见Das，2017a：340-390对资本对劳动的征服的详细讨论）。 马克思在《资本论》第一卷附录中说：FSL“直接是他人劳动剥削的过程……。这是任何资本主义生产过程的普遍形式”（即在资本主义社会关系统治下的生产过程）（Marx，1977b：1019）。作为资本主义生产的更普遍形式，它“可以在没有特定资本主义生产方式的情况下被发现”，对马克思来说这是RSL（同上）。两种征服形式在资本主义的一般条件意义上是相似的。但辩证法也看到了一个区别。 与马克思（有时）可能相信的相反，转向RSL并不是自动的，即使存在向RSL的长期趋势，与固定资本与可变资本比率的上升相关联（Das，2017a）。对我来说，从FSL向RSL的过渡取决于基本阶级之间的权力平衡，这在工人反抗长时间（和低工资）工作制度的斗争中得到了体现。阶级斗争（潜在或实际）条件了资本家之间通过（a）使用旨在提高劳动生产率的技术或（b）例如FSL来降低生产成本的程度。而某些客观条件可以促进或限制阶级斗争，相应地，向RSL的过渡可以是更快的，也可以是一个漫长的过程，并在地理上不均衡。 先进的资本主义特征是成功向RSL的过渡和由此产生的经济活力。这种转换在一定程度上是因为两个因素，例如殖民地转移，以及阶级斗争反对资本家使用长时间和低工资的劳动力。然而，在外围的大部分地区（尤其是在其广阔的农村地区和小城镇），情况有些不同。存在资本主义关系的必要条件。在一些地区，产权所有者可能在形式上征用劳动（例如，资本家使用高度脆弱和低成本的劳动力，包括在资本主义再生产之外再生产的劳动力，如在土著社区中）。在其他地区，尤其是在一些大城市和它们附近的村庄中，确实存在真正的征服。国家与RSL的局部存在和向它的过渡的障碍都有联系。 让我们从RSL的局部存在开始。落后国家可以从已经先进的国家采用技术，这意味着 “历史上落后国家的发展必然导致不同历史阶段的特殊结合”，从而导致联合发展“我们的意思是不同阶段的集合，分步骤的结合，古老形式与更现代形式的融合。” （Trotsky，2008：4-5） 通过借用在先进国家已经发展的技术，一个外围国家可以跳过发展过程中的某些阶段，从而产生联合发展： “落后国家的发展的特点是其联合性质。换句话说，帝国主义技术、经济和政治的最新成果在这些国家与传统的落后性和原始性相结合。” （Trotsky，1940） 这意味着在一个不发达国家，技术落后的“农民土地耕作”可以与一个在技术和资本主义结构上“处于先进国家水平”的工业共存，并且在某些方面甚至可以超过先进国家的工业（同上：8）。 外围资本主义国家可以负责真正的征服，无论是与帝国主义合作还是独立于帝国主义。部分受到群众对低生活标准的斗争的推动，部分受到地缘政治竞争的推动（有时叠加有民族主义的沙文主义和宗教色彩），并且在某些情况下，为了保护自己的资本免受帝国主义竞争（价值法则）的影响，外围的资本主义国家可以提供各种形式的帮助给国家资本引进现代技术和提高劳动生产率。这一过程可能标志着从形式征服向真正征服的某种转变。"},{"prompt":"请将“To the extent that technological change in the periphery will create a market for products for the domestic (and foreign) companies and/or will increase relative surplus value, a part of which will be shared by imperialist countries, imperialism may not be inimical to technological change in the periphery. So a fundamental role of the peripheral state can be to mediate technological transfer from imperialist to imperialized countries: [O]fficials of the states with a subordinate position in the imperial state system will insist on the transfer of technological, management and marketing knowhow to strengthen the ability of their capitalists to compete and for them to make profit, extract rents and serve their ‘national interest.’ (Veltmeyer and Petras, 2015: 168) There are limits to technical change in the periphery, however. This is partly because of its insertion into the imperialist world market and because of its relatively low level of cultural development (e.g. low level of education) (Trotsky, 2008: 4—5). As we have seen, for Trotsky, it is not just that capitalist development is uneven but also that capitalist relations are combined with pre-capitalist relations (e.g. serfdom). This is an advance over the perspective that focuses only on the unevenness of capitalist development (Harvey, 2008b/1982; Smith, 2008). Trotsky’s perspective, however, has a problem: it homogenizes the capitalist class relation; it treats the different forms (and stages) of capitalism — subsumptions of labour — as one. It thus abstracts from the ways in which the balance of power between the basic classes intervenes in the transition from one form of capitalist class relation (FSL) to another form (RSL). Thus it abstracts from the obstacles to the transition within capitalism. In peripheral countries, it is not just that capitalism is combined with pre-capitalist relations existing in specific areas. The matter is more complex than that. FSL can be a prolonged process when/where there is a massive army of un- and under-employed men and women whom the state does not have adequate support for nor does it do much to diminish the size of the reserve army. It is worth quoting Marx (from Capital 3) again: the reserve army or the relative over-population is the reason why, on the one hand, the more or less imperfect subordination of labour [read: FSL] to capital continues in many branches of production, and continues longer than seems at first glance compatible with the general stage of development. This is due to the cheapness and abundance of disposable or unemployed wage-labourers, and to the greater resistance, which some branches of production, by their very nature, render to the transformation of manual work into machine production. (Marx, 1894: 167; italics added) This situation, I argue, holds specifically in the periphery, even though Marx did not think about this. In peripheral capitalism, there is a vast industrial reserve army of labour which owes its origin to colonialism and colonial state and is expanding under ‘new imperialism’ through, for example, primitive accumulation. During classical imperialism (colonialism), as widely known (Bagchi, 1976), a vast reserve army was created through deindustrialization caused by: coercive methods, including tariff on imports from colonies; cheaper machine-made exports to colonized countries; and primitive accumulation (dis-possession of small property owners, including peasants). In some parts of the ex-colonized world, the state actually took steps to break up the communal-type property into private property in order to stop ideas about communal (communist) property from taking root, and Marx commented on this (Anderson, 2010: 219—20). And, under current, ‘new imperialism’,9 primitive accumulation is also happening on a big scale, thanks to the extra- economic (state-enabled) dispossession: this has been expanding the reserve army.10 The reserve army is also expanding because of cheap exports from imperialist countries and lack of financial support from peripheral capitalist states for their relatively weak, small-scale property owners against international competition. The massive and expanding reserve army of labour (never fully captured by official statistics) provides capital an ample opportunity for FSL, including of those who are oppressed on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, age, caste, and the like. On the other hand, the reserve army adversely affects the bargaining power of employed labour and makes struggle against formal subsumption rather difficult. Many peripheral countries specialize in relatively low-skilled activities such as farming, mining and production of light industrial goods, as mentioned in the last section. These are potentially the ‘branches of production’, which ‘by their very nature, can render relative resistance ‘to the transformation of manual work into machine production’ (Marx, 1894: 167). The sporadic introduction of advanced techniques could strengthen not only the use of serfdom and other forms of extra-economic relations (as Trotsky says), but also relations of FSL that he fails to recognize. To enhance their competitiveness and to appropriate more surplus value, enterprises using advanced technology themselves and/or the small-scale firms they outsource some of their production to can — and do — resort to a regime of long hours (and low wages), just as they can and do use unfree labour. Besides, the peripheral state lacks the resources needed for systemic technological change. One reason for this, apart from colonialism-induced under-development, is the ongoing imperialistic transfer of resources in the form of debt payment, repatriation of profit, and so on from the periphery (Roberts, 2019). The peripheral capitalist state also lacks the resources because it is not allowed by imperialist institutions, which are obsessed with marketization and privatization, to use the resources where they may exist. As a result, it fails to develop the productive forces through technological change to any significant extent and on a nation-wide scale. It also fails to adequately augment the social wage through pro-labour policies in a way in which such policies can substantially increase the power of labour vis-à-vis private employers and enable them to demand a regime of higher wages. Such a regime, within limits, would contribute to an articulation between production and consumption. But the peripheral state fails to secure such a regime. The system of capitalist class relation in the periphery then is marked by three main forms and logics of accumulation: accumulation by dispossession of direct producers (i.e. ongoing primitive accumulation); accumulation by exploitation of workers (proletarians and semi-proletarians), with its two moments of formal and real subsumption; and accumulation by class differentiation (Figure 11.1). These three forms of accumulation coexist with the (remnants of) pre-capitalist class relations and with class relations of hybrid subsumption. And then all these social relations of production are shaped by imperialism (see the next section). These different relations may exist in different areas within a peripheral country or even inside a given city-region, thus indicating uneven and combined development. Given this complexity of class relations, which impact the peripheral state, the latter has a certain specificity relative to the state in advanced capitalism. An implication of the subsumption perspective is that the development process in the world in general and in peripheral capitalism in particular, with its attendant class relations, must be seen as multiple transitions: from pre-capitalist relations to hybrid subsumption, from pre-capitalist and hybrid relations to FSL under capital, from FSL to RSL, and finally, from the latter to cooperative labour of associated producers, nationally and at a global scale. So the role of the peripheral state must be seen in relation to these transitions. The democratic revolution against pre-capitalist relations has remained aborted or incomplete in the periphery, and this is in part because of capitalists’ and their state’s fear of anti-feudal struggle becoming the struggle against capitalism and the state. Massive concentration of land in the hands of a few and feudal remnants in the sphere of social relations of production as well as cultural and political spheres exist, which are partly behind undemocratic state practices (these issues are elaborated in Section 6). 3 Imperialism retarding development of productive forces in the periphery Imperialism today It is true that the periphery, like the core, is experiencing globalization. But there is a difference: for the periphery, globalization is generally expressed as imperialism. The multiple states system emphasized in the globalization literature is a system where some states are imperialist and other states are imperialized (see Callinicos, 2009). I define imperialism not mainly in terms of the unequal relations in the realm of exchange or in terms of income inequality between rich and poor countries, and so on, nor in terms of the bullying behaviour of rich states, although all these are important. I define imperialism fundamentally as the capitalist class relation at the international scale (i.e. at the level of the world market) supported by the powerful states of advanced countries. Imperialism is the economic exploitation of proletarians and of semi-proletarians (and other small-scale producers) of the peripheral capitalist countries by the monopolistic industrial-financial businesses of advanced countries, whereby the powerful, highly militarized states of advanced capitalist countries subjugate the militarily weak states of peripheral countries to ensure the business interests of the monopolies of advanced countries which are undergoing relative capitalist decay as seen in falling profitability. If the capitalist state, seen from a national angle or in the abstract, secures the general conditions for the capitalist accumulation, then the capitalist state, seen internationally (i.e. from the standpoint of imperialist world market and seen more concretely), secures the general conditions for accumulation of value in the hands of the imperialist businesses.”翻译为中文","completion":"在外围地区，技术变革将为国内（和外国）公司创造产品市场和/或增加相对剩余价值，帝国主义国家将分享其中的一部分，因此帝国主义可能不会对外围的技术变革持敌对态度。因此，外围国家的一个基本职能可以是调解技术从帝国主义国家向被帝国主义化国家的转移： “在帝国主义国家体系中处于从属地位的国家的官员们将坚持转移技术、管理和市场营销的知识，以增强他们的资本家竞争的能力并使他们获利、提取租金并服务于他们的‘国家利益’。” （Veltmeyer和Petras，2015：168） 然而，外围的技术变革是有限制的。这部分是因为它融入了帝国主义世界市场，以及由于其相对较低的文化发展水平（例如教育水平低）（托洛茨基，2008：4—5）。正如我们所见，对于托洛茨基来说，不仅资本主义发展是不均衡的，资本主义关系也与前资本主义关系（例如农奴制）相结合。这是对仅关注资本主义发展不均衡性的视角的一种超越（哈维，2008b/1982; 史密斯，2008）。然而，托洛茨基的视角存在一个问题：它将资本主义阶级关系同质化；它将资本主义的不同形式（和阶段）——劳动的征用——视为一体。因此，它抽象地考虑了基本阶级之间的权力平衡如何介入从一种资本主义阶级关系（FSL）向另一种形式（RSL）过渡的问题。因此，它抽象地考虑了资本主义内部过渡的障碍。在外围国家，不只是资本主义与特定区域存在的前资本主义关系相结合。事情比这更复杂。 当/在存在大量未就业和就业不足的男性和女性的大军，且国家没有足够的支持也没有做太多减少这支后备军规模的情况下，FSL可能是一个长期的过程。再次引用马克思（来自《资本论》第三卷）的话是有价值的：相对过剩人口或后备军 是为什么在一方面，在许多生产部门中，劳动对资本的或多或少不完善的从属关系[读作：FSL]继续存在，且持续的时间比乍看之下与总体发展阶段兼容的时间要长。这是由于可用或失业的工资劳动者的廉价和丰富，以及一些生产部门由于其本质对手工劳动向机械生产的转换提供了较大的抵制。 （马克思，1894：167；斜体增加）这种情况，我认为，特别适用于外围，即使马克思没有考虑到这一点。在外围资本主义中，存在着一个庞大的工业后备劳动力大军，其起源于殖民主义和殖民状态，并在“新帝国主义”下通过例如原始积累而扩大。在经典帝国主义（殖民主义）期间，众所周知（Bagchi，1976），通过去工业化创造了一个庞大的后备军，这是由于：强制手段，包括对殖民地进口征收关税；向被殖民国家出口更便宜的机器制造产品；以及原始积累（剥夺小产权所有者，包括农民）。在一些前殖民地世界的部分地区，国家实际上采取了措施将公社型产权分割为私有财产，以阻止关于公社（共产主义）财产的想法扎根，马克思对此发表了评论（Anderson，2010：219—20）。而在当前的“新帝国主义”下，也在大规模发生原始积累，这得益于额外的经济（国家启用的）剥夺：这一剥夺正在扩大后备军。后备军也因来自帝国主义国家的廉价出口和外围资本主义国家对其相对弱小的小规模产权所有者对抗国际竞争的财政支持不足而扩大。 庞大且不断扩大的劳动力后备军（官方统计从未完全捕捉到）为资本提供了充分的机会进行FSL，包括那些基于性别、种族、族裔、年龄、种姓等被压迫的人们。另一方面，后备军不利地影响了受雇劳动力的议价能力，使得反对形式征用的斗争相当困难。许多外围国家专门从事相对低技能的活动，如农业、采矿和轻工业品生产，如上一节所述。这些可能是“生产部门”，“从它们的本质来看，可以提供相对抵制‘手工劳动向机械生产的转化’”（马克思，1894：167）。 先进技术的零星引入不仅可能加强农奴制和其他形式的超经济关系的使用（正如托洛茨基所说），而且还有他未能认识到的FSL关系。为了提高竞争力和占有更多的剩余价值，使用先进技术的企业本身和/或他们将部分生产外包给的小规模公司可能会——而且确实会——采用长时间（和低工资）的制度，就像他们可以并且确实使用非自由劳动一样。此外，外围国家缺乏进行系统性技术变革所需的资源。除了殖民主义引起的发展不足之外，一个原因是持续的帝国主义式资源转移，比如债务支付、利润汇回等从外围（罗伯茨，2019）。外围资本主义国家还因为不被帝国主义机构所允许，后者痴迷于市场化和私有化，无法使用可能存在的资源，因此缺乏资源。结果，它未能通过技术变革在任何重大程度上和全国范围内发展生产力。它也未能通过亲劳动政策充分增加社会工资，以这样一种方式来实质性提高劳动力与私人雇主的力量，并使他们能够要求更高工资的制度。这样的制度，在一定限度内，将有助于生产和消费之间的联系。但是，外围国家未能确保这样的制度。 因此，外围的资本主义阶级关系体系以三种主要形式和积累逻辑为特征：通过对直接生产者（即持续的原始积累）的剥夺进行积累；通过对工人（无产者和半无产者）的剥削进行积累，其包括形式征用和真实征用的两个时刻；以及通过阶级分化进行积累（图11.1）。这三种积累形式与（前资本主义阶级关系的）残余以及混合征用的阶级关系共存。然后，所有这些生产社会关系受到帝国主义的影响（见下一节）。这些不同的关系可能存在于一个外围国家的不同地区，甚至在一个特定的城市区域内，从而表明不均衡和联合发展。鉴于这种复杂的阶级关系影响外围国家，后者相对于先进资本主义中的国家有其特定性。 征用视角的一个含义是，世界总体上和外围资本主义特别是其随附的阶级关系的发展过程，必须被视为多重转型：从前资本主义关系到混合征用，从前资本主义和混合关系到资本下的FSL，从FSL到RSL，最后，从后者到全国和全球范围内的联合生产者的合作劳动。因此，必须根据这些转型来看待外围国家的角色。反对前资本主义关系的民主革命在外围一直被中断或不完整，部分原因是因为资本家及其国家担心反封建斗争变成反对资本主义和国家的斗争。土地在少数人手中的大量集中和社会生产关系以及文化和政治领域的封建残余存在，这在一定程度上是不民主国家实践背后的原因（这些问题在第6节中有详细阐述）。 3 帝国主义在外围阻碍生产力的发展 今日的帝国主义 确实，像核心一样，外围也正在经历全球化。但有一个区别：对于外围来说，全球化通常表现为帝国主义。全球化文献强调的多国家体系是一个某些国家是帝国主义国家而其他国家是被帝国主义化的国家的系统（见Callinicos，2009）。我不主要以交换领域的不平等关系或富国和穷国之间的收入不平等等来定义帝国主义，也不是以富国的欺凌行为来定义，尽管这些都很重要。我根本上将帝国主义定义为国际规模上的资本主义阶级关系（即世界市场层面）由先进国家的强大国家支持。帝国主义是先进国家的垄断工业金融企业对外围资本主义国家的无产者和半无产者（及其他小规模生产者）的经济剥削，其中先进资本主义国家的强大、高度军事化的国家将军事上较弱的外围国家置于从属地位，以确保先进国家的垄断企业的商业利益，这些企业正在经历相对资本主义衰退，如利润率下降所见。如果从国家角度或抽象地看资本主义国家保障了资本主义积累的一般条件，那么从国际上看（即从帝国主义世界市场的立场和更具体地看）资本主义国家保障了价值在帝国主义企业手中积累的一般条件。"},{"prompt":"请将“The imperialist state partly functions as the executive committee for different fractions of imperialist capital operating in the periphery. More accurately, the imperialist state, the state of imperialist countries, along with the various international state-like institutions it controls, is the executive committee for managing the common affairs of the different fractions of imperialist capital that are involved in accumulation within the periphery (and the core countries). The state in the periphery is, more or less, the junior partner of the imperialist state. The state is a fundamental aspect of the imperialist relation (it is surprising that Lenin’s (1916) Imperialism hardly mentions the state). Operating globally, the state of advanced countries turns imperialist in order to help its big business. To remain globally competitive and increase its rate of profit, imperialist capital makes use of political-military and diplomatic control over natural resources, markets for its goods and services, and over labour11 of different LDCs which have militarily and economically weaker states. Imperialist capital also makes use of non-military processes such as ideas and practice of cooperation and assistance. So peripheral societies become the battle ground for inter-imperialist rivalry, which can become bloody from time to time. Sometimes even if a peripheral country has nothing to offer (in terms of resources or markets), its location itself could be attractive to imperialism: Once the race of imperial territory began in earnest during the closing decades of the nineteenth century, it became necessary for strategic reasons to seize territories that were often of no value in themselves — indeed, that were often net recipients of state expenditure — but that were necessary in order to protect those territories that were of economic value. (Davidson, 2016: 226) Imperialist mechanisms and the peripheral state Imperialism, as imperialist-state-enabled world-scale accumulation, is driven by specific mechanisms. These have implications for the peripheral state. Protection of the capitalist rules of the game: In the global periphery, there is massive poverty which causes seething (molecular) anger against capitalism and imperialism. There can be a danger of the peripheral state weakening capitalist rules of the game. So the imperialist state has to guard the guardians (i.e. peripheral states) in reinforcing/defending the capitalist rules of the game globally and if necessary by creating conflicts among peripheral states and weakening any potential ‘solidarity’ among them.12 Indeed, as Wood (2005) has stressed, imperialist power must be exercised to make sure that states and peoples in the periphery, more or less, adhere to the rules of the capitalist market. This implies, among other things, that the ability of the peripheral state to control the market (or value) relations is limited because of imperialism. Even state-mediated redistribution of small amount of land to the poor is sanctioned by imperialist institutions on the ground that it is an infringement of private property, as happened in Zimbabwe.13 Response to capitalist decay in advanced capitalism: There is relative stagnation in imperialist countries with falling profitability (long-term fall in the rate of profit). The relative stagnation is seen in the fall in the growth of investment, including in research and development, in the fall in the rate of growth, and so on. Imperialism is fundamentally a manifestation of the decay of capitalism in the advanced countries and not necessarily because of wrong government policies of an advanced country (Lenin, 1916). On behalf of globally operating imperialist businesses, imperialist states seek to use the periphery to alleviate the effects of declining profitability and capitalist decay. They do this in many ways. Unequal trade: One is that the imperialist states compete with each other to make sure their own monopolies are able to use politically mediated access to the markets and resources of the periphery. Imperialism is about interimperialist rivalry, even if it is not always manifested: The drive to neutralise the breakdown tendency through increased valori-sation takes place at the cost of other capitalist states. The accumulation of capital produces an ever more destructive struggle among capitalist states. (Grossman, 1929) In response to the attempt of imperialist states to defend the competitive position of their big business, the peripheral countries may wish to protect their own economies. As Grossman (1929) says, ‘accumulation intensifies the drift to protectionism in the economically backward countries’. In this situation, the peripheral state will bear the consequences from the imperialist countries. Military intervention by imperialist states is one. Another is economic warfare: ‘the cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which’ an advanced country ‘batters down all Chinese walls’. With this mechanism, imperialist countries force the less developed countries’ ‘intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate’ (Marx and Engels, 1848: 16). While the state sustains commodity relations in various ways, it can enforce unequal exchange on behalf of the capitalist class operating under its own jurisdiction, where necessary. Imperialist states enforce unequal exchange in the world market. Colonialism/imperialism is an expression of this tendency. Unequal exchange happens in another way too. Given that c / v is higher in advanced countries than in poorer countries, the states of advanced countries and state-like institutions globally, by sustaining world trade, are actually complicit in the transfer of surplus in the form of ‘the tribute levied by finance capital’ and ‘high monopoly profits for a handful of very rich countries’ (Lenin, 1916) — from poor to rich countries. Here is Marx (1863): Profit can also be made by cheating, one person gaining what the other loses. Loss and gain within a single country cancel each other out. But not so with trade between different countries [peripheral countries, unlike core countries, depend more on unskilled labour]. . . . Here the law of value undergoes essential modification. . . . The relationship between labour days of different countries may be similar to that existing between skilled, complex labour and unskilled simple labour within a country.14 In this case, the richer country exploits the poorer one.15 ‘At advanced stages of accumulation’, as the rate of profit (and eventually, its mass) drops, ‘it becomes more and more difficult to valorise the enormously accumulated capital’, and, therefore, transfers of surplus value through trade ‘become a matter of life and death for capitalism. This explains the virulence of imperialist expansion in the late stage of capital accumulation’ (Grossman, 1929). An important unequal exchange is trade in agri-goods and natural resources. In the international division of labour, imperialist countries depend on raw materials produced in the periphery, and these must be produced and imported at extremely low prices, and this process in turn checks inflation in the imperialist countries (Patnaik and Patnaik, 2016). More specifically, certain use-values happen to be concentrated in what are peripheral countries. These use-values include crops produced in warmer climates (and these climate happen to be un-available in imperialist countries), oil, and minerals, including those needed for what is misnamed as a post-industrial economy (e.g. lithium needed for cell phones). To these use-values the big businesses of the North must have access at any cost, and this involves imperialist control over LDCs. This has an implication for the state: it is important that the capitalist state and a leading state maintain control over supplies of such scarce materials. To the extent that these tend be in LDCs, role of imperialism is crucial. A new round of primitive accumulation: An important strategy used by imperialist capital to respond to falling profitability is investing capital not in production but in a new round of primitive accumulation. A lot of capital goes to the periphery to buy up assets, including of small-scale producers and state- owned companies, and if necessary by using its own force and the force of its junior partner (peripheral state) (Harvey, 2005). By forcing the peripheral states to open up their economies, imperialist capital also buys up assets of peripheral business owners, thus symbolizing a new round of centralization of capital at the international scale. Cheap production: Apart from exploiting the periphery through unequal trade with advanced countries and a new round of primitive accumulation, imperialist capital makes use of cheap labour in the periphery. A massive reserve army allows FSL and production at a cheap cost. Marx (1894) himself says that when capital is invested in the less developed world, the rate of profit is higher there due to backward development, and likewise, because of the use of unfree labour such as ‘slaves, coolies, etc.’ Imperialist capital makes use of peripheral labour in at least two ways: export of productive capital to the periphery which results in production of goods and services by MNCs, including through joint ventures; and the production of commodities in the periphery through outsourcing. Outsourcing is a more recent mechanism than capital export. As John Smith (2016) shows, production through outsourcing ensures that a very small part of the sale price of the commodities remains in the periphery with the major part going to the hands of imperialist businesses involved in various parts of the commodity chain including shipping, sale, advertisement, insurance, finance, design, and so on. Whether through direct investment by imperialist businesses in the periphery or through outsourcing, imperialism involves the exploitation of labour of the periphery by imperialist capital. The peripheral state must support this. Imperialism is the objective condition under which the peripheral state, more or less, must work and reproduce the peripheral social formation not only as capitalist but also as imperialized. In fact, if any state in the periphery ever seeks to promote economic development, whether on the basis of capitalism or non-capitalist relations or some combination of the two (e.g. China), by regulating the global law of value in its national interest, and if significantly hurts the interests of imperialist economy or politics, then imperialist state knows how to discipline the peripheral state, including through lies and deception as well as coercion (military intervention aimed at regime change), and accusation that given peripheral countries go against the fundamental principles of democracy, free market, freedom, world peace, and so on.”翻译为中文","completion":"帝国主义国家部分充当在外围运作的各分支帝国主义资本的执行委员会。更准确地说，帝国主义国家，即帝国主义国家的政府，连同其控制的各种国际类国家机构，是为管理在外围（和核心国家）进行积累的各分支帝国主义资本的共同事务的执行委员会。外围的国家或多或少是帝国主义国家的初级合伙人。国家是帝国主义关系的一个基本方面（令人惊讶的是，列宁（1916年）的《帝国主义》几乎没有提到国家）。 在全球范围内运作的先进国家的国家变得帝国主义化，以帮助其大企业。为了保持全球竞争力和提高其利润率，帝国主义资本利用对自然资源、商品和服务市场以及不同最不发达国家（LDCs）的劳动力的政治-军事和外交控制，这些国家在军事和经济上都较为弱小。帝国主义资本还利用非军事过程，如合作和援助的理念和实践。因此，外围社会成为帝国主义间竞争的战场，这种竞争有时可能变得血腥。有时，即使一个外围国家没有什么可提供的（就资源或市场而言），其地理位置本身就可能对帝国主义具有吸引力： 一旦19世纪末帝国主义领土竞赛正式开始时，出于战略原因征服经常本身没有价值的领土就变得必要——实际上，这些领土经常是国家支出的净接受者——但为了保护那些具有经济价值的领土而变得必要。 （Davidson，2016：226） 帝国主义机制与外围国家 作为帝国主义国家启用的世界规模积累，帝国主义由特定机制驱动。这些对外围国家有着含义。 保护资本主义游戏规则：在全球外围，存在大量贫困，这引起了对资本主义和帝国主义的强烈（分子级）愤怒。外围国家削弱资本主义规则的风险可能存在。因此，帝国主义国家必须保护守护者（即外围国家）在全球范围内加强/捍卫资本主义规则，并在必要时通过在外围国家之间制造冲突和削弱它们之间可能的“团结”来实现。实际上，正如伍德（2005）强调的，必须行使帝国主义权力以确保外围的国家和人民或多或少地遵守资本主义市场的规则。这意味着，由于帝国主义，外围国家控制市场（或价值）关系的能力受到限制。即使是由帝国主义机构批准的对穷人进行小规模土地再分配也因为它侵犯了私有财产而受到制裁，就像在津巴布韦发生的那样。 对先进资本主义中的资本主义衰退的回应：帝国主义国家存在相对停滞，其利润率下降（长期利润率下降）。相对停滞体现在投资增长下降，包括研发投资减少，增长率下降等。帝国主义根本上是先进国家资本主义衰败的表现，这并不一定是因为先进国家错误的政府政策（列宁，1916）。代表全球运营的帝国主义企业，帝国主义国家寻求利用外围来缓解利润下降和资本主义衰败的影响。他们通过许多方式做到这一点。 不平等贸易：帝国主义国家互相竞争，确保自己的垄断企业能够通过政治斡旋获得对外围市场和资源的使用权。帝国主义是关于帝国主义间的竞争，即使它并不总是表现出来： 通过增加价值实现以避免崩溃倾向，是以牺牲其他资本主义国家为代价发生的。资本的积累产生了资本主义国家之间日益破坏性的斗争。 （格罗斯曼，1929） 为了回应帝国主义国家保卫其大企业竞争地位的努力，外围国家可能希望保护自己的经济。正如格罗斯曼（1929）所说，“积累加剧了经济落后国家保护主义的倾向”。在这种情况下，外围国家将承受来自帝国主义国家的后果。军事干预是其中之一。另一个是经济战：“商品的廉价是‘先进国家用以破除一切中国墙的重炮’。通过这种机制，帝国主义国家迫使不发达国家的‘对外国人的极度顽固的仇恨屈服’”（马克思和恩格斯，1848：16）。 虽然国家以各种方式维持商品关系，但如有必要，它可以代表在其管辖下运营的资本主义阶级，强制执行不平等交换。帝国主义国家在世界市场上强制执行不平等交换。殖民主义/帝国主义是这种趋势的表达。不平等交换还以另一种方式发生。鉴于先进国家的c / v高于较贫穷国家，先进国家的国家和全球性的国家类机构，通过维持世界贸易，实际上是共同参与了以“金融资本征税”和“为少数非常富裕的国家带来高垄断利润”的形式从穷国向富国转移剩余价值。以下是马克思（1863）的说法： 通过欺骗也可以赚取利润，一个人获得的是另一个人的损失。在一个国家内的损失和收益相互抵消。但不同国家之间的贸易不是这样[与核心国家不同，外围国家更多依赖于非熟练劳动]。……这里的价值法则发生了本质的修改。……不同国家间的劳动日的关系，可能类似于一个国家内熟练的、复杂的劳动与非熟练的简单劳动之间的关系。在这种情况下，较富裕的国家剥削了较贫穷的国家。‘在积累的高级阶段’，随着利润率（最终，其总量）的下降，‘为了实现巨额积累的资本变得越来越困难’，因此，通过贸易转移剩余价值‘对资本主义成为生死攸关的问题。这解释了资本积累后期帝国主义扩张的恶性’（格罗斯曼，1929）。 一个重要的不平等交换是农产品和自然资源的贸易。在国际分工中，帝国主义国家依赖于外围生产的原材料，这些原材料必须以极低的价格生产和进口，这一过程反过来又抑制了帝国主义国家的通货膨胀（帕特纳克和帕特纳克，2016）。更具体地说，某些使用价值恰好集中在现在所谓的外围国家。这些使用价值包括在较温暖的气候下生产的农作物（这些气候在帝国主义国家不可得），石油和矿产，包括被错误称为后工业经济所需的（例如手机所需的锂）。北方的大企业必须不惜一切代价获得这些使用价值的使用权，这涉及到对最不发达国家的帝国主义控制。这对国家有一定的含义：重要的是资本主义国家和领先的国家维持对这些稀缺材料的供应控制。鉴于这些往往存在于最不发达国家中，帝国主义的作用至关重要。 新一轮原始积累：帝国主义资本回应利润下降的一个重要策略是投资资本不是在生产中而是在新一轮的原始积累中。大量资本流向外围购买资产，包括小规模生产者和国有公司的资产，必要时使用自己的力量和初级合作伙伴（外围国家）的力量（哈维，2005）。通过迫使外围国家开放经济，帝国主义资本还购买了外围业主的资产，从而象征着国际规模上资本集中的新一轮。 廉价生产：除了通过与先进国家的不平等贸易和新一轮原始积累对外围进行剥削外，帝国主义资本还利用外围的廉价劳动力。庞大的后备军队允许FSL和廉价成本的生产。马克思（1894）本人说，当资本投资于不太发达的世界时，由于落后的发展，利润率在那里更高，同样，由于使用不自由劳动力，如“奴隶、苦力等”。帝国主义资本至少以两种方式利用外围劳动力：向外围出口生产资本导致跨国公司生产商品和服务，包括通过合资企业；以及通过外包在外围生产商品。外包是比资本出口更近期的机制。正如约翰·史密斯（2016）所示，通过外包生产确保商品销售价格的很小一部分留在外围，大部分进入参与商品链各个环节的帝国主义企业手中，包括运输、销售、广告、保险、金融、设计等。无论是通过在外围直接投资的帝国主义企业还是通过外包，帝国主义都涉及帝国主义资本对外围劳动力的剥削。外围国家必须支持这一点。 帝国主义是外围国家必须在其中工作并再生产不仅作为资本主义而且作为被帝国主义化的外围社会形态的客观条件。实际上，如果外围的任何国家曾试图促进经济发展，无论是基于资本主义还是非资本主义关系或两者的某种组合（例如中国），通过调节全球价值法则以维护其国家利益，并且如果这显著伤害帝国主义经济或政治的利益，那么帝国主义国家就知道如何约束外围国家，包括通过谎言和欺骗以及胁迫（旨在政权更迭的军事干预），以及指控给定的外围国家违反了民主、自由市场、自由、世界和平等基本原则。"},{"prompt":"请将“4 Class basis of the peripheral state, and peripheral state functions and form Broadly speaking, there are two main proprietary classes which hold state power in the periphery. One is the urban bourgeoisie, especially the larger- scale owners of capital operating nationally and increasingly engaged in international operations in part through collaboration with imperialist capital. The other major class is the class of large-scale landholders based in villages and small towns.16 In this class alliance or power bloc, urban capitalists are not merely dominant but also increasingly so.17 They demand state policies, including under both dirigisme and neoliberalism. It is the fundamental role of the state in the periphery, as it is in the core, to serve the capitalist class.18 During the initial decades of post-independence dirigisme, such a favourable relationship was often supported by not only the ideology of anti-imperialism but also the ideology of socialism (or socialistic patterns of society). The official names or constitutions of some states include the word ‘socialism’ or ‘socialistic’. These ideologies did inform state practice to some extent as revealed in state regulation of businesses and state protection of domestic business vis-à-vis imperialist businesses until recently. The bureaucrats and politicians running the affairs of the state made use of capitalists’ expertise, and the like. Capitalists joined various committees of the state. Capitalists made use of the state. Nothing major has been done to undermine capitalist private property as such. The state firmly protects capitalist property rights, not private property rights as such (consider the rights of small-scale producers, including the peasantry, that are being crushed by the state). This is necessary for the capitalist class to enlarge its property-base at the expense of self-exploiting small-scale property owners. To the extent that some nationalization has happened, it has had little to do with socialism. Trotsky’s comments on nationalization in Mexico in the early decades of the 20th century have much contemporary relevance: The nationalization of railways and oil fields in Mexico has of course nothing in common with socialism. It is a measure of state capitalism in a backward country which in this way seeks to defend itself on the one hand against foreign imperialism and on the other against its own proletariat. (Trotsky, 1940) The peripheral state has not only defended capitalist property rights and com-modity relations. It has also protected and promoted capitalist profit-making in various ways. Domestic markets have been automatically protected from com-petition with imperialist capital (although increasingly less so), and state-owned industries have provided cheap capital goods and means of transportation, and state-owned banks continue to heap cheap money or indeed free money (loans given are pardoned) on private businesses. Concentration and centralization of capital have continued. The state has often provided subsidies to the emerging capitalist class or a group of capitalists in trouble, so it has the minimum sum necessary for investment. The state gives contracts to the private sector, helping it resolve its realization crisis. The strategy of locating industries in ‘backward’ areas (growth poles) in order to promote rural and/or regional development has been crucial: such an initiative has required the state to subsidize private businesses. Private sector companies (as well as public sector companies which have helped the former to grow) have benefited enormously from the huge reserve army of labour in rural and semi-rural areas, which has been kept alive at near-subsistence level through various ‘development policies’. Recently, the neoliberal method of primitive accumulation aided by the state has deposited an enormous quantity of exchange values in capitalist hands. This method includes the sale of public sector companies and privatization of government services (e.g. provisioning of water, education, healthcare, and the like) as well as the take-over of the land/assets of indigenous peoples and other small-scale producers by the urban capitalists at below-market prices.19 Indeed, in the process, those members of the capitalist class who have enjoyed close relations with influential politicians and bureaucrats have benefited hugely by, for example, receiving state contracts. Such relations are the source of massive corruption and plundering of state resources, a form of primitive accumulation. In some parts of the periphery, the state has taken on the form of the devel-opmental state, which is obsessed with capitalist economic development. Such a state has to even discipline and coerce specific members of the capitalist class.20 It typically keeps the workers in check. In the vast majority of cases, however, the state has not played such a developmental role. What Ron Herring (1999) calls ‘embedded particularism’ (state’s links to specific capitalists) has been partly responsible for what he calls ‘failed developmental state’. In addition, the world-market conditions favourable for exports, and the worldgeopolitical conditions (American state’s need to fight the communism threat in East Asia) that facilitated the emergence of developmental state with massive American support in that region, do not exist everywhere and always. During more recent times, the peripheral state blatantly supports capital, and financial capital, over the interests of common people. About Brazil, Daniel Bin (2014) says that in the mid-1990s, the Brazilian state began removing state resources (tax money) earmarked from education and social security to essentially use them for servicing the public debt to the benefit of finance capital. This practical earmarking for finance was not guaranteed by the Constitution, as it had previously been earmarked for social security or education. This policy was a decision that clearly revealed the class character of the Brazilian state. It would prove to be the first step in granting an important advantage to the finance sector in the class struggle over surplus value transitionally appropriated by the state. In large peripheral countries, a major component of the power bloc — class basis of the state — is foreign capital, including especially imperialist capital. The imperialist capital has had a relation of collaboration and conflict with ‘national’ sections of the capitalist class of the periphery. Its influence on the peripheral state, of course, varies geographically across the periphery: it is, traditionally, more in some countries (South America) than in other regions. Foreign capital possesses power based on its economic presence in a poor country: the simple fact of the periphery’s economic dependence limits the possible economic and political actions of the nationally operating bourgeoisie (Ougaard, 1982: 401). The power of foreign capital that it actually exercises depends on the political activities of individual enterprises, including on the basis of their organizations operating in the periphery (ibid.). In addition, the exercise of the power of foreign capital in the periphery is based on the relations between the centrestate and the peripheral state and is enormously helped by such international agencies as the World bank, IMF, aid agencies of the advanced capitalist states, foreign embassies, western think-tanks, and so on, which force policy changes such as the expansion of commodification and privatization of state-owned companies (ibid.).21 The rural landholding families constitute another part of the power bloc or the class alliance that controls state power, and once again, its importance, like that of imperialist capital, is more in some countries than in others (see Das, 2020b: 233—81). The big latifundia owner of Latin America are much more powerful than an average large-scale landowner in the Indian Punjab or SE Asia. The large-scale land-owners are involved in the appropriation of capitalist profit: mainly from farming, but also from non-farming activities located in villages and small towns. Some of these rural landowners appropriate ground rent, as well as mercantile profit and usurious interest from poor rural labour and peasants. This process is enabled by the peripheral state: it considers it legitimate for the property-owners to extract extremely high rents, whether in cash or in labour or in kind (e.g. crop-share), and charge usurious interest rates on loans taken by small-scale producers and labourers in villages or even rural parts of the city-regions. To some degree, the specifically capitalist elements of this class emerged in part due to what was predominantly a bourgeois land reform that, to some extent, removed some erstwhile pre-capitalist fetters (De Janvry, 1981; Djurfeldt and Sircar, 2017). Pre-capitalist cultural traits can coexist with capitalist values in the areas of influence of large landowners, and impact statesociety relations. The capitalist class in rural areas has also benefited from the policy of exemption of taxation on agricultural incomes in some countries and from the state-enabled, regionally confined (and not nation-wide) introduction of technical changes which have included the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution was promoted by the state policy of providing cheap inputs and price support.22 The rural propertied class still exercises substantial political power, through which it protects both its accumulation strategies and the sources of its capital/wealth. Urban capital and the landed elements are inter-connected. An ally of the urban working class, rural masses (including those who have small plots of land) are an enormous potential threat to the propertied class, whether in rural or urban areas. What makes them a potent force is their role in production: if they stop working, there will be no surplus value. Given their potential as a threat to the propertied, it is important that they be prevented from launching any attack on the class character of the state or indeed on the urban capitalist class. The urban bourgeoisie indeed needs the landed to control the rural masses. The landed is therefore regarded as functional to the political interests of the bourgeoisie.”翻译为中文","completion":"4 外围国家的阶级基础，外围国家的职能和形态 广义上说，有两个主要的所有者阶级在外围持有国家权力。一个是城市资产阶级，特别是规模较大的资本所有者，他们在国内经营并日益参与国际操作，部分通过与帝国主义资本的合作。另一个主要阶级是以村庄和小镇为基础的大规模土地所有者。在这个阶级联盟或权力集团中，城市资本家不仅占据主导地位，而且越来越是如此。他们要求国家政策，包括在国家指导主义和新自由主义下的政策。在外围和核心地区一样，国家的根本角色是服务于资产阶级。在后独立初几十年的国家指导主义期间，这种有利关系常常不仅得到反帝国主义意识形态的支持，还得到社会主义（或社会主义模式的社会）意识形态的支持。一些国家的官方名称或宪法中包含“社会主义”或“社会主义化”的词汇。这些意识形态在一定程度上影响了国家实践，如在最近对企业的国家监管和对国内企业相对于帝国主义企业的国家保护中所显示的那样。掌管国家事务的官僚和政治家利用了资本家的专业知识等。资本家加入了国家的各种委员会。资本家利用了国家。没有采取重大举措来破坏资本主义私有财产本身。国家坚定保护资本主义财产权，而非私有财产权本身（考虑到正在被国家摧毁的小规模生产者，包括农民的权利）。这对资产阶级扩大其财产基础以牺牲自我剥削的小规模财产所有者而言是必要的。在某种程度上出现了国有化，但这与社会主义几乎无关。托洛茨基对20世纪初墨西哥国有化的评论具有很强的现实相关性： 墨西哥的铁路和油田国有化当然与社会主义无关。这是一个落后国家的国家资本主义措施，通过这种方式试图一方面对抗外国帝国主义，另一方面对抗本国无产阶级。 （托洛茨基，1940） 外围国家不仅捍卫了资本主义财产权和商品关系。它还以各种方式保护和促进了资本主义的盈利。国内市场自动免受帝国主义资本竞争（尽管越来越少），国有工业提供了廉价的资本货物和交通工具，国有银行继续为私营企业提供廉价或确实免费的资金（贷款被免除）。资本的集中和中心化继续进行。国家经常向新兴的资产阶级或陷入困境的资本家集团提供补贴，以便它们具有必要的投资最低金额。国家向私营部门发放合同，帮助其解决实现危机。在“落后”地区（增长极）定位产业的战略对于促进农村和/或地区发展至关重要：这种举措要求国家补贴私营企业。私营公司（以及帮助前者成长的公共部门公司）因农村和半农村地区巨大的劳动力后备军而获益良多，这些劳动力通过各种“发展政策”维持在近乎生存水平。 最近，国家帮助的新自由主义原始积累方法在资本家手中积累了大量的交换价值。这种方法包括出售公共部门公司和私有化政府服务（例如水、教育、医疗保健等）以及以低于市场价格将土地/资产从城市资本家手中夺取原住民和其他小规模生产者的资产。实际上，在这个过程中，与有影响力的政治家和官僚关系密切的资本家阶级的成员通过例如接受国家合同而受益匪浅。这些关系是大规模腐败和掠夺国家资源的来源，是原始积累的一种形式。 在外围的一些地区，国家采取了发展型国家的形式，这种国家痴迷于资本主义经济发展。这样的国家甚至必须约束和强迫资本主义阶级的特定成员。它通常会控制工人。然而，在绝大多数情况下，国家并没有扮演这样的发展角色。罗恩·赫林（Ron Herring，1999）所说的“嵌入式特定主义”（国家与特定资本家的联系）部分地负责了他所称的“失败的发展型国家”。此外，有利于出口的世界市场条件，以及促成东亚地区出现大量美国支持的发展型国家的世界地缘政治条件（美国国家需要在东亚对抗共产主义威胁）并不是在所有地方和所有时候都存在。 在最近的时期，外围国家公然支持资本，尤其是金融资本，而不是普通民众的利益。关于巴西，丹尼尔·宾（Daniel Bin，2014）表示，20世纪90年代中期，巴西国家开始转移原本用于教育和社会保障的国家资源（税收资金），实际上用于为金融资本服务的公共债务。这种为金融而实践的指定用途并不为宪法保障，就像之前被指定用于社会保障或教育一样。这一政策的决定清楚地揭示了巴西国家的阶级特征。这将是向金融部门在国家暂时占有的剩余价值的阶级斗争中提供重要优势的第一步。 在大型外围国家，国家权力集团或阶级基础的一个主要组成部分是外国资本，尤其是帝国主义资本。帝国主义资本与外围的“国家”资本主义阶级的部分存在合作和冲突的关系。它对外围国家的影响当然在地理上跨越外围呈现出变化：传统上，在一些国家（南美）比其他地区更为明显。外国资本基于其在贫穷国家的经济存在而拥有权力：外围的经济依赖限制了在国家层面运作的资产阶级可能的经济和政治行动（Ougaard，1982：401）。外国资本实际上行使的权力取决于个别企业的政治活动，包括基于其在外围运作的组织的基础上（同上）。此外，在外围行使外国资本的权力是基于中心国家和外围国家之间的关系，并且得到了如世界银行、国际货币基金组织、先进资本主义国家的援助机构、外国大使馆、西方智库等国际机构的极大帮助，这些机构强制推动政策变革，如扩大商品化和国有公司的私有化（同上）。 农村土地持有家庭构成了控制国家权力的权力集团或阶级联盟的另一部分，再次，就像帝国主义资本一样，它的重要性在一些国家比其他国家更为明显（见Das，2020b：233—281）。拉丁美洲的大型地主比印度旁遮普或东南亚的平均大规模地主拥有更多的权力。大规模土地所有者涉及资本主义利润的占有：主要来自农业，但也来自位于村庄和小镇的非农业活动。这些农村地主中的一些人占有地租，以及从贫困农村劳动力和农民那里获得的商业利润和高额利息。这一过程得到了外围国家的支持：它认为对产权所有者来说，以现金、劳动或实物（例如作物份额）的形式提取极高的租金，以及向小规模生产者和村里或城市地区的农村部分的劳动者收取高额利息是合法的。 在某种程度上，这个阶级的特别资本主义成分部分是由于主要是资产阶级的土地改革而出现的，这种改革在一定程度上消除了一些以往的前资本主义束缚（De Janvry，1981; Djurfeldt和Sircar，2017）。前资本主义的文化特征可以与资本主义价值观在大地主影响区域并存，并影响国家社会关系。农村资产阶级也从某些国家对农业收入免税的政策中受益，并且得益于国家支持的、局限于特定地区（非全国范围）的技术变革引入，这包括了绿色革命。绿色革命得到了国家提供廉价投入和价格支持的政策推动。农村有产阶级仍然行使着大量的政治权力，通过这些权力，它保护了其积累策略和资本/财富来源。 城市资本和土地所有者是相互联系的。农村大众（包括那些拥有小块土地的人）作为城市工人阶级的盟友，是对农村或城市地区有产阶级的巨大潜在威胁。使他们成为有力量的力量是他们在生产中的角色：如果他们停止工作，就不会有剩余价值。鉴于他们作为有产者的潜在威胁，防止他们发动对国家阶级性质或确实对城市资产阶级的任何攻击是重要的。城市资产阶级实际上需要土地所有者来控制农村大众。因此，土地所有者被视为对资产阶级的政治利益具有功能性。"},{"prompt":"请将“The act of controlling and disciplining of the rural masses by the landed also delivers an important economic advantage to the urban bourgeoisie. Food and agri-materials consumed by industries are produced cheaply, because rural workers are remunerated well below the value of their labour power. So these commodities are very ‘competitively’ priced as there are many producers, and this is to the benefit of urban capitalists. Besides, the continuing existence of rural landlords helps reproduce the idea of private property ownership and thereby the idea of capitalist private property, and this is beneficial to the urban capitalist class. So in terms of the defence of private property, rural landlords and urban capitalists have the same interest. It is important to note that just like most sections of the urban bourgeois class, the rural landowning capitalists (e.g. those in Brazil or India) have also supported the liberalization of trade that the urban capitalists have demanded because the rural capitalists, generally speaking, have eyed making money from exports of farm products. Of course, class processes that benefit the landed class can go against the urban capitalist class. The class interest of the landed is in the ruthless exploitation of people with little or no land: as poor peasants via rental extractions and (increasingly) as labourers at below-subsistence wages, often under unfree conditions. Heavy rental extraction has meant that peasants have insufficient resources to invest in land. Super-exploitation of peasants and labourers also reduces the size of the home market. Besides, given the opportunity to earn revenue through these means of super-exploitation, property owners have little incentive to invest in land to increase labour productivity. Thus, to the extent that one can at all isolate national-scale factors of under-development, agrarian class relations have acted as a fetter on the development of productive forces, at least in specific regions. This situation goes against capitalists’ interests in higher rates of profit which would have come from cheaper farm products for food and raw materials and a growing home market for large-scale production. So large-scale landowners are potential enemies of the urban capitalist class. Even if state policies against the landed (e.g. land redistribution) would help capitalists economically, the political interests of the latter (i.e. the need to control the rural masses) are a barrier to the implementation of such policies. Of course, urban capitalists, including MNCs, have begun to try relatively new strategies of accumulation in rural areas: they seek to control rural markets for inputs and outputs, and finance/insurance activities, and even production through contract farming. And, these strategies are sought to be codified/supported by the state’s pro-corporate farm laws, as in India. Because such laws would work to the detriment of small-scale producers (and small-scale capitalists) as well as workers, so they protest against corporates’ ‘rural turn’ (rural accumulation strategies) with the support of the state. In the current epoch, the peripheral state functions to create conditions to make sure that the peripheral countries are a low-wage platform for the production of goods and services for domestic and imperialist capital. The state ensures this through coercive means (political control over labour when it protests). And the state ensures this by various pro-business policies, including flexible labour market policies as in India or Indonesia.23 In many countries, the state allows capitalists to ‘employ’ labour on precarious terms.24 This situation includes a large number of people being hired by labour contractors (‘labour merchants’) who then make them available to capitalists, so workers do not sell their labour power directly to capitalists. This means that those who productively consume labour power are not often its direct buyers, so if wages are low, workers cannot complain to the capitalists who actually use them. To the extent that low-wage production in these countries, in rural and urban areas, acts as a countervailing force towards the rate of profit to fall in imperialist countries, such a role of the state is objectively important. The state also makes sure that these countries absorb the commodities and finance from advanced and imperialist countries which experience the crisis of profitability and capitalist decay. And often such absorption is based on de-industrialization: import of foreign goods and services decimates peripheral enterprises. Another beneficiary of peripheral state’s policies is what might be termed ‘state elites’, composed of high-ranking members of the bureaucracy (in civilian administration and in the army) plus senior officials engaged in the industrial management of public sector enterprises. As in imperialist centre, so in the periphery, the capitalist form of exploitation is the dominant form of exploitation which is mainly based on economic coercion. This, in turn, allows the state to have a degree of autonomy vis-à-vis specific fractions of the capitalist class, an autonomy that allows the state elites to possess the flexibility with which to ensure the reproduction of the conditions of capitalist accumulation and, in the process, meets its own interests. In the periphery, state elites’ autonomy could be a little more than in the core countries. One reason could be what Alavi calls the ‘over-developed’ nature of the state (over-developed in relation to its economic base).25 But there are other reasons, as we will see. In the initial years of independence, state elites in the periphery had a slightly progressive stance and even exhibited a degree of anti-capitalist attitude. But over time, they have behaved as typical state elites acting in partnership with the propertied classes. Their bourgeois ideological orientation and coherence has helped the bourgeoisie. However, ‘[o]ften the organizational capabilities of the peripheral state’s apparatuses are rather weak, which is why it might be said that the peripheral state is simultaneously underdeveloped and overdeveloped’ (Ougaard, 1982: 400). This fact implies that their action may not perfectly coincide with the interests of capital. Yet state elites have ensured that state policies, more or less, benefit the capitalists. Of course, state elites’ ‘control over’ state apparatuses, along with a relative absence of ‘bureaucratic professionalization’, is a massive source of rents (corruption): giving a license to a business person to set up a factory or ensuring a worker gets a water connection, is a source of bribe money for officials and politicians who work in concert. Peripheral states are the most corrupt in the world, and usually, the worst effects of corruption are borne by common people who are poor and lack relevant connections to officials and politicians. If a government regulation is there (for example, one that disallows the use of child labour in a sector), civil servants can receive monetary compensation from the business class to look the other way: a certain part of the extra profit that a business person makes by violating the regulation is shared with the civil servants (who probably share a part of the bribe with their political masters in order to receive protection from them). Civil servants and politicians can also ‘sell’ a given policy (e.g. sale or leasing of state-owned enterprises) secretively (through the use of secret electoral bonds) to meet the specific needs of a given fraction of the capitalist class by presenting that policy as being in the interest of economic development and in the interest of the nation. What has changed since the neoliberal turn has happened?26 Increasingly, civil servants are overseeing a market system, where animal spirits are highly encouraged, right from the prime minister’s office. They need to ensure the success of the market system during their formal tenure (and after retirement when they work as so-called consultants for private companies). Now as before their power comes from their ability to favour the business class as such vis-à-vis the working masses. In particular, much of their power now comes from the ability to sell off public assets to private players at a throwaway price and from making land and other natural resources available to the business class that are taken away from unorganized small-scale producers. Their power also comes from connecting this or that fraction of the business class to the international circuit of capital and to powerful imperialist states on favourable terms, and so on. In playing this sort of ‘compradore’ role, they are helped by the fact that they may have worked for international institutions and have connections with them. In contexts where the overwhelming majority of the population are illiterate or primary school dropouts and are poor, ‘the educated elite’ according to Bardhan (1998: 52), ‘enjoy a high scarcity value (a rent) for their education and profession. By managing to direct educational investment away from the masses, the elite has protected its ‘scarcity rent’, which is seen in their salary increases and perks. State elites, especially from the dominant social-cultural groups (e.g. upper castes and dominant religious or ethnic groups), have benefited considerably from the expansion of educational and administrative functions and the nationalization of industries, which created jobs for managers in the public sector and subsidized collective consumption (which has actually made some of them members of an expanding consuming class). In short, state elites have economic resources, as well as social and cultural capital. Since they occupy crucial positions in the state apparatus, they use state’s ‘autonomy’ to implement policies partly in their own interest, akin to exercising powers of patronage. The state elite has personal connections with business groups, both inside a country and in its diaspora. Even before independence, it was also the repository of the intelligentsia, working out a development theory for capitalism, often restraining more intensely bourgeois objectives and formulating policies that appeared to be more reformist and universal (Kaviraj, 1988). Members of the state elite viewed ‘their society as in need of basic change’ (Kohli, 1987: 25) and charted a path of capitalist development that defied imperialist pressures, one that is consistent with a bourgeois conception of ‘national’ development. Much planning/policy discourse accordingly comes from them who are always in interaction with the organic intellectuals of the capitalist class, in their own country and in imperialist countries, working in the academia, media, private consultancies, and so on, and who help the capitalist class construct the accumulation strategies. Such interaction is materialized through the various institutions/apparatuses of the state, and through their rules, procedures, dis-courses, and strategies. The state elite governs, and exercises power over, the millions of development-hungry, illiterate, and semi-literate people in rural areas and in impoverished urban spaces, in the name of development. Often the promise of development stays on paper with the massive gap between development on paper and development proper. Development on paper serves as a big bourgeois state ideology in the periphery. At the local scale of state-society relations, state elites (officials and political leaders, especially of ruling parties) represent the worst face of state power. Forming an alliance with the economically dominant classes at this level, they fail to implement policies that are supposed to benefit the common people and/or corner much of the development benefits that are supposed to go to the poor. Their high-handedness complements and reinforces that of the proprietary classes.”翻译为中文","completion":"对农村大众的控制和管制行为，也为城市资产阶级带来了重要的经济优势。工业消费的食品和农产品成本低廉，因为农村工人的报酬远低于其劳动力价值。因此，这些商品价格极具“竞争力”，因为生产者众多，这对城市资本家有利。此外，农村地主的持续存在有助于再现私有财产所有权的概念，从而是资本主义私有财产的概念，这对城市资产阶级有益。所以在保卫私有财产方面，农村地主和城市资本家拥有共同的利益。值得注意的是，就像城市资产阶级的大多数部分一样，农村拥有资本的地主（例如巴西或印度的那些）也支持城市资本家所要求的贸易自由化，因为农村资本家通常有意通过出口农产品赚钱。 当然，对地主阶级有利的阶级过程可能会与城市资本家阶级相冲突。地主阶级的利益在于对几乎没有或没有土地的人的无情剥削：作为穷农民通过租金提取以及（越来越多地）作为低于生存工资的劳工，往往在非自由条件下。高额的租金提取意味着农民没有足够的资源投资于土地。对农民和劳工的超级剥削也减少了国内市场的规模。此外，鉴于通过这些超级剥削手段获得收入的机会，土地所有者几乎没有投资于土地以提高劳动生产率的激励。因此，若要在国家层面上分离出导致不发达的因素，农业阶级关系已成为生产力发展的桎梏，至少在特定地区是如此。这种情况与资本家对更高利润率的利益相违背，后者本可通过更便宜的农产品获得以及国内大规模生产市场的增长。因此，大土地所有者是城市资产阶级的潜在敌人。即使针对土地所有者的国家政策（例如土地重新分配）在经济上有助于资本家，但后者的政治利益（即控制农村大众的需要）是实施此类政策的障碍。当然，包括跨国公司在内的城市资本家已开始尝试在农村地区采取相对新的积累战略：他们寻求控制农村投入和产出市场，金融/保险活动，甚至通过合同农业进行生产。这些战略被国家的亲企业农业法律所规范/支持，如印度。因为这样的法律将对小规模生产者（和小规模资本家）以及工人不利，所以他们反对企业在国家支持下的“农村转向”（农村积累战略）。 在当前时代，外围国家的职能是创造条件，确保外围国家成为低工资的生产商品和服务的平台，服务于国内和帝国主义资本。国家通过强制手段（在劳工抗议时对劳动力的政治控制）确保了这一点。国家还通过各种亲商业政策来确保这一点，包括印度或印度尼西亚的灵活劳动力市场政策。在许多国家，国家允许资本家以不确定的条款“雇用”劳动力。这种情况包括大量人员被劳务承包商（“劳务商”）雇佣，然后使他们为资本家服务，所以工人并没有直接向资本家出售其劳动力。这意味着那些产品性消费劳动力的人并不常是其直接购买者，所以如果工资低，工人不能向实际使用他们的资本家抱怨。在这些国家的农村和城市地区，低工资生产作为对帝国主义国家利润率下降的一种抵消力量，国家的这种角色客观上很重要。国家还确保这些国家吸收来自发达和帝国主义国家的商品和金融，这些国家正在经历利润率危机和资本主义衰败。通常这种吸收基于去工业化：进口外国商品和服务摧毁了外围企业。 外围国家政策的另一受益者是可以称为“国家精英”的群体，由高级官僚（在民政管理和军队中）和从事公共部门企业工业管理的高级官员组成。与帝国主义中心一样，在外围，基于经济胁迫的资本主义剥削形式是主要的剥削形式。这反过来允许国家在对特定资本主义阶级分支的自主性上拥有一定程度的自主性，这种自主性使得国家精英具有以确保资本主义积累条件再生产的灵活性，并在此过程中满足其自身利益。在外围，国家精英的自主性可能比在核心国家更大一些。一个原因可能是阿拉维所说的国家的“过度发达”性质（相对于其经济基础而言）。但还有其他原因，我们将会看到。在独立初年，外围的国家精英持有稍微进步的立场，甚至表现出一定程度的反资本主义态度。但随着时间的推移，他们表现得像典型的国家精英，与有产阶级合作。他们的资产阶级意识形态取向和一致性有助于资产阶级。然而，“往往外围国家的机构组织能力相当薄弱，这就是为什么可以说外围国家同时是不发达和过度发达的”（Ougaard，1982：400）。这个事实意味着他们的行动可能不完全符合资本的利益。然而，国家精英确保了国家政策或多或少有利于资本家。当然，国家精英对国家机构的“控制”，以及相对缺乏“官僚职业化”，是腐败（收取租金）的巨大来源：为商人提供设立工厂的许可证或确保工人获得水连接，为一起工作的官员和政治家提供了贿赂资金的来源。外围国家是世界上最腐败的国家之一，通常腐败的最坏影响由普通民众承受，这些民众穷困且缺乏与官员和政治家的相关联系。 如果有政府规定（例如，禁止在某个行业使用童工的规定），公务员可以从商业阶级那里收取金钱，以便于选择视而不见：商人通过违反规定所获得的额外利润的一部分与公务员分享（他们可能会与他们的政治主人分享部分贿赂，以便从他们那里获得保护）。公务员和政治家也可以秘密地（通过使用秘密选举债券）“出售”某项政策（例如出售或租赁国有企业），将该政策呈现为符合经济发展利益和国家利益的需要，以满足资本主义阶级特定部分的具体需求。自新自由主义转变发生以来有什么变化？越来越多的公务员正在监督一个市场系统，在这个系统中，从总理办公室开始，高度鼓励动物精神。他们需要确保市场系统在他们的正式任期内（以及退休后当他们为私营公司工作所谓的顾问时）取得成功。现在和以前一样，他们的权力来自于他们能够支持商业阶级对抗工人大众。特别是，他们现在的大部分权力来自于以低廉价格出售公共资产给私人玩家的能力，以及将土地和其他自然资源提供给商业阶级，这些资源是从无组织的小规模生产者那里夺取的。他们的权力还来自于将这个或那个商业阶级分支连接到国际资本流通和有利条件下的强大帝国主义国家。在扮演这种“中介人”角色时，他们因为可能曾为国际机构工作并与之保持联系而受到帮助。 在大多数人口是文盲或小学辍学并且贫穷的情况下，根据巴德汉（Bardhan，1998：52）的说法，“受过教育的精英”因其教育和职业的稀缺价值（一种租金）而享有高度优势。通过成功地将教育投资从大众中转移开，精英保护了其“稀缺性租金”，这在他们的工资增长和福利中得到体现。国家精英，尤其是来自主导的社会文化群体（例如上层种姓和主导的宗教或族裔群体），从教育和行政职能的扩张以及国有化产业中受益良多，这为管理人员在公共部门创造了就业机会，并补贴了集体消费（实际上使他们中的一些人成为不断扩大的消费阶层的成员）。简而言之，国家精英拥有经济资源以及社会和文化资本。由于他们在国家机构中占据关键位置，他们利用国家的“自主性”部分地为了自身利益实施政策，类似于行使赞助权力。 国家精英与国内外商业团体有个人联系。即使在独立前，它也是知识分子的储藏所，为资本主义制定了发展理论，常常限制更激进的资产阶级目标，并制定了看似更改革性和普遍性的政策（卡维拉吉，1988）。国家精英成员视“他们的社会需要基本变革”（科利，1987：25）并规划了一条资本主义发展道路，该路线抵制了帝国主义压力，符合资产阶级关于“国家”发展的概念。许多规划/政策话语相应地来自于他们，他们始终与本国和帝国主义国家的资产阶级有机知识分子互动，在学术界、媒体、私人咨询公司等领域工作，并帮助资产阶级构建积累战略。这种互动通过国家的各种机构/机制及其规则、程序、话语和策略具体化。国家精英治理并对成千上万渴望发展的文盲和半文盲人民行使权力，在农村地区和贫困城市空间，以发展的名义。发展的承诺往往只存在于纸面上，发展在纸面和实际发展之间存在巨大差距。纸面上的发展成为外围大资产阶级国家意识形态的一部分。 在国家-社会关系的地方层面，国家精英（官员和政治领导人，尤其是执政党的）代表了国家权力的最坏面孔。他们与这一层面的经济主导阶级结成联盟，未能实施旨在惠及普通民众的政策，或者将本应流向穷人的大部分发展利益据为己有。他们的高压手段补充并加强了有产阶级的手段。"},{"prompt":"请将“Whether they have much ‘human capital’ or not, state elites qua elites are not a class, however, so they cannot be considered a part of the class coalition holding state power.27 Unlike landowners and private capitalists, they, as even the managers of state property, cannot transfer property to their heirs. It is the ownership/control of the means of production that decides who ultimately has power in a society and the state.28 State elites do have a certain degree of autonomy, but this autonomy is that of the state as a structure in a dominantly bourgeois society. Their activities — including rent-seeking — must be seen as contingent on a state, the structure of which is designed to pursue capitalist interests. State elites as such are not a class and cannot therefore hold and exercise state power on their own behalf.29 It is the logic of private sector profit in the hands of the (big) business houses that sets the limit within which specific economic development strategies are designed by state elites, based on their worldview which is more or less influenced by the interests of the bourgeoisie as a whole.30 The actual nature of policies depends to some extent on the perception of their own economic/political interests, and their perception of what ‘the nation’ needs, and their ability to conceive these needs along the capitalist lines. In the early stage of the post-independence epoch, they conceived of national capitalist development to be relatively autonomous of imperialist pressures, but in more recent times, the elites have a penchant for neoliberal development without any pretention to counter imperialism.31 The dominant class base of the state changes over time (and over space). Since the late 1950—1960s, there has been an expansion of the capitalist class (although differently in different regions within a country). In more recent times, capitalist elements among the landed, relative to those landowners who used to appropriate ground-rent often using extra-economic coercion, have become more powerful and have been connected to urban capitalists. However, the economic and political importance of rural capitalists, in spite of their numerical dominance within the property-owning class, is declining relative to that of the city-based big-business, which includes foreign capital. There is also increasing integration between the periphery’s capitalist class and imperialist capital. 5 The state, exploited classes, and class struggle from below in the periphery The proprietary coalition is only part, albeit the dominant part, of the peripheral state’s social conditioning. What the state is and does, and why, must also be investigated from the standpoint of the lower classes (the masses) and especially in terms of their struggle against the state and the propertied classes and against imperialism, no matter how weak and constrained that struggle is. Which classes are the exploited classes in the periphery, and how are they exploited? This has been discussed in the last section on the nature of the dominant classes, but a brief re-articulation of the relevant ideas might be useful. In the rural context, the exploited classes are the small-scale producers. They include: middle peasants who do not hire labour, and poor peasants who may work on their own and/or rented land, and also as part-time wage-earners. The exploited classes also include agricultural and non-agricultural labourers. As a general rule, these classes/strata are exploited in the capitalist system, but they are subordinated by a wide variety of regionally specific production relations, extending from sharecropping and other kinds of tenancy arrangements which structure their conditional access to small plots of land. Such relations are additionally structured by the presence or absence of cash wages, debt, and freedom on the part of a worker personally to commodify his/her own labour power. Those compelled to rely mainly or wholly on the sale not of the product of their labour but rather of labour power itself — that is, labourers of various types — are exploited by property owners, who appropriate surplus labour in the form of profit as well as rent and interest. Many rural men and women and even children work as seasonal or migrant labourers in nearby city-regions and also in newly transplanted enterprises in rural areas. In the urban context, a small percentage of wage earners has access to a regular wage, tenure, and pension benefits. The vast majority of workers are precariously employed without regularity of employment or pension and other benefits. There are many men and women, who work as small-scale owners/producers, in part because of the lack of secure wage-employment with a decent wage. The miserable conditions of these classes prompt the struggle from below. Forms of class struggle from below Forms of class struggle from below vary and are often place-specific. One can observe four inter-connected forms. The first is the struggle by proletarian and semi-proletarian elements as full-time or part-time wage earners against capital, both in urban and rural areas. This ‘from below’ struggle includes struggle against pre-capitalist exploitation where it exists. More importantly, their struggle, which is generally in the form of strikes (work stoppage), is against the formal and RSL under capital: that is, it is against low wages, oppressive labour practices, long hours and poor working conditions, precarity, and the introduction of, or subordination to, labour-saving technology, and so on. This sort of struggle also aims at the state which supports the propertied class against ‘from below’ agency undertaken by workers and small-scale producers. Workers in rural and urban areas fight for concessions from the capitalist state, including in its role as an employer and as a provider of subsistence goods (e.g. food) that contribute to social reproduction. Also, workers (whether in South Africa or India, etc.) have not only struck work, and they have also defended the public sector (and fought against their privatization), and they have also built production and service-provision cooperatives as a means of building working-class power. A second main form is ‘from below’ struggle against primitive accumulation: the state facilitating ‘coercive depeasantization’ (smallholders being coercively stripped of their means of production), the privatization of common property and public sector resources, and the withdrawal of state benefits meant for the poor. Here again ‘from below’ agency targets the state (and not just the propertied classes) for its support for primitive accumulation — for example, when it privatizes the commons. Connected to this form of struggles is the struggle, launched by small-scale commodity producers for better farm prices and lower farm inputs for protection from big business trying to extend its control over rural market, finance, and so on. Brazil’s landless workers movement and Zapatista movement and numerous similar movements against modern forms of primitive accumulation in South Asia are the relevant examples. In addition to these two forms of class struggle, there are other kinds of conflict that have their roots in class relations but have some autonomy: these struggles oppose ecological degradation and special oppression (i.e. oppression based on gender/caste/ethnic/national/religious/racial relations) that the state, including bourgeois parties promotes/sustains. Indeed, adverse environmental change and non-class forms of oppression have a disproportionate impact on the poor than on the better-off sections. To the degree that the propertied classes and the state bolster — either overtly or covertly — ‘non-class’ forms of oppression, they become the target of anti-oppression struggles. These are the struggles in which exploited classes participate, although they may not always be conscious of the role of capitalism in the creation of ecological problems and promotion/maintenance of social oppression. There is also struggle which is most clearly ‘political’: for the democratization of the state. Workers and small-scale producers join with the broad mass of the population, not least because they are the ones who often experience in its most overt form the corrupt practices and patronizing attitudes of state elites, who treat them like slaves. Insofar as the undemocratic nature of the state — its lack of accountability to the exploited classes in terms of policies, programmes, and politics — derives from the fact that the main role of this capitalist apparatus is to reproduce dominance of the exploiting propertied classes, so struggles over democracy are centrally linked to the fact of class relations. In more recent times, struggles against the attack on democratic rights have focused on the assaults on religious and ethnic minorities from fascistic forces whether in Brazil, Turkey, India, or Sri Lanka. Anti-imperialist struggles, including in Pakistan, as well as struggles against fascistic tendencies as well as struggles against special oppression, are a part of the democratic movement in the periphery. State’s concessions as a response to class struggle from below Struggles from below mean that both the propertied classes and the state find it necessary to make concessions from time to time. But these do not threaten capital. Even such state-enabled accumulation projects as the Green Revolution were driven in part by the fear that actual or potential famine conditions during the 1960s might constitute a threat to the political order. To the extent that the land reform policy has granted small amounts of land, taken from large landlords, to poor people, this has represented a reverse primitive accumulation.32 But reverse primitive accumulation does not undermine capitalism. Capitalism does not require that all labour power become a commodity. As long as a sufficient amount of labour power is in the commodity form, capitalism’s fundamental mechanisms (e.g. competition, appropriation of surplus value, and the like) can be in full force. In fact, the existence of a semi-commodified labour power is no barrier to capital’s pursuit of surplus. Capital can benefit at the expense of small-scale producers in multiple ways.33 Similarly, many states have provided limited wage employment on public works as well as small loans to poor people to set up small businesses, and this contributes towards their reproduction as potential wage labour (and as small-scale producers).34 However, the major interventions of the post-colonial state have failed to significantly improve the conditions of life of the poor, the conditions that are created by the ways in which the capitalist economic system works. The main, if not the sole, reason for state failure is the class character of the state and society. In most populous post-colonial countries, large landowners share state power with the urban bourgeoisie: this means that state policies have been dominantly in the interests of these classes and their international patrons. As already mentioned, the landowners perform the important role of economically and politically controlling the rural masses, including labourers, whose anger against landlordism could be potentially directed at the bourgeoisie of the country as well as their international patrons. Further, those who are responsible for the design and implementation of pro-poor policies, including judges and bureaucrats, come from the landed class or represent their interests.35”翻译为中文","completion":"无论他们是否拥有大量“人力资本”，国家精英作为精英并不构成一个阶级，因此，他们不能被视为掌握国家权力的阶级联盟的一部分。不同于土地所有者和私人资本家，就算作为国有财产的管理者，他们也不能将财产转移给他们的继承人。拥有/控制生产资料的权力决定了谁最终在社会和国家中拥有权力。国家精英确实拥有一定程度的自主权，但这种自主权是作为一个主要资产阶级社会中的国家结构所拥有的。他们的活动——包括寻租——必须被视为以追求资本主义利益而设计的国家结构为条件。因此，国家精英本身不是一个阶级，因此不能代表自己行使国家权力。私营部门利润的逻辑为国家精英设计特定经济发展策略的范围设定了限制，这基于他们的世界观，这种世界观或多或少受到整体资产阶级利益的影响。政策的实际性质在一定程度上取决于他们对自己经济/政治利益的看法，以及他们对“国家”需求的看法，以及他们按照资本主义路线构想这些需求的能力。在后独立时代的早期阶段，他们构想的国家资本主义发展相对独立于帝国主义压力，但在最近，精英们倾向于不抗衡帝国主义的新自由主义发展。 国家的主导阶级基础随时间（和空间）而变化。自1950—1960年代晚期以来，资本家阶级已经扩张（尽管在一个国家的不同地区不同）。在最近，与那些过去常常使用超经济强制手段占有地租的地主相比，土地上的资本主义元素变得更为强大，并且与城市资本家建立了联系。然而，尽管农村资本家在拥有财产的阶级内占据数目上的优势，与基于城市的大企业相比，包括外国资本在内，他们的经济和政治重要性正在相对下降。外围的资本家阶级与帝国主义资本之间的融合也在增加。 5 外围的国家、被剥削阶级和来自下层的阶级斗争 所有者联盟只是外围国家社会条件的一部分，尽管是主导部分。对国家是什么、做什么以及为什么，也必须从下层阶级（大众）的立场出发来调查，特别是就他们反对国家和有产阶级以及反对帝国主义的斗争而言，不管这场斗争多么微弱和受限。 哪些阶级是外围的被剥削阶级，他们是如何被剥削的？这在上一节关于主导阶级性质的讨论中已经讨论过，但简要重新阐述相关观点可能是有用的。在农村背景下，被剥削阶级是小规模生产者。他们包括：不雇佣劳动力的中等农民，以及可能在自己和/或租赁土地上工作并且还兼职为工资工作的贫农。被剥削阶级还包括农业和非农业劳动者。一般规则是，这些阶级/阶层在资本主义制度中被剥削，但它们受到广泛的特定地区生产关系的支配，从佃耕和其他类型的租赁安排中延伸，这些安排构建了他们有条件地进入小块土地的渠道。这种关系还受到现金工资、债务及个人自由贩卖其劳动力的存在或缺乏的额外结构化。那些主要或完全依赖于出售其劳动力而非劳动产品的人——即各种类型的劳工——被占有者剥削，后者通过利润以及租金和利息的形式占有剩余劳动。许多农村男性、女性甚至儿童作为季节性或移民劳工在附近的城市区域以及在农村地区新建的企业中工作。在城市背景下，少数工资收入者有权获得规律工资、任期和养老金福利。绝大多数工人没有固定的就业或养老金和其他福利，他们的工作岗位不稳定。许多男性和女性，由于缺乏有保障的有体面工资的工资就业，以小规模所有者/生产者的身份工作。这些阶级的悲惨条件促使了来自下层的斗争。 来自下层的阶级斗争形式 来自下层的阶级斗争形式多种多样，通常具有地方特色。我们可以观察到四种相互关联的形式。第一种是无产阶级和半无产阶级成员作为全职或兼职工资收入者在城市和农村地区反对资本的斗争。这种“来自下层”的斗争包括在存在的地方反对前资本主义剥削。更重要的是，他们的斗争通常以罢工（停工）的形式出现，是对资本下的正式和实际征用的斗争：即对低工资、压迫性劳动实践、长时间工作和恶劣的工作条件、不稳定性以及对节约劳动的技术的引入和服从等问题的斗争。这种斗争还针对支持有产阶级对抗“来自下层”代理人行动的国家（由工人和小规模生产者）。无论是在农村还是城市地区的工人都在争取从资本主义国家获得让步，包括国家作为雇主和提供有助于社会再生产的生存商品（例如食物）的角色。此外，工人（无论是在南非还是印度等地）不仅罢工，他们还保卫公共部门（并对抗其私有化），并建立生产和服务提供合作社作为构建工人阶级力量的手段。 第二种主要形式是反对原始积累的“来自下层”斗争：国家促进“强制性去农民化”（小农户被强制剥夺生产手段）、公共财产和公共部门资源的私有化以及撤销原本用于穷人的国家福利。这里“来自下层”的代理人再次针对国家（而不仅仅是有产阶级），因为其支持原始积累——例如，当它将公共资源私有化时。与这种斗争形式相关的是，小规模商品生产者为了更好的农产品价格和更低的农业投入品以及保护免受试图扩大对农村市场、金融等控制的大企业的影响而发起的斗争。巴西无地农工运动和萨帕塔运动以及对南亚现代形式原始积累的众多类似运动是相关的例子。 除了这两种形式的阶级斗争外，还有其他种类的冲突，它们根源于阶级关系但具有一定的自主性：这些斗争反对生态退化和特殊压迫（即基于性别/种姓/族裔/民族/宗教/种族关系的压迫），国家（包括资产阶级政党）促进/维持的。实际上，不利的环境变化和非阶级形式的压迫对穷人的影响大于对较富裕阶层的影响。在有产阶级和国家公开或隐秘地支持“非阶级”形式的压迫的程度上，它们成了反压迫斗争的目标。这些是被剥削阶级参与的斗争，尽管他们可能并不总是意识到资本主义在生态问题产生和维持/促进社会压迫中的作用。 还有一种斗争形式是最明显的“政治性”斗争：争取国家的民主化。工人和小规模生产者与广大民众一道参与，不仅是因为他们经常以最明显的形式经历了国家精英的腐败行为和居高临下的态度，后者将他们视为奴隶。因为国家的非民主性质——其在政策、计划和政治上对被剥削阶级缺乏问责性——来自于它作为这个资本主义装置的主要角色是为了再现剥削有产阶级的统治，所以民主斗争与阶级关系事实密切相关。在最近，反对对民主权利的攻击的斗争集中在对宗教和族裔少数群体的法西斯势力攻击上，无论是在巴西、土耳其、印度还是斯里兰卡。反帝国主义斗争，包括在巴基斯坦，以及对法西斯倾向和特殊压迫的斗争，是外围民主运动的一部分。 国家作为对来自下层斗争的回应的让步 来自下层的斗争意味着有产阶级和国家有时不得不做出让步。但这些不会威胁到资本。即使像绿色革命这样由国家支持的积累项目也是部分受到了1960年代潜在或实际饥荒条件可能对政治秩序构成威胁的恐惧所驱动的。在土地改革政策中，从大地主手中拿出少量土地给穷人，并不代表原始积累的倒退。但原始积累的倒退并不破坏资本主义。资本主义并不要求所有劳动力都变成商品。只要有足够多的劳动力以商品形式存在，资本主义的基本机制（例如竞争、剩余价值的占有等）就可以充分发挥作用。事实上，半商品化的劳动力的存在并不妨碍资本追求剩余。资本可以通过多种方式以小规模生产者为代价获益。同样，许多国家为穷人提供了有限的公共工程工资就业机会以及设立小企业的小额贷款，这有助于他们作为潜在工资劳动力（和小规模生产者）的再生产。 然而，后殖民时代国家的主要干预措施未能显著改善穷人的生活条件，这些条件是由资本主义经济系统运作方式造成的。国家失败的主要（如果不是唯一）原因是国家和社会的阶级性质。在大多数人口众多的后殖民国家，大地主与城市资产阶级共同分享国家权力：这意味着国家政策主要符合这些阶级及其国际宗主的利益。正如前文所提到的，地主在经济和政治上控制农村大众（包括劳工）方面发挥了重要作用，这些人对地主制的愤怒可能潜在地针对国家的资产阶级以及他们的国际宗主。此外，负责设计和实施惠及穷人政策的人员，包括法官和官僚，来自地主阶级或代表他们的利益。"},{"prompt":"请将“As explained earlier, the economic interest of the capitalist class, domestic and foreign, is such that it would not have had any problem if the land reform leg-islation had completely destroyed the pre-capitalist class, reviewing barriers to productivity. Such legislation would also have improved the material conditions of peasants and rural labourers. But the political interests of capitalists were such that they could not go against the feudals. What Marx said in 1852 (in a chapter in New York Daily Tribune) about the then-British bourgeoisie, is relevant to the late developing countries now: They prefer to compromise with the vanishing opponent [i.e. the feudals] rather than to strengthen the arising enemy [i.e. the working class], to whom the future belongs, by concessions of a more than apparent importance. Therefore, they strive to avoid every forcible collision with [them]. (Marx, 1852b) So, given the importance of the landowners, the state acting on behalf of the bourgeoisie cannot afford to hurt their (i.e. landowners’) interest too much by properly implementing land reforms. This imperative of non-harm to the dominant classes is stronger under neoliberalism. This is seen in the attempted relaxation of ceiling laws to benefit the new rich. Existing ceilings on land holdings are being considered an obstacle to accumulation. The Green Revolution, in a sense, represents a continuity with the earlier programme (i.e. the land reforms), once again revealing the class character of the state. The Green Revolution policy placed new means of production (e.g. the new technological package, state capital in the form of subsidies, and so on) precisely in the hands of the same class which was protected by the land reforms policy and allowed it an opportunity to accumulate capital, unfettered and untaxed. The landed elements continue to govern the conditions of existence of the poor. Neither the land reforms nor the Green Revolution has done anything to significantly undermine the economic and political power of large property owners (many of whom also invest in non-farm activities such as transportation, trading, and so on). I may add that since the onset of neoliberal capitalist policies, land and water resources are increasingly being used to produce high value goods for a narrow domestic elite and for export. And one implication of this is a relative decline in the access to food on the part of millions of people in the periphery. Also, given the overall capitalist class context, the amount of funding for the proper implementation of the policies on the scale that is necessary has to be limited. In the market system, the use of society’s resources must be justified mainly on the basis of the profit logic. This logic puts severe limits on the amount of money the capitalist state can commit in the form of pro-poor policies, relative to the massive need of the hundreds of millions of the poor whom the system marginalizes (e.g. peasants increasingly losing access to land, people without secure employment for a living wage). The actual amount spent on the poor depends on, among other things, the balance of class forces as mediated by state-based mechanisms (e.g. judiciary, electoral power of different classes), and this balance is not in favour of the poor. But there are severe structural limits to what the state can do for the poor.36 Note that these limits are expressed by the ruling class, directly or through its spokespersons, who have no qualms about milking the state to satisfy their appetite for profits. The situation of state spending for the poor relative to country’s ability to spend is stark in neoliberal period with the state having shifted its path from welfare/interventionist state to laissez-faire neoliberal state (Tiwana and Singh, 2015). One of the (contradictory) aims of the latter is to shrink mass income and consumption at home in order to enable cheap exports and repayment of debt to imperialist finance capital (Patnaik, 1999). When viewed in relation to policies for the exploited classes, within which the different strata belong to different castes/ethnic minorities, the state is a deeply contradictory entity. On the one hand, without the democratic grassroots organization of these classes vis-à-vis the ruling classes and state elites, pro-poor policies will fail. Policies which aim to take land from landowners and give it to the poor, or which aim to ensure safety in the workplace and the payment of adequate wages, will not be implemented without the direct participation of the masses in their implementation, given the enormous power of the propertied classes to hide what they do. On the other hand, state’s own actions and ideas and its own form, the form of anti-poverty policies, tend to fragment and disorganize the lower classes who compete for meagre resources. Not only must the state disorganize, it must also have a certain amount of social-political distance between itself and the lower classes. Indeed, real direct democratic control over the state’s day-to-day operation by the lower classes contradicts state’s function to reproduce class relations. In its day-to-day operation, the state is generally not accessible to lower classes the way it is to dominant classes. Therefore, the possibility of state officials properly implementing antipoverty policies does not generally arise. If lack of power contributes to poverty, the state is a cause of powerlessness of the lower classes. It must therefore be seen as an important cause of poverty. One should therefore be critical of those who are sanguine about the talk of decentralization of state power as a solution to problems. Many commentators, including Amartya Sen (1999), assume that by encour-aging competition between parties and allowing a free press, democracy will lead to the implementation of pro-poor policies. He says that what the government does can be influenced by public pressures from below (Dreze and Sen, 1995). But much depends on what issues are politicised, and what is, or is not, politicized depends on the visions and pre-occupations of ruling as well as opposition parties. Non-communist opposition parties do not oppose ruling parties on crucial issues such as payment of compensation to landlords in the land reform laws or privatization of state-owned companies or periphery’s subjugation to the imperialist military-economic framework. In other words, on class-related issues that do matter to the exploited classes, whose interests are fundamentally opposed to those of exploited classes, opposition parties do not matter. Parties in power and parties in opposition do not oppose the fundamental interests of the business class and its collaboration with imperialism. Both ruling and opposition parties work within the framework of a state that supports the fundamental interests of the propertied classes and share the ruling class ideology which, in turn, contributes to the de-politicization of the crucial issues. Dreze and Sen ignore the fact that the ideology of the propertied classes and the coercive character of the state, among other things, influence what enters into political debates and what does not. Sen’s view is problematic because it is silent about the class character of the parties/regimes, which manage the common affairs of the state, which, in turn, manage the common affairs of the capitalist class. Sen’s optimistic prognosis cannot answer the question of why it is that crucial development issues — such as unequal distribution of means of production (particularly land), extreme forms of income inequality, absence of high-quality and free state-provided healthcare and education, and employment for all at an inflation-adjusted living wage — do not become important election issues and are not much debated by competing mainstream parties. Democracy can help in the promulgation and implementation of policies favourable to the masses, but within limits. If the masses are to secure significant access to economic resources, including land and remuneration for their work, in the democratic process — so as to enjoy the health and educational freedoms which Sen rightly thinks all human beings should enjoy — then this requires, at least, the severe curtailment of political power exercised by dominant proprietary classes. 6 Coercive nature of the peripheral state’s democratic form It is a mistake, however, to assume that the only response the state can make to ‘from below’ struggle is a defensive one of concession, however limited. Hence the importance of understanding that the state response frequently is to launch counter-revolutionary action — a form of ‘from above’ class struggle — on behalf of capital and large landowners, and in the interest of maintaining political order. Hence the class character of society and the grassroots struggles arising from this influence the nature of the state form (especially in terms of whether it is democratic or not), which in turn influences state actions. The existence of the democratic form does not mean that it is the only form of class rule: indeed, when necessary, the state will and does use coercion, and increasingly so, against the exploited classes if they resist its accumulation policies beyond a certain limit. The state turns coercive when people fight against domestic and imperialist capital. The capitalist state tends to be much less democratic in the periphery than the state in the metropolitan countries. In those peripheral countries, where the democratic state form exists, the amount of the gap between substantive economic inequality and formal political equality is much greater than in the imperialist countries. This is because of severe forms of economic inequality and high level of absolute poverty. This fact is an aspect of a broader trend: in the LDCs, the normal effects of class relations on the common people are more extreme. Coercion is partly, and only partly, thanks to its colonial legacy.37 There are strong anti-democratic pressures from society since independence from colonialism. Anti-democratic pressure emanates from geographically fixed land-based accumulation activities (e.g. latifundia, mining capital, and so on) that remain powerful in the villages and small towns: owners of farm-land or mines cannot leave a place with their property, so they must counter any resistance from the masses at all costs. Threats to formal democracy also come from those (e.g. fascistic forces) who are opposed to minority religions and women’s rights. They also derive from the several other aspects of the capitalism that exists. One aspect is primitive accumulation which generally involves coercion.”翻译为中文","completion":"正如之前解释的，国内外资本家阶级的经济利益，即使土地改革立法彻底破坏了前资本主义阶级，消除了生产力的障碍，他们也不会有任何问题。这样的立法也会改善农民和农村劳工的物质条件。但资本家的政治利益使他们不能反对封建势力。马克思在1852年（在纽约每日论坛报的一章中）关于当时的英国资产阶级所说的话，对现在发展较晚的国家仍然相关： 他们宁愿与消亡的对手妥协，也不愿通过超乎表面的重要让步来加强未来属于他们的敌人（即工人阶级）。因此，他们努力避免与[他们]发生任何强制性的冲突。 （马克思，1852b） 因此，鉴于地主的重要性，代表资产阶级行事的国家不能通过正确实施土地改革来过多地损害他们（即地主）的利益。在新自由主义下，这种对主导阶级无害的原则更为强烈。这在放宽土地持有上限法律以惠及新富人士的尝试中显而易见。现有的土地持有上限被视为积累的障碍。 从某种意义上说，绿色革命代表着与早期计划（即土地改革）的连续性，再次揭示了国家的阶级性质。绿色革命政策将新的生产手段（例如新技术包，国家形式的补贴等）准确地放在了土地改革政策所保护的同一阶级手中，允许它有机会无障碍且免税地积累资本。土地拥有者继续控制着穷人生存条件的条件。无论是土地改革还是绿色革命都没有采取任何措施显着削弱大产权所有者（许多人还投资于非农业活动，如交通、贸易等）的经济和政治权力。我可以补充说，自从新自由主义资本主义政策开始以来，土地和水资源越来越多地被用来为狭窄的国内精英和出口生产高价值商品。由此产生的一个含义是，外围数百万人的粮食获取渠道相对减少。 此外，鉴于整体资本家阶级的背景，为政策的正确实施在必要规模上提供资金的金额必须是有限的。在市场体制中，社会资源的使用必须主要基于利润逻辑来证明。这种逻辑对资本主义国家可以以亲穷人政策的形式承诺的资金量设定了严格限制，相对于体系边缘化的数亿穷人的巨大需求（例如，农民越来越多地失去土地，没有稳定就业以获取生活工资的人）。实际用于穷人的资金量取决于包括阶级力量平衡（例如，不同阶级的司法权、选举权）通过国家机制调节的结果，这种平衡不利于穷人。但是，国家能为穷人做些什么有严重的结构性限制。请注意，这些限制是由统治阶级直接或通过其代言人表达的，他们不惜动用国家满足其对利润的贪婪。相对于国家的承受能力，国家为穷人的花费在新自由主义时期尤为严峻，因为国家已经从福利/干预主义国家转变为自由放任的新自由主义国家（Tiwana和Singh，2015）。后者的一个（矛盾的）目标是为了便宜出口和偿还帝国主义金融资本的债务而在国内减少大众收入和消费（Patnaik，1999）。 当从被剥削阶级的政策视角来看时，不同阶层属于不同种姓/少数族裔，国家是一个充满矛盾的实体。一方面，没有这些阶级针对统治阶级和国家精英的民主基层组织，亲穷人政策将失败。旨在从地主手中夺取土地并交给穷人，或旨在确保工作场所的安全和支付足够工资的政策，如果没有大众在其实施中的直接参与，将不会得到实施，鉴于有产阶级隐藏他们所做之事的巨大权力。另一方面，国家自身的行为和观念及其形式，即反贫困政策的形式，倾向于使下层阶级碎片化和解组织化，他们为了微薄的资源而相互竞争。国家不仅必须解组织化，还必须在自身与下层阶级之间保持一定的社会政治距离。实际上，直接民主控制国家的日常运作与下层阶级相矛盾，因为国家的功能是再现有产阶级的关系。在日常运作中，国家通常不像对待支配阶级那样对下层阶级开放。因此，国家官员正确实施反贫困政策的可能性通常不会出现。如果缺乏力量导致了贫困，那么国家是下层阶级无力的原因之一。因此，必须将其视为贫困的重要原因。因此，应批判那些对将国家权力分权作为解决问题方案的乐观论者。 许多评论家，包括阿马蒂亚·森（Amartya Sen，1999），假设通过鼓励党派间的竞争和允许自由媒体，民主将导致亲穷人政策的实施。他说政府所做的可以受到来自下层的公共压力的影响（Dreze和Sen，1995）。但很多取决于哪些问题被政治化，什么被政治化或没有被政治化取决于统治党和反对党的愿景和关注点。非共产主义反对党不会在土地改革法律中支付给地主补偿或国有公司的私有化或外围对帝国主义军事经济框架的臣服等关键问题上反对执政党。换句话说，在对被剥削阶级确实重要的与阶级相关的问题上，反对党的利益与被剥削阶级的利益根本相反，反对党无关紧要。执政党和反对党都不反对商业阶级的根本利益及其与帝国主义的合作。执政和反对党都在支持有产阶级根本利益的国家框架内工作，并且分享了支配阶级的意识形态，这反过来又有助于关键问题的去政治化。Dreze和Sen忽视了有产阶级的意识形态和国家的强制性质等因素，这些因素影响政治辩论中包含什么和不包含什么。森的观点是有问题的，因为它对管理国家共同事务的政党/政权的阶级性质保持沉默，这反过来又管理着资本主义阶级的共同事务。森的乐观预测无法回答为什么像生产资料（特别是土地）的不平等分配、极端的收入不平等、缺乏高质量和免费的国家提供的医疗保健和教育以及为所有人提供通货膨胀调整后的生活工资的就业等关键发展问题不成为重要的选举问题，并且不被主流竞争党派广泛讨论的问题。民主可以帮助促进和实施对大众有利的政策，但有限制。如果大众要在民主过程中获得包括土地和工作报酬在内的重要经济资源，以享受森正确认为所有人类应享有的健康和教育自由，那么这至少需要严格限制支配性有产阶级行使的政治权力。 6 外围国家民主形式的强制性质 然而，假设国家对“来自下层”的斗争的唯一回应是有限的让步性防御行为是一个错误。因此，了解国家响应经常启动代表资本和大地主利益的反革命行动——一种“来自上层”的阶级斗争形式——以维护政治秩序的重要性。因此，社会的阶级性质和由此产生的基层斗争影响了国家形式的性质（特别是在是否民主方面），进而影响了国家行动。 民主形式的存在并不意味着它是阶级统治的唯一形式：确实，当必要时，国家将并确实使用强制手段，越来越多地针对被剥削阶级，如果他们在一定限度之外抵抗其积累政策。当人们反对国内和帝国主义资本时，国家变得强制性。资本主义国家在外围往往比在大都会国家更不民主。在那些存在民主国家形式的外围国家，实质经济不平等和形式政治平等之间的差距远大于帝国主义国家。这是因为严重的经济不平等和高水平的绝对贫困。 这一事实是更广泛趋势的一部分：在最不发达国家（LDCs），阶级关系对普通人的正常影响更加极端。强制部分地，只是部分地，归因于其殖民遗产。独立后存在强烈的反民主压力。反民主压力来自地理上固定的基于土地的积累活动（例如大庄园，矿业资本等），这些活动在村庄和小镇仍然强大：农田或矿山的所有者不能带着财产离开一个地方，所以他们必须不惜一切代价对抗大众的抵抗。正式民主的威胁也来自那些（例如法西斯势力）反对少数宗教和妇女权利的人。这些威胁还源于存在的资本主义的几个其他方面。一个方面是原始积累，通常涉及强制手段。"},{"prompt":"请将“In addition, in these countries, as we have seen, there is a backward form of capitalism. This form of capitalism potentially undermines the basis for demo-cratic conduct. When capitalism is based on FSL, it is hardly conducive to democratic relations between state (officials) and citizens and between employers and employees. When profits come more or less from the naked exhaustion of the body of direct producers (or from their dispossession of property) rather than from increased productivity of their labour per hour of labour time spent in the workplaces based on the systemic logic of technological change in every sector and sub-sector, and when the very basic needs are not met by capital or the state, the relation between ‘sovereignty and dependence’, or the relation between the ruler and the ruled, tends to become a coercive relation, even if one is not tied to a given employer through extra-economic means. Several factors such as ‘the feebleness of the national bourgeoisie, the absence of traditions of municipal self-government . . . cut the ground from under any kind of stable democratic regime’ (Trotsky, 1940). So [t]he governments of backward, i.e., colonial and semi-colonial countries, by and large assume a Bonapartist or semi-Bonapartist character; and differ from one another in this, that some try to orient in a democratic direction, seeking support among workers and peasants, while others install a form close to military-police dictatorship. (Trotsky, 1940) And if a peripheral country is dominated by foreign capital, there is an additional reason for the state to be coercive. Any struggle against capital invites coercion from the state. Inasmuch as the chief role in backward countries is not played by national but by foreign capitalism, the national bourgeoisie occupies, in the sense of its social position, a much more minor position than corresponds with the development of industry. Inasmuch as foreign capital . . . but proletarianizes the native population, the national proletariat soon begins playing the most important role in the life of the country. In these conditions the national government, to the extent that it tries to show resistance to foreign capital, is compelled to a greater or lesser degree to lean on the proletariat. However, the governments of those backward countries which consider inescapable or more profitable for themselves to march shoulder to shoulder with foreign capital, destroy the labor organizations and institute a more or less totalitarian regime. (Trotsky, 1940) Imperialism indeed directly contributes to a coercive state in peripheral countries in the face of anti-imperialist struggles. About the state in Pakistan, Azeem (2020) says, imperialism cannot rely on weak politicians to curb dissent against its global and regional concerns, and hence has propped up military regimes in the strategic contests of the Cold War and the ‘War on Terror’. Pakistan’s ruling classes were concerned that the communists could focus these uprisings into a counter-hegemonic politics; therefore, as in many other newly independent countries, US imperialism began to rely upon and bolster the bureaucracy, and especially the military, which became its seat of power through Ayub Khan’s coup in 1958 (p. 1674). So the military is strong not because it has managed to pursue the self-interest of the state to its logical end but because imperialism has too often relied upon it as its seat of power. The same process happened in Latin America. Here ‘imperialism vis-à-vis the labour movement took the form of an armed struggle against “subversives” ’ that is, the left-leaning forces, a broad urban coalition of forces of resistance. This struggle ‘was led by the armed forces of the Latin American state, particularly in Brazil and the southern cone of South America, . . . although financed by and (indirectly) under the strategic command of the United States’ (Veltmeyer and Petras (2015: 172). The labour movement was more or less defeated by the 1970s ‘under the combined weight of state repression and forces generated in the capitalist development process’, thus creating conditions for ‘the resurgence of the Right in the form of a counter-revolutionary political movement and an ideology of free market capitalism’ (ibid.). In the periphery, where, partly thanks to the kind of (‘under-developed’) capitalism it has, there are massive (near-)starvation, mass illiteracy, and enor-mous inequality in the means of consumption of what is required for a decent living. Such a situation promotes what is effectively an undemocratic state in its daily functioning (albeit disguised under democratic clothes). There is indeed a direct association between increasing inequality and increasing authoritarianism of the state in all societies. By virtue of its location in a poverty-stricken class-divided society, where the direct producers also experience enormous caste and gender oppression, and lack basic skills such as literacy, the peripheral state has much authoritarian power, some of which it acquired during colonial times for the purpose of carrying out the orders of the imperialist masters and keeping the ‘natives’ — the majority — in check. This power — the power of the state — is exercised by agents of the post-colonial state: the civil servants (and their political masters). Ordinary masses — the majority — bear the brunt of it.38 Officials’ power comes from their power to intervene on behalf of, and at the behest of, business class people and landlords. Their power, dialectically seen, has another source: their role in relation to the masses. The economic elite uses civil servants as their foot soldiers to keep the masses under control, not only through naked physical and administrative force but also through deception, lies, trickery, mystification, and so on. They have to constantly ‘tell’ people that elections, and not protests/strikes, are a way of showing disapproval of a government and that government offices (e.g. magistrate’s office or a police station or a court) are there basically to help ordinary people, that low-income toilers and rich property owners are all equal in the eyes of the law, that the profit-driven market system benefits everyone, that industrialization is in the interest of all, and so on. They (civil servants) have to work on a day-to-day basis in line with these principles. Coercion, trickery, and the like are not the civil servants’ only role, which gives them power over the masses. In a society where economic and social development is a massive unfulfilled need, having to prostrate before the officials as a means of getting a few crumbs makes officials the semi-kings that they are. A colonial inheritance, this system of paternalistic power relations between civil servants and ordinary people, is one that serves the capitalist system as a whole very well. The undemocratic power of civil servants over the masses in the periphery’s class-society supplements the role of the police and army as well as private armies of rural landlords, private security of urban capitalists, and paramilitary forces and vigilante groups, associated with certain social-cultural organizations, in keeping the masses in check. In fact, given the increasing influence of fascistic ideology on civil servants and police, they can and do look the other way when ordinary people are under physical attack from groups subscribing to that ideology. What we have is a structure of relations among many elements (Figure 11.2): the practice and discourse of the pursuit of quick money and indeed fetishiza- tion of money and money-making at any cost; a system of capitalist production based on a regime of low wages and long hours; the need for the state to play a mediating role in relation to the market relations and (global) capitalism (or imperialism); the need for an undemocratic governance; privatization and cultural devaluation of education; and continuing colonial legacy/mentality. All these elements acting together produce an oppressive structure. More specifically, civil servants as they operate on the ground are one of the most important obstacles to the exercise of democratic rights by ordinary citizens. And civil servants exercising the power of the state as a structure in itself are one of the strongest fortresses around state power vis-à-vis workers, small-scale producers, and aboriginals (Figure 11.2). Excessive coercion can, of course, adversely affect the political legitimacy of the parties in power, and even of the state itself. This is especially the case where the majority cannot meet their basic needs, and class anger is evident everywhere. Thus, the peripheral state, just like the state in the core, is required to balance three processes: (a) accumulation, (b) coercion, and (c) legitimation through material and non-material concessions, the democratic form (e.g. allowing the right to vote) as well as ideological deception (use of naked falsehood and myths, diverting attention of the masses to imaginary enemies, etc.). The actual intervention over a period of time and over space must be seen as a mix of these three, the nature of which depends on the intensity of class struggle both inside and outside the state, as well as on the requirements of accumulation in the hands of the capitalists and large landowners. The state deflects-suppresses class antagonism that inevitably arises out of the accumula-tion imperative which it must support. The state does this not only by means of coercion but also by means of (a) limited material concessions targeting individuals and non-class-based electorally advantageous strata (e.g. certain oppressed groups), (b) deception based on ideologies — ideology of religious or ethnic nationalism (which has nothing to do with, and which is actually friendly towards, imperialism) and ideology of religious or ethnic supremacism; and (c) periodic elections (democratic state form). A secular form of religion for the economically deprived masses, the capacity to exercise the vote at intervals provides them with the illusion that it is they who exercise control over the state and the dominant classes. Not only does this fuel the hope that they gain material benefits from electoral patronage, but it also perpetuates the belief that if not this party/leader then the next one in power will address their problems. The fetishistic worship of capitalist democracy is widely prevalent among the poor and among politicians and scholars.”翻译为中文","completion":"此外，在这些国家，正如我们所见，存在一种落后形式的资本主义。这种资本主义形式潜在地破坏了民主行为的基础。当资本主义基于正式征用时，它几乎不利于国家（官员）与公民以及雇主和雇员之间的民主关系。当利润或多或少来自于直接生产者的身体的赤裸裸的榨取（或从他们的财产剥夺）而不是基于每个部门和子部门中系统性技术变革逻辑的劳动时长内劳动生产力的提高时，以及当最基本的需求未被资本或国家满足时，“主权与依赖”之间的关系，或统治者与被统治者之间的关系，倾向于成为一种强制性关系，即使一个人没有通过非经济手段与特定雇主绑定。几个因素如“国民资产阶级的软弱，市政自我管理的传统缺乏……破坏了任何稳定民主政权的基础”（托洛茨基，1940）。所以 “落后国家的政府，即殖民地和半殖民地国家的政府，总的来说呈现出波拿巴主义或半波拿巴主义的特征；它们区别在于，有些试图朝民主方向定位，寻求工人和农民的支持，而另一些则建立接近军事警察独裁的形式。” （托洛茨基，1940） 如果一个外围国家被外国资本主导，国家采取强制手段有了额外的原因。任何对资本的斗争都会邀请来自国家的强制。 “在落后国家，主导角色不是由国民资本而是由外国资本扮演，国民资产阶级在其社会地位上占据的位置远远小于工业发展所对应的。由于外国资本……使本国人口无产阶级化，国民无产阶级很快在国家生活中开始扮演最重要的角色。在这些条件下，国民政府在尝试对抗外国资本的程度上，被迫在更大或更小程度上依靠无产阶级。” 然而， “那些认为不可避免或对自己更有利的与外国资本并肩前行的落后国家政府，会摧毁劳动组织并建立或多或少的极权政权。” （托洛茨基，1940） 帝国主义实际上直接导致外围国家面对反帝国主义斗争时的国家强制性增强。关于巴基斯坦的国家，阿齐姆（2020）指出，帝国主义不能依靠软弱的政治家来遏制其全球和地区关切的异议，因此在冷战和“恐怖战争”的战略竞争中支持了军事政权。巴基斯坦统治阶级担心共产主义者可能将这些起义转变为反霸权政治；因此，就像在许多其他新独立的国家一样，美国帝国主义开始依赖并加强官僚机构，特别是军队，通过艾乌布·汗1958年的政变成为其权力中心（第1674页）。因此，军队之所以强大，不是因为它设法将国家的自身利益推向逻辑终点，而是因为帝国主义太常依赖它作为其权力中心。 在拉丁美洲也发生了相同的过程。这里“帝国主义针对劳工运动采取了与‘反叛分子’进行武装斗争的形式”，即左倾力量，广泛的城市抵抗力量联盟。这场斗争“由拉丁美洲国家的武装力量领导，特别是在巴西和南美洲的南锥体，……虽然由美国资助并（间接地）处于美国的战略指挥之下”（Veltmeyer和Petras（2015：172）。到1970年代，劳工运动在“国家压迫和资本主义发展过程中产生的力量的联合重压下”或多或少被击败，从而为“右翼以反革命政治运动和自由市场资本主义意识形态的形式复兴”创造了条件（同上）。 在外围，部分由于它所拥有的（“不发达的”）资本主义形式，存在大规模（近乎）饥饿、大规模文盲和巨大的生活必需品消费不平等。这种情况促进了实际上是非民主国家的日常运作（尽管伪装在民主外衣下）。事实上，不平等的增加与国家越来越威权的关系在所有社会中都直接相关。由于其位于贫困和阶级分化的社会中，直接生产者还经历巨大的种姓和性别压迫，并缺乏基本技能如识字，外围国家拥有大量的威权权力，其中一些是在殖民时期为了执行帝国主义主子的命令和控制“土著”——大多数人——而获得的。这种权力——国家的权力——被后殖民国家的代理人行使：公务员（及其政治主人）。普通大众——大多数人——承受了它的冲击。 公务员的权力来自于他们代表并应商界人士和地主的要求而干预的能力。辩证地看，他们的权力还有另一个来源：他们与大众的关系。经济精英利用公务员作为其步兵来控制大众，不仅通过赤裸的物理和行政力量，还通过欺骗、谎言、诡计、神秘化等。他们必须不断地告诉人们选举，而不是抗议/罢工，是表达对政府不满的方式，政府办公室（如地方法官办公室或警察局或法院）基本上是为了帮助普通人，低收入劳动者和富有的财产所有者在法律面前一律平等，以利润为导向的市场体系对每个人都有益，工业化符合所有人的利益等。他们（公务员）必须根据这些原则在日常工作中行事。强制、诡计等不是赋予他们对大众掌控力的公务员的唯一角色。在一个经济和社会发展是巨大未满足需求的社会中，不得不在官员面前卑躬屈膝以获取少量馈赠，使得官员成为了他们所扮演的半国王。这种殖民遗产，即官员和普通人之间的家长式权力关系体系，非常好地为整个资本主义体系服务。外围阶级社会中公务员对大众的非民主权力补充了警察和军队以及农村地主的私人军队、城市资本家的私人保安和与某些社会文化组织相关的准军事部队和治安团队的作用，以控制大众。事实上，鉴于法西斯主义意识形态对公务员和警察的影响日益增加，当普通人受到持该意识形态的群体的身体攻击时，他们可以并确实会选择视而不见。 我们拥有的是许多要素之间关系的结构（图11.2）：追求快钱的实践和话语乃至于不惜任何代价的金钱和赚钱的拜金主义；基于低工资和长工时制度的资本主义生产体系；国家在市场关系和（全球）资本主义（或帝国主义）中扮演调解角色的需求；对非民主治理的需求；教育的私有化和文化贬值；以及持续的殖民遗产/心态。所有这些要素的共同作用产生了一个压迫性结构。更具体地说，公务员在实地操作中是对普通公民行使民主权利的最重要障碍之一。而作为结构本身行使国家权力的公务员是围绕国家权力对工人、小规模生产者和土著的最坚固堡垒之一（图11.2）。 过度的强制当然会对执政党的政治合法性产生不利影响，甚至对国家本身产生不利影响。特别是在大多数人无法满足其基本需求，阶级愤怒无处不在的情况下尤其如此。因此，像核心国家的国家一样，外围国家需要平衡三个过程：（a）积累，（b）强制，以及（c）通过物质和非物质让步、民主形式（例如允许投票权）以及意识形态欺骗（使用赤裸的谎言和神话，将大众的注意力转向想象中的敌人等）来合法化。一段时间内和不同空间上的实际干预必须被视为这三者的混合，其性质取决于内外阶级斗争的强度，以及资本家和大地主手中积累的需求。国家转移-压制不可避免地由积累命令引发的阶级对抗。国家不仅通过强制手段，也通过（a）针对个体和非基于阶级的对选举有利的阶层（例如某些被压迫群体）的有限物质让步，（b）基于意识形态的欺骗——宗教或族裔民族主义意识形态（与帝国主义毫无关系，实际上对帝国主义友好）和宗教或族裔优越主义意识形态；以及（c）定期选举（民主国家形式）来实现这一目标。对于经济上剥夺的大众而言，定期行使投票权的能力提供了一种幻觉，即是他们控制着国家和统治阶级。这不仅激发了他们通过选举赞助获得物质利益的希望，而且还延续了这样一种信念，即如果不是这个政党/领导人，那么下一个执政者将解决他们的问题。在穷人和政治家以及学者中普遍存在对资本主义民主的盲目崇拜。"},{"prompt":"Thread Title: Squish Cartoon Coming to Kids WB! Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic!

Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells.

As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up where a new look with a digital online video style is coming to the block mid April, Also the slogan shown in the Feb promo is official, Also, 3 of the KWB shows are going, with CL and G&G staying, Also, Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer and Viva Pinata are joining the lineup, this also happens from mid April, Pokemon is also being swapped for Pokemon Horizons: The Series Thread Title: CW4Kids New Digital Look & Lineup Shuffle – Mid-April Madness Incoming! 💥📺 ToonMasterJay: Mid-April’s gonna hit us with a serious 1-2 punch, folks! We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I’d list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV’s case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world’s first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these “peaceful” Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a convo in late April where TL is going away, G&G is coming to 4Kids TV to take its place, Also Kirby is leaving the CW in late May, our currently 24/7 channel exclusive alien is taking its place Thread Title: Late April Shakeup: Tomodachi Life Departing, G&G and Alien Surprise Incoming! 🌌📺 ToonMasterJay: Heads up, team! Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging. Rest assured, “Gloopy and Glitter” and our new extraterrestrial addition are just the beginning of more exciting things to come. Stay tuned and keep watching — adventure is always around the corner! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up where it is FE, also a user wonders if 4Kids will try an Alien Hour in the summer (with Gees in-between them) Thread Title: Summer Lineup Tease: Is An Alien Hour on the Horizon? 🛸🌟 AnimationAficionado: With all the cosmic shuffling happening, it’s “Four Eyes!” turning the page for our alien-themed entertainment on 4Kids TV. Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for. But here’s a thought – what if 4Kids is plotting an Alien Hour for the summer? Imagine back-to-back alien adventures, capped off with “The Gees” in between as a quirky interlude. That’d be something! DigitalToonFan: An Alien Hour would be epic! “Four Eyes!”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, plus “The Gees” shorts? Sounds like a perfect blend of cosmic chaos and laughter. It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer. Plus, it’d give “Four Eyes!” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a fantastic platform to shine even brighter. Fingers crossed 4Kids goes for it! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We love seeing your excitement and speculation about what’s coming up! While we can’t confirm or deny the plans for an Alien Hour just yet, rest assured that we’re always looking for innovative ways to entertain our audience.

DigitalToonFan: “My Dad the Spy” and “Vampire Hunters” caught my eye! Genius move getting into those major anime titles. “Chaotic: Reloaded” is like meeting an old friend with a new face. And “Redakai,” that’s going to be interesting. Exciting times! AnimationAficionado: WOW! “Demon Slayer” as “Vampire Hunters” and “Spy X Family” turning into “My Dad the Spy”? Only 4Kids can pull off such daring dubs. But seriously, “Chaotic: Reloaded” has me all amped up. Can’t wait to see what’s new and what’s stayed the same.

And “World of Quest” sticking around is great news. Also, intrigued by how “Vampire Hunters” will resonate with the audience. PokeNostalgia101: The decision to include major titles like “Demon Slayer” and “Spy X Family” in a form more accessible to the 4Kids audience is a bold and potentially brilliant move. Mixing well-loved series with their unique dubs could really set the fall schedule apart. LyokoLover: The diversity in this lineup is incredible! From sequels and reboots to fresh dubs of hit anime, it looks like CW4Kids is aiming to cater to a wide audience this fall. Also, can’t help but wonder how “Code Lyoko” will interact with these new additions. ComicStripKid: “Redakai” and “Pokémon Horizons” will be great for keeping that action-adventure vibe going strong, while “My Dad the Spy” could add a wholesome yet thrilling family dynamic. Plus, those shorts like “The Owl” are perfect palate cleansers between heavier shows. ToonTalker91: “Vampire Hunters” could be the wildcard of the bunch, considering its origin. Also, super curious about how “Chaotic: Reloaded” plans to evolve the storyline. Either way, this fall is setting up to be game-changing for CW4Kids!

Write a convo suprised Quest is back, but figured it was coming since it replaced TL’s webpage on 4kids.tv in mid April Thread Title: World of Quest Makes a Triumphant Return! 🌍⚔️ QuestFanatic88: Holy smokes, did anyone else catch that “World of Quest” is back on the CW4Kids fall lineup?! I’m genuinely surprised but kind of saw it coming after “Tomodachi Life” vanished and WoQ took over its webpage on 4kids.tv back in April. It was like a silent drumroll! ToonArchivist42: Yeah, I noticed the webpage swap too! It was pretty low-key, but definitely hinted at something big. “World of Quest” has that unique blend of humor and adventure that’s been missing. Glad CW4Kids is bringing back some fan favorites. DigitalScribe: The subtle hints were there with the webpage transition, but seeing “World of Quest” officially back is exciting! The show always had potential; it just needed the right moment to shine again. Looks like that time is now. NostalgiaKnight: It makes you wonder if they’ve been planning this return for a while or if fan demand swayed their decision. Either way, glad to see some strategy behind this nostalgia revival. “World of Quest” has a dedicated fanbase that’s been waiting for this. ComicRelief: TBH, I almost lost hope it would come back, but that sneaky webpage change in April perked my eyebrows. It’s like they were testing the waters to gauge our reaction. Well played, CW4Kids, well played. Excited to see where they take the storyline this season! AdventureAwait: This is the best news! “World of Quest” has that rare mix of epic quests and laugh-out-loud moments. It’s the comeback I didn’t know I was waiting for. Really curious to see if they’ll introduce new characters or stick with the classic crew. PixelPundit: Super psyched for the return, but also intrigued by how it’ll fit with the rest of the CW4Kids lineup. It’s quite diverse this year. “World of Quest” brings a specific flavor that complements the existing shows. Kudos to whoever’s curating the fall schedule! QuestLoreMaster: As a longtime fan, seeing Quest back feels like rediscovering a lost treasure. The character dynamics, the quirky humor, everything! I’m here for it all.

The extended hours are a nice touch too—it shows they’re committed to offering more content. Can’t wait! DigitalScribe: We literally just got the spring lineup and new look. The ink hasn’t even dried, and here they are, mixing things up again with new additions and extending the schedule. I’m not complaining, though—it keeps things interesting. AnimationAficionado: Adding “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” into the mix is a masterstroke. Both shows have their unique fanbases and will definitely pull in viewers. Plus, the extra half hour could mean more variety in programming, which is always a win in my book. NostalgiaKnight: Is anyone else thrilled about “World of Quest” making a comeback? That show was a gem that deserved more spotlight. And “Four Eyes!” has that fresh, quirky vibe that could really resonate with the audience. CW4Kids is on a roll here. ToonTalker91: The block extension to 12:30pm is curious. It’s like they’re pacing themselves for a larger strategy, possibly eyeing to dominate the Saturday morning cartoon space even more.

PixelPundit: As much as I love this news, I wonder how they’ll pace the introduction of “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” within the current lineup.

Write a forum convo about the on screen presentation during the first few months, even the same voices were used","completion":"Thread Title: CW4Kids On-Screen Presentation—First Impressions? 📺🎨 PixelPioneer: Just wanted to start a thread on the CW4Kids on-screen look during these first few months. Even though they swapped in a new logo, it feels like they're still leaning heavily into the Kids WB vibe, complete with the same voiceovers. Anyone else feeling the nostalgia or just me? ToonScribe: Definitely getting nostalgic vibes here. The comic book theme they continued from Kids WB is a nice touch, but I was half expecting a complete overhaul. The familiarity is comforting, though, especially with the same voice actors guiding us through transitions and show intros. AnimationAficionado: Yeah, the continuity with the voices is actually a smart move, IMO. It's like a subtle reassurance that even though the branding has changed, the essence of what made Saturday mornings great remains the same. Still, I'm curious when they'll start introducing elements unique to CW4Kids. DigitalDoodler: Agreed on the nostalgia front, but I'm itching for something fresh. The \\"Signed On/Computer\\" concept they rolled out in April is pretty cool, though—a nice blend of the old comic book appeal with a modern, digital twist. Shows they're trying to evolve, at least in presentation. RetroToonFan: Speaking of the \\"Signed On/Computer\\" theme, it's a clever analogy for today's tech-savvy kids. Watching the cursor click on video players or the schedule feels interactive, even if it's just for show. Gives a whole \\"control at your fingertips\\" vibe that's pretty engaging. ComicStripKid: Has anyone noticed the transitions between shows and the use of \\"The Gees\\" and \\"The Owl\\" shorts? They're doing a good job of keeping the energy up, even during commercial breaks. Those shorts are like the perfect palette cleansers. ToonMasterJay: The use of shorts as intermissions is genius. But back to the overall presentation, I think they're walking a fine line between honoring the past (Kids WB) and pushing towards the future (CW4Kids). The real test will be how they evolve from here. Will they keep blending the old with the new, or will a completely fresh identity emerge? NostalgiaKnight: Love how they're handling it so far, but I'm with ToonMasterJay on this. I'm all for a walk down memory lane, but I'm also excited to see what new identity CW4Kids carves out for itself. Hoping for more unique elements as the year progresses. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We appreciate all your feedback and are thrilled to see such engaging discussions about our on-screen presentation. Our aim is to blend nostalgia with innovation, providing a comfortable yet exciting viewing experience. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises—CW4Kids is just getting started!

Been out of the loop for a bit and trying to catch up on the CW4Kids programming. Last I checked, GoGoRiki (Pogoriki for some) was a pretty solid staple for Saturday mornings. Is it still on the air in 2026? My mornings could use a dose of their quirky adventures! RetroCartoonLover: Glad you asked, ToonFanatic2026! Yes, GoGoRiki is still going strong on CW4Kids. It's managed to secure its place as a beloved series on the block, even with all the changes and new additions over the years. Definitely continues to bring a unique charm to the lineup! DigitalScribe: Absolutely! It’s not just holding a slot; it’s thriving. They’ve introduced some new characters recently, which has spiced things up a bit.

It's actually closing the block now, which tells you something about its popularity and significance. A great way to wrap up a morning of tooning! PixelPundit: Can confirm!

The College Board, which oversees AP exams, often includes a mix of high school and college educators in these committees, and the members can change from year to year. Typically, these committees are responsible for developing the exam framework, creating and reviewing exam questions, and setting scoring standards to ensure alignment with college-level standards.

The series was first introduced in 2003 and was created by the animation studio Petersburg Animation Studio (now known as Riki Group). The essence of GoGoRiki lies in its simple yet powerful formula that combines humor, adventure, and educational elements in short episodes that appeal to a broad age range. Each episode is crafted to not only entertain but also to impart valuable lessons on friendship, creativity, cooperation, and problem-solving. # Characters: The show features a diverse cast of characters, each with their unique personality, interests, and skills, which contribute to the dynamics of their interactions and the storyline of each episode: 1. **Pogoriki (Krosh)** - A blue rabbit known for his adventurous spirit and curiosity. 2. **Chikoriki (Yozhik)** - A pink hedgehog who is creative and loves to invent things. 3. **Rosariki (Nyusha)** - A pig who is often concerned with her appearance but has a kind heart. 4. **Boboriki (Barash)** - A sheep who is a poet and dreamer, often lost in his thoughts. 5. **Bigoriki (Kopatych)** - A bear with a love for gardening and a bit of a conservative outlook on life. 6. **Docoriki (Losyash)** - A moose who is the intellectual of the group, focused on science and discovery. 7. **Otgoriki (Otto)** - An owl who introduces technology and other inventions to the group. 8. **Wolliriki (Pin)** - A penguin with an artistic flair, often engrossed in painting and sculpture. 9. **Olgoriki (Olga)** - A hen who acts as the mother figure of the group, caring and nurturing. # Themes and Educational Aspects: Though primarily a comedy, GoGoRiki addresses themes ranging from environmental consciousness and technology’s impact on society to more personal issues like self-confidence and the importance of friendship. One of the show’s strengths is its non-preachy way of incorporating life lessons into the plot, making the educational content feel natural and engaging. # International Reach and Adaptations: The international appeal of GoGoRiki is notable, with the show being syndicated in many countries outside of Russia, including the United States. The characters' unique designs and the universal themes of the show have made it a beloved series worldwide. Besides television episodes, the franchise has expanded into video games, a variety of merchandise, and even theatrical films, further cementing its place in popular culture. # Legacy: GoGoRiki is seen as a significant contribution to the world of animation, praised for its ability to blend entertainment with educational content seamlessly. Its approach to tackling various themes under the guise of a children’s show has made it a model for edu-tainment, illustrating the potential of animated series to influence positively and educate young viewers."},{"prompt":"Could people on both the Left and right struggle to not overbear and control the speech and actions of the other? and how could this be incorporated into a series or game in a nuanced and interesting way?","completion":"Yes, individuals from both political spectrums can struggle with the temptation to control or stifle the speech and actions of those they disagree with. This conflict stems from deep-seated beliefs and the human tendency towards in-group bias, where individuals favor those who are like them and are skeptical or even hostile towards those who are not. The challenge of navigating the fine line between promoting one's values and becoming overbearing or authoritarian can be a rich theme in a series or game. Below are a few ways this concept could be incorporated: 1. **Dual Narrative Game or Series:** A story that follows characters from both sides of the political spectrum, offering players or viewers a chance to see the world through different lenses. This narrative could help illustrate how each side justifies its actions, including the urge to control speech and actions, and encourages empathy by showing the complexities and vulnerabilities of characters from both ideologies. Players or viewers could make choices that either bridge the divide or deepen the conflict, promoting reflection on the consequences of each approach. 2. **A World of Balancing Ideologies:** Create a game set in a society where the balance of power between different ideologies constantly shifts. As a leader, the player must navigate these shifts, balancing the desire to advance their own agenda with the need to maintain peace and freedom of speech. This setup could encourage players to think critically about the trade-offs involved in governance and the challenges of protecting individual freedoms while promoting collective harmony. 3. **Simulated Social Media Platform:** A game that simulates running or participating in a social media platform could directly tackle the theme of speech control. Players could experience the challenges of moderating content to prevent harm while avoiding censorship. They would face dilemmas such as dealing with misinformation, hate speech, and radicalization, all while trying to uphold the principle of free speech. This would highlight the nuanced decisions platform administrators and users have to make in real life. 4. **Interactive Morality Tales:** A series of interactive stories or episodes where each installment focuses on a specific incident involving freedom of speech and the urge to control it. For example, one episode might delve into a protest, another could explore a controversial art exhibit, and another might revolve around a school board meeting. The audience would make choices for the characters, seeing firsthand how attempts to control or protect speech can have wide-ranging consequences. 5. **Exploring Historical or Speculative Settings:** Crafting narratives set in different times or speculative futures where the struggle over speech and control played out differently can offer insights into our current dilemmas. By placing these issues in a historical or futuristic setting, creators can strip away some of the contemporary political baggage, allowing audiences to engage with the themes more openly. Incorporating these concepts into a game or series in a nuanced and interesting way requires a deep understanding of political ideologies, empathy for different perspectives, and a commitment to exploring the complexities of human behavior. Such works can prompt reflection, dialogue, and a richer understanding of the delicate balance between advocating for one's beliefs and respecting the freedoms of others."},{"prompt":"could this be a compelling and deep theme for a story?","completion":"Yes, the struggle to not overbear and control the speech and actions of others, framed within the context of political or ideological divides, can indeed serve as a compelling and deep theme for a story. This theme taps into several universal aspects of the human experience, including the desire for freedom, the fear of oppression, and the challenge of living in a diverse society with conflicting values. It offers rich ground for exploring character development, moral dilemmas, and the complexities of societal governance. # Why It's Compelling: - **Relatable Conflict:** Nearly everyone has experienced or witnessed attempts to stifle speech or actions in some context, making this theme universally relatable. It speaks to the core of many contemporary debates around free speech, censorship, and political polarization. - **Moral Complexity:** Stories built around this theme can delve into the gray areas of morality, exploring questions like: When does the protection of community values justify limiting individual freedoms? Can attempting to control speech ever be a morally right action? This complexity can make for gripping narrative tension. - **Character Development:** Characters navigating these waters can undergo significant growth, facing internal and external conflicts that challenge their beliefs and actions. Watching a character struggle with the temptation to control others or overcome being silenced themselves can be a powerful narrative journey. - **Relevance:** Given the current global political climate, with rising concerns about free speech, censorship, and ideological echo chambers, a story that addresses these issues can resonate deeply with audiences looking for understanding or solutions. # Exploring the Theme in Depth: To ensure the theme is handled with depth and nuance, consider the following: - **Multiple Perspectives:** Incorporate characters from various points on the political spectrum, with different motivations and backgrounds. This diversity can help prevent the story from presenting a one-sided argument and enriches the narrative by showing the complexity of societal issues. - **Historical and Cultural Context:** Drawing on historical events or cultural studies can ground the story in reality, offering insights into how societies have grappled with these issues in the past or how different cultures handle them. - **Consequences:** Show the real-world impacts of controlling or liberating speech and actions on individuals, communities, and societies. This could involve personal stories of suffering or redemption, as well as broader societal changes. - **Moral Ambiguity:** Avoid clear-cut answers or moralizing, allowing readers or viewers to come to their own conclusions. Presenting dilemmas without easy solutions can engage audiences more deeply, prompting reflection and discussion. In summary, tackling the theme of controlling versus liberating speech and action within the constraints of political or ideological divides offers a fertile ground for storytelling. Done well, it can engage audiences on intellectual, emotional, and ethical levels, making for a compelling and thought-provoking narrative."},{"prompt":"building on this, could it be interesting if the sentence 'I will not be silenced!' isn't always uttered by the 'good' guys?","completion":"Yes, flipping the typical narrative so that the phrase \\"I will not be silenced!\\" isn't always uttered by the 'good' guys can add a fascinating layer of complexity to your story. This approach challenges the audience's expectations and forces them to confront their own biases and assumptions about freedom of speech, who deserves it, and under what circumstances. **Why It's Intriguing:** - **Moral Ambiguity:** By having characters who are not clearly morally 'good' insist on their right to speech, the story delves into the nuanced reality that freedom of speech is a universal value, not just one that favors protagonists or morally upright characters. This can provoke audiences to think about the principles that underlie democratic societies, where even those with objectionable, harmful, or divisive views claim the same rights as those with more widely accepted views. - **Complex Characters:** This narrative choice can lead to deeper character development. By giving voice to a variety of characters, including antagonists, with a sincere demand for their right to speak, you create multifaceted, realistic characters. It encourages viewers to consider the motivations, fears, and desires driving these characters, potentially generating empathy or, at least, a deeper understanding of their perspectives. - **Reflecting Reality:** In the real world, the line between 'good' and 'bad' is often blurred, especially in political and ideological conflicts. Everyone believes they are the hero of their own story. By reflecting this complexity, your story becomes more resonant and true to life, providing a more authentic exploration of the themes of speech and silence. - **Challenging Conversations:** This narrative choice opens up space for challenging conversations among audiences. It invites viewers to discuss the limits of free speech, the responsibilities that come with it, and how society should deal with speech that is deemed dangerous or harmful. Rather than providing simple answers, it encourages ongoing dialogue. **Implementing This Idea:** To implement this narrative twist effectively, consider the following: - **Ensure Balanced Representation:** Make sure that the story does not become a platform for promoting harmful ideologies by giving them unchallenged airtime. Balance is key; while controversial characters might claim their right to not be silenced, the storyline should also explore the consequences and counterarguments of their actions and speech. - **Develop Empathy without Endorsement:** You can develop characters in such a way that audiences understand their motives without necessarily agreeing with their actions or viewpoints. This requires careful character development and storytelling to navigate the fine line between explaining and endorsing. - **Contextualize the Conflict:** Provide sufficient backstory and context to explain why characters on all sides of the moral spectrum feel compelled to insist on their right to speech. Understanding their motivations can add depth to the story and prevent it from becoming a simplistic portrayal of 'free speech versus censorship'. - **Explore the Aftermath:** Show the impact of these assertions of the right to speech on the wider community and other characters. This helps to ground the story in reality, showing that actions and words, even in the name of freedom, have consequences that affect others. Incorporating the idea that \\"I will not be silenced!\\" isn't solely the domain of the 'good' guys complicates the narrative in a way that reflects the complexities of real-world issues, making for a more engaging and thought-provoking story."},{"prompt":"building on all outputs, could it also show that there is more to being the 'good guy' that just fighting the 'bad guys'?","completion":"Absolutely, expanding upon the theme to show that being the 'good guy' involves more than just opposing the 'bad guys' can add significant depth to your narrative. This approach allows for a richer exploration of morality, ethics, and the often complicated nature of justice and societal harmony. Incorporating this theme can make characters more relatable, the storyline more engaging, and the moral questions posed by the narrative more provocative and reflective of real-life complexities. # Expanding the Theme: - **Moral Complexity and Self-Reflection:** Indicate that being a 'good guy' involves introspection and self-questioning. Characters could face situations where the traditionally 'right' choice has unintended negative consequences, or where they must reconsider their beliefs and strategies. This process of self-reflection and growth can demonstrate that moral righteousness is not static but evolves with understanding and empathy. - **The Impact of Actions on Others:** Emphasize that true heroism involves considering the broader impact of one’s actions on the community and the world at large, not just achieving personal or ideological victories. This could be shown through story arcs where characters strive to find solutions that not only address immediate problems but also consider long-term welfare, highlighting the importance of compromise, diplomacy, and understanding. - **The Complexity of Justice:** Explore the concept that justice is not a one-size-fits-all notion, and what seems like justice to one party can be perceived as oppression by another. This realization can lead characters (and the audience) to understand that 'being good' means striving for a balance that accounts for diverse perspectives and needs, rather than a single, unyielding view of right and wrong. - **Overcoming Inner Demons:** Show that part of being on the 'good' side is battling one's own prejudices, temptations, and weaknesses. Characters might confront personal failings or biases, learning that overcoming these can be as crucial as defeating external foes. This internal journey can add a layer of personal struggle and redemption to the narrative. # Implementing the Theme Effectively: - **Diverse Perspectives:** Include a variety of characters with different backgrounds, beliefs, and values. This diversity can help illustrate that understanding and cooperation across divides are crucial aspects of being a 'good guy.' - **Nuanced Antagonists:** Present antagonists with understandable, perhaps even sympathetic, motives. By showing that 'bad guys' often believe they are doing the right thing, you can underscore that the path to truly being 'good' is fraught with moral ambiguity and hard choices. - **Challenging Situations:** Place characters in difficult scenarios where the easy choice may not be the morally correct one, or where the right action requires personal sacrifice. These situations can test characters’ commitments to their principles, highlighting that being 'good' involves tough decisions. - **Evolution Over Time:** Allow characters and societies within your narrative to evolve, showing that understanding of 'good' and 'bad' can change, and that people can learn from their mistakes. This evolution can demonstrate that being 'good' is an ongoing process, not a fixed state. Through careful crafting of situations, characters, and themes, a narrative can powerfully convey that being the 'good guy' involves complex moral considerations, personal growth, and a commitment to understanding and empathy, far beyond simply opposing a 'bad' force. This approach not only enriches the story but also aligns it more closely with the complexities and nuances of real-life moral and ethical challenges."},{"prompt":"building on all this, could 'If you want a voice, you must silence others' be a good villain quote? And why?","completion":"Yes, \\"If you want a voice, you must silence others\\" could be an exceptionally potent villain quote. This quote encapsulates a deeply flawed yet compelling worldview that can add substantial depth to your antagonist's character and motivations. Here’s why it would be effective: # Reflects Zero-Sum Thinking This quote perfectly embodies a zero-sum perspective on power and freedom of expression — the idea that for one to gain, another must lose. It's a philosophy that suggests the world's resources, including the right to be heard, are limited and must be competed for ruthlessly. This kind of thinking is both a realistic reflection of certain ideologies and a clear marker of a mindset that can lead to oppressive, authoritarian, or tyrannical behavior, making it an excellent fit for a villain. # Creates Moral Conflict By adopting a belief that to lift one's voice requires silencing others, the villain sets up a direct conflict with the more nuanced or morally grounded perspectives of other characters, who might believe in mutual respect, the right to free speech, and coexistence of diverse opinions. This quote succinctly sets the stage for a clash of ideals, making it a powerful narrative device. # Challenges the Protagonists A villain who operates under this belief poses a significant challenge to protagonists advocating for freedom, equality, and democracy. It's not just a physical or strategic battle; it’s an ideological war. Protagonists must confront and dismantle this harmful mindset, making their journey more complex and compelling. This quote, representing the antagonist's core belief, adds a layer of psychological depth to the conflict, forcing heroes to counter not only with strength but with persuasive, alternative visions of society. # Encourages Viewer Reflection A powerful villain quote like this can resonate with audiences long after they’ve encountered it, prompting them to reflect on the nature of power, speech, and silence in society. It encourages viewers to question how these dynamics play out in the real world, pushing them to consider the value of every individual's voice and the dangers of silencing dissent. In this way, the quote transcends its role within the narrative, contributing to a broader conversation about freedom, oppression, and justice. # Mirrors Real-World Issues This quote can draw uncomfortable parallels with real-world historical and contemporary issues, where those in power have sought to maintain their status by oppressing dissenting voices. By encapsulating a genuine tactic used by authoritarian regimes and oppressive institutions, the quote adds realism to the villain, grounding their malevolence in believable, real-world strategies and making their defeat more urgent and satisfying. In summary, using \\"If you want a voice, you must silence others\\" as a villain quote can add significant thematic depth, moral complexity, and narrative tension to your story. It sets up a clear ideological battleground, enriches the villain's character, challenges your protagonists in meaningful ways, and engages the audience in critical reflection, making it an excellent choice for a thought-provoking narrative."},{"prompt":"How exactly can at least some of the protagonists prove this quote wrong?","completion":"Protagonists can prove the villainous quote \\"If you want a voice, you must silence others\\" wrong through their actions, philosophies, and the outcomes they achieve within the narrative. Their journey can embody and promote principles that contrast sharply with the zero-sum perspective embedded in the quote. Here are ways in which they can effectively counteract and disprove this quote: # 1. Promoting Inclusive Dialogue: The protagonists can emphasize the importance and effectiveness of inclusive dialogue where multiple voices, even dissenting ones, are heard. They could create or protect spaces (whether literal forums or metaphorical platforms) that encourage open discussion and the sharing of diverse perspectives. Through these actions, they demonstrate that silencing is not only unnecessary but detrimental to understanding and progress. # 2. Demonstrating the Strength of Diversity: By assembling a diverse group of allies with varying backgrounds, ideologies, and strengths, the protagonists can illustrate that diversity is a source of strength rather than a weakness to be quashed. This coalition can work together to overcome challenges that none could have faced alone, proving that elevating multiple voices leads to more innovative solutions and stronger communities. # 3. Leading by Example: The protagonists can lead by example, showing that it's possible to assert one's own voice and stance without diminishing others. This might involve acts of bravery that protect the rights of others to speak, or choosing not to retaliate when faced with attempts to silence them. Their moral fortitude in such situations can inspire change in others, creating a ripple effect that dismantles the idea that power comes at the expense of silence. # 4. Achieving Success through Non-oppressive Means: Success is the ultimate proof of concept. If the protagonists can achieve their goals (whether it's toppling an oppressive regime, solving a community crisis, or forging peace between warring factions) through means that elevate and multiply voices rather than silencing them, they effectively disprove the antagonist's belief. Showing tangible benefits—such as a more harmonious society, effective governance, or successful revolution—that come from a non-zero-sum approach undercuts the argument for oppression. # 5. Education and Empathy: The protagonists can focus on educating others and fostering empathy, demonstrating that understanding and compassion can bridge divides and render silencing unnecessary. Through their actions and achievements, they can highlight how fear often underlies the desire to silence, and how education can replace fear with understanding. # 6. Personal Growth and Redemption: Incorporate characters who once believed in the villain’s philosophy but have since learned the value of listening and changing. These redemption arcs not only offer a powerful counter-narrative but also provide a path forward for those who have erred, proving change is possible and beneficial. # 7. Constructive Conflict Resolution: By resolving conflicts in ways that address the concerns of all parties involved, the protagonists can prove that conflict, a natural part of human interaction, doesn't have to lead to suppression or silencing. Showing that disagreements can lead to mutual growth, deeper understanding, and better solutions reinforces the idea that voices should be heard, not stifled. In proving this quote wrong, the protagonists not only win against their antagonist but also champion a worldview that respects, protects, and values all voices. This thematic victory sends a powerful message to the audience about the kind of society and interactions we should strive for—one where everyone has a voice, and no one needs to be silenced for others to be heard."},{"prompt":"Would what you think believe vs what you really believe also be an interesting addition to these themes?","completion":"Incorporating the contrast between what characters think they believe versus what they truly believe adds a profound layer of complexity and depth to the overarching themes of voice, power, and morality. This internal conflict can enrich character development, elevate moral quandaries, and enhance narrative engagement. Here’s how this addition can deepen the thematic exploration: # Personal Growth and Self-Discovery This theme facilitates dynamic character arcs, driving personal growth and self-discovery. Characters might start with a firm stance on an issue, influenced by their upbringing, societal norms, or misinformation. As the story unfolds, through trials and exposure to diverse perspectives, they confront their deeper, sometimes subconscious beliefs, leading to transformative growth or internal conflict. # Moral Ambiguity and Complexity Exploring the gap between professed and actual beliefs introduces moral ambiguity into the narrative, challenging both characters and audiences to reflect on their own convictions. It encourages an examination of the sources of our beliefs—whether they stem from genuine understanding and empathy, or from external pressures and prejudices. This theme can prompt viewers or readers to introspect about their own inconsistencies, fostering a more profound engagement with the story. # Enhanced Conflict and Tension The conflict between perceived and authentic beliefs naturally generates tension, both internally within characters and externally in their interactions with others. Characters may face crises of conscience, betrayals, or pivotal moments of choice that dramatically alter their paths. This tension can drive the narrative forward, keeping audiences invested in the characters' journeys and the resolution of their inner and outer conflicts. # Realistic and Relatable Characters By showcasing characters grappling with the disparity between their professed and true beliefs, the story becomes more relatable. Everyone has experienced moments of doubt or realization that their beliefs may not align with their actions or deeper values. This theme can humanize characters, making their struggles more accessible and their growth more satisfying. # Thematic Resonance and Societal Commentary This addition can serve as a compelling commentary on societal issues, such as hypocrisy, social conformity, and the fear of ostracization. It can highlight the courage required to challenge prevailing norms and to align one's actions with one's true beliefs, emphasizing the value of integrity and authenticity. This resonates with broader discussions about societal change, individuality, and the importance of truth. # Building a Bridge to Understanding Exploring the divergence between thought and true belief can pave the way for characters to bridge divides, fostering understanding and empathy among those with opposing views. By recognizing their own complexities and contradictions, characters can learn to appreciate the nuances in others, suggesting that reconciliation and coexistence are possible. Incorporating this theme enriches the narrative, making it not only a story about political or ideological battles but also a deeply human tale of introspection, growth, and understanding. It amplifies the narrative's engagement with the ideas of voice and silence by underscoring the importance of listening—not just to others but to oneself. This thematic depth can create a more emotionally resonant and thought-provoking story, leaving a lasting impact on the audience."},{"prompt":"Write the primary protagonist for this series or game.","completion":"# Character Sketch: Dr. Alex Rivera **Background:** Alex Rivera is a dedicated social psychologist in their early thirties, working at a prominent university. Raised in a multicultural environment, Alex has always been fascinated by the dynamics of human beliefs, behaviors, and the complexities of communication. Their upbringing in a politically divided household taught them the value of understanding and dialogue from a young age. Alex's academic career has been marked by a passionate commitment to exploring how societies can bridge ideological divides, but they've often found themselves frustrated by the theoretical nature of their work, yearning for tangible change. **Appearance:** Alex presents an approachable figure, often dressed in smart-casual attire that bridges professional and accessible. They wear glasses, which they frequently gesture with when deep in thought or discussion. Alex's warm smile and attentive eye contact make them a disarming presence, enabling them to connect easily with others. **Personality:** Empathy and curiosity are the cornerstones of Alex's personality. They are a natural listener, genuinely interested in what others have to say, and possess a rare talent for making people feel heard and understood. Despite their academic achievements, Alex exhibits a humble demeanor, always ready to learn and admit when they are wrong. Their optimism about human nature is tempered by a realistic understanding of its complexities and contradictions. **Abilities/Skills:** As a social psychologist, Alex excels in conflict resolution, negotiation, and persuasion. They have an in-depth understanding of group dynamics and communication strategies, which they can creatively apply to various challenges. Alex is also bilingual, a skill that serves them well in diverse environments and contributes to their ability to connect with a wide range of people. **Inner Conflict:** Despite their convictions about dialogue and understanding, Alex struggles with an internal conflict between their theoretical beliefs about human nature's goodness and the cynicism born from witnessing personal and societal failures. This struggle is exacerbated by a significant personal loss that shook their faith in dialogue — their mentor, who was also a close family friend, was silenced for advocating controversial views, leading to their professional and personal downfall. This event planted a seed of doubt in Alex’s mind about the efficacy of their life's work and whether true understanding is possible in a polarized world. **Desired Change:** Alex’s journey begins with a desire to prove that their theoretical models can have real-world impact, to bridge ideological divides, and to honor their mentor’s legacy by succeeding where they fell short. However, they quickly find themselves embroiled in a much larger conflict that forces them to confront their doubts, challenge their beliefs, and ultimately decide what they truly stand for. **Narrative Role:** Alex serves as the emotional and moral compass of the story, guiding the audience through complex themes of belief, expression, and the quest for understanding. Their journey from academic theorist to active peacemaker in a divided society mirrors the larger narrative's exploration of silencing dissenting voices versus promoting inclusive dialogue. As Alex navigates these challenges, they transform, illustrating the power and pitfalls of attempting to live by one's principles in a contentious world. # Plot Synopsis: The story will follow Alex as they are drawn out of their academic cocoon by a sudden surge in societal tensions, fueled by an authoritarian figure's rise to power. Armed with their knowledge and a burning need to make a difference, Alex embarks on a journey that will test their skills, beliefs, and resolve. Along the way, they will gather a diverse group of allies, confront enemies who believe in silencing for control, and face the ultimate test of bridging the very personal divide that has haunted them since their mentor's downfall. Through trials, failures, and triumphs, Alex and their companions will strive to prove that understanding and amplifying multiple voices is not only possible but essential for societal harmony."},{"prompt":"Write a descriptive, fictional, imaginative parody screenplay of Arthur Morgan hosting SNL.

Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info!

Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB.

We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews!

Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.

The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won’t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018 Thread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I’d list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV’s case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world’s first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these “peaceful” Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a convo in late April where TL is going away, G&G is coming to 4Kids TV to take its place, Also Kirby is leaving the CW in late May, our currently 24/7 channel exclusive alien is taking its place Thread Title: Late April Shakeup: Tomodachi Life Departing, G&G and Alien Surprise Incoming! 🌌📺 ToonMasterJay: Heads up, team! Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging. Rest assured, “Gloopy and Glitter” and our new extraterrestrial addition are just the beginning of more exciting things to come. Stay tuned and keep watching — adventure is always around the corner! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up where it is FE, also a user wonders if 4Kids will try an Alien Hour in the summer (with Gees in-between them) Thread Title: Summer Lineup Tease: Is An Alien Hour on the Horizon? 🛸🌟 AnimationAficionado: With all the cosmic shuffling happening, it’s “Four Eyes!” turning the page for our alien-themed entertainment on 4Kids TV. Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for. But here’s a thought – what if 4Kids is plotting an Alien Hour for the summer? Imagine back-to-back alien adventures, capped off with “The Gees” in between as a quirky interlude. That’d be something! DigitalToonFan: An Alien Hour would be epic! “Four Eyes!”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, plus “The Gees” shorts? Sounds like a perfect blend of cosmic chaos and laughter. It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer. Plus, it’d give “Four Eyes!” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a fantastic platform to shine even brighter. Fingers crossed 4Kids goes for it! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We love seeing your excitement and speculation about what’s coming up!

Not just fresh episodes but brand NEW shows are stepping into the limelight: “Redakai: Conquer the Kairu,” “Vampire Hunters” (yep, that’s the 4Kids take on “Demon Slayer”), “Chaotic: Reloaded” (a sequel we’ve all been dreaming of!), and “My Dad the Spy” (the intriguing 4Kids dub of “Spy X Family”). DigitalToonFan: “My Dad the Spy” and “Vampire Hunters” caught my eye! Genius move getting into those major anime titles. “Chaotic: Reloaded” is like meeting an old friend with a new face. And “Redakai,” that’s going to be interesting. Exciting times! AnimationAficionado: WOW! “Demon Slayer” as “Vampire Hunters” and “Spy X Family” turning into “My Dad the Spy”? Only 4Kids can pull off such daring dubs. But seriously, “Chaotic: Reloaded” has me all amped up. Can’t wait to see what’s new and what’s stayed the same.

And “World of Quest” sticking around is great news. Also, intrigued by how “Vampire Hunters” will resonate with the audience. PokeNostalgia101: The decision to include major titles like “Demon Slayer” and “Spy X Family” in a form more accessible to the 4Kids audience is a bold and potentially brilliant move. Mixing well-loved series with their unique dubs could really set the fall schedule apart. LyokoLover: The diversity in this lineup is incredible! From sequels and reboots to fresh dubs of hit anime, it looks like CW4Kids is aiming to cater to a wide audience this fall. Also, can’t help but wonder how “Code Lyoko” will interact with these new additions. ComicStripKid: “Redakai” and “Pokémon Horizons” will be great for keeping that action-adventure vibe going strong, while “My Dad the Spy” could add a wholesome yet thrilling family dynamic. Plus, those shorts like “The Owl” are perfect palate cleansers between heavier shows. ToonTalker91: “Vampire Hunters” could be the wildcard of the bunch, considering its origin. Also, super curious about how “Chaotic: Reloaded” plans to evolve the storyline. Either way, this fall is setting up to be game-changing for CW4Kids!

Write a convo suprised Quest is back, but figured it was coming since it replaced TL’s webpage on 4kids.tv in mid April Thread Title: World of Quest Makes a Triumphant Return! 🌍⚔️ QuestFanatic88: Holy smokes, did anyone else catch that “World of Quest” is back on the CW4Kids fall lineup?! I’m genuinely surprised but kind of saw it coming after “Tomodachi Life” vanished and WoQ took over its webpage on 4kids.tv back in April. It was like a silent drumroll! ToonArchivist42: Yeah, I noticed the webpage swap too! It was pretty low-key, but definitely hinted at something big. “World of Quest” has that unique blend of humor and adventure that’s been missing. Glad CW4Kids is bringing back some fan favorites. DigitalScribe: The subtle hints were there with the webpage transition, but seeing “World of Quest” officially back is exciting! The show always had potential; it just needed the right moment to shine again. Looks like that time is now. NostalgiaKnight: It makes you wonder if they’ve been planning this return for a while or if fan demand swayed their decision. Either way, glad to see some strategy behind this nostalgia revival. “World of Quest” has a dedicated fanbase that’s been waiting for this. ComicRelief: TBH, I almost lost hope it would come back, but that sneaky webpage change in April perked my eyebrows. It’s like they were testing the waters to gauge our reaction. Well played, CW4Kids, well played. Excited to see where they take the storyline this season! AdventureAwait: This is the best news! “World of Quest” has that rare mix of epic quests and laugh-out-loud moments. It’s the comeback I didn’t know I was waiting for. Really curious to see if they’ll introduce new characters or stick with the classic crew. PixelPundit: Super psyched for the return, but also intrigued by how it’ll fit with the rest of the CW4Kids lineup. It’s quite diverse this year. “World of Quest” brings a specific flavor that complements the existing shows. Kudos to whoever’s curating the fall schedule! QuestLoreMaster: As a longtime fan, seeing Quest back feels like rediscovering a lost treasure. The character dynamics, the quirky humor, everything! I’m here for it all. Also, props to CW4Kids for that sly hint through the webpage change. It built up the perfect amount of anticipation. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled to see so much enthusiasm for “World of Quest” making its return to CW4Kids! Rest assured, we’ve been listening to your feedback and are just as excited to bring back this beloved series. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in store. The adventure is just beginning!

They’ve just announced that “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” will be joining the lineup in June. Plus, they’re extending the block to end at 12:30pm now. Feels like early Christmas to me! RetroCartoonLover: This is definitely prep for the fall season. They’re testing waters with “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” before making them staples. The extended hours are a nice touch too—it shows they’re committed to offering more content. Can’t wait! DigitalScribe: We literally just got the spring lineup and new look. The ink hasn’t even dried, and here they are, mixing things up again with new additions and extending the schedule. I’m not complaining, though—it keeps things interesting. AnimationAficionado: Adding “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” into the mix is a masterstroke. Both shows have their unique fanbases and will definitely pull in viewers. Plus, the extra half hour could mean more variety in programming, which is always a win in my book. NostalgiaKnight: Is anyone else thrilled about “World of Quest” making a comeback? That show was a gem that deserved more spotlight. And “Four Eyes!” has that fresh, quirky vibe that could really resonate with the audience. CW4Kids is on a roll here. ToonTalker91: The block extension to 12:30pm is curious. It’s like they’re pacing themselves for a larger strategy, possibly eyeing to dominate the Saturday morning cartoon space even more. More shows mean more diversity in content, and I’m all for that. PixelPundit: As much as I love this news, I wonder how they’ll pace the introduction of “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” within the current lineup. Will other shows get less airtime, or are they planning to overhaul the schedule entirely? Either way, interesting times ahead for CW4Kids.

Write a convo with the only 4 shows guaranteed to be on the block this time in 2026","completion":"Thread Title: CW4Kids 2026: The Core Four Shows Guaranteed to Return 🌟📺 ToonSavvy101: Hey CW4Kids fans! Can you believe we're already talking about 2026? Times sure have flown by! I’ve just seen an announcement that only four shows are guaranteed to return to the block by that time. Looks like we’re sticking with \\"Pokémon Horizons: The Series,\\" \\"Code Lyoko,\\" \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\\" and \\"World of Quest.\\" Thoughts on this pared-down core? DigitalAnimatorX: I'm not surprised to see \\"Pokémon Horizons: The Series\\" make the cut. Pokémon has been a pillar for CW4Kids, no matter the season. But trimming down to four indicates a significant strategy shift. I'm all in for \\"Code Lyoko\\" sticking around, though. That show has layers that still captivate. RetroToonFan: Honestly, keeping \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" makes total sense. It's been one of the most original and entertaining additions in recent years. “World of Quest” has its charm and nostalgia factor. But only four shows? Sounds like they're making room for something big or changing their approach. PixelPundit: It’s a mixed bag for me. On one hand, I appreciate the focus on these shows, suggesting more consistent storytelling and perhaps deeper development. On the other, the diversity and range of toons will surely be missed. Hope they have plans to introduce compelling new content to fill the gaps. AnimationAficionado: \\"Code Lyoko\\" is the one I'm most excited about; its unique blend of virtual reality and real-life drama set it apart. But yeah, this core four setup has me curious about what CW4Kids’ long game is. Maybe they're aiming for quality over quantity, or perhaps they're gearing up for a major revamp with fresh, innovative shows? NostalgiaKnight: While I am a bit wistful about what might be leaving our screens, there’s something to be said about having these four powerhouses leading the way into 2026. It cements their status as fan favorites and integral to the CW4Kids identity. I just hope they pair these veterans with some groundbreaking new series to keep the block vibrant. ToonTalker91: The focus on these four does offer a certain level of stability, which might be exactly what they're aiming for amidst all the industry changes. Yet, CW4Kids has always been about variety. Let’s hope this is a strategic move to bolster their lineup with something fresh and unexpected down the line. QuestFanatic88: \\"World of Quest\\" getting another guaranteed run?! Yes, please! It’s such an underrated show with so much potential. As for the strategy, focusing on these four titans could be genius if they manage to weave in new toons that complement and expand the CW4Kids universe. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We're thrilled for the continued journey with \\"Pokémon Horizons: The Series,\\" \\"Code Lyoko,\\" \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\\" and \\"World of Quest\\" into 2026 and beyond. Rest assured, our commitment to bringing engaging, innovative, and diverse programming to CW4Kids remains stronger than ever. Stay tuned for what's next – we’ve got surprises in store that we can’t wait to share with you! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp"},{"prompt":"Write a follow up saying \\"Nestor over Pogoriki?\\" and worrying a bit about GoGoRiki","completion":"Thread Title: \\"Nestor over Pogoriki?\\" Concerns & Speculations about GoGoRiki's Future 🤔📺 PixelPundit: With the recent emphasis on \\"World of Quest\\" characters like Nestor taking central stage, I've noticed Pogoriki and the GoGoRiki crew seem to be getting less spotlight. \\"Nestor over Pogoriki?\\" Is this what we're seeing now? I've got to admit, it's got me a bit worried about the future of GoGoRiki on CW4Kids. RetroToonFan: Noticed that too, @PixelPundit. It's like all of a sudden, there's this shift. Don't get me wrong, \\"World of Quest\\" is fantastic, but GoGoRiki has its own unique charm and humor that’s hard to replicate. It'd be a real shame to see it pushed aside or, worse, phased out. ToonSavvy101: It’s a tricky balance for a block like CW4Kids, trying to keep the content fresh while staying true to what the audience loves. Maybe they’re experimenting with screen time allocation, seeing who draws in more viewers? But I agree, GoGoRiki deserves to maintain its presence. It adds a distinctive flair to the mix. DigitalAnimatorX: I’m trying to remain optimistic here. Maybe it’s not as much “Nestor over Pogoriki” as it is just giving “World of Quest” some well-deserved limelight. Hopefully, CW4Kids finds a way to balance both effectively. After all, variety is what makes this block so special. AnimationAficionado: There's a point to be made about audience dynamics possibly changing. However, part of CW4Kids’ appeal is its ability to juggle diverse shows like GoGoRiki. I can’t help but worry though—if they sideline shows based on perceived popularity cliffs, we might lose the essence of what makes the block eclectic and entertaining. NostalgiaKnight: Definitely concerning to see one of the quirky staples like GoGoRiki possibly getting less attention. It serves up a different kind of storytelling, which is refreshing. The ideal scenario? CW4Kids leverages both “World of Quest” and GoGoRiki to cater to different tastes within their audience, without having to choose one over the other. ToonTalker91: Let’s not jump to conclusions. CW4Kids has always been good at rotating focus to keep content engaging. It might just be Pogoriki and Co.’s turn to take a backseat temporarily. Still, it's valid to express concerns; hopefully, the admins take notice and ensure GoGoRiki doesn't get overshadowed in the long term. QuestFanatic88: \\"World of Quest\\" and GoGoRiki both add incredible value to the lineup—each in their unique way. It’s crucial they find a happy medium. While Nestor’s adventures are compelling, the GoGoRiki gang offers that comedic relief that’s equally indispensable. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We appreciate your concerns and insights on the balance between “World of Quest” and GoGoRiki. Rest assured, we’re committed to delivering a diverse and engaging lineup that encompasses the broad spectrum of interests within our audience, including the continued presence of GoGoRiki. Stay tuned for future announcements and thanks for your passionate engagement with CW4Kids programming!

Classes like Berserker (Axes), Swordfighter (Swords), and Archer (Long Range and Spears) emphasize the importance of matching class types with appropriate weapon choices for optimal performance. 2. **Role Specializations:** Classes are tailored toward specific roles in a party—Berserkers for raw damage, Shielders for defense, Assassins for high-damage output on singular targets, and Priests for healing and support. 3. **Growth Trends:** Each class has unique growth rate patterns emphasizing their role (e.g., Berserkers with high STR growth for damage, Shielders with high DEF growth for tanking). 4. **Skill Themes:** Skills are thematic and reflect the class's focus. For example, Berserkers have skills that revolve around high damage and self-harm for greater power, while Priests focus on healing and protective spells. 5. **Utility Skills:** Some classes have utility skills aimed at increasing mobility (e.g., Lunge for Berserkers, Withdrawal for Archers) or providing strategic advantages (e.g., Taunt for Shielders). 6. **Status Effects:** Many classes can inflict or manipulate status effects, such as Stunned, Silenced, or Debilitated, showcasing an emphasis on strategy beyond mere damage. # Suggested Skill Additions: To fill gaps, consider the following suggestions based on observed patterns: 1. **Enhanced Mobility Skills for Heavy Classes:** Classes with lower AGI could benefit from skills that temporarily boost their movement or allow them to engage/disengage effectively, such as a Charge skill for Berserkers or a Tactical Retreat skill for Gunners. 2. **Strategic Skills for Casters:** Provide Witch/Warlock and Sage classes with spells that manipulate the battlefield, such as creating temporary obstacles or areas that either boost allies or debuff enemies. 3. **Combo Skills:** Skills that trigger additional effects when used in conjunction with another class's abilities, promoting teamwork. For example, a combo skill between Assassins and Swordfighters where a pre-marked target by an Assassin receives extra damage from Swordfighter attacks. 4. **Buff/Debuff Removal or Transfer:** Especially for support and caster classes (Priest, Prophet), skills that remove or transfer debuffs from allies to enemies could add a strategic layer to battles. 5. **Area Control Skills:** For classes like the Ninja or the Trickster, add skills that affect large areas, such as traps or smoke screens that obscure vision, reducing enemy accuracy for a turn. 6. **Elemental Manipulation for Casters:** Expand on the elemental spells for Gentle Fist, Witch/Warlock, and other mage-type classes with more diverse elemental control, such as weather manipulation spells that affect the entire battlefield. 7. **Passive Skills for Non-Casters:** Introduce passive skills that provide ongoing benefits or that activate under certain conditions, such as a Swordfighter's passive that increases evasion after a successful parry or block. 8. **Synergy Skills for Hybrid Classes:** For classes like the Hunter (Long Range and Axes), include skills that capitalize on their hybrid nature, such as a skill that switches between ranged and melee combat modes, adjusting stats accordingly. 9. **Defensive Skills for Less Tanky Classes:** Offer squishier classes like the Assassin or Archer defensive maneuvers or escape tactics like smoke bombs or backflip shots that increase distance between them and their pursuer. 10. **Skill Chains:** Develop a chain of actions where completing one skill successfully unlocks a more powerful follow-up skill for the next turn, adding depth and planning to combat scenarios. By incorporating these suggestions, you can address existing gaps and add further depth and strategic variety to the RPG classes, enriching the gameplay experience."},{"prompt":"Have you noticed that each class gets a \\"chance roll\\" ability for free (such as \\"# Outrage All basic attacks have a chance to do 1.5x more damage.

As he arrived at the edge of the crater, Oozar beheld a sight that would forever change his life: a spacecraft, unlike any technology his species had ever developed. Its sleek, metallic body reflected the moonlight, creating an ethereal scene amidst the glowing flora and fauna. Tentatively, Oozar extended a tentacle to touch the craft, only for a panel to slide open, revealing a figure clad in a spacesuit. The astronaut, a human from a distant planet called Earth, named Lin, was on an exploratory mission when her ship malfunctioned and crashed. Despite the language barrier and their vastly different appearances, a bond formed between Oozar and Lin, born out of shared curiosity and a mutual desire to understand the other’s world. Using the ship’s technology, they overcame communicative hurdles, learning each other’s languages and cultures. In the weeks that followed, Lin taught Oozar about Earth and its wonders, while Oozar shared the secrets of Gloraxon V. However, their exchange went beyond mere knowledge. They taught each other about the power of empathy, the strength found in diversity, and the importance of looking beyond outer appearances. As Lin worked on repairing her spacecraft, a new threat emerged. A malevolent force from a neighboring system had set its sights on Gloraxon V, drawn by the unique energies emitted by the planet. United by their newfound friendship, Oozar and Lin concocted a plan to save Oozar's home, utilizing his knowledge of the planet's terrain and Lin’s technological prowess. Together, they set up a network of mirrors throughout the Glowing Forest, aiming to amplify the bioluminescent light into a powerful beam. When the invaders arrived, intent on conquest, they were met with a blinding radiance that disoriented them, leaving their ships vulnerable. Utilizing the element of surprise, Lin launched a counteroffensive from her now-repaired spacecraft, driving the invaders away and saving Gloraxon V. In the aftermath, as Lin prepared to return to Earth, the goodbye was bittersweet. Oozar and Lin knew that their paths might never cross again, yet they were forever changed by their encounter. They had not only forged an unbreakable bond but also proved that unity and understanding could transcend the vastness of space and the differences between species. Oozar returned to his people, no longer the outcast curious about the stars but a hero who had defended his planet from alien invaders. He shared the tale of his friendship with Lin and the lessons it taught him, inspiring generations of Gelloids to look up at the stars not with fear, but with wonder and hope. And far across the galaxy, on a small, blue planet, Lin shared her incredible story, too, spreading the message that in the vast, unknown reaches of space, friendship and bravery know no bounds."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
