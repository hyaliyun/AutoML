As the number of experiments increases, the observed frequency of a random event will tend to stabilize around the theoretical probability of that event occurring. This is a fundamental principle in statistics and probability, affirming that empirical probability converges to theoretical probability as the sample size increases. Therefore, Statement A is correct. - **Statement B**: Asserts that buying 1000 lottery tickets, each with a winning probability of frac{1}{1000}, guarantees a win. However, the probability of winning at least once when buying multiple tickets is different from the sum of the probabilities for each ticket. The events are independent, and the correct approach to determine the probability of winning at least once involves calculations beyond simple addition. Thus, it is incorrect to conclude guaranteed winning, making Statement B incorrect. - **Statement C**: Suggests that the probability of getting a tail in a coin toss can be determined by the ratio of tails observed in a series of tosses. While frac{49}{100} is an empirical probability based on the experiment's outcome, it does not redefine the theoretical probability of a fair coin toss, which remains frac{1}{2}. Thus, stating that the probability is frac{49}{100} based on one experiment is incorrect, making Statement C incorrect. - **Statement D**: Misinterprets probabilistic forecasts as reflecting a consensus among experts rather than an objective probability based on data and models. The statement \\"the probability of precipitation in this city tomorrow is 70%\\" means there is a 70% chance of precipitation according to weather prediction models, not a division of expert opinion.

This is because for x > 0, y > 0, and for x < 0, y < 0. Since k=6 > 0, the graph indeed lies in the first and third quadrants, making this statement correct. **Statement B**: To find the intersection points of the graph of y=frac{6}{x} and the function y=x-1, we set frac{6}{x} = x - 1. Solving this equation involves multiplying both sides by x to eliminate the denominator and then rearranging the terms to solve for x: [ begin{aligned} frac{6}{x} &= x - 1 6 &= x^2 - x 0 &= x^2 - x - 6 0 &= (x-3)(x+2) end{aligned} ] This yields x = 3 or x = -2. Substituting these values back into either of the original equations gives us the corresponding y values: - For x = 3, y = 3 - 1 = 2. - For x = -2, y = -2 - 1 = -3. Thus, the intersection points are (3, 2) and (-2, -3), confirming statement B as correct. **Statement C**: To examine the behavior of y when x > -2, we consider the nature of the inverse proportion. As x increases from -2 towards 0, y becomes more negative, indicating that y < -3 for x > -2. However, this overlooks the behavior for x > 0, where y is positive. Therefore, the statement as presented is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the behavior of y across all values of x > -2. **Statement D**: The graph of y=frac{6}{x} is symmetric about the origin because if (x, y) is on the graph, then (-x, -y) is also on the graph.

This identity can help simplify the difference between the two expressions: [ cos(sin x) - sin(cos x) = cos(sin x) - (-cos(frac{pi}{2} + cos x)). ] This simplifies to: [ cos(sin x) + cosleft( frac{pi}{2} + cos x right). ] 3.

Due to the tiling with parallelograms, each side can find another side parallel and equal to it somewhere within the polygon. 4. The chain of parallelograms implies that the opposite edge must be equal in length and direction in the reverse way, satisfying property 3. # Step 4: Property 3 implies Property 2 1. Assume the polygon has property 3. 2. This implies that for every vector there is an opposite vector in the polygon. 3. We can perform a constructive method to divide the polygon into parallelograms by always pairing opposite sides. 4. Keep slicing the polygon by its sides with property 3 in mind until only parallelograms are left. # Conclusion By showing the implications 1 Rightarrow 3 Rightarrow 1 and 2 Rightarrow 3 Rightarrow 2, we have proven that properties 1, 2, and 3 are equivalent. Thus, the properties of the convex polygon F having a center of symmetry, being able to be divided into parallelograms, and for any vector overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}} there exists an opposite vector overrightarrow{A_{j} A_{j+1}} are all equivalent. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Given that the normal vector of plane alpha is (1, 2, 2), and the normal vector of plane beta is (2, 4, k), if plane alpha is parallel to plane beta, then find the value of k.

This substitution leads to α=β-frac{π}{4}. Given the equation tan(α+frac{π}{4})=3cos2α, and substituting α+frac{π}{4} with β, we get tanβ=3cos(2β-frac{π}{2}). Since cos(2β-frac{π}{2}) is equivalent to sin2β, the equation simplifies to tanβ=3sin2β. The tangent function can be expressed as the ratio of sine to cosine, so we have frac{sinβ}{cosβ}=3(2sinβcosβ). Simplifying this, we get frac{sinβ}{cosβ}=6sinβcosβ.

Distance covered by the first train = Speed of the first train * Time taken to cross the bridge Distance covered by the first train = 15 m/s * 30 s = 450 meters Since the train is 130 meters long, the length of the bridge (L) must be the distance covered by the first train minus the length of the train itself.

Let's denote the normal retail price of the sweater as R. The 60% discount means that the customer pays 40% of the normal retail price (since 100% - 60% = 40%). Therefore, the selling price at 60% discount is 40% of R. We can set up the equation as follows: 0.40 * R = 1.35 * W Now, we want to find the markup percentage from wholesale to the normal retail price. The markup is the difference between the retail price and the wholesale cost, divided by the wholesale cost, and then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

The area of the rectangle is given by A = L * S. We can use this to find the length of the long side (L): 1200 m^2 = L * 30 m L = 1200 m^2 / 30 m L = 40 m Now we have the lengths of both sides: the long side L is 40 m and the short side S is 30 m. Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal (D). We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the diagonal is the hypotenuse, and the two sides are the length and the width of the rectangle.

This case covers all possible values of ( n ) where ( n leq 9 ) since there are 9 jesters, and all seats can be jesters. 2. **Case where at least one sage is present:** Suppose there is at least one sage at the table. We need to figure out the valid configurations: Let's denote the sage by ( A ) and their neighbors by ( B ) and ( C ). - The sage ( A ) speaks the truth, therefore ( A )'s statement \\"Exactly one of my two neighbors is a jester\\" must be true. - This implies one of ( B ) and ( C ) must be a jester and the other must be a sage. Assume without loss of generality that ( B ) is a sage and ( C ) is a jester: - Since ( B ) is also a sage, their statement must be true. Thus, the other neighbor of ( B ), who is opposite to ( A ), must be a jester. - Since ( C ) is a jester, their statement is false. Therefore, both of ( C )'s neighbors are sages. This leads us to continue this pattern clockwise around the table. Therefore, the arrangement of the table cycles every 3 seats: Sage-Jester-Sage, which implies ( n ) must be a multiple of 3 to have a consistent distribution. Let ( n = 3k ), where each group of three comprises two sages and one jester. Given there are constraints: - ( k leq 9 ) (as there are at most 9 jesters), - ( 2k leq 11 ) (as there are at most 11 sages). This implies ( k leq 5 ). Consequently, the allowed values of ( n ) are: [ n = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 ] 3. **Combining Both Cases:** When ( n leq 9 ), we have solutions where everyone is a jester: [ n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] And from the previous step, for ( n = 3k ), we have: [ n = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 ] 4. **Conclusion:** The combined possible values of ( n ) which satisfy the problem's conditions are: [ n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15 ] Concluding, these values are all the possible ( n ) and we have demonstrated why others are not possible.

The two largest circles (radius 8 and 6) are on the same side of line ell— let’s say the north side. 2. **Placing Other Circles**: To maximize the area of T, place the second largest two circles on the opposite side of ell (south side), i.e., circles with radii 4 and 2. No overlap occurs between circles on opposite sides. 3. **Calculating the Area of T**: - Area of circle with radius 8 is pi cdot 8^2 = 64pi. - Area of circle with radius 6 is pi cdot 6^2 = 36pi. - Area of circle with radius 4 is pi cdot 4^2 = 16pi. - Area of circle with radius 2 is pi cdot 2^2 = 4pi. - Since circles with radius 8 and 6 are on the same side, their areas might overlap. If arranged so they just touch each other, the overlap is minimized. Hence, considering them as a single unit, you would subtract the combined area of 36pi (from smaller circle) from 64pi (from larger circle), which simplifies as their distinct radii prevent an overlap. The circles on the south do not overlap with circles on the north. 4. **Final Calculation**: - Cumulative area of regions inside exactly one circle is 64pi + 36pi + 16pi + 4pi = 120pi since there’s no overlap between circles on different sides.

These points are represented as (cos(2nx), sin(2nx)). 3. **Calculate the distance between points:** The distance between points at angles 2nx and 2mx is given by the chord length formula for the unit circle: [ D = 2 sinleft(frac{2nx - 2mx}{2}right) = 2 sin((n-m)x) ] 4. **Check rationality:** For the distance to be rational, sin((n-m)x) must be rational. We express sin((n-m)x) using angle sum identities and the known values of sin x and cos x. Using the multiple angle formula, we note: [ sin(kx) quad text{can be expressed in terms of} quad sin x quad text{and} quad cos x quad text{both rational numbers} ] Therefore, sin((n-m)x) will also be rational given that both sin x and cos x are rational. 5. **Show that the points are distinct:** To ensure that these angles 2nx generate distinct points, we need to show that x is not a rational multiple of pi. If x = frac{p}{q}pi for rationals p and q, then: [ cos x = cosleft(frac{ppi}{q}right) ] However, for cos x = frac{4}{5}, this should not be the case. We appeal to the fact that not all Pythagorean triples can be roots of unity because the set of nth roots of unity zeta_n for n leq 2 times 1975 is finite, whereas the set of Pythagorean triples is infinite. Therefore, we can always find a cosine value corresponding to a Pythagorean triple that is not a root of unity. In conclusion, through careful selection of angles and verification of conditions, we can find 1975 distinct points on the unit circle with rational pairwise distances. Therefore, it is possible to find such points.

Using the polar to Cartesian conversion formulas rho^2 = x^2 + y^2, rhosintheta = y, and rhocostheta = x, we can rewrite the equation as follows: [ rho = 4sinleft(theta - frac{pi}{3}right) implies rho^2 = 4rhosinleft(theta - frac{pi}{3}right) ] Expanding the sine function using the angle subtraction formula, sin(alpha - beta) = sinalphacosbeta - cosalphasinbeta, we get: [ rho^2 = 4rholeft(sinthetacosfrac{pi}{3} - costhetasinfrac{pi}{3}right) ] Substituting cosfrac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{2} and sinfrac{pi}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, the equation becomes: [ rho^2 = 2rhosintheta - 2sqrt{3}rhocostheta ] Converting to Cartesian coordinates, we replace rho^2 with x^2 + y^2, rhosintheta with y, and rhocostheta with x, yielding: [ x^2 + y^2 = 2y - 2sqrt{3}x ] Rearranging terms, we obtain the equation of a circle in Cartesian coordinates: [ x^2 + y^2 + 2sqrt{3}x - 2y = 0 ] 2. **Identifying the Center of the Circle:** The general equation of a circle in Cartesian coordinates is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h, k) is the center of the circle. Comparing this with our equation, we can rewrite it as: [ (x + sqrt{3})^2 + (y - 1)^2 = (sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2 ] This shows that the circle is centered at (-sqrt{3}, 1). 3. **Determining the Line of Symmetry:** The polar coordinate equation of a line passing through the center of a circle can be determined by the angle theta that the line makes with the origin. Since the center of the circle is (-sqrt{3}, 1), this corresponds to a line with an angle of frac{5}{6}pi in polar coordinates.

Must the entire set S be separable? 1. **Define Red-Separable Set**: Let's define a red-separable set as one for which there exists a triangle Delta such that all red points lie strictly inside Delta, and all green points lie strictly outside Delta. 2. **Define Finite Set ( A )**: Let ( A ) be a finite set of red and green points in general position, ( P ) be the convex hull of some red points from ( A ), and ( Q ) be a subset of green points from ( S ). We need to determine under what conditions there exists a triangle ( Delta ) separating ( P ) and ( Q ). 3. **Assumption on Support Lines**: Without loss of generality, we can assume the sides of ( Delta ) are supporting lines for ( P ). 4. **Fixed Circle ( C )**: Fix a circle ( C ). Each supporting line ( ell ) of ( P ) can be associated with a point ( T ) on ( C ). 5. **Arbitrary Point ( X ) in ( Q )**: Let ( X ) be an arbitrary point in ( Q ). If there exists a separating triangle ( Delta ), then the three points ( T ) corresponding to its sides ( l_0, l_1,ldots,l_n ) intersect all arcs ( a(X) ), where ( X in Q ). 6. **Determine Separability**: If there exist three points on ( C ) intersecting all arcs ( a(X) ) and these points form an acute-angled triangle, then the set ( A ) can be divided as required. Conversely, if any three points on ( C ) form an acute-angle and intersect all arcs, it ensures that the set is red-separable. 7. **Construct Counterexample**: Construct a counterexample: Assume a system of arcs such that any three points intersect almost one-third of all arcs. - Let ( n ) be a natural number. - Let ( T_1, T_2, ldots, T_{3n+1} ) be vertices of a regular ((3n+1))-gon inscribed in ( C ). - For each ( i ), let ( a_i ) be the open arc ( T_i T_{i+n} ). 8. **Count ( n )**: Any three points on ( C ) intersect a maximum of ( n ) other arcs. Removing arc ( T_1 T_{n+1} ), the remaining arcs can intersect any triangle formed by these points. 9. **Apply to Initial Problem**: Consider a regular ( 3001 )-gon inscribed in ( C ): - Vertices ( Y_1, Y_2, ldots, Y_{3001} ). - Points ( X_i ) denote the intersection of tangents at ( Y_i ) with ( Y_{i+1000} ). 10. **Shift in Color**: - Mark points ( Y_i ) red and denote the resultant set by ( A ). 11. **Verification**: - The convex hull of points ( X_i ) contains points ( Y_i ). Thus, the set can initially be red-separable. - Removing any point from ( X_i ) or ( Y_i ) maintains separability. 12. **Conclusion**: - If any considerable subset (system of arcs on ( C )) intersects almost a third of all potential arcs, its removal allows for a red-separable set. - However, the counterexample does not prove full separability of the entire initial set ( S ).

The prime divisors of 15 are 3 and 5. We will consider each case separately. 3. **Case 1: ( p = 3 )** - Since ( p ) is the smallest prime divisor of ( n^4 + 6 ), then 2 does not divide ( n^4 + 6 ).

Let R be the set of red vertices and B be the set of blue vertices such that R sqcup B is a partition of the vertices. 2. **Defining Polynomials:** Define the polynomials: [ f(x) = sum_{r in R} x^r quad text{and} quad g(x) = sum_{b in B} x^b ] By the hypothesis, the sum of these polynomials is: [ f(x) + g(x) = x^{2n-1} + x^{2n-2} + cdots + x + 1 ] This is the polynomial representing all vertices of the 2n-gon. 3. **Evaluating at x=1:** Since f(1) + g(1) represents the sum of all vertices, and there are 2n vertices: [ f(1) + g(1) = 2n ] Given that f(1) and g(1) count the number of red and blue vertices respectively, and there are n red and n blue vertices: [ f(1) = g(1) = n ] 4. **Magnitude of Polynomials on the Unit Circle:** For any z such that z^{2n} = 1 (i.e., z is a 2n-th root of unity), we have: [ |f(z)| = |g(z)| ] This follows because f(z) + g(z) = z^{2n-1} + z^{2n-2} + cdots + z + 1 and the magnitudes of f(z) and g(z) must sum to the magnitude of the right-hand side, which is constant for all z on the unit circle. 5. **Counting Red-Red and Blue-Blue Distances:** Let r_k denote the number of pairs of red vertices that are k units apart along the edges of the polygon, and let b_k denote the number of pairs of blue vertices that are k units apart. We can express these counts using the polynomials: [ sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} r_k z^k = f(z) f(overline{z}) = |f(z)|^2 ] [ sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} b_k z^k = g(z) g(overline{z}) = |g(z)|^2 ] for all z such that z^{2n} = 1. 6. **Equating the Polynomials:** Since |f(z)| = |g(z)| for all z such that z^{2n} = 1, we have: [ sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (r_k - b_k) z^k = |f(z)|^2 - |g(z)|^2 = 0 ] This polynomial must be identically zero for all z that are 2n-th roots of unity. 7. **Conclusion:** Since the polynomial sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (r_k - b_k) z^k = 0 for all z that are 2n-th roots of unity, it follows that: [ r_k = b_k quad text{for all} quad k ] This implies that the sequences of red-red distances and blue-blue distances are equal. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The polynomial g(x) = x^{2001} 14x^{2000} + 1 has distinct zeros s_1, ldots, s_{2001}.

This is trivially true for any ( m ), as any integer is congruent to 0 modulo 1. Thus, we can choose any ( b_0 > N ) to satisfy the statement. 3. **Inductive Step**: Suppose the statement holds for all ( d < a ). We need to show it holds for ( d = a ). - **Periodic Nature of Powers of 2**: Consider the sequence of powers of 2 modulo ( a ), which becomes periodic starting from some minimal exponent ( M ). Let ( k ) denote the length of the period such that: [ 2^{M + k} equiv 2^M pmod{a}. ] - **Bound on Period Length**: The periodic sequence will not cover all possible residues modulo ( a ) (since 0 either never appears or only appears once). Thus, ( k < a ). - **Divisibility and Rescaling**: Let ( d = gcd(a, k) ). Define ( a' = a / d ) and ( k' = k / d ). Since ( 0 < k < a ), it follows that ( 0 < d < a ). By the induction hypothesis, for this ( d ), there exist positive integers ( b_0, b_1, ldots, b_{d-1} ) such that: [ b_i > max(2^M, N) quad text{and} quad 2^{b_i} + b_i equiv i pmod{d} quad text{for} quad i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, d-1. ] 4. **Sequence Construction**: For each ( i = 0, 1, ldots, d-1 ), form the sequence: [ 2^{b_i} + b_i, , 2^{b_i + k} + (b_i + k), , ldots, , 2^{b_i + (a' - 1)k} + (b_i + (a' - 1)k). ] - **Modulo ( a ) Representations**: Modulo ( a ), the above sequence terms are: [ 2^{b_i} + b_i, , 2^{b_i} + (b_i + k), , ldots, , 2^{b_i} + (b_i + (a' - 1)k). ] - **Non-congruence Proof**: Let us verify no two terms in these sequences are congruent modulo ( a ). Assume: [ 2^{b_i} + (b_i + mk) equiv 2^{b_j} + (b_j + nk) pmod{a} ] for some ( i, j in {0, 1, ldots, d-1} ) and ( m, n in {0, 1, ldots, a' - 1} ). - Since ( d ) divides ( a ), we similarly have: [ 2^{b_i} + (b_i + mk) equiv 2^{b_j} + (b_j + nk) pmod{d}. ] - As ( k ) is divisible by ( d ), it implies: [ i equiv j pmod{d}, ] meaning ( i = j ). Subsequently, we have: [ mk equiv nk pmod{a}, ] which implies: [ mk' equiv nk' pmod{a'}. ] Since ( a' ) and ( k' ) are coprime, this leads to ( m equiv n pmod{a'} ), thus ( m = n ). Hence, the ( a ) terms of the ( d ) sequences are unique modulo ( a ). 5. **Conclusion**: The final ( a ) numbers meeting all criteria (greater than ( N ) and unique modulo ( a )) complete the inductive step, proving the statement for all ( a ).

The equations for the asymptotes of this hyperbola are y=frac{1}{2}x and y=-frac{1}{2}x. We can select the point (2, 0) on the hyperbola since it is one of the vertices.

Speed in m/s = (Speed in km/h) × (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 90 km/h × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 90 × (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 90 × (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 25 m/s Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 1240 meters / 25 m/s Time = 49.6 seconds Therefore, it will take the train approximately boxed{49.6} seconds to pass the bridge."},{"prompt":"Given that points B_{1} and B_{2} are the two vertices on the imaginary axis of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2}frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 (a>0, b>0), a line passing through B_{1} and perpendicular to the yaxis intersects the hyperbola at points P and Q.

Adding the original 8 mice to the 48 pups gives us a total of 8 + 48 = 56 mice after the first round of breeding. 4. When the pups grow up, all the mice (now totaling 56) have another 6 pups each. So the second generation of pups is 56 mice * 6 pups/mouse = 336 pups. 5. Adding the second generation of pups to the existing 56 mice gives us a total of 336 + 56 = 392 mice. 6. Now, each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups. Since there were 56 adult mice from the first generation, the number of pups eaten is 56 mice * 2 pups/mouse = 112 pups. 7.

This can be simplified to {T}_{k+1}={(-1)}^{k}{C}_{5}^{k}{x}^{5-k}{y}^{k}, where {C}_{5}^{k} is the binomial coefficient. To find the term that contains x^{2}y^{4}, we need to solve for k in two scenarios based on the power of x and y: 1. For the x^{2} term, we set 5-k=2, which gives us k=3. 2. For the y^{4} term, we also need to consider the multiplication with (x+y), which could potentially increase the power of y by 1 if y is chosen from (x+y). However, since we are specifically looking for y^{4} and already accounted for all y's in (x-y)^{5}, we focus on the term where k=3 to match the y^{4} requirement directly from (x-y)^{5}. Therefore, the coefficient of x^{2}y^{4} in the expansion comes from the term where k=3. Substituting k=3 into our general term formula gives us the coefficient as {(-1)}^{3}{C}_{5}^{3}. This simplifies to -10 because {C}_{5}^{3}=10 and {(-1)}^{3}=-1. However, we must also consider the effect of multiplying by (x+y). The multiplication by x in (x+y) does not change the power of y, but the multiplication by y could potentially add to the coefficient if it were to produce a term of x^{2}y^{4}. This happens when we multiply the x^{3}y^{3} term from (x-y)^{5} by y in (x+y), which corresponds to k=4 for the x^{3}y^{3} term. Substituting k=4 into our formula gives us the coefficient as {(-1)}^{4}{C}_{5}^{4}. This simplifies to +5 because {C}_{5}^{4}=5 and {(-1)}^{4}=1.

This means c's share of the total profit is ( frac{24,000}{60,000} = frac{2}{5} ). The total investment in the business is ( 45,000 + 63,000 + C ). Since c's share of the profit is ( frac{2}{5} ), c's investment must also be ( frac{2}{5} ) of the total investment.

We start with the given equation: (2c - b) cos C = (2b - c) cos B 2. Using the identity ( cos B = sin (90^circ - B) ) and ( cos C = sin (90^circ - C) ), although unnecessary as we're not switching to sines, it can simplify the trigonometric step. Rearranging terms for clarity, we take advantage of cosine properties directly: frac{(2c - b)}{(2b - c)} = frac{cos B}{cos C} 3. Derive the condition by using cotangent (since cos (90^circ - theta) = sin theta): frac{(2c - b)}{(2b - c)} = cot(180^circ - (B+C)) 4. Because cot (180^circ - theta) = -cot theta, simplifying using the angle sum identities and properties of cotangent: -frac{1}{2} 5. Thus, cos (B+C) = -cos A = -frac{1}{2} 6.

Given sin(omega - A) = frac{3}{5}, we can express sin omega using the sine of angle addition formula: sin omega = sin (omega - A + A) = sin (omega - A) cos A + cos (omega - A) sin A, which simplifies to sin omega = frac{3}{5} cos A + sqrt{1 - left(frac{3}{5}right)^2} sin A. Substituting A = frac{pi}{6}, we get sin omega = frac{3}{5} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{4}{5} times frac{1}{2}. Since 0 < omega < frac{pi}{2}, we use sin omega = sqrt{1 - cos^2 omega}.

Squaring both sides and solving for cos omega, we end up with a quadratic equation 100cos^2 omega + 60cos omega - 39 = 0.

This requires: [ leftlangle frac{sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, frac{sqrt{2}}{d} e_j rightrangle = delta_{ij} ] where ( delta_{ij} ) is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if ( i = j ) and 0 otherwise. 3. **Norm condition**: For the vectors to be orthonormal, each vector must have norm 1: [ left| frac{sqrt{2}}{d} e_i right| = 1 implies left| e_i right| = frac{d}{sqrt{2}} ] Since ( |x_i - y| = frac{d}{sqrt{2}} ), we need to choose ( y ) such that this condition holds. 4. **Orthogonality condition**: For orthogonality, we need: [ leftlangle frac{sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, frac{sqrt{2}}{d} e_j rightrangle = 0 quad text{for} quad i neq j ] This simplifies to: [ leftlangle e_i, e_j rightrangle = 0 quad text{for} quad i neq j ] Since ( |x_i - x_j| = d ) for ( i neq j ), we have: [ |e_i - e_j| = d ] This implies: [ |x_i - y - (x_j - y)| = d implies |x_i - x_j| = d ] which is already given. 5. **Generalization to ( S )**: Now, consider any ( x in S ). We need to show that ( frac{sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) ) also has norm 1 and is orthogonal to all ( frac{sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) ). Let ( e = x - y ). We need: [ left| frac{sqrt{2}}{d} e right| = 1 implies |e| = frac{d}{sqrt{2}} ] and for orthogonality: [ leftlangle frac{sqrt{2}}{d} e, frac{sqrt{2}}{d} e_i rightrangle = 0 quad text{for all} quad i ] This simplifies to: [ leftlangle e, e_i rightrangle = 0 quad text{for all} quad i ] 6. **Verification**: Since ( |x - x_i| = d ) for all ( x_i in S_0 ), we have: [ |e - e_i| = d implies |x - y - (x_i - y)| = d implies |x - x_i| = d ] This implies: [ |e|^2 = |e_i|^2 = frac{d^2}{2} ] and: [ leftlangle e, e_i rightrangle = 0 ] Thus, ( frac{sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) ) is orthogonal to all ( frac{sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) ) and has norm 1. Therefore, the set [ left{frac{sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) : x in Sright} ] is an orthonormal system in ( mathcal{H} ). (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Find the modular inverse of ( 31 ), modulo ( 45 ).

Problem Simplification: We begin by noting that any sequence can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence. Exchanging terms to achieve a non-decreasing order does not decrease the number of desired subsequences. Therefore, we can assume the sequence is sorted in increasing order. 2. Gap Condition: Next, consider the condition that two consecutive terms in our sequence should not differ by more than 1. If x_i = x_{i-1}+a with a geq 2, then reducing all terms from x_i onward by a-1 will convert larger gaps into multiple subsequences we are interested in. 3. Reduction to Counts: Thus, we can reduce the problem to counts of individual elements. Specifically, we assume the sequence consists of repeated values: a_1 instances of the number 1, a_2 instances of the number 2, and so on up to a_r instances of number r, subject to the constraint that the total is 2007, i.e., [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_r = 2007. ] The number of desired subsequences within this arrangement is: [ a_1 cdot a_2 cdot a_3 + a_2 cdot a_3 cdot a_4 + cdots + a_{r-2} cdot a_{r-1} cdot a_r. ] 4. Optimizing the Number of Terms: Due to the conditions a_{r-2} ge a_{r-1} ge a_r, if r ge 4, replacing all instances of r by r-1 will increase the number of desired subsequences: [ left( cdots + a_{r-3} cdot a_{r-2} cdot (a_{r-1} + a_r) right). ] Thus, the optimal condition involves at most three different numbers (r=3).

(Walther Janous) 1. **Problem Restatement and Initial Insight**: Given ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2018} ) are integers arranged on a circle such that ( a_i > a_{i-1} + a_{i-2} ) for all ( i ). We need to find the maximum number of these integers that are positive. 2. **Analysis of Conditions**: The condition ( a_i > a_{i-1} + a_{i-2} ) restricts the growth of our sequence. A crucial insight here involves understanding how positive numbers interact under this constraint. If ( a_{k+1} > a_k + a_{k-1} ), then clearly ( a_{k+1} ) must be significantly larger than ( a_k ) and ( a_{k-1} ). 3. **Lemma 1 - Positivity Constraint**: Let's consider what happens if two consecutive terms are positive. Assume ( a_j ) and ( a_{j+1} ) are both positive. Then: [ a_{j+2} > a_{j+1} + a_j ] Since ( a_j ) and ( a_{j+1} ) are positive, ( a_{j+2} ) must be larger than their sum, making ( a_{j+2} ) positive if ( a_j ) and ( a_{j+1} ) were sufficiently large. However, this makes ( a_i )'s grow rapidly. 4. **Repetition and Growth**: Due to the circular nature, this repeated growth is unsustainable. We must establish a way to break this cycle adequately to prevent unbounded growth while maximizing positives. 5. **Maximum Positives - Contradiction Proof**: Assume the maximum number of positive integers is more than half of the total, say ( n geq 1009 ). Then, at least one triplet ( (a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}) ) must be among our sequence. Without loss of generality, let ( a_1, a_2, a_3 ) be all positives: [ a_3 > a_2 + a_1 > a_1 ] So ( a_3 geq a_1 + 2 ). Continuing with [ a_4 > a_3 + a_2 quad Rightarrow quad a_4 > a_1 + 2 + a_2 > a_1 ] Repeating this process rapidly leads ( a_i ) to exceed bounds set by finite integers along our points. This inductive argument implies contradiction if the sequence does not permit having more than 1008 positives. 6. **Conclusion**: The maximum number of positive integers achievable, without violating the integer growth bound by the circle's constraints, is 1008.

To verify, consider the right-hand side: [ frac{1}{n+1} + frac{1}{n(n+1)} = frac{1}{n+1} + frac{1}{n(n+1)} ] Combine the terms over a common denominator: [ = frac{(n+1) + 1}{n(n+1)} = frac{n+1+1}{n(n+1)} = frac{n+2}{n(n+1)} ] This simplifies to: [ frac{1}{n} ] Thus, the general formula is valid. 4.

To convert from kmph to m/s, we multiply by (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) and divide by (3600 seconds / 1 hour): Vr (in m/s) = Vr (in kmph) * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 h) Vr (in m/s) = (V1 + 80) * (1000 / 3600) Vr (in m/s) = (V1 + 80) * (5 / 18) The total length of the two trains is the sum of their individual lengths: Total length = Length of first train + Length of second train Total length = 290 meters + 210.04 meters Total length = 500.04 meters The time it takes for the two trains to cross each other is given as 9 seconds. We can use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time: Vr (in m/s) = Total length / Time Vr (in m/s) = 500.04 meters / 9 seconds Now we can equate the two expressions for Vr (in m/s) and solve for V1: (V1 + 80) * (5 / 18) = 500.04 / 9 To solve for V1, we first simplify the right side of the equation: 500.04 / 9 = 55.56 (approximately) Now we have: (V1 + 80) * (5 / 18) = 55.56 Next, we multiply both sides by (18 / 5) to isolate (V1 + 80): V1 + 80 = 55.56 * (18 / 5) V1 + 80 = 55.56 * 3.6 V1 + 80 = 200.016 Finally, we subtract 80 from both sides to find V1: V1 = 200.016 - 80 V1 = 120.016 kmph Therefore, the speed of the first train is approximately boxed{120.016} kmph."},{"prompt":"Along the road connecting Masha's and Sasha's houses, there are 17 apple trees and 20 poplars.

We aim to show that this implies the original triangle is equilateral. First Method 1. Consider an acute triangle (ABC), with (angle B = 60^circ). 2. Let (AH) and (CK) be the altitudes, with (M) as the midpoint of (AC). 3. In the right triangles (AHC) and (AKC), [ HM = KM = frac{1}{2} AC ] because the median to the hypotenuse in a right triangle is half the hypotenuse. Therefore, triangles (CMN) and (AMK) are isosceles. 4. The angle formed by the external angle at (M) of triangle (CMN), [ angle AMH = 2 angle C quad text{and} quad angle CMK = 2 angle A ] hence, [ angle HMK = angle AMH + angle CMK - 180^circ = 2 (angle A + angle C) - 180^circ. ] 5. Using the triangle angle sum property and (angle B = 60^circ), [ 2 (angle A + angle C) - 180^circ = 2 cdot 120^circ - 180^circ = 60^circ. ] Therefore, (angle HMK = 60^circ). 6. Since (HM = KM = MK (text{median})), triangle (HMK) being equilateral implies (angle HMK = 60^circ). This confirms that triangle (ABC) is equilateral. Second Method 1. Consider the semicircle with diameter (AC) and center (M). Mark points (K) and (H) on the semicircle such that the arc (KH) spans 60 degrees. 2. Drawing straight lines (AK) and (CH) intersecting at (B) outside the semicircle, results: - Points (K) and (H) are the bases of the altitudes of triangle (ABC) lying on its sides. 3. Since (KM) and (HM) represent altitudes, triangle (KMH) is equilateral if: [ angle KMH = 60^circ. ] This implies (angle AKC) and (angle BKC) should be consistently 60 degrees with (angle B = 60^circ). Consequently, paralleling (KH) with (AC) and preserving equilateral properties.

The centroid theorem states that for (n) points (P_i) with centroid (G), we have: [ sum_{i < j} P_iP_j^2 = n sum_{i=1}^{n} P_iG^2 ] Let's consider a coordinate system where (G) is the origin.

Thus, using (G) as the centroid: [ AG^2 = BG^2 = CG^2 = DG^2 = 1 - OG^2 ] Thus: [ AB^2 + AC^2 + AD^2 + BC^2 + BD^2 + CD^2 = 4 (1 - OG^2) = 16 (1 - OG^2) ] 3. **Arithmetic and Geometric Mean Application:** The sum of the squares of the edges implies: [ AB^2 + AC^2 + AD^2 + BC^2 + BD^2 + CD^2 leq 4 times 4 = 16 ] Since the points (A, B, C,) and (D) are on the sphere with (OG = 0), the arithmetic mean of the six squared distances is: [ frac{AB^2 + AC^2 + AD^2 + BC^2 + BD^2 + CD^2}{6} leq frac{16}{6} = frac{8}{3} ] By the AM-GM inequality: [ left( AB cdot AC cdot AD cdot BC cdot BD cdot CD right)^{1/6} leq frac{8}{3} ] Raising both sides to the sixth power: [ AB cdot AC cdot AD cdot BC cdot BD cdot CD leq left( frac{8}{3} right)^3 = frac{512}{27} ] We're given that: [ AB cdot AC cdot AD cdot BC cdot BD cdot CD = frac{512}{27} ] Hence, the equality condition holds if: 1. The centroid (G) of (A, B, C, D) coincides with (O). 2. All the distances (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD,) and (CD) are equal.

Yvonne responded, This isn't fair because there are 11 favorable sums for you: 4,6, ldots, 24, and only 10 favorable sums for me: 5,7, ldots, 23. I will only play if we roll 3 dice at the same time, or if we roll just 1. Provide a justified opinion on the negotiation.","completion":"1. **Evaluate Yvonne's Argument:** Yvonne argues that the game is unfair because there are 11 even sums possible (4, 6, ..., 24) for Xénia, while there are only 10 odd sums possible (5, 7, ..., 23) for her. However, her reasoning is incorrect because she does not account for the number of ways each sum can be achieved. 2. **Demonstrate Counting of Outcomes:** For instance, with four dice, the sum 4 can only be obtained in one way: (1+1+1+1). However, the sum 5 can be obtained in multiple ways: [ 5 = 2+1+1+1 = 1+2+1+1 = 1+1+2+1 = 1+1+1+2. ] If we distinguish the dice (say by coloring them), there would be more permutations resulting in each sum. 3. **Total Number of Possibilities:** The total number of possible outcomes when rolling 4 dice is: [ 6^4 = 1296. ] 4. **Symmetry in Rolling Dice:** Instead of enumerating all sums and their combinations, consider that each outcome of the dice roll has an equal probability. Because each die roll is independent and the die has an equal number of odd and even faces (3 odd: 1, 3, 5 and 3 even: 2, 4, 6), the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum is equally likely. 5. **Sum Parity Analysis:** Imagine we change the labeling of the die faces to match the 'modified' counting: - The face with 1 red dot now has 6 white points. - The face with 2 red dots now has 5 white points. - The face with 3 red dots now has 4 white points. - The face with 4 red dots now has 3 white points. - The face with 5 red dots now has 2 white points. - The face with 6 red dots now has 1 white point. Notice that making this switch keeps the game fair since for every possible configuration leading to an even sum in the original setup, there is a corresponding configuration leading to an odd sum in the modified setup. 6. **Equal Probability Insight:** Because of this re-labeling, we see that each possible die configuration (summed over multiple rolls) maps perfectly to an equal count of even and odd sum outputs regardless of how many dice (k) we roll. This symmetry shows that half of the die rolls result in sums that are even and half result in sums that are odd. # Conclusion: Thus, Xénia's offer is fair, as the number of outcomes producing even and odd sums are equal, making the game balanced. Yvonne’s concern about fairness due to the sheer number of sums possible was incorrect. Therefore, either player has an equal chance of winning.

Cut any triangle into two parts that can be used to form a 20sided polygon.","completion":": 1. Begin with the given square shape. Notice that the problem requires us to demonstrate how to cut this square into two pieces and then form an octagon out of these pieces. This is represented in the provided illustration. 2. First, we need to divide the square into two pieces. Consider cutting the square along a diagonal. This diagonal will split the square into two right-angled triangles. The right-angled triangles are congruent because they share the same hypotenuse, which is the diagonal of the square, and each has the remaining side lengths equal to the sides of the original square. Let's denote the original square's side length as (s). Each right-angled triangle will have legs of length (s) and a hypotenuse, which is the diagonal of the square, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: [ text{Diagonal} = sqrt{s^2 + s^2} = ssqrt{2} ] 3. Arrange these two triangles to form a square by placing two of the right-angled triangles together, each joining along one of the legs of length (s). 4. To create an octagon from the two right-angled triangle pieces, cut one of the right-angled triangles along the median descending from the right angle (the line from the right angle to the midpoint of the hypotenuse). This will create two smaller right-angled triangles. 5. Now, rearrange the resulting three triangles to form an octagon. The sides of the triangles that were legs of length (s) in the original triangles will now form part of the sides of the octagon. The hypotenuse of the original triangle (length (ssqrt{2})) will form the longer edges of the octagon. 6. Similarly, if we cut an equilateral triangle (with all sides equal) into two parts in such a way that they can be rearranged to form a specific polygon, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the triangle and the desired polygon. Conclusion: This visual representation and steps demonstrate how to cut a square into pieces and rearrange them to form an octagon. The geometric intuition remains similar if applied to other shapes, such as creating a 20-sided polygon from parts cut out of a triangle.

The radius of the circle is 6 units, and the side length of the octagon is 5 units. What are the lengths of the diagonals of the octagon?","completion":"To find the diagonals of the given octagon that is circumscribed around a circle with a radius of 6 units and has side lengths of 5 units, we proceed as follows: 1. **Analyzing the symmetry and key axes:** - Let the consecutive vertices of the octagon (N) be (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H), and the center of the circumscribed circle (O). - Because sides (AB) and (AH) are tangent to the circle, they are mirror images of each other with respect to the line (AO). This line (AO) must be an axis of symmetry for both the circle and the octagon. - By symmetry, each axis of symmetry must pass through (O) and splits the octagon into symmetric pairs of sides and vertices. 2. **Identifying all four symmetry axes:** - The octagon's vertices form symmetric pairs with respect to the axes through (AO): - (B, H), - (C, G), - (D, F), - (E), which lies directly on (AO). - Thus, the octagon is symmetric with respect to the following diagonals: (AE, BF, CG, DH). 3. **Calculating the side and diagonals:** - The octagon becomes two squares and several triangles by its symmetry lines, which means that all axes of symmetry intersect at right angles or (45^circ). Let's denote (OA = OB = R) (i.e., the distance from (O) to a vertex of the octagon). 4. **Solving for (R) using the side length of the octagon:** - Consider the arrangement of one side and diagonals lying on lines: - The angle (angle AOB) subtended at the center (O) for adjacent vertices is (45^circ) as it is regular. Using trigonometric relations: [ AB = 5 quad (Given Length of each side) ] Consider triangle (AOB): [ AB = 2 cdot R cdot sinleft(frac{angle AOB}{2}right) ] [ 5 = 2 cdot R cdot sinleft(frac{45^circ}{2}right) ] [ sinleft(22.5^circright) = frac{sqrt{2 - sqrt{2}}}{2} ] [ 5 = 2 cdot R cdot frac{sqrt{2 - sqrt{2}}}{2} ] [ R = frac{5}{sqrt{2 - sqrt{2}}} ] 5. **Computing the necessary lengths:** - For the diagonal crossing four vertices and passing through the center (i.e., longest diagonal): [ AE = 2 cdot R quad (from O out to the far side of the octagon) ] Thus, by the such analysis each diagonal cuts the octagon in symmetric pairs and creates a structural integrity for calculating squares as above. - Summarizing final critical diagonals: [ AE = 2a ] [ BF = 2b = 2 cdot sqrt{45} ] This structural problem calculates specific measurements of octagonal sub-divisions related by symmetry preserving properties given in the problem statement consistent with center formation and rule.

We will consider all possible changes for each digit: 1. The first digit \`2\` could have been \`1\`, \`2\`, or \`3\` before the storm. 2. The second digit \`0\` could have been \`9\`, \`0\`, or \`1\` before the storm. 3. The third digit \`5\` could have been \`4\`, \`5\`, or \`6\` before the storm. 4. The fourth digit \`0\` could have been \`9\`, \`0\`, or \`1\` before the storm. However, these digits must still form a valid time in the HH:MM format. First, analyze the hour (HH): - For the first digit (\`2\`): - \`1\` is valid. - \`2\` is valid. - \`3\` is valid. - For the second digit (\`0\`): - \`9\` is invalid in the 24-hour format if the first digit is \`2\`. - \`0\` is valid. - \`1\` is valid when combined with \`2\` as it forms valid time \`21\`. Therefore, the possible hour (HH) configurations before the storm are: - \`19\` - \`20\` - \`21\` Next, analyze the minutes (MM): - For the third digit (\`5\`): - \`4\` is valid. - \`5\` is valid. - \`6\` is valid. - For the fourth digit (\`0\`): - \`9\` is valid. - \`0\` is valid. - \`1\` is valid. Therefore, the possible minute (MM) configurations before the storm include combinations of digits \`4\`, \`5\`, \`6\` with \`0\`, \`9\`, \`1\`.

Each game involves two players, so we can calculate the total number of games played by summing the number of player appearances and dividing by 2. This is because each game increments the play count of two players by 1. Thus, [ text{Total number of games} = frac{10 + 15 + 17}{2} = frac{42}{2} = 21 ] 2. **Analyze Alice's resting and playing pattern:** Alice played 10 times, so she must have rested during: [ 21 - 10 = 11 text{ games} ] The maximum amount of time Alice could rest happens if she alternates between playing and resting. Since she rested for 11 games, the games Alice rested can be assumed to be the odd-numbered games (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), meaning she must have played the even-numbered games to keep this alternating pattern valid. 3. **Determine who lost the second game:** Following our assumption: - Alice must have played the even-numbered games (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.). - Since she played the even-numbered games, she must have lost the preceding odd-numbered games.

Thus, the Chicken McNugget Theorem is not directly applicable. Nonetheless, we can systematically determine the answer by checking the combinations and summations. 1. **Verify combinations with 6 and 9**: - Any linear combination of 6 and 9 must be of the form (6a + 9b), where (a) and (b) are non-negative integers. - Since (6) and (9) have a common factor of (3) (i.e., they are not relatively prime), they can only form multiples of (3). Specifically, they can only generate numbers of the form (3k) where (k) is an integer. Therefore, combinations of 6 and 9 alone will always produce multiples of 3. 2. **Incorporate the 20 portion**: - To find combinations including 20, we need to check whether adding multiples of 20 to combinations of 6 and 9 generates new numbers. 3. **List the numbers not achievable with 6 and 9 alone**: - As already noted, any number that is not a multiple of 3 is not achievable by combinations of 6 and 9.

Therefore, (a_1^2q^4 - 4)(1+q+q^2+q^3+q^4) = 0, hence a_1q^2 neq pm2, or 1+q+q^2+q^3+q^4 neq 0. (1) If a_1q^2 neq pm2, then we get pm2(1+q+q^2) = S. Thus, S = pm2[(q+frac{1}{2})^2 + (q+frac{1}{2}) - frac{1}{4}] = pm2[(q+frac{1}{2})^2 - frac{1}{4}]. Therefore, from the given, we have (q+frac{1}{2})^2 - frac{1}{4} in mathbb{R}, and |(q+frac{1}{2})^2 - frac{1}{4}| leq 1. Let q+frac{1}{2} = h(costheta + isintheta), (h > 0).

Thus, -1 leq h^2cos2theta - frac{1}{4} leq 1, hence cos2theta > 0. Thus, theta = kpi (k in mathbb{Z}). Therefore, q+frac{1}{2} in mathbb{R}. Again, let q = r(cosalpha + isinalpha), (r > 0).

The same strategy as for triangle ABC will be applied (guards move towards converging points). - **Scenario 2**: The monkey is on segment DE (where D is the midpoint of AB). 5. **Final Chase**: - If the monkey ends up on segment DE, the second guard runs to vertex B. - When the second guard reaches vertex B, the monkey must be on segments BD or DE, and both guards can then move towards point D to trap and catch the monkey. # Conclusion: The guards will always be able to catch the monkey by following the described strategies for each potential location of the monkey within the triangle paths. boxed{text{They will succeed.}}"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, C are denoted as a, b, c respectively.

The volume of the wooden box is: Volume = length × width × height Volume = 8 m × 7 m × 6 m Volume = 336 m³ Since we are given the dimensions of the rectangular boxes in centimeters, we need to convert the volume of the wooden box from cubic meters to cubic centimeters. There are 100 cm in a meter, so there are 100 × 100 × 100 = 1,000,000 cm³ in a cubic meter. Therefore, the volume of the wooden box in cubic centimeters is: Volume = 336 m³ × 1,000,000 cm³/m³ Volume = 336,000,000 cm³ We are given that the maximum number of rectangular boxes that can be carried in the wooden box is 2,000,000.

This implies that it has sides of different lengths. Without loss of generality, let us assume ( a = B C < A C = b ). Set ( b - a = varepsilon ). 2. **Choosing a Point ( P ):** Choose a point ( P ) inside the triangle such that the distance from ( P ) to vertex ( C ) is ( P C = delta leq frac{varepsilon}{3} ). 3. **Triangle Inequality for ( B C P ):** Applying the triangle inequality to triangle ( B C P ): [ P B < P C + C B = a + delta ] 4. **Triangle Inequality for ( A C P ):** Similarly, for triangle ( A C P ): [ A C < A P + P C implies P A > A C - C P = b - delta ] 5. **Calculating ( P A - P B ):** Substitute ( P A ) and ( P B ) based on the inequalities: [ P A - P B > (b - delta) - (a + delta) = varepsilon - 2delta geq delta = P C ] 6. **Conclusion Based on Contradiction:** The above inequality implies ( P A > P B + P C ), which contradicts the triangle inequality theorem (one side of a triangle must be less than the sum of the other two sides). Since this contradiction arises from the assumption that ( A B C ) is not equilateral, it must be false. Therefore, ( A B C ) must be an equilateral triangle. # Demonstration That an Equilateral Triangle Meets the Condition: 1. **Checking for Equilateral Triangle:** Let ( A B = B C = C A = a ). Given that any segment in the triangle is shorter than the longest side of the triangle, we have ( P A, P B, P C < a ). 2. **Applying the Triangle Inequality:** From the triangle inequalities in triangles ( A P B ), ( B P C ), and ( C P A ): [ P A + P B > A B = a, quad P B + P C > B C = a, quad P C + P A > C A = a ] 3. **Conclusion for Equilateral Triangle:** Thus, any two segments among ( P A ), ( P B ), and ( P C ) are longer than ( a ). Therefore, we conclude that: [ boxed{A B C text{ is an equilateral triangle}} ] # Additional Note on Construction: For an equilateral triangle ( A B C ), if we rotate the triangle around vertex ( A ) by ( +60^{circ} ), the image of point ( P ) would be ( P' ), forming an equilateral triangle ( A P P' ).

The problem requires us to determine the smallest natural number ( N ) such that when the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, 2016 ) are divided into pairs, the product of the numbers in each pair does not exceed ( N ). 2. Let's consider taking the two largest numbers from the sequence, which are 2016 and 2015. Their product is: [ 2016 times 2015 = 4068240. ] Clearly, this gives us an upper bound, but we seek the smallest possible ( N ). 3. We need to form pairs such that every product is lower than or equal to ( N ). The critical insight here is to form \\"balanced\\" pairs where the products are minimized across the board. 4. To proceed methodically, notice that logically ( N ) needs to satisfy the condition for the median values of the set, because the extremes (i.e., the smallest and the largest pairs) usually yield the highest product. We compute this through pairing numbers near the middle of the sequence and extending outward. 5. Consider the largest number, 2016. Pair it with 1: [ 1 times 2016 = 2016. ] This result is much smaller. We continue this strategy with pairs that gradually increase up to the median of the sequence. 6.

Let X, Y, Z, W be the points where the two perpendicular lines passing through the focus F intersect the ellipse Gamma. 2. **Define the intersections of tangents:** Let A = XX cap WW, B = XX cap YY, C = YY cap ZZ, and D = ZZ cap WW. These points are the intersections of the tangents to the ellipse at X, Y, Z, W. 3. **Intersection of diagonals with the ellipse:** Let AC intersect Gamma at points I and K, with I closer to A. Similarly, let BD intersect Gamma at points J and L, with J closer to B. 4. **Collinearity using Pascal's Theorem:** Let T = XY cap WZ. By applying Pascal's Theorem to the hexagon XXZWWY, we get that A, F, T are collinear. Similarly, applying Pascal's Theorem to YYWZZX, we get that C, F, T are collinear. Thus, T, A, I, F, K, C are collinear. 5. **Perpendicularity of diagonals:** Similarly, B, J, F, L, D are collinear. Since F is the focus of the ellipse, we have angle BFA + angle CFD = 90^circ. Given that angle BFA = angle CFD, it follows that BD perp CA. 6. **Tangency and harmonic division:** Since the pole of T is BD, the lines TJ and TL are tangent to Gamma.

We observe that T, S, R, P lie on AC, BD, X'Z', Y'W' respectively. Furthermore, we have: [ -1 = (TF; IK) = (SF; JD) = (RF; XZ) = (PF; YW) ] Thus, T, S, R, P lie on the directrix of Gamma and are collinear. 10. **Ellipse through intersection points:** Consider the ellipse passing through AX'BCZ'. Since (AC; FT) = (X'Z'; FR) = -1, the pole of F is the directrix. Similarly, since (BD; FS) = -1, the points AX'BCZ'D lie on an ellipse. Similarly, ABY'CXW' lies on an ellipse. Since F has the same pole in both cases, the points AX'BY'CZ'DW' lie on an ellipse, denoted by Omega. 11. **Quadrilateral inscribed in a conic:** Consider the quadrilateral formed by the tangents from A, B, C, D with Omega. The vertex A^* = AA cap BB lies on the pole of P and is collinear with X, F, Z. Similarly, C^* = CC cap DD lies on X, F, Z, and B^* = BB cap CC and D^* = DD cap AA are collinear with F and Y and W.

We now need to find the radius ( r ) of the sphere inscribed in the pyramid, which is equal to the radius of the circle inscribed in the triangle ( PKN ). 1. **Calculation of ( PK ), ( PN ), and ( KN ):** Since ( PK ) and ( PN ) are the heights from ( P ) perpendicular to the midpoints of the opposite edges of the square, both of them can be calculated as half the diagonal of the square base. The diagonal of a square whose sides are ( a ) is ( asqrt{2} ). Thus, [ PK = PN = frac{asqrt{2}}{2} ] 2. **Calculation of the radius ( r ) of the inscribed circle in triangle ( PKN ):** The semiperimeter ( s ) of ( triangle PKN ) is: [ s = frac{PK + PN + KN}{2} ] Here, ( KN ) equals the side length of the base square: [ KN = a ] Therefore, the semiperimeter becomes: [ s = frac{frac{asqrt{2}}{2} + frac{asqrt{2}}{2} + a}{2} = frac{asqrt{2} + a}{2} ] The radius ( r ) of the inscribed circle can be found using the formula: [ r = frac{A}{s} ] where ( A ) denotes the area of ( triangle PKN ). **Calculating the area ( A ) of ( triangle PKN ):** [ A = frac{1}{2} times PK times height ] Given that ( PK ) and ( height ) are calculated similarly due to symmetry, the height is also a perpendicular drawn from ( P ) to midpoint ( K = frac{asqrt{2}}{2} ). Using the given formula and the known lengths: ] Therefore, [ A = frac{1}{2} times PK times PN = frac{1}{2} times frac{asqrt{2}}{2} times frac{asqrt{2}}{2} = frac{a^2}{4} ] So now: [ r = frac{frac{a^2}{4}}{frac{a(sqrt{2}+1)}{2}} = frac{a^2}{4} div frac{a(sqrt{2}+1)}{2} = frac{a^2}{4} times frac{2}{a(sqrt{2}+1)} = frac{a(2-sqrt{2})}{4} ] Therefore, the radius of the inscribed sphere in the pyramid is: [ boxed{r = frac{a(sqrt{2}-1)}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"engineer undertakes a project to build a road 15 km long in 300 days and employs 40 men for the purpose . after 100 days , he finds only 2.5 km of the road has been completed . find the ( approximate ) number of extra men he must employ to finish the work in time .","completion":"To determine the number of extra men needed to complete the project on time, we first need to calculate the rate at which the work is being completed with the current workforce and then determine the rate needed to complete the remaining work within the remaining time.

This means there are 300 - 100 = 200 days left to complete the remaining 15 - 2.5 = 12.5 km of the road. The current rate of work with 40 men is 2.5 km in 100 days. To find the work rate per day, we divide the distance completed by the number of days: Work rate = 2.5 km / 100 days = 0.025 km/day Now, we need to find the required rate to complete the remaining 12.5 km in 200 days: Required rate = 12.5 km / 200 days = 0.0625 km/day To find the factor by which the workforce needs to increase to meet the required rate, we divide the required rate by the current rate: Factor = Required rate / Current rate = 0.0625 km/day / 0.025 km/day = 2.5 This means the workforce needs to be 2.5 times larger than the current workforce to meet the deadline. Since the current workforce is 40 men, we multiply this number by the factor: New workforce = 40 men * 2.5 = 100 men The engineer already has 40 men, so the number of extra men needed is: Extra men = New workforce - Current workforce = 100 men - 40 men = 60 men Therefore, the engineer must employ approximately boxed{60} extra men to finish the work on time."},{"prompt":"Given real numbers a > 0 and b > 0, sqrt{2} is the geometric mean of 8^a and 2^b.

First, observe that we are dealing with a geometric problem involving several triangles, specifically focusing on an isosceles right triangle and properties derived from it. 2. We are given that angle DCA = angle CAF = 90^{circ}. This implies that the angles at points D, C, and A form right angles. Therefore, angle ACF = 90^{circ} - angle CAF = 90^{circ} - 90^{circ} = 0^{circ}, but since C is a straight line point, this helps us realize angle ACX = 45^{circ} in another geometric configuration provided by the problem. 3. Given that angle ACX = 45^{circ}, triangle AXC is a right triangle with angle AXC = 90^{circ} at X. This makes triangle AXC a 45-45-90 right triangle. In such triangles, the two non-right angles are both 45^{circ} and the two legs opposite these angles are equal. Hence, AX = AC. 4. We know that diagonals AC and AE are equal in length (by symmetry or other geometric properties given). Hence, AE = AX. 5. At this point, triangle AEX is identified as isosceles since AE = AX. In any isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. 6.

Since ( B ) never misses and shoots second, ( A )'s probability of winning depends on whether he hits ( B ). ( A )'s survival depends on his hit probability on ( B ), which leads to considering whether ( B )'s elimination offers enough advantage to avoid immediate retaliation by ( C ). Given these scenarios: * If ( A ) shoots ( C ) or ( B ), ( A ) faces direct retaliation leading to reduced winning opportunities. * Shooting the air seems strategically preferable, ensign ( B )'s predictable shot to ( C ), simplifying ( A )'s chances to duel ( B ). **Conclusion**: A will not aim directly at either of his opponents but rather choose to shoot in the air to maximize his survival probability in the duel context.

The remaining 2/5 of the winners, which is 8 winners, will share the remaining 3/5 of the prize. Since each winner must receive at least 20, the minimum total amount that the 8 winners (2/5 of the winners) can receive is 8 * 20 = 160. Now, we are given that the greatest possible individual award is 160. This means that at least one winner will receive 160. Since the 12 winners (3/5 of the winners) are sharing 2/5 of the prize, and we want to maximize the individual award, we can assume that one of these winners receives the maximum amount of 160. So, 2/5 of the prize is at least 160. To find the total prize money, we can set up the equation: (2/5) * P = 160 To solve for P, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2: P = 160 * (5/2) P = 160 * 2.5 P = 400 So, the total prize money is 400. However, this is the amount that corresponds to 2/5 of the prize. We need to find the full prize amount. Since 400 is 2/5 of the total prize, we can find the full amount by dividing 400 by 2/5 or multiplying by 5/2: Total Prize Money = 400 / (2/5) Total Prize Money = 400 * (5/2) Total Prize Money = 400 * 2.5 Total Prize Money = 1000 Therefore, the total prize money is boxed{1000} ."},{"prompt":"A regular pentagon (A B C D E) is given.

So triangles ALD and CKA are congruent by the side-angle-side postulate (ADA = ACA). This congruency immediately gives us LD = AK. Given AK = 3x, then LD = 3x.

We recognize that the objective of the game is for a player to move the King from its initial position at the bottom left corner (a1) to the top right corner (h8) of the chessboard. 2.

The first player starts by moving the King diagonally to the position b2 (a1 to b2). 4. Following this initial move, the first player employs a strategy where they mirror the moves of the second player. This mirroring strategy ensures that for every move the second player makes, the first player responds with a move that maintains control over the progress toward h8. 5. If the second player moves diagonally, the first player also moves diagonally. For example, if the second player moves to c3 from b2, the first player will move to d4. 6. If the second player moves upwards, the first player also moves upwards. For example, if the second player moves to c3 and then upwards to c4, the first player will move from d4 to d5. 7. Similarly, if the second player moves to the right, the first player also moves to the right. For example, if the second player moves from c3 to d3, the first player will respond by moving from d4 to e4. 8.

The formula for compound interest is: Compound Interest (CI) = Principal * (1 + Rate)^Time - Principal Given that the difference between compound interest and simple interest over 2 years is 15, we can set up the following equation: CI - SI = 15 Substituting the formulas for CI and SI, we get: P * (1 + r)^2 - P - (P * r * 2) = 15 Given that the principal sum (P) is 6000, we can substitute that into the equation: 6000 * (1 + r)^2 - 6000 - (6000 * r * 2) = 15 Now, let's simplify the equation: 6000 * (1 + r)^2 - 6000 - 12000r = 15 Divide the entire equation by 6000 to simplify further: (1 + r)^2 - 1 - 2r = 15 / 6000 (1 + r)^2 - 1 - 2r = 0.0025 Now, let's expand (1 + r)^2: 1 + 2r + r^2 - 1 - 2r = 0.0025 r^2 = 0.0025 Since we're looking for the rate per annum, we take the square root of both sides: r = sqrt(0.0025) r = 0.05 So the interest rate per annum is boxed{5%} (since 0.05 in decimal form is equivalent to 5%)."},{"prompt":"Let M be the number of positive integers that are less than or equal to 1000 and whose base2 representation has more 1's than 0's.

Similarly, to find E, we count numbers where the number of 1s equals the number of 0s. This occurs only for even d, where binom{d}{d/2} gives the count for each d. **Using Pascal's Triangle**: - Sum all numbers to the right of the center for rows 0 to 9: Total sum of rows = 2^0 + 2^1 + dots + 2^9 = 2^{10} - 1 = 1023. - Center elements (only for even d from 0 to 8): 1 + 2 + 20 + 70 = 93.

Let's rewrite the expression to be proved: [ frac{x(y^2 - 2z^2)}{z} + frac{y(z^2 - 2x^2)}{x} + frac{z(x^2 - 2y^2)}{y} ] Simplifying each term: [ frac{xy^2}{z} - 2x z + frac{yz^2}{x} - 2y x + frac{zx^2}{y} - 2z y ] 5. Combine the terms: [ frac{xy^2}{z} + frac{yz^2}{x} + frac{zx^2}{y} - 2(xz + yx + zy) ] 6. Using the given condition ( frac{x}{y} + frac{y}{z} + frac{z}{x} = 5 ), we can infer that: [ frac{xy^2}{z} + frac{yz^2}{x} + frac{zx^2}{y} = x left( frac{y^2}{z} right) + y left( frac{z^2}{x} right) + z left( frac{x^2}{y} right) ] 7. We need to show that: [ x left( frac{y^2}{z} right) + y left( frac{z^2}{x} right) + z left( frac{x^2}{y} right) geq 2(xz + yx + zy) ] 8. By the AM-GM inequality, we know that: [ frac{xy^2}{z} + frac{yz^2}{x} + frac{zx^2}{y} geq 3 sqrt[3]{frac{xy^2}{z} cdot frac{yz^2}{x} cdot frac{zx^2}{y}} = 3 sqrt[3]{x y z} ] 9. Since ( sqrt{x}, sqrt{y}, sqrt{z} ) are sides of a triangle, we can use the fact that: [ x + y + z geq 2 sqrt{xy} + 2 sqrt{yz} + 2 sqrt{zx} ] 10. Therefore, we have: [ frac{xy^2}{z} + frac{yz^2}{x} + frac{zx^2}{y} geq 2(xz + yx + zy) ] 11.

Hence, there are: [ 2^6 = 64 ] such matrices in total. 2. Let ( B subset A ) be the subset of matrices from ( A ) where the rows are distinct. To find (|B|), we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle: We define subsets of matrices with repeating rows as follows: - ( A_{12} ): matrices where the 1st and 2nd rows are identical. - ( A_{23} ): matrices where the 2nd and 3rd rows are identical. - ( A_{13} ): matrices where the 1st and 3rd rows are identical. We need to calculate: [ |B| = |A| - |A_{12} cup A_{23} cup A_{13}| ] Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we have: [ |A_{12} cup A_{23} cup A_{13}| = |A_{12}| + |A_{23}| + |A_{13}| - |A_{12} cap A_{23}| - |A_{13} cap A_{23}| - |A_{12} cap A_{13}| + |A_{12} cap A_{23} cap A_{13}| ] Let’s compute each term: 1.

Counting (|A_{ij} cap A_{jk}|) For ( A_{12} cap A_{23} ), the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd rows must all be the same. Hence each (*) can independently be 0 or 1: [ |A_{12} cap A_{23}| = |A_{23} cap A_{13}| = |A_{12} cap A_{13}| = 2^1 = 2 ] 3.

Consider the events: - ( A ): The event that the second person has more heads than the first. - ( B ): The event that the second person has more tails than the first. 2. Note that: - The first person flips the coin 10 times. - The second person flips the coin 11 times. 3. Since the second person flips the coin one additional time compared to the first, the outcome of the second person's coin flip must either result in: - More heads (H) for the second person compared to the first, or - More tails (T) for the second person compared to the first. 4. The total number of heads and tails sums to 11 flips for the second person. Therefore, the events (A) and (B) are mutually exclusive; only one of them can occur, not both. 5. Additionally, because each coin flip is an independent event with an unbiased outcome (assuming a fair coin), and the second person has exactly one more flip, there cannot be a scenario where the counts of both heads and tails exceed that of the first person simultaneously. 6. Since the coin is fair, the probabilities of getting heads or tails are equally likely and each flip is independent, the events (A) and (B) are equally probable events. 7. Since only one of these events (A) or (B) must occur, the probability of either event happening is reflected by their mutual exclusivity and symmetry in probability distribution. 8. Therefore, the probability of (A) (that the second person has more heads) is: [ P(A) = frac{1}{2} ] 9.

Consider the sequence defined by: [ x_{1}=1, quad x_{2}=P(x_{1}), quad x_{3}=P(x_{2}), quad ldots, quad x_{n}=P(x_{n-1}), quad ldots ] We need to prove that ( P(x)=x+1 ) if for every positive integer ( N ) there exists a member of the sequence divisible by ( N ). 1. **Define a New Polynomial:** Assume the contrary that ( P(x) neq x+1 ). Then, define the polynomial ( Q(x) ) as follows: [ Q(x) = P(x) - x ] Notice that ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients where ( Q(n) > 0 ) (since ( P(n) > n )) for every positive integer ( n ). 2. **Behavior of ( Q(x) ):** Since ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial with positive integers, it must be non-decreasing for sufficiently large ( x ). This ensures that ( P(x) > x+1 ) for sufficiently large ( x ). 3. **Existence of Terminations:** If there are infinitely many integers ( n ) such that ( P(n) = n+1 ), then the polynomial ( P(x) - x - 1 ) has infinitely many zeros. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a non-zero polynomial can have only finitely many zeros. Hence, there exists an integer ( M ) such that for all ( x > M ), ( P(x) neq x+1 ). 4. **Large Values in Sequence:** Let ( k in mathbb{N} ) be where ( x_{k} > M ). From then on, ( P(x_{l}) - x_{l} geq 2 ) for all ( l geq k ) due to the nature of ( P(x) ). 5. **Checking Divisibility:** Assume ( d = x_{l+1} - x_{l} geq 2 ). Then ( d ) divides ( P(x_{l+1}) - P(x_{l}) ), which implies ( d ) divides ( x_{l+2} - x_{l+1} ). Using induction: If ( a equiv b pmod{d} ), then ( P(a) equiv P(b) pmod{d} ). Therefore, ( x_{l} equiv x_{l+1} equiv ldots equiv x_{m} pmod{d} ). 6. **Contradiction on Divisibility:** If the remainder is not zero, no term in the sequence could be divisible by ( d^{m} ) for sufficiently large ( m ), contradicting the hypothesis that for every ( N ), there is a member of the sequence divisible by ( N ). 7. **Form of ( P(x):** Hence all ( x_{l} ) must be divisible by ( P(x_{l}) - x_{l} geq 2 ). Let ( x_{l} = c_{l} cdot (P(x_{l}) - x_{l}) ). Then, [ P(x_{l}) = frac{c_{l}+1}{c_{l}} x_{l} ] holds for infinitely many ( (x_{l}, c_{l}) ) as ( x_{l} to infty ). 8. **Degree Evaluation of ( P(x):** Since ( frac{c_{l}+1}{c_{l}} x_{l} = left(1+frac{1}{c_{l}}right) x_{l} leq 2 x_{l} ), the degree of ( P(x) leq 1 ). Therefore, ( P(x) ) must be of the form ( ax + b ). 9. **Integer Coefficients and Conditions:** Given ( P(x) = ax + b ) with integer coefficients and ( P(n) > n ), and that the sequence tests the conditions implied only: - ( a = 1 ) - ( b = 1 ) Because any other combination does not satisfy the initial conditions.

The rate at which pipe A fills the tanker is ( frac{1}{t_A} ) (tanker per minute), and the rate at which pipe B fills the tanker is ( frac{1}{40} ) (tanker per minute). When A and B work together, their combined rate is ( frac{1}{t_A} + frac{1}{40} ). According to the problem, half of the time is spent with B working alone and the other half with A and B working together. Since the total time taken to fill the tanker is approximately 30 minutes, each half is approximately 15 minutes. In the first 15 minutes, pipe B fills ( 15 times frac{1}{40} ) of the tanker. In the next 15 minutes, pipes A and B together fill ( 15 times left(frac{1}{t_A} + frac{1}{40}right) ) of the tanker. The sum of these two amounts should equal 1 (a full tanker), so we have: [ 15 times frac{1}{40} + 15 times left(frac{1}{t_A} + frac{1}{40}right) = 1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{15}{40} + 15 times frac{1}{t_A} + frac{15}{40} = 1 ] [ frac{30}{40} + 15 times frac{1}{t_A} = 1 ] [ frac{3}{4} + 15 times frac{1}{t_A} = 1 ] Subtracting ( frac{3}{4} ) from both sides, we get: [ 15 times frac{1}{t_A} = frac{1}{4} ] [ frac{1}{t_A} = frac{1}{60} ] Therefore, ( t_A = 60 ) minutes.

It is not required that all 3 colors be used. In how many ways can the collection of lockers be painted?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to paint 10 lockers either blue, red, or green, following the given rules. We'll break down the problem into detailed steps to ensure clarity and thoroughness. 1. **Identify Odd and Even Numbered Lockers**: - Even-numbered lockers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. - Odd-numbered lockers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The condition given states that lockers m and n must have different colors whenever m-n is odd. This translates to even and odd lockers needing to be different colors. 2. **Color Constraints**: - All even-numbered lockers must be the same color (**Color set E**). - All odd-numbered lockers must be the same color (**Color set O**). 3. **Different Coloring Scenarios**: **Case 1: One color for even lockers and one color for odd lockers** Let's assign: - C_E: Color of even lockers - C_O: Color of odd lockers There are: - 3 choices for C_E. - 2 remaining choices for C_O (since it must differ from C_E). Thus, the number of ways to paint all even and odd lockers with different colors, one for each set, is: [ 3 times 2 = 6 ] **Case 2: One color for even lockers and two colors for odd lockers** Next, let’s explore the combinations with: - One color for evens (C_E). - Two colors for odds (C_1 and C_2). - There are 3 choices for C_E. - The remaining 2 colors (C_1 and C_2) will be used for the odd lockers. For the 5 odd lockers, using two colors: [ 2^5 = 32 ] However, we need to exclude the cases where all odd lockers are painted the same with either C_1 or C_2. Each uniform color scenario occurs in only one way, so: [ 32 - 2 = 30 ] Therefore, the number of ways to arrange them is: [ 3 times 30 = 90 ] **Case 3: Two colors for even lockers and one color for odd lockers** The process is symmetric to Case 2, but the roles of odd and even are swapped.

Since the toppings are distributed evenly, we can calculate the total number of pieces of meat on the whole pizza by multiplying the number of pieces per slice by the number of slices: Total pieces of meat on the pizza = 22 pieces/slice * 6 slices = 132 pieces We know the total pieces of meat is made up of pepperoni, ham, and sausage. We already know the number of pieces of pepperoni and sausage, so we can calculate the number of pieces of ham: Total pieces of meat = Pieces of pepperoni + Pieces of ham + Pieces of sausage 132 pieces = 30 pieces (pepperoni) + H (ham) + 42 pieces (sausage) Now, let's solve for H (the number of pieces of ham): 132 pieces = 30 pieces + H + 42 pieces 132 pieces = 72 pieces + H H = 132 pieces - 72 pieces H = 60 pieces So, there are 60 pieces of ham on the entire pizza. Now, we can find the ratio of the number of pieces of ham to the number of pieces of pepperoni: Number of pieces of ham : Number of pieces of pepperoni = 60 : 30 To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 30 in this case: 60 / 30 : 30 / 30 = 2 : 1 Therefore, the ratio of the number of pieces of ham to the number of pieces of pepperoni is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"The realvalued function f is defined for all positive integers.

We will consider two cases: ( a = 0 ) and ( a neq 0 ). # Case 1: ( a = 0 ) 3.

Equating the two expressions for ( f(x^4) ): [ 2a f(x)^2 + a f(x) = 4a^2 f(x) ] Simplifying, we get: [ f(x) left( 2a f(x) + a - 4a^2 right) = 0 ] Therefore, either ( f(x) = 0 ) or ( 2a f(x) + a - 4a^2 = 0 ). 9. If ( f(x) neq 0 ), then: [ 2a f(x) + a - 4a^2 = 0 implies f(x) = 2a - frac{1}{2} ] 10. Thus, ( f(x) ) can either be ( 0 ) or ( 2a - frac{1}{2} ). 11. If ( f(x) = 2a - frac{1}{2} ), then: [ f(x^2) = 2a f(x) = 2a left( 2a - frac{1}{2} right) = 4a^2 - a ] But we also have ( f(x^2) = 2a f(x) = 2a left( 2a - frac{1}{2} right) = 4a^2 - a ). 12.

Water is poured into the top bucket one litre at a time. After a litre is poured, the water is allowed to settle before another litre is poured. If water is poured into a bucket that is full, the water spills over the rim of the bucket in such a way that exactly one third of the runoff goes into each of the three buckets on which it rests. For example, once the top bucket is full, additional water spills equally into the three buckets in the secondhighest layer. At the first instant when at least one bucket on the bottom layer is full, what is the total amount of water that has been poured into the top bucket?","completion":"To solve the problem, we will follow a step-by-step analysis of the water distribution through the layers of buckets. 1. **Understanding the initial setup:** - The pyramid of buckets has 4 layers, with 10 in the bottom layer, 6 in the second layer, 3 in the third layer, and 1 at the top. - Each bucket can hold 6 liters of water. 2. **Filling the top bucket (Layer 1):** - Begin pouring water into the top bucket. - The top bucket will be full when 6 liters are poured into it. 3. **Water distribution to the second layer:** - Once the top bucket is full, any additional water will spill equally to the three buckets it rests on in the second layer. - Each of these three buckets will get frac{1}{3} of the additional water. 4. **Filling the second layer (Layer 2):** - Each bucket in the second layer also holds 6 liters. - To fill each bucket in the second layer, a total of 6 times 3 = 18 liters is needed. - Since each bucket gets frac{1}{3} of the water overflow from the top bucket, it takes pouring 18 liters to fill the three second-layer buckets. - Combining the 6 liters already poured to fill the top bucket, we need an additional 18 liters, summing up to 6 + 18 = 24 liters. 5. **Water distribution to the third layer:** - Once the top bucket and the three buckets in the second layer are full, water spills over to six buckets in the third layer. - Each of the three buckets in the second layer pours frac{1}{3} of the water equally to the buckets below. - The edge buckets in the third layer get frac{2}{9} of the water, while the corner buckets get frac{1}{9} of the water since each edge bucket receives water from two buckets above and each corner bucket receives from one. 6. **Filling the third layer (Layer 3):** - Calculating for the edge buckets: Each edge bucket requires 6 liters to fill. - Given the distribution, each edge bucket receives frac{2}{9} of any incoming water. - To fill an edge bucket, we need 6 div frac{2}{9} = 6 times frac{9}{2} = 27 liters. - Therefore, all the edge buckets in this layer will be full after an additional 27 liters are poured into the top. - Combining with the previous step, we now have 24 + 27 = 51 liters poured. 7. **Return to calculating volumes:** - At 51 liters, the three edge buckets in the third layer are full, each with 6 liters. - The three corner buckets in the third layer each contains 27 times frac{1}{9} = 3 liters. 8. **Water distribution to the bottom layer (Layer 4):** - Focus now moves to the bottom layer. - Three edge buckets in Layer 3 spill water into the bottom layer. Each bucket spills frac{1}{3} to three below buckets (one center and two edges). - Each bottom layer edge bucket receives frac{2}{27} liters for each liter poured into the top. 9. **Filling the fourth layer (Layer 4):** - Calculating for the center bucket: To fill this bucket, it receives frac{2}{9} of the water from each edge bucket above it. It will need 6 liters. - The center bucket receives frac{2}{9} per liter poured above. It needs 6 div frac{2}{9} = 27 additional liters. - Thus, this occurs after 51 + 27 = 78 liters. 10. **Final check on other buckets:** - Confirm that other buckets are not filled before the center bucket. Each bucket in the bottom layer will have received an appropriate fraction of water ensuring the center fills first. **Conclusion:** The total amount of water poured into the top bucket when the first bucket in the bottom layer becomes full is: [ boxed{78 text{ liters}} ]"},{"prompt":"A student divided each term of the equation x^{2}bx+1=0 by (x^{2}) to obtain the equation left(frac{1}{x}right)^{2}b frac{1}{x}+1=0.

Let's assume the first statement is true. The first statement says, \\"There is exactly one false statement in this book.\\" If this is true, then all other statements (2 through 100) must be false. However, if statement 1 is true, it contradicts statements 2 through 100 since they claim a different number of false statements. This contradiction tells us that the first statement cannot be true. 2. Let's proceed by assuming the second statement is true. The second statement says, \\"There are exactly two false statements in this book.\\" If this were true, statement 1 and one other statement must be false. However, this fails the consistency check because if statement 2 is true, then only one of the remaining statements should align with it, making analysis more complex without solving the issue of false alignment. Therefore, the second statement can't be true either. 3. As a result, we continue this logical analysis until reaching the 99th statement. Now, consider the 99th statement: \\"There are exactly 99 false statements in this book.\\" 4. If the 99th statement is true, this means 99 statements in the book are false.

To confirm, if any of the 1 through 98 statements are assumed true, they will contradict by not fitting logically with the claim of a different number of false statements in each individual setup. Therefore, this logically leads us to deduce: - The 99th statement is consistent precisely because it claims that all other statements except itself are false. - The 100th statement can't be true because it claims itself also false if the condition aligns, resulting in an inconsistency.

A circle is drawn with its center on AB such that it is tangent to AC and BC. We need to find the length of CP where P is the point where the circle and side AC meet. 1. **Identify Tangents**: Since the circle is tangent to AC and BC, and its center is on AB, the circle must be tangent to BC at B. This is because B is the right angle, and a circle centered on one side of a right triangle and tangent to the other two sides will always touch the hypotenuse at the right angle vertex. Therefore, P is the point where the circle meets AC, making CP a tangent from C to the circle, just like BC is. 2. **Tangent Lengths are Equal**: Since CP and BC are both tangents to the circle from point C, their lengths must be equal. This means CP = BC. 3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem**: To find the length of BC, we use the Pythagorean theorem. In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (AC) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (AB and BC).

The coloring must ensure that, for any right-angled parallelepiped, the number of red vertices among its 8 vertices is a multiple of 4. 2. **Observation about Rectangles in Coordinate Planes**: - Consider any rectangle ( R_1 ) lying on a coordinate plane, say the ( xy )-plane, with vertices at ((x_1, y_1, 0)), ((x_1, y_2, 0)), ((x_2, y_1, 0)), and ((x_2, y_2, 0)). Let ( r_1 ) be the number of red vertices in this rectangle. - For any such rectangle ( R_1 ), ( r_1 ) must be even.

Since the solution is 20% salt by volume, the amount of salt in the original x gallons is: Salt in original solution = 20% of x = 0.20 * x Given that x = 119.99999999999996 (which we can round to 120 for simplicity), the amount of salt in the original solution is: Salt in original solution ≈ 0.20 * 120 = 24 gallons When one fourth of the water evaporates, the amount of salt remains the same, but the volume of the solution decreases. The volume of the solution after evaporation is: Volume after evaporation = 3/4 * x = 3/4 * 120 = 90 gallons Now, 8 gallons of water and 16 gallons of salt are added to the solution.

The discriminant Delta = 1 - 4m. - When Delta leq 0, f'(x) leq 0 always holds, so f(x) is decreasing on (-infty, 1). - When Delta > 0, i.e., m < frac{1}{4}, we have x_1 = frac{1 - sqrt{1-4m}}{2} and x_2 = frac{1 + sqrt{1-4m}}{2}. - If 0 < m < frac{1}{4}, then x_1 < x_2 < 1. So, f(x) is decreasing when x < x_1, increasing when x_1 < x < x_2, and decreasing when x_2 < x < 1. - If m leq 0, then x_1 < 1 leq x_2. So, f(x) is decreasing when x < x_1 and increasing when x_1 < x < 1. In summary, when m leq 0, the decreasing interval of f(x) is (-infty, frac{1 - sqrt{1-4m}}{2}) and the increasing interval is (frac{1 - sqrt{1-4m}}{2}, 1). When 0 < m < frac{1}{4}, the decreasing intervals are (-infty, frac{1 - sqrt{1-4m}}{2}) and (frac{1 + sqrt{1-4m}}{2}, 1), and the increasing interval is (frac{1 - sqrt{1-4m}}{2}, frac{1 + sqrt{1-4m}}{2}). When m geq frac{1}{4}, the decreasing interval is (-infty, 1). 2. The domain of the function is (-infty, 1). If the function f(x) has two extreme points x_1, x_2, and x_1 < x_2, then f'(x) = 0 has two distinct roots x_1, x_2 in (-infty, 1). Let g(x) = -x^2 + x - m. We have the system of equations: begin{cases} Delta = 1 - 4m > 0 -frac{1}{2 times (-1)} < 1 g(1) < 0 end{cases}, which implies 0 < m < frac{1}{4}. Then, we have begin{cases} x_1 + x_2 = 1 x_1 x_2 = m end{cases}, and x_1 < x_2. So, 0 < x_1 < frac{1}{2} and 0 < x_2 < frac{1}{2}. f(x_1) + f(x_2) = frac{1}{2}x_1^2 + m ln(1-x_1) + frac{1}{2}x_2^2 + m ln(1-x_2) = frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + m ln[(1-x_1)(1-x_2)] = frac{1}{2}[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2] + m ln[1 - (x_1 + x_2) + x_1x_2] = frac{1}{2}(1 - 2m) + m ln m. Consider the function h(x) = x ln x - x + frac{1}{2}, where 0 < x < frac{1}{4}. The derivative h'(x) = ln x < 0, so h(x) is decreasing on (0, frac{1}{4}). Therefore, h(x) > h(frac{1}{4}) = frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{4} ln 4, which completes the proof. The final answer for part (1) is: - When m leq 0, the decreasing interval of f(x) is boxed{(-infty, frac{1 - sqrt{1-4m}}{2})} and the increasing interval is boxed{(frac{1 - sqrt{1-4m}}{2}, 1)}. - When 0 < m < frac{1}{4}, the decreasing intervals are boxed{(-infty, frac{1 - sqrt{1-4m}}{2})} and boxed{(frac{1 + sqrt{1-4m}}{2}, 1)}, and the increasing interval is boxed{(frac{1 - sqrt{1-4m}}{2}, frac{1 + sqrt{1-4m}}{2})}. - When m geq frac{1}{4}, the decreasing interval is boxed{(-infty, 1)}.

Prove that if the diamond is divided into several parts, its total value will decrease, and the decrease in value will be the greatest when the parts are equal in weight.","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: Let ( p ) be the weight of the original diamond. Suppose the diamond is divided into ( n ) parts, each with weights ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n ). According to the problem, the price of the diamond is proportional to the square of its weight; let the proportionality constant be represented by ( k ). 2. **Price of the Whole Diamond**: The price of the whole diamond can be expressed as: [ text{Price of whole diamond} = k p^2 ] 3. **Price of the Diamond After Division**: After the diamond is divided into parts, the price of each part is proportional to the square of its weight. Hence, the total price for all parts after division will be: [ text{Total price after division} = k p_1^2 + k p_2^2 + k p_3^2 + ldots + k p_n^2 ] 4. **Inequality Establishment**: We need to show that: [ k p^2 > k p_1^2 + k p_2^2 + k p_3^2 + ldots + k p_n^2 ] This simplifies to proving: [ p^2 > p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 + ldots + p_n^2 ] 5. **Express Partitioned Weights**: Suppose each part ( p_i ) can be written in terms of deviations from the average weight, i.e., [ p_1 = frac{p}{n} + x_1, quad p_2 = frac{p}{n} + x_2, quad cdots, quad p_n = frac{p}{n} + x_n ] Thus, we have the condition: [ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + ldots + p_n = p ] which implies: [ left( frac{p}{n} + x_1 right) + left( frac{p}{n} + x_2 right) + ldots + left( frac{p}{n} + x_n right) = p ] Simplifying, we get: [ p = frac{p}{n} cdot n + (x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_n) = p + (x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_n) ] Therefore: [ x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_n = 0 ] 6. **Substitute ( p_i ) Back into the Equation**: Substitute ( p_i = frac{p}{n} + x_i ) back into the price equation, we get: [ k left[ left( frac{p}{n} + x_1 right)^2 + left( frac{p}{n} + x_2 right)^2 + ldots + left( frac{p}{n} + x_n right)^2 right] ] 7. **Expanding and Simplifying**: Expanding the individual terms, we get: [ left( frac{p}{n} + x_1 right)^2 = left( frac{p}{n} right)^2 + 2 frac{p}{n} x_1 + x_1^2 ] Summing up these terms for all ( n ): [ k left[ sum_{i=1}^n left( left( frac{p}{n} right)^2 + 2 frac{p}{n} x_i + x_i^2 right) right] ] Considering ( sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 0 ), the middle term disappears: [ k left[ n left( frac{p}{n} right)^2 + sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 right] ] which simplifies to: [ k left[ frac{p^2}{n} + sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 right] ] 8. **Identify Minimum Condition**: The expression ( frac{p^2}{n} + sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 ) reaches its minimum when ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ldots + x_n^2 = 0 ), i.e., ( x_1 = x_2 = ldots = x_n = 0 ). Consequently: [ sum_{i=1}^n left( frac{p}{n} right)^2 = frac{p^2}{n} ] Therefore, the value of ( k left( p_1^2 + p_2^2 + ldots + p_n^2 right) ) is minimal when all parts are equal. # Conclusion: The reduction in the diamond's price is greatest when the parts into which the diamond is divided are equal.
