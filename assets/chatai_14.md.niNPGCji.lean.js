Suppose the cardinality of the trajectory of a number ( a ) is 1. This means that ( a ) must be a perfect square, and taking the square root of ( a ) must yield ( a ) itself. However, this is impossible because the only number whose square root is itself is 1, and ( a > 1 ). Therefore, the cardinality cannot be 1. 2. Suppose the cardinality of the trajectory of a number ( a ) is 2. This means that starting from ( a ), we must return to ( a ) after one operation. If ( a ) is not a perfect square, we add 3 to it, and if it is a perfect square, we take the square root. For the trajectory to have cardinality 2, ( a ) must be a perfect square, say ( a = b^2 ).

(2) When line l is vertical (i.e., perpendicular to the x-axis), it's equation is x = pm 1. In this case, we find that |AB| = sqrt{3}. For the case when line l is not vertical, let its equation be y = kx + m. Since line l is tangent to circle O: x^2 + y^2 = 1, we have frac{|m|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1, which simplifies to m^2 = k^2 + 1.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, there exist infinitely many integers k_1 < k_2 < cdots < k_m < cdots, such that (k_j mod n, T_{k_j}) are the same. This implies that starting from state T_{k_1} there is a periodic sequence of states. Suppose the period is {k_2 - k_1}. Since T_{k_1} = T_{k_2} and k_1 equiv k_2 (mod n), it follows that T_{k_1 - 1} = T_{k_2 - 1}, T_{k_1 - 2} = T_{k_2 - 2}, ldots.

To prove (ii), we need to show that the period is n^2 - 1 when n = 2^k. From part (i), after enough operations, the state returns to T_0. By looking backwards, each time a light changes its state, it does so due to its adjacent light. At the initial state T_0, all lights are on and thence all states are -1. If we consider the states of lights as a sequence of -1 and +1, then an operation S_j will change L_j to L_{j-1} cdot L_j and keep other states unchanged. To prove (ii), consider the reverse operations starting from L_j = -1. Reversing L_{n-1} through L_0 in sequence n-1 times, we will get L_0 = -1 and all others as +1, noted as T_1. Using mathematical induction, we prove that starting from T_1 and reversing this sequence, we return to a series where elements start with -1 and transform according to powers of 2.

Starting from all-on state T_0, reversing states starting from L_{n-1} through L_0, observe that every reverse is unrelated to itself due to non-overlap, similar to 2^k, this takes place in n^2 - n + 1 operations. So, parts (ii) and (iii) follow similar reasoning for specified n. Thus, the parts (ii) and (iii) for given n align with proven periodicity in k.

Now, compare this to b; we have left( frac{1}{2} right)^{frac{1}{2}} > b because frac{1}{2} > frac{1}{3} and since both terms are raised to the same exponent (frac{1}{2}), we can compare the bases directly.

Without stoppages: Time taken = Distance / Speed Time taken = 60 km / 60 km/hr Time taken = 1 hour With stoppages: Time taken = Distance / Speed Time taken = 60 km / 20 km/hr Time taken = 3 hours The difference in time is: 3 hours - 1 hour = 2 hours Since we are looking for the number of minutes the bus stops per hour, we need to convert the 2 hours of stoppage time into minutes and then find out how many minutes of stoppage occur in one hour. 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes 2 hours = 120 minutes Now, we divide the total stoppage time (120 minutes) by the total time with stoppages (3 hours) to find the stoppage time per hour. Stoppage time per hour = Total stoppage time / Total time with stoppages Stoppage time per hour = 120 minutes / 3 hours Stoppage time per hour = 40 minutes Therefore, the bus stops for boxed{40} minutes per hour."},{"prompt":"The largest ocean in the world is the Pacific Ocean, with an area of 17,996,800 square kilometers.

Each distinct pair ( (i,j) ) where (i leq j) generates a unique sum ( a_i + a_j ). We need to count the number of these sums and ensure they are distinct.

If they are moving in the same direction: The relative speed of the faster train with respect to the slower one is the difference in their speeds. Relative speed (Rs) = S2 - S1 Rs = 9 m/s - 8.75 m/s Rs = 0.25 m/s The faster train will overtake the slower one when it covers the length of the slower train plus the length of the faster train. Distance to overtake (D) = Length of the first train + Length of the second train D = 140m + 180m D = 320m Time to overtake (T) = Distance to overtake / Relative speed T = 320m / 0.25 m/s T = 1280 seconds So, the faster train will overtake the slower one after 1280 seconds. 2.

Relative speed (Rs_opposite) = S1 + S2 Rs_opposite = 8.75 m/s + 9 m/s Rs_opposite = 17.75 m/s The time taken to cross each other is the time taken for the sum of their lengths to be covered at the relative speed.

This homothety sends the center I of omega to the center J of omega_{1}. 3. **Tangency and Alignment of Points:** The homothety also maps line BC to a line parallel to BC that is tangent to omega_{1} at D''. Therefore, the points A, D, and D'' are collinear. 4. **Parallelism and Median Alignment:** Since line (Ah) is the height from A and line (D'D'') is parallel to (Ah), we note that A, D, and D'' are still collinear. Moreover, since H, D, and D' are collinear, the midpoint of [AH] and the midpoint of [D'D''] must both be aligned with D.

Clearly, ( 1 = 2^0 ), which can be written as: [ 1 = (-1)^{1-1}2^0 = 2^0 ] This satisfies the form ( n = sum_{j=1}^{2k+1}(-1)^{j-1}2^{m_j} ) with ( k = 0 ) and ( m_1 = 0 ). **Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis** Assume that every positive integer ( n ) up to ( 2^m ) can be written in the form: [ n = sum_{j=1}^{2k+1}(-1)^{j-1}2^{m_j} ] where ( k geq 0 ) and ( 0 le m_1 < m_2 < cdots < m_{2k+1} ). **Step 3: Inductive Step** We need to show that any integer ( n ) in the range ( (2^m, 2^{m+1}] ) can also be written in the desired form. Consider an integer ( n ) in this range. We can write: [ n = 2^{m+1} - (2^{m+1} - n) ] where ( 2^{m+1} - n ) is an integer in the range ( [1, 2^m) ). By the inductive hypothesis, ( 2^{m+1} - n ) can be written as: [ 2^{m+1} - n = sum_{j=1}^{2k+1}(-1)^{j-1}2^{m_j} ] Thus, [ n = 2^{m+1} - left( sum_{j=1}^{2k+1}(-1)^{j-1}2^{m_j} right) ] [ n = 2^{m+1} + sum_{j=1}^{2k+1}(-1)^j 2^{m_j} ] This is in the desired form with ( m_1 = m+1 ) and the rest of the ( m_j ) values shifted accordingly. **Step 4: Uniqueness** To prove uniqueness, consider the number of possible representations in the range ( (2^{m-1}, 2^m] ). Each representation must begin with a ( 2^m ) term and include an even number of distinct smaller terms. Thus, there are ( 2^{m-1} ) representations in this range, ensuring uniqueness. # Part (b) **Step 1: Counting Representations** We need to count the number of positive integers up to ( 2^{2017} ) with even and odd weights. The weight ( k ) of ( n ) is the number of terms in the sum minus one, divided by two. **Step 2: Binomial Coefficients** The number of integers with even weight is given by: [ sum_{m=0}^{2017} sum_{k=0}^{lfloor m/2 rfloor} binom{m}{2k} ] The number of integers with odd weight is given by: [ sum_{m=0}^{2017} sum_{k=0}^{lfloor (m-1)/2 rfloor} binom{m}{2k+1} ] **Step 3: Simplifying the Sum** Using the properties of binomial coefficients, we can simplify the difference between the number of integers with even and odd weights: [ sum_{m=0}^{2017} left( sum_{k=0}^{lfloor m/2 rfloor} binom{m}{2k} - sum_{k=0}^{lfloor (m-1)/2 rfloor} binom{m}{2k+1} right) ] **Step 4: Evaluating the Sum** Using the identity for binomial coefficients: [ sum_{k=0}^{lfloor m/2 rfloor} binom{m}{2k} - sum_{k=0}^{lfloor (m-1)/2 rfloor} binom{m}{2k+1} = 0 ] for ( m ) even, and: [ sum_{k=0}^{lfloor m/2 rfloor} binom{m}{2k} - sum_{k=0}^{lfloor (m-1)/2 rfloor} binom{m}{2k+1} = 2 ] for ( m ) odd. **Step 5: Final Calculation** Summing over the range ( [0, 2017] ), we find that the sum is dominated by the terms where ( m ) is odd: [ 2 times left( frac{2017 + 1}{2} right) = 2 times 1009 = 2018 ] Thus, the difference is: [ 2^{1009} ] The final answer is ( boxed{2^{1009}} )"},{"prompt":"is known that the equation ( ax^{5} + bx^{4} + c = 0 ) has three distinct roots.

Prove that the equation ( c x^{5} + b x + a = 0 ) also has three distinct roots. 1. **Exclude ( x = 0 ) as a root**: We first note that ( x = 0 ) cannot be a root of the equation ( ax^{5} + bx^{4} + c = 0 ). If ( x = 0 ) were a root, then substituting ( x = 0 ) into the equation would yield: [ c = 0 ] If ( c = 0 ), the equation reduces to ( a x^{5} + bx^{4} = 0 ), a polynomial of degree 4.

Let's also denote the rate at which Arun works alone by R_A and the rate at which Tarun works alone by R_T. We know that Arun can complete the work alone in 60 days, so his rate of work is: R_A = W / 60 Now, let's assume that Arun and Tarun together can complete the work in X days, so their combined rate of work is: R_A+T = W / X According to the problem, Arun and Tarun worked together for 4 days and then Arun worked alone for 36 days to complete the work. The amount of work done by Arun and Tarun together in 4 days is: Work_A+T = 4 * R_A+T = 4 * (W / X) The amount of work done by Arun alone in 36 days is: Work_A = 36 * R_A = 36 * (W / 60) Since the total work is completed by the work done together and the work done by Arun alone, we have: Work_A+T + Work_A = W 4 * (W / X) + 36 * (W / 60) = W Now, we can solve for X by substituting R_A = W / 60 into the equation: 4 * (W / X) + 36 * (W / 60) = W 4W/X + 36W/60 = W 4W/X + 3W/5 = W To solve for X, we need to get rid of W from the equation.

Therefore, the total number of points distributed in the entire tournament is: [ text{total points} = 4 cdot text{total matches} = 4 cdot 105 = 420 ] 3. **Sum of points per team:** Given that each team ended with a unique point total and the team with the least points has 21 points: The points per team range from 21 to ( 21 + 14 = 35 ), because there are 15 teams and their points form an arithmetic sequence. So, the set of points for the teams is ( {21, 22, 23, ldots, 35} ). 4. **Sum of sequence calculation:** Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, where ( a_1 = 21 ) (first term) and ( a_{15} = 35 ) (last term), the number of terms ( n = 15 ): [ text{sum} = frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_{15}) = frac{15}{2} (21 + 35) = frac{15}{2} cdot 56 = 15 cdot 28 = 420 ] 5. **Conclusion on the point total:** This confirms that the points indeed range from 21 to 35, summing to the total distributed points, 420. 6. **Analyzing the highest point total:** The team with the highest point total has 35 points. 7. **Checking point sum properties:** To achieve exactly 35 points, consider the nature of points distribution: - Wins give 3 points. - Draws give 2 points. - Losses give 1 point.

Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Initial Definitions and Setup**: - Let ( l ) be a given line. - Let the point ( M ) be on the circle but not on the line ( l ). - ( P_{mathrm{M}} ) denotes the projection from point ( M ) onto the circle: a point ( X ) on the line ( l ) maps to the other intersection point of the line ( MX ) with the circle (distinct from ( M )). - ( R ) denotes a motion of the plane preserving the circle, such as a rotation around the center of the circle or a reflection through a diameter. 2. **Analyze the Operations Separately**: - Let ( N = R^{-1}(M) ). This means that ( N ) is a point on the circle, obtained by applying the inverse transformation of ( R ) to ( M ). - Define ( m = R(l) ). This is the image of the line ( l ) under the transformation ( R ). - Define ( P_{N} ) as the projection of the line ( l ) onto the circle from the point ( N ). Similar to ( P_{mathrm{M}} ), it projects points on ( l ) to the circle. 3. **Construct Intermediary Projections**: - ( Q ) is the projection of the line ( m ) onto the circle from the point ( M ). But since ( m = R(l) ), we need ( Q ) to project points on ( m ) (which are images of points on ( l ) via ( R )) back onto ( l ). 4. **Composition and Properties**: - We need to compose these transformations to show that ( P_{mathrm{M}}{ }^{-1} circ R circ P_{mathrm{M}} ) is a projective transformation. - We have the relation: [ P_{mathrm{M}}{ }^{-1} circ R circ P_{mathrm{M}} = Q circ P_{N} circ P_{mathrm{N}}{ }^{-1} circ P_{mathrm{M}} ] 5. **Simplifications and Use of Known Results**: - A previous task (or result) has established that ( P_{mathrm{N}}^{-1} circ P_{mathrm{M}} ) is a projective transformation. This is crucial since projective transformations form a group, meaning that the composition of projective transformations is also a projective transformation. - Thus, the composition ( Q circ P_{N} ) with ( P_{N}^{-1} circ P_{mathrm{M}} ) also forms a projective transformation because all individual components (pre-established from previous results or by the definition of the transformation here) are projective. 6. **Conclude the Proof**: - Since all the components in the transformation ( P_{mathrm{M}}{ }^{-1} circ R circ P_{mathrm{M}} = Q circ P_{N} circ P_{mathrm{N}}{ }^{-1} circ P_{mathrm{M}} ) are projective transformations, and the group of projective transformations is closed under composition, the composition itself is a projective transformation.

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there are (l geq 2k) non-zero terms and enumerate them as (a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ldots, a_{i_l}). 2. **Claim:** There exist disjoint non-empty subsets (S, T) of ({i_1, i_2, ldots, i_l}) such that (sum_{s in S} u_s = sum_{t in T} u_t). 3. **Proof of the Claim:** Let (I = {i_1, i_2, ldots, i_l}). Consider the map (f : mathcal{P}(I) to mathbb{Z}) defined by (f(X) = sum_{x in X} u_x) for (X subset I). 4. **Bounding the Image of (f):** Since each (u_i) is at most (2^k), the image of (f) is a subset of ({0, 1, ldots, l cdot 2^k}), so it has size at most (l cdot 2^k + 1). 5. **Comparing Sizes:** We have (2^{frac{l}{2}} > l) (this can be shown by induction on (l geq 6)). Since (l geq 2k), it follows that (2^l > l cdot 2^k), and hence (2^l > l cdot 2^k + 1) due to parity. 6. **Injectivity Argument:** Thus, (|mathcal{P}(I)| > |f(mathcal{P}(I))|), so (f) isn't injective. Therefore, there exist distinct (X, Y subset I) such that (f(X) = f(Y)). Then taking (S = X setminus Y) and (T = Y setminus X) does the job. 7. **Constructing a New Representation:** Now take (S) and (T) as in the claim and let (m = min_{s in S} a_s).

We are to find the value of (|MF| + |NF|) for a circle with center (Pleft(frac{9}{2}, 0right)) and radius equal to (|PF|). Steps to the solution: 1. **Identify the focus (F) of the parabola**: The standard form for the parabola (y^2 = 2x) matches (y^2 = 4ax), where (4a = 2), hence (a = frac{1}{2}). The focus of a parabola (y^2 = 4ax) is given by ((a, 0)). Therefore, the focus (F = left(frac{1}{2}, 0right)). 2. **Calculate the radius of the circle**: The radius of the circle, which is (|PF|) is calculated as the distance between points (Pleft(frac{9}{2}, 0right)) and (Fleft(frac{1}{2}, 0right)): [ |PF| = left| frac{9}{2} - frac{1}{2} right| = left| frac{8}{2} right| = 4 ] Hence, the radius of the circle is 4. 3. **Write down the equation of the circle**: Using the standard form of a circle ((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2), with center (Pleft(frac{9}{2}, 0right)) and radius (r = 4), we find: [ left(x - frac{9}{2}right)^2 + y^2 = 16 ] 4. **Substitute the equation of the parabola into the circle's equation**: Substitute (y^2 = 2x) into the circle's equation: [ left(x - frac{9}{2}right)^2 + 2x = 16 ] 5. **Simplify and solve the resulting quadratic equation**: Simplify the above equation: [ x^2 - 9x + frac{81}{4} + 2x = 16 ] [ x^2 - 7x + frac{81}{4} = 16 ] Multiply by 4 to clear the fraction: [ 4x^2 - 28x + 81 = 64 ] [ 4x^2 - 28x + 17 = 0 ] Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}), where (a = 4), (b = -28), and (c = 17): [ x = frac{28 pm sqrt{784 - 272}}{8} = frac{28 pm sqrt{512}}{8} = frac{28 pm 16sqrt{2}}{8} = frac{14 pm 8sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{7 pm 4sqrt{2}}{2} ] Thus, the (x)-coordinates of the intersection points are: [ x_1 = frac{7 + 4sqrt{2}}{2}, quad x_2 = frac{7 - 4sqrt{2}}{2} ] 6. **Calculate (|MF| + |NF|)**: By definition of a parabola, the sum of the distances from any point on the parabola to the focus (directrix) is a constant.

For the first component: frac{-3a^3b + 4a^2b^2}{ab} = -3a^2 + 4ab = -3a^2 + 4a(a+1) = -3a^2 + 4a^2 + 4a = a^2 + 4a, this simplifies to a(a+4). For the second component, using the difference of powers: a^4 - b^4 = (a^2)^2 - (b^2)^2 = (a^2 - b^2)(a^2 + b^2) = (a - b)(a + b)(a^2 + b^2) = -(2a+1)(a^2 + b^2), since b = a+1. Then, a^4 - b^4 = -(2a+1)((a^2 + (a+1)^2) = -(2a+1)(a^2 + a^2 + 2a + 1) = -(2a+1)(2a^2 + 2a + 1).

We need to ensure that these shapes are identical in terms of size and shape. The resulting sections are as follows: - Top-left quadrant: a portion from the top-left of the shape - Top-right quadrant: a portion from the top-right of the shape - Bottom-left quadrant: a portion from the bottom-left of the shape - Bottom-right quadrant: a portion from the bottom-right of the shape Each of these shapes retains the same size and orientation when considering the symmetry of the original figure. 5. **Comparing the resultant shapes:** All four sections are of the same dimensions and shape due to the symmetry: a. Identify the top-row and bottom-row cut in each of the quadrant. b. Ensure that the sections are congruent i.e., can be superimposed upon each other through rotation or reflection. 6. **Conclusion**: By observing the resultant shapes, it's clear they are identical and can be superimposed on one another, satisfying the problem condition.

Furthermore, we note that all prime numbers greater than (2) are odd. Hence, from now on, we consider (p) to be an odd prime number. 3. Let (q) be a prime divisor of (2^p + p). Note that if (q) divides (2^p + p), then (q) is an odd prime because (2^p + p) is an odd number (since (p) is odd and (2^p) is clearly even plus an odd number yields an odd number). 4. Since (q) divides (2^p + p) and (q) also divides (3^p + p), we can write: [ q mid 3^p + p - (2^p + p) = 3^p - 2^p. ] Hence, [ 3^p equiv 2^p pmod{q}. ] 5.

Assume, for contradiction, that all 25 posts are occupied by a Chizh. - Focus on the Chizh that landed last. Since it occupies the last unoccupied post, it must have caused a Chizh from one of its adjacent posts to fly away.

So the total cost for the cheap gym in the first year is: 120 + 50 = 170 Next, let's calculate the cost of the second gym membership. It is 3 times more expensive than the cheap one, so the monthly fee would be: 10/month * 3 = 30/month The sign-up fee for the second gym is 4 months of membership, so the sign-up fee would be: 4 months * 30/month = 120 Now, let's calculate the total cost for the second gym for the first year.

Converting the Equation of the Line:** Line l is given by rho cos theta = 2. In Cartesian coordinates, rho cos theta = x. Therefore, the equation of the line is: [x = 2.] **2. Converting the Equation of the Circle:** The circle C is given by rho = 2sqrt{2}sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right). Using the conversion rho = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} and sin(theta + alpha) = sinthetacosalpha + costhetasinalpha, and knowing sinfrac{pi}{4} = cosfrac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we can rewrite the equation as: [sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 2sqrt{2}left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}frac{x}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}frac{y}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}right),] which simplifies to: [x + y = sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.] Squaring both sides gives: [x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = x^2 + y^2,] which simplifies to 2xy = 0. This is an incorrect simplification on my part; let's correctly approach it: Starting from the correct conversion, the equation of the circle after simplifications becomes: [sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = x + y.] Squaring both sides correctly, we get: [x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy.] Upon correctly interpreting the transformations, the correct conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates for the circle's equation is: [x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0.] Rewriting this equation, we get: [(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 2.] **3. Analyzing the Geometry:** The center of the circle is at (1, 1) and the radius sqrt{2}. The line x=2 is vertical, and its distance to the center of the circle is 1 unit, which is less than the radius but greater than half of the radius.

This implies that t is maximized when sin A = sin C. Given sin C = frac{3}{2} - sin A, we express t as t = 2sin A(frac{3}{2} - sin A) = -2sin^2 A + 3sin A. When sin A = frac{3}{4}, t attains its minimum value: t = -2left(frac{3}{4}right)^2 + 3 times frac{3}{4} = 1. Thus, t ranges within [1, frac{9}{8}]. Considering tsqrt{(frac{9}{4}-t)(t-frac{1}{4})} = frac{1}{4}sqrt{-16t^4 + 40t^3 - 9t^2}, we define f(t) = -16t^4 + 40t^3 - 9t^2 for t in [1, frac{9}{8}].

We also need to find the radius of this circle. 1. Let O_i be the center of circle k_i for i=1, 2, 3, and the point of intersection of the common external tangents of circles k_1 and k_2 be denoted by A, and that of circles k_1 and k_3 be denoted by B. 2.

Step 2: Casework based on the adjacent chips We consider the following case based on the colors of the chips adjacent to the fixed red chip. We must ensure no diagonal adjacency for same-color chips, hence restricting placement choices. **Case: Ensuring no adjacent chips of the same color** - **Subcase 1**: Alternate the red and green chips on the first row and first column ensuring we start with a red chip. - **Subcase 2**: Attempt to fit the remaining blue and green chips in the grid ensuring no adjacency. Step 3: Counting the configurations For each subcase: - **Subcase 1**: The first row and column have alternating red and green chips. The remaining center square cannot be red or green, it must be blue. This leads to only one configuration. - **Subcase 2**: With the center square fixed as blue, we place the remaining blue chips ensuring no adjacency. This placement restricts the positions severely and only allows one possible configuration due to the grid's limited space and the number of chips. Step 4: Total configurations Combining configurations from all subcases, we find a very limited number of valid configurations, given the strict conditions. With the constraints and chip counts, there are a total of 1 configuration possible. Thus, the total number of ways to place the chips is 1.

If the selling price is Rs 500, we can calculate the cost price (CP) using the formula: Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Profit Given that Profit = 25% of CP, we can write: 500 = CP + (25/100) * CP 500 = CP * (1 + 0.25) 500 = CP * 1.25 CP = 500 / 1.25 CP = Rs 400 So, the cost price of the first article is Rs 400, and the selling price is Rs 500 as given. **Second Article:** The shopkeeper sells the second article at a loss of 25%. The cost price is given as Rs 800. We can calculate the selling price (SP) using the formula: Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) - Loss Given that Loss = 25% of CP, we can write: SP = 800 - (25/100) * 800 SP = 800 - 0.25 * 800 SP = 800 - 200 SP = Rs 600 So, the selling price of the second article is Rs 600. **Third Article:** The shopkeeper sells the third article at a profit of 50%. The cost price is given as Rs 1800. We can calculate the selling price (SP) using the formula: Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Profit Given that Profit = 50% of CP, we can write: SP = 1800 + (50/100) * 1800 SP = 1800 + 0.50 * 1800 SP = 1800 + 900 SP = Rs 2700 So, the selling price of the third article is Rs 2700.

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives: [ 10k = -20 implies k = -2 ] 3. Substituting k = -2 into the first equation: [ 80(-2) + b = 240 implies b = 400 ] Therefore, the linear function relationship between y and x is: [ y = -2x + 400 ] Encapsulating the answer: [ boxed{y = -2x + 400} ] Part 2: Pricing for a 8000 Profit 1.

For the line l: x - y + 4 = 0, we have A = 1, B = -1, and C = 4. A point C on the circle can be described using the parametric equations given by x = 1 + 2costheta and y = 1 + 2sintheta. Substituting these coordinates into the distance formula gives us: d = frac{|(1)(1 + 2costheta) + (-1)(1 + 2sintheta) + 4|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}}. Let's simplify the numerator first: |1 + 2costheta - 1 - 2sintheta + 4| = |2costheta - 2sintheta + 4|. Using the fact that sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{2}, we can rewrite the distance as: d = frac{|2costheta - 2sintheta + 4|}{sqrt{2}}. We can further simplify by factoring out sqrt{2}: d = frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{2}}| sqrt{2}(costheta - sintheta) + 2sqrt{2}|. Therefore, d = |sqrt{2}(costheta - sintheta) + 2sqrt{2}|. We can apply a trigonometric identity by recognizing that cos(theta - frac{pi}{4}) = costhetacos(frac{pi}{4}) + sinthetasin(frac{pi}{4}), which, since cos(frac{pi}{4}) = sin(frac{pi}{4}) = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, simplifies to costheta - sintheta. Thus, we rewrite our expression for distance: d = |2cos(theta + frac{pi}{4}) + 2sqrt{2}|. The maximum and minimum values of cos(theta + frac{pi}{4}) are 1 and -1 respectively. Therefore, the minimum value for the distance d occurs when cos(theta + frac{pi}{4}) = -1, giving us: d_{text{min}} = |-2 + 2sqrt{2}| = 2 - 2sqrt{2}, but we can conclude that a distance cannot be negative.

Since the vectors vec{a}_{60} + vec{b}_{60} + vec{c}_{60} = 0 (because they form a closed loop as the sides of triangle ABC), and similarly, vec{a} + vec{b} + vec{c} = 0, we have: [ overrightarrow{AG}_{60} - overrightarrow{AH} = 0 ] 7. Because AH is the +60^circ rotation of AG, and since AF is the +60^circ rotation of AC, we conclude that triangle AHF is the +60^circ rotation of triangle AGC. Therefore, angle AHC = angle AGC. 8. Similarly, we can show that triangle BIC is the +60^circ rotation of triangle BHE, and hence angle BIC = angle BHE. 9.

Since the line is parallel to the polar axis, it must have a constant value for the radial coordinate rho, and the angular coordinate theta will change. However, for the point (1, frac{pi}{2}), the line is at a right angle to the polar axis which means it intersects the circular track of radius 1, maintaining rho = 1 for all points on the line. Therefore, for any point P(rho, theta) on the line, we have: rho sin(theta) = 1 The sin(theta) term means that, for a given radius rho, its projection on the vertical axis (which is sinusoidal) is equal to 1 – consistent with how the line passes through the point (1, frac{pi}{2}). Thus, the equation of the line passing through (1, frac{pi}{2}) and parallel to the polar axis is boxed{rho sin(theta) = 1}. Enhanced Explanation: 1. Recall that in polar coordinates, a line parallel to the polar axis (the vertical line in Cartesian coordinates) will have a constant projection on this axis. This can be observed from a right triangle formed by the radius of the circle, the polar axis, and the line itself. 2. We understand that rho sin(theta) gives us the vertical component of the polar coordinates, and since our line is parallel to the polar axis, this value must remain constant for all points on our line. 3. For the given point with coordinates (1, frac{pi}{2}), the sin(theta) term is maximized because sin(frac{pi}{2}) = 1. Therefore, the general form of the line will maintain this maximum projection by keeping rho sin(theta) = 1 constant. 4.

Hence: [ frac{b}{a} = frac{a}{b - 1} ] 6. **Solve for (a) and (b)**: Cross-multiplying gives: [ b(b - 1) = a^2 ] Using the given hyperbola equation (a^2 - (b - 1)^2 = 1), we substitute (a^2 = b(b - 1)): [ a^2 = b(b - 1) ] Substituting into the hyperbola equation: [ b(b - 1) - (b - 1)^2 = 1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ b(b - 1) - (b^2 - 2b + 1) = 1 ] [ b^2 - b - b^2 + 2b - 1 = 1 ] [ b - 1 = 1 ] Hence: [ b = 2 ] Substitute (b = 2) back into (a^2 = b(b - 1)): [ a^2 = 2(2 - 1) = 2 ] [ a = sqrt{2} ] 7. **Find (sin^{-1}left(frac{a}{b}right))**: We have (a = sqrt{2}) and (b = 2), so: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] Finally: [ sin^{-1}left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) = frac{pi}{4} ] # Conclusion: (boxed{frac{pi}{4}})"},{"prompt":"Let ( P ) and ( Q ) be points on the sides ( BC ) and ( CD ) of the parallelogram ( ABCD ), respectively, such that ( BP = DQ ).

Half-full boxes contain 12.5 carrots each (half of 25), so 5 half-full boxes contain 5 * 12.5 = 62.5 carrots. Total carrots = 175 (from full boxes) + 62.5 (from half-full boxes) = 237.5 carrots (since we can't have half a carrot, we'll round this to 237 or 238 depending on the rounding method). 3.

To prove the original problem, we will use a special subset of N. Suppose a subset P of N contains any segment of consecutive natural numbers of arbitrary length. Then P is called a \\"long subset\\" of N. We will prove a strengthened version of the problem (I): If a long subset P of N is partitioned into r pairwise disjoint subsets A_{1}, A_{2}, dots, A_{r}, then one of these subsets A_{i} has the property (*). We use mathematical induction on r to prove (I): 1. **Base Case (r = 1)**: When r = 1, the problem is trivially true because there is only one subset, which is the entire set P. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume the statement (I) is true for some r = n, i.e., if a long subset P is partitioned into n pairwise disjoint subsets, then one of these subsets has property (*). 3. **Induction Step**: Consider r = n + 1. Suppose (P) is a long subset of (N) and is partitioned into (n+1) pairwise disjoint subsets (A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n}, A_{n+1}): [ P = A_{1} cup A_{2} cup cdots cup A_{n} cup A_{n+1} ] Let (Q = A_{1} cup A_{2} cup cdots cup A_{n}). - If (Q) is a long subset, then by the induction hypothesis, at least one subset (A_{i}) (for (i = 1, dots, n)) has the property (*), and we are done. - If (Q) is not a long subset, there exists some positive integer (m_{1}) such that (Q) does not contain any segment of (m_{1}) consecutive natural numbers. Since (P) is a long subset, for any given (k), (P) must contain a segment of length (k m_{1}) of consecutive natural numbers. Divide this segment into (k) smaller segments (P_{1}, P_{2}, ldots, P_{k}), each of length (m_{1}). Each small segment (P_{i}) must contain at least one element (a_{i}) that is not in (Q) (since (Q) does not contain (m_{1}) consecutive numbers), hence (a_{i} in A_{n+1}). We then have a sequence ( {a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k}} subseteq A_{n+1} ). Since (a_{i} in P_{i}) and these segments are consecutive, the differences (a_{j+1} - a_{j}) are bounded by: [ 1 leq a_{j+1} - a_{j} leq 2 m_{1}, quad text{for} quad j = 1, 2, ldots, k-1. ] Thus, (A_{n+1}) exhibits property (*) with (m = 2 m_{1}). By mathematical induction, we conclude that the statement (I) is true for any natural number (r). Since (N) itself is a long subset of (N), by the stronger statement (I), the original problem statement holds. Hence, the original problem is established.

The remaining two-thirds of the profit (2P/3) is divided in the ratio of their investments. Mary invested 650 and Mike invested 350, so the total investment is 650 + 350 = 1000. The ratio of Mary's investment to the total investment is 650/1000 = 13/20, and the ratio of Mike's investment to the total investment is 350/1000 = 7/20.

On the interval (-∞, ln(√a)), f'(x) < 0, so the function f(x) is strictly decreasing. On the interval (ln(√a), +∞), f'(x) > 0, so the function f(x) is strictly increasing.

However, this is not true for all real numbers x, so we discard this case. - When m neq 0, the quadratic function f(x) = mx^2 - (3-m)x + 1 must always be positive.

The discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation must be negative to ensure there are no real roots and therefore, the function does not cross the x-axis.

For the inequality mx > 0 to be true for any real number x, this is not possible since for any chosen m > 0, x could be negative, invalidating the inequality.

How many cows are on the farm?","completion":"Let's denote: - the number of horses by ( x ), - the number of ducks by ( y ), - the number of cows by ( z ). According to the problem statement, we have the following equations: 1. The number of cows is a third of the total number of horses and ducks combined: [ z = frac{x + y}{3} ] 2. The combined number of heads and legs of the ducks and horses is 100: [ x + 4x + y + 2y = 100 ] Simplifying the terms, we get: [ 5x + 3y = 100 ] Using the first equation, we substitute ( z ) in the second equation. Let’s solve it step by step: 1. From equation (1): [ z = frac{x + y}{3} ] 2. Let’s express ( y ) in terms of ( x ) and ( z ): [ y = 3z - x ] 3. Substitute ( y ) in equation (2): [ 5x + 3(3z - x) = 100 ] Expand and combine like terms: [ 5x + 9z - 3x = 100 ] [ 2x + 9z = 100 ] 4. Solve for ( x ) in terms of ( z ): [ 2x = 100 - 9z ] [ x = frac{100 - 9z}{2} ] 5. For ( x ) to be an integer, the term ( frac{100 - 9z}{2} ) must be an integer. This implies that ( 100 - 9z ) must be even. Since 100 is even, 9z must also be even. This means ( z ) must be an integer divisible by 2. Therefore, let ( z = 2u ) where ( u ) is an integer. Substituting this into the equation for ( x ): 6. Substitute ( z ): [ x = frac{100 - 9(2u)}{2} ] Simplifying: [ x = frac{100 - 18u}{2} ] [ x = 50 - 9u ] Now let’s make ( y ) also an integer: [ y = 3z - x = 6u - 50 + 9u = 15u - 50 ] 7. ( y ) must be positive: [ 15u - 50 > 0 ] [ 15u > 50 ] [ u > frac{50}{15} ] [ u > frac{10}{3} approx 3.33 ] Since ( u ) must be an integer, the smallest possible value is 4. 8. Also, ( x ) must be positive: [ x = 50 - 9u > 0 ] [ 50 > 9u ] [ u < frac{50}{9} approx 5.55 ] Therefore, ( u ) can be 4 or 5. # Case 1: ( u = 4 ) [ z = 2u Rightarrow z = 8 ] [ x = 50 - 9 cdot 4 = 50 - 36 = 14 ] [ y = 15u - 50 Rightarrow y = 15 cdot 4 - 50 = 60 - 50 = 10 ] # Case 2: ( u = 5 ) [ z = 2u Rightarrow z = 10 ] [ x = 50 - 9 cdot 5 = 50 - 45 = 5 ] [ y = 15u - 50 Rightarrow y = 75 - 50 = 25 ] For the condition ( x > y ), only the first case satisfies ( x > y ).

To find the equation of line l, we first find the midpoint of segment AB, which is left(frac{3+5}{2}, frac{3+2}{2}right) = (4, frac{5}{2}). The slope of segment AB is frac{2-3}{5-3} = -frac{1}{2}.

These grid lines can either be horizontal or vertical and they divide the square into smaller rectangles.

Each domino intersects the line exactly once. We need to prove that d (the count of dominos intersecting this line) is even. 3. **Counting Squares on One Side of the Line**: - If we look at any portion of the board on one side of the line, it includes a certain number of squares. Since the entire board is a 6 times 6 grid, any half-plane cut by a line through the center contains 18 squares (i.e., 6 times 3 squares). 4. **Analysis of Domino Coverings**: - Each domino that intersects the line intersect along its width covering two squares. Therefore, when we look at all the squares on one side, each domino that intersects the line covers exactly one square on that side. 5. **Matching Parity**: - Any domino that intersects the line contributes exactly 1 square to the side's count because each domino covers 2 squares and since it intersects only once, one of its parts lies on one side of the line. - The number of squares on one side of the line is 18, which is even, hence the number of domino contributions (each contributing one) must also be even.

There must be at least one grid line (either horizontal or vertical) that does not intersect any domino.

Therefore, the volume V(x) of the rectangular solid is x cdot 2x cdot left( frac{9}{2} - 3x right) = -6x^3 + 9x^2. By setting V'(x) = 0, we find x = 1.

Since a square of a real number is always non-negative, this inequality has no solution. This means there are no integers that satisfy the inequality when a = 1. 2. **Case when a > 1:** - The inequality simplifies to 1 < x < a.

Then q^{n+1} divides a_{n+2} because: [ a_{n+2} = alpha a_{n+1} - a_n = frac{p}{q} a_{n+1} - a_n. ] Since a_{n+1} is divisible by q^n, a_{n+2} must be divisible by q^{n+1}. 8. **Contradiction:** Since a_{n+2}a_n - a_{n+1}^2 = c, for large enough n, q^{2n} divides c. This is a contradiction because c is a fixed positive integer and cannot be divisible by arbitrarily large powers of q. 9. **Conclusion:** Therefore, alpha must be an integer for all terms of the sequence to be integers.

This theorem states that any planar graph can be colored with at most five colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Let the colors be ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ). 2. **Defining the Oriented Graph ( G_1 )**: - Construct an oriented graph ( G_1 ) with vertex set ( V(G_1) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ) and directed edges as follows: [ 1 to 2, quad 1 to 3, quad 1 to 4, quad 2 to 3, quad 2 to 4, quad 4 to 3, quad 1 to 5, quad 5 to 2, quad 5 to 3, quad 5 to 4 ] 3. **Orienting the Edges of ( G )**: - For each edge ( uv in E(G) ), orient ( uv ) as ( u to v ) or ( v to u ) based on the orientation of the corresponding colors in ( G_1 ).

This is because the directed edges in ( G_1 ) are arranged such that no four consecutive edges can all have the same orientation. 5. **Conclusion for ( G )**: - Since the orientation of edges in ( G ) is derived from ( G_1 ), the same property holds for ( G ). Therefore, in any cycle of ( G ), at most (frac{3k}{4}) edges can share the same orientation. 6. **Optimality of the Bound**: - Consider the complete graph ( K_4 ). It is a planar graph with 6 edges and 4 vertices. Any orientation of the edges of ( K_4 ) will have cycles where exactly (frac{3}{4}) of the edges share the same orientation.

The tangents from a point to a circle are equal, so: - ( AP = AS = x ) - ( BP = BQ = y ) - ( CQ = CR = z ) - ( DR = DS = w ) 3. **Express the side lengths in terms of tangents:** - ( AB = AP + PB = x + y ) - ( BC = BQ + QC = y + z ) - ( CD = CR + RD = z + w ) - ( DA = DS + SA = w + x ) 4. **Relate the sides and diagonals using the law of sines and areas:** Using the area approach and considering the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ), we can break up the areas into triangles.

We start by completing the square for the quadratic form: [ ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 = n ] We can rewrite this as: [ a left( x^2 + frac{b}{a}xy right) + cy^2 = n ] Completing the square inside the parentheses: [ x^2 + frac{b}{a}xy + left( frac{b}{2a}y right)^2 - left( frac{b}{2a}y right)^2 = x^2 + frac{b}{a}xy + frac{b^2}{4a^2}y^2 - frac{b^2}{4a^2}y^2 ] [ = left( x + frac{b}{2a}y right)^2 - frac{b^2}{4a^2}y^2 ] Substituting back, we get: [ a left( left( x + frac{b}{2a}y right)^2 - frac{b^2}{4a^2}y^2 right) + cy^2 = n ] [ a left( x + frac{b}{2a}y right)^2 - frac{ab^2}{4a^2}y^2 + cy^2 = n ] [ a left( x + frac{b}{2a}y right)^2 + left( c - frac{b^2}{4a} right)y^2 = n ] Since ( ac - frac{b^2}{4a} = frac{4ac - b^2}{4a} ), we can rewrite the equation as: [ a left( x + frac{b}{2a}y right)^2 + frac{4ac - b^2}{4a} y^2 = n ] Let ( p = 4ac - b^2 ). Since ( p ) is a positive squarefree integer, we have: [ a left( x + frac{b}{2a}y right)^2 + frac{p}{4a} y^2 = n ] This equation implies that the number of integer solutions ((x, y)) is finite because the quadratic form is positive definite (since ( a > 0 ) and ( p > 0 )). 2. **Proving that ( M(n) = M(p^k cdot n) ) for every integer ( k ge 0 ):** Consider the equation ( ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 = n ).

Let point A be (k, h), and the radius of odot Q be r. 3. The points M and N are the intersection points of odot Q with line l, hence their coordinates are M(x-r, 0) and N(x+r, 0) respectively. 4. Distance PQ is given by [ PQ = sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (0-2)^2} = sqrt{x^2 + 4}. ] Since PQ = 1 + r, we get: [ sqrt{x^2 + 4} = 1 + r. ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ x^2 + 4 = (1 + r)^2 implies x^2 + 4 = 1 + 2r + r^2. ] Rearranging, we obtain: [ x^2 = r^2 + 2r - 3 implies x = pm sqrt{r^2 + 2r - 3}. ] 5. Let's compute the slopes (k_{AN} and k_{AM}) of AN and AM: [ k_{AN} = frac{h-0}{k-(x+r)} = frac{h}{k-x-r}, quad k_{AM} = frac{h-0}{k-(x-r)} = frac{h}{k-x+r}. ] 6. Using the tangent formula for the angle between two lines: [ tan (angle MAN) = left| frac{k_{AN} - k_{AM}}{1 + k_{AN}k_{AM}} right| = left| frac{frac{h}{k-x-r} - frac{h}{k-x+r}}{1 + frac{h}{k-x-r} cdot frac{h}{k-x+r}} right|. ] Simplifying the numerator and the denominator: [ tan (angle MAN) = left| frac{h left( frac{1}{k-x-r} - frac{1}{k-x+r} right)}{1 + frac{h^2}{(k-x-r)(k-x+r)}} right| = left| frac{h left( frac{(k-x+r) - (k-x-r)}{(k-x-r)(k-x+r)} right)}{1 + frac{h^2}{(k-x-r)(k-x+r)}} right|. ] Simplifying further: [ tan(angle MAN) = 2rh / left((k-x)^2 - r^2 + h^2right). ] 7. Substituting x = pm sqrt{r^2 + 2r - 3}: [ tan(angle MAN) = frac{2rh}{(k pm sqrt{r^2 + 2r - 3})^2 - r^2 + h^2}. ] 8. Given 2m = h^2 + k^2 - 3, let m + (1 - nh)r = pm k sqrt{r^2 + 2r - 3}. Squaring both sides: [ m^2 + 2m(1 - nh)r + (1 - nh)^2 r^2 = k^2 r^2 + 2k^2r - 3k^2. ] 9. We solve the system of equations: [ begin{cases} m^2 = -3k^2, 2m(1 - nh) = 2k^2, (1 - nh)^2 = k^2. end{cases} ] 10. From m^2 = -3k^2, we find m = 0, k = 0. Solving (1 - nh)^2 = k^2 gives n = 1/h. Given 2m = h^2 - 3 yields h = pm sqrt{3}. 11. Therefore, tan(angle MAN) = frac{1}{n} = h = pm sqrt{3}. Hence: [ angle MAN = 60^circ text{ or } 120^circ. ] When Q(0,0), r=1, we deduce angle MAN = 60^circ.

The formula to calculate the number of cars after each year is: Number of cars after n years = Initial number of cars * (1 + Percentage increase)^n In this case, the percentage increase is 75%, which can be written as 0.75 in decimal form. So the formula becomes: Number of cars after n years = 25 * (1 + 0.75)^n Let's calculate the number of cars for each year up to five years: After 1 year: Number of cars = 25 * (1 + 0.75)^1 Number of cars = 25 * 1.75 Number of cars = 43.75 Since Bobby can't have a fraction of a toy car, we'll round to the nearest whole number.

The base of the power alternates between having an additional '01' or '011' at the end as k increases. Step 2: Establish the behavior of the sequence We start by comparing the first few terms: - **Comparing a_1 and a_2:** [ a_1 = 0.201, quad a_2 = (0.2011)^{a_1} ] Since 0.2011 > 0.201 and 0 < a_1 < 1, we have: [ a_2 = (0.2011)^{0.201} > (0.201)^{0.201} = a_1 ] Thus, a_1 < a_2. - **Comparing a_2 and a_3:** [ a_3 = (0.20101)^{a_2} ] Since 0.20101 < 0.2011 and 0 < a_2 < 1, we have: [ a_3 = (0.20101)^{a_2} < (0.2011)^{a_2} = a_2 ] Thus, a_3 < a_2. - **Comparing a_3 and a_4:** [ a_4 = (0.201011)^{a_3} ] Since 0.201011 > 0.20101 and 0 < a_3 < 1, we have: [ a_4 = (0.201011)^{a_3} > (0.20101)^{a_3} = a_3 ] Thus, a_3 < a_4. Step 3: General pattern and induction hypothesis From the comparisons, we observe that: - When k is odd, a_k < a_{k+1}. - When k is even, a_k > a_{k+1}. This suggests a zigzag pattern where each odd-indexed term is less than the next term, and each even-indexed term is greater than the next term. Step 4: Determine when a_k = b_k Given the zigzag pattern, the sequence {a_k} is rearranged in decreasing order as {b_k} such that: [ b_1 = a_2 > b_2 = a_4 > ldots > b_{1005} = a_{2010} > b_{1006} = a_{2011} > ldots > b_{2010} = a_3 > b_{2011} = a_1 ] Thus, a_k = b_k only when k is an even number from 2 to 2010 inclusive.

Definition Recap: - We define a real polynomial p(x) as a “square polynomial” if there exists a non-constant real polynomial q(x) such that p(x) = q^2(x). - We need to determine if there exist non-constant real polynomials f(x) and g(x) such that neither f(x) nor g(x) is a square polynomial, but f(g(x)) and g(f(x)) are both square polynomials. 2. Introduce Lemma: - Lemma: If p(x) is a real square polynomial and alpha is a non-zero complex number, then p(x) - alpha is not a square polynomial in the realm of complex polynomials. 3. Proof of Lemma: - Assume p(x) = q^2(x) where q(x) is a non-constant real polynomial. - Suppose there exists a complex polynomial r(x) such that p(x) - alpha = r^2(x). - Then, we have: [ alpha = q^2(x) - r^2(x) = (q(x) - r(x))(q(x) + r(x)). ] - Since q(x) is a non-constant polynomial, both q(x) - r(x) and q(x) + r(x) are non-constant polynomials, which leads to a contradiction because alpha is a non-zero complex number. 4.

Without loss of generalization, let alpha_1 be an odd number. 6. Checking f(g(x)): - Consider f(g(x)) = a prod_{i=1}^n (g(x) - x_i)^{alpha_i}. - Since f(g(x)) is a square polynomial, we know each term (g(x) - x_i)^{alpha_i} must form a square when combined. - Each (g(x) - x_i) must itself form a product of complex polynomials squared (since alpha_1 is odd), implying g(x) - x_1 must be a complex square polynomial. 7. Form of g(x): - Let's assume g(x) - x_1 = h^2(x) for some complex polynomial h(x).

We analyze the need by considering rectangles of size 2 times 3 on the board. 2. **Rectangular Subdivision**: Note that each 2 times 3 rectangle contains 6 squares and potentially two 2 times 2 ships could overlap within these when the rectangle extends over the board boundary: - Consider the rectangle consisting of three 1 times 2 domino pieces. - Domino arrangements help in visualization and proper detector placement. 3. **Detector Placement**: - If we place a detector in any cell of this configuration, we must consider how the 2 times 2 ship interacts with it. Essentially, at least one cell of each possible ship arrangement in this rectangle must signal the detector. - Given the 2 times 2 configuration can occupy different dominoes across 2 times 3 rectangle, at least two detectors per rectangle are necessary to ensure all ship’s positions can be detected. 4. **Calculating Total Detectors**: With the board divided effectively into these overlapping 2 times 3 rectangles: [ text{Rectangles along width and height} approx leftlceil frac{7}{2} rightrceil times leftlceil frac{7}{3} rightrceil approx 4 times 3 = 12 text{ rectangles} ] - We place 2 detectors per rectangle – yielding: [ 2 times 12 = 24 text{ detectors. However, to avoid overlap and redundancy ideally, we optimize an arrangement.} 5. **Optimization through Checkerboard Pattern**: - Considering an interleaved pattern reducing redundant signals that simplify detecting 2 times 2 ship regions: - Optimized observe patterns result only in non-overlapping checkerboard ensuring efficient problem-solving reduces the detector count to 16. 6. **Verification with Example Illustraction**: - Geometrically assess placing of all 16 detectors as shown ensures any 2 times 2 ship covers across spans the board reliably. Details ensuring absolute guarantees they're envisaged patterns. Conclusion This ensures the coverage, correct positioning, and then methodical problem solving leading to a solution.

According to the problem, the discriminant of this quadratic equation is always positive: b^2 - 4a(b - 1) > 0 For any real number b in mathbb{R}, the inequality b^2 - 4ab + 4a > 0 must hold. Consequently, we have: (4a)^2 - 4(4a) < 0 Rightarrow a^2 - a < 0 Therefore, the range of values for a is boxed{0 < a < 1}. 3. According to the problem, we have: f(x_1) + x_2 = x_1 + x_2 = -frac{b}{a} = frac{-a}{2a^2 + 1} This implies that b = frac{a^2}{2a^2 + 1}. Let t = a^2 in (0, 1).

Given that 2^{m+1} + 1 divides 3^{2^m} + 1, we can write this as: [ 3^{2^m} equiv -1 pmod{q} ] 3. From this, we know that gcd(3, q) = 1 because 3 is a base of the congruence relation modulo q and q is odd. 4. Squaring both sides of the congruence, we get: [ (3^{2^m})^2 equiv (-1)^2 pmod{q} ] Which simplifies to: [ 3^{2^{m+1}} equiv 1 pmod{q} ] 5. Let k denote the smallest positive integer such that: [ 3^k equiv 1 pmod{q} ] Then, k must be a divisor of 2^{m + 1} (by Fermat's Little Theorem). 6. Since k divides 2^{m + 1}, we can write k = 2^r, where r is some integer satisfying r leq m + 1. 7. Suppose r leq m, it would imply: [ 3^{2^m} equiv 1 pmod{q} ] This contradicts the initial condition that 3^{2^m} equiv -1 pmod{q}. 8. Therefore, we conclude that r = m + 1. 9. From Euler's theorem, we know k must also divide varphi(q), where varphi is the Euler's totient function: [ varphi(q) = q - 1 = 2^{m+1} ] 10. As varphi(q) leq q - 1: Hence, [ varphi(q) = q - 1 ] Thus 2^{m + 1} = q - 1 dividing itself gives: [ varphi(q) = q - 1 ] 11.

Since there are 4 balls in total and we want to draw 2, we can use the combination formula C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. Therefore, the total number of ways to draw 2 balls from 4 is: C(4, 2) = frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = frac{4 cdot 3}{2 cdot 1} = 6 Now, let's find the number of favorable ways that draw one white ball and one black ball. Since there are 2 white balls and 2 black balls, we can choose one white ball in 2 ways and one black ball in 2 ways. Since these are independent events, we multiply the number of ways to find the total number of favorable outcomes: 2 times 2 = 4 Thus, the probability of drawing one white ball and one black ball is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: P(text{one white, one black}) = frac{text{favorable outcomes}}{text{total outcomes}} = frac{4}{6} = frac{2}{3} The final step-by-step solution is: 1. Total number of ways to draw 2 balls from 4: C(4, 2) = 6. 2. Number of favorable outcomes (one white and one black): 2 times 2 = 4. 3.

We denote the length of this chain as ( alpha_i geq 1 ), and we call it the length of the divisibility chain starting at ( a_i ). 2. **Optimal Divisibility Chain**: Among all possible divisibility chains starting at ( a_i ), we consider the one with the maximum possible length and denote this maximum length as ( A(i) ). Thus, ( A(i) ) represents the length of the longest divisibility chain starting at ( a_i ). 3. **Case Analysis**: - Suppose there exists an index ( i ) such that ( A(i) geq n+1 ). In this case, starting from ( a_i ), we can find a divisibility chain with at least ( n+1 ) numbers.

Prove that this heptagon has four equal angles.","completion":"1. **Consider the Sum of Sines and Cosines**: Let us consider a convex heptagon with angles theta_1, theta_2, theta_3, theta_4, theta_5, theta_6, theta_7. From the problem statement, we choose 4 angles of the heptagon and compute their sines, and for the remaining 3 angles, we compute their cosines. The sum of these 7 values should be independent of our specific choice of the 4 angles to take the sines of. 2. **Permutation and Transform**: Without loss of generality, reorder the angles and consider swapping one sine with one cosine. Specifically, let us switch sin(theta_i) and cos(theta_j), and let us denote the arguments by alpha and beta, respectively. The new sum becomes: (sin beta + cos alpha) - (sin alpha + cos beta) Simplifying this difference using trigonometric identities gives: [ (sin beta + cos alpha) - (sin alpha + cos beta) = sqrt{2} left( sin left( beta - frac{pi}{4} right) - sin left( alpha - frac{pi}{4} right) right) ] 3. **Sum Consistency**: According to the problem, the value of the sum does not change with the choice of the sets of angles. Thus, equating the expressions, we have: [ sin left( alpha - frac{pi}{4} right) = sin left( beta - frac{pi}{4} right) ] Given that alpha, beta in (0, pi), the solutions to the equation would be: [ alpha - frac{pi}{4} = beta - frac{pi}{4} quad text{or} quad alpha - frac{pi}{4} = pi - (beta - frac{pi}{4}) ] Simplifying, this gives us: [ alpha = beta quad text{or} quad alpha = frac{3pi}{2} - beta ] 4. **Implications for the Heptagon Angles**: If alpha is any given angle of the heptagon, then the other angles must satisfy: [ theta_i = alpha quad text{or} quad theta_i = frac{3pi}{2} - alpha ] Since the sum of all interior angles of a heptagon is (7-2) pi = 5pi, this condition must hold for all seven angles. 5. **Constraint Due to 3pi/2 - alpha**: It implies that the angles cannot take more than two distinct values. Since there are 7 angles, at least 4 of them must be equal. Conclusion: Therefore, there exists at least four angles in the heptagon which have the same measure. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"As shown in Figure 610, a line l does not intersect with a circle centered at O.

Since ( A ) includes in their list the players beaten by ( A ) and their list, and since ( B ) (who is already in the list of ( A )) has beaten ( X ), ( X ) is on the list of ( B ), and thus indirectly on the list of ( A ).

According to the problem statement, the new number is 18 more than the original number. Mathematically, we express this as: [ 200 + 10x + y = (100x + 10y + 2) + 18 ] 4.

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9, 11, and 17. Since 9, 11, and 17 are all prime numbers except for 9 which is 3^2, their LCM is simply their product: LCM(9, 11, 17) = 9 * 11 * 17 Calculating this gives us: LCM = 9 * 11 * 17 = 99 * 17 = 1683 Now, we want to find a multiple of 1683 that is less than or equal to 3,381 and leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 9, 11, and 17.

Therefore, the difference ((P(2021) - P(1)) - (Q(2021) - Q(1))) must be divisible by 2020: [ (P(2021) - P(1)) - (Q(2021) - Q(1)) = (P(2021) - Q(2021)) - (P(1) - Q(1)). ] 6. Notice that: - (P(1) = 1 + 2 + ldots + 101 = frac{101 cdot 102}{2} = 5151). - As (Q(x)) is obtained by permuting the coefficients of (P(x)), it follows that (Q(1) = P(1) = 5151). 7. Consequently: [ (P(2021) - Q(2021)) - (P(1) - Q(1)) = P(2021) - Q(2021). ] 8. Since (P(1) = Q(1)), we find that (P(2021) - Q(2021)) must be divisible by 2020. 9. This is a contradiction because our initial assumption was that (P(k) - Q(k)) for all (k geq 2) is not divisible by 2020. 10. Therefore, there is no such polynomial (Q(x)) that satisfies the required condition.

Our goal is to sort these numbers in increasing order using a series of allowable swaps. According to the problem, we can swap two numbers if one of them is divisible by the other. 1. **Identify the correct position:** Consider the number ( k neq 1 ). Our objective is to place ( k ) in the ( k )-th position. Let's denote the current number in the ( k )-th position by ( n ). 2. **Swap ( n ) with 1:** If ( n neq 1 ), we swap ( n ) with 1. This is because 1 can be swapped with any number since every number is divisible by 1. After this step, number 1 is in the ( k )-th position. 3. **Swap ( k ) with 1:** Now, we swap 1 (which is currently in the ( k )-th position) with ( k ), because 1 divides every number, thus enabling this swap. As a result, the number ( k ) is accurately positioned at the ( k )-th place. This process guarantees that ( k ) will be correctly placed in the ( k )-th position using at most two swaps (first placing 1 in the ( k )-th position and then placing ( k ) there). 4. **Iterate through all numbers:** We repeat the above steps for each ( k ) ranging from 2 to 2017, thus correctly arranging all numbers. The numbers are processed in the reverse order to ensure that each position gets sorted one by one starting from the highest number, 2017. - For ( k = 2017, 2016, ldots, 1): - Place ( k ) in its correct position by swapping based on the method described. 5. **Conclusion:** By processing the numbers from 2017 down to 2 in this manner, we systematically place each number in its correct position.

We need to prove that if ( 2^{n-1} - 1 ) is divisible by ( n ), but ( 2^h - 1 ) is not divisible by ( n ), then ( n ) is a prime number. 3. Assume ( n ) is not a prime number. Then there exists a prime number ( q ) and an integer ( m geq 1 ) such that ( q^m mid n ) and ( q^m nmid 2^h - 1 ). 4. Since ( q^m mid n ), we have ( q^m mid 2^{n-1} - 1 ). Given ( n = ph + 1 ), it follows that ( q^m mid 2^{ph} - 1 ). 5. Let ( mathrm{ord}_{q^m}(2^h) ) denote the order of ( 2^h ) modulo ( q^m ). Since ( q^m mid 2^{ph} - 1 ), we have ( mathrm{ord}_{q^m}(2^h) mid p ). 6. Since ( q^m nmid 2^h - 1 ), we have ( mathrm{ord}_{q^m}(2^h) neq 1 ). Therefore, ( mathrm{ord}_{q^m}(2^h) = p ). 7. By definition of order, ( p mid phi(q^m) ), where ( phi ) is Euler's totient function. We have ( phi(q^m) = q^{m-1}(q-1) ). 8. Since ( p mid q^{m-1}(q-1) ), and ( p ) is a prime, ( p ) must divide either ( q^{m-1} ) or ( q-1 ). Since ( p neq q ) (because ( q mid n ) and ( n equiv 1 pmod{p} )), it follows that ( p mid q-1 ). Thus, ( p < q ). 9. Given ( n = ph + 1 ) and ( h < p ), we have ( n < p^2 ). Since ( q mid n ), ( q < p^2 ). 10. Since ( p < q ) and ( q < p^2 ), we must have ( m = 1 ) (otherwise ( q^m ) would be too large). Therefore, ( n = aq ) for some integer ( a ). 11. Since ( n = ph + 1 ), we have ( ph + 1 = aq ).

Setup and assumption:** We aim to prove that the constant ( c = 10 ) satisfies the condition in the theorem. Assume ( G ) is a graph such that the average degree ( d(G) geqslant 10r^2 ). **2. Applying Theorem 1.4.3:** By Theorem 1.4.3, if the average degree ( d(G) geqslant 10r^2 ), the graph ( G ) must contain a subgraph ( H ) with the following properties: - The connectivity ( kappa(H) geqslant r^2 ). - The minimum degree ( delta(H) geqslant varepsilon(G) - r^2 geqslant 10r^2 - r^2 = 9r^2 ). **3. Selection of vertices:** To find a subgraph in ( H ) that forms a ( K^r )-expansion, we proceed as follows: - Select ( r ) vertices in ( H ) to serve as branch vertices. Denote this set of branch vertices as ( X ). - Let ( Y ) be a set consisting of ( r(r-1) ) vertices in ( H ) such that each vertex in ( X ) has ( r-1 ) neighbors in ( Y ). Thus, ( Y ) contains all the necessary vertices for connecting the branch vertices to form a ( K^r )-expansion. **4.

Davonte ran 3.25 kilometers farther than Mercedes, so we add 3.25 km to Mercedes' distance: Davonte's distance = 18.75 km + 3.25 km = 22 km Now, let's find out how far Felicia ran. Felicia ran 1.75 kilometers less than Davonte, so we subtract 1.75 km from Davonte's distance: Felicia's distance = 22 km - 1.75 km = 20.25 km To find the average distance Emilia ran, we add the distances of Jonathan, Davonte, and Felicia and then divide by 3: Emilia's distance = (7.5 km + 22 km + 20.25 km) / 3 = 49.75 km / 3 = 16.5833 km Finally, we add up the distances of Mercedes, Davonte, Felicia, and Emilia to get the total: Total distance = 18.75 km + 22 km + 20.25 km + 16.5833 km = 77.5833 km Therefore, Mercedes, Davonte, Felicia, and Emilia ran a total of boxed{77.5833} kilometers."},{"prompt":"Given the origin as the vertex, find the equation of the parabola whose focus is the center of the circle described by x^2 + y^2 = 4x.","completion":"First, let's rewrite the equation of the circle in its standard form to find its center. We complete the square for x to get: [ (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 4, ] which represents a circle with center (2, 0) and radius 2. Since the focus of the parabola is the center of the circle, the focus is F(2, 0). A parabola with the vertex at the origin and its axis along the x-axis will have an equation of the form y^2 = 4px for some positive value p (since the parabola opens to the right). Here, the focus lies on the axis of symmetry of the parabola which is the x-axis. The distance from the vertex (origin) to the focus (located on the x-axis) is p. Since the focus F(2, 0) is 2 units away from the origin along the x-axis, p = 2. Substituting this value into the parabola's equation, we get: [ y^2 = 4(2)x, ] which simplifies to: [ y^2 = 8x. ] This is the equation of the parabola with its vertex at the origin and focus at (2, 0).

Determine, in terms of n , maximal number of good pairs.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to determine the maximum number of \\"good\\" pairs ((i, j)) where (1 leq i leq j leq 2n-1) and the number of blue numbers among (i, i+1, ldots, j) is odd. 2. **Constructing the Graph:** Let's construct a graph (G) with vertices labeled (1, 2, ldots, 2n-1). We will connect vertices (i) and (j) (where (i < j)) if the segment ([i, j]) contains an odd number of blue numbers. 3. **Graph Properties:** Observe that this graph is triangle-free. This is because if there were a triangle, say with vertices (a, b, c) (where (a < b < c)), then the segments ([a, b]), ([b, c]), and ([a, c]) would all need to have an odd number of blue numbers. However, the union of two segments with an odd number of blue numbers would result in an even number of blue numbers, contradicting the condition for the third segment. 4. **Applying Turán's Theorem:** Turán's theorem states that a triangle-free graph on (n) vertices has at most (leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor) edges. In our case, the number of vertices is (2n-1), so the maximum number of edges is: [ leftlfloor frac{(2n-1)^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{4n^2 - 4n + 1}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor n^2 - n + frac{1}{4} rightrfloor = n^2 - n ] 5. **Constructing the Optimal Coloring:** To achieve the maximum number of good pairs, we can color exactly (n) numbers blue. This ensures that every segment containing exactly one blue number is a good pair. The number of such segments is: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} k = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] However, this does not directly give us the maximum number of good pairs. Instead, we need to consider the total number of segments and ensure that the number of blue numbers is odd in as many segments as possible. 6. **Final Calculation:** By carefully choosing the positions of the blue numbers, we can ensure that the number of good pairs is maximized. The optimal configuration is to place (n) blue numbers such that each segment containing an odd number of blue numbers is counted. This results in: [ n^2 ] good pairs. Therefore, the maximum number of good pairs is (boxed{n^2})."},{"prompt":"What is the interval in which the equation x^5 3x 1 = 0 cannot possibly have at least one real root?
