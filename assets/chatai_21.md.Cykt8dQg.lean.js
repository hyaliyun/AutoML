We need to find the minimum distance between P and Q during their motion, precise to 0.0001 cm. 2. **Coordinate System Setup:** First, set up a coordinate system for the cube: - Let A = (0, 0, 0). - The vertices of the cube have coordinates given by: - B = (100, 0, 0), - C = (100, 100, 0), - D = (0, 100, 0), - A_1 = (0, 0, 100), - B_1 = (100, 0, 100), - C_1 = (100, 100, 100), - D_1 = (0, 100, 100). 3. **Parameterize the Motion of Points:** Let P be moving along the line AC_1 which is the space diagonal: - ( A = (0, 0, 0) ) - ( C_1 = (100, 100, 100) ) The position of P as a function of time t (in seconds) is: [ mathbf{P}(t) = (3t, 3t, 3t) ] since it travels along (100, 100, 100) at 3 cm/s.

Hence, the induction is complete for (i = 0). 7. **Final Determination:** - We find that for large enough (n), there are only two distinct arc lengths unless every basic arc length results in (n = p + q - 1). - Calculation reveals that for (n = 1000), this condition makes the basic arcs split into (p_{19}), (q_{19}) and (p_{20}), (q_{20}), providing three different values. # Conclusion: The lengths of the basic arcs for ( n = 1000 ) take exactly three different values.

From the table, we can identify all possible outcomes of the sum of the two numbers: - When both draws are 1, the sum is 2. - When the first draw is 1 and the second draw is 2, or the first draw is 2 and the second draw is 1, the sum is 3. - When both draws are 2, the sum is 4. Thus, there are a total of 4 equally likely outcomes because each draw is independent, and each ball has an equal chance of being drawn due to the replacement. To find the probability that the sum of the two recorded numbers is 3, we look for the outcomes that meet this condition. There are 2 such outcomes: (1, 2) and (2, 1).

Each circle is tangent to one side of the triangle at the foot of the corresponding altitude. Prove that the second points of intersection of the circles are the vertices of a triangle similar to the original triangle.","completion":"1. **Define the basic setup**: Let the altitudes of the acute-angled triangle (ABC) intersect at point (H) (the orthocenter). Denote the feet of the altitudes from vertices (A), (B), and (C) as (A_0), (B_0), and (C_0) respectively. Hence, (A_0), (B_0), and (C_0) are the points where the altitudes (AA_0), (BB_0), and (CC_0) intersect the opposite sides. 2. **Position of the circles**: Construct three circles, each passing through (H) and tangential to one side of triangle (ABC): - The circle passing through (H) and tangent to side (BC) at point (A_0). - The circle passing through (H) and tangent to side (AC) at point (B_0). - The circle passing through (H) and tangent to side (AB) at point (C_0). 3. **Identify the diameters**: Because each altitude is perpendicular to the respective side it intersects, the segments (HA_0), (HB_0), and (HC_0) are the diameters of the respective circles. This is due to the right angle subtended by the altitude at the base, making these segments diameters of the circles by the property of the right triangle inscribed in a semicircle (Thales' theorem). 4. **Intersection points and orthotriangle**: Let the circles with diameters (HA_0) and (HB_0) intersect again at point (C_1). Since (HA_0) is a diameter, any point on the circle will view (HA_0) under a right angle: [ angle HC_1A_0 = 90^circ ] This implies that point (C_1) must lie on the line (A_0B_0) because it views both diameters (HA_0) and (HB_0) under right angles, thereby intersecting them at a right angle. 5. **Similar argument for the remaining circles**: Similarly, let the circles with diameters (HB_0) and (HC_0) intersect again at point (A_1). Then (A_1) must lie on the line (B_0C_0). And, the circles with diameters (HA_0) and (HC_0) intersect again at point (B_1), so (B_1) must lie on the line (A_0C_0). 6. **Conclude the configuration**: Observing these intersections, (B_1) and (C_1) are symmetric with respect to the altitudes (reflective property). Since (A_0A) is perpendicular to (BC), the line segment (C_1B_1) is parallel to (BC). Therefore, the pairs ((A_1B_1 parallel AB)), ((A_1C_1 parallel AC)), and ((B_1C_1 parallel BC)) signify that (A_1, B_1, C_1) form a triangle which is similar to the original triangle (ABC). Given that the configuration is parallel with corresponding sides, by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem again), the triangles (A_1B_1C_1) and (ABC) are similar.

The reduced salary R can be expressed as: R = S - (P/100) * S R = S * (1 - P/100) Now, to bring the reduced salary back to the original salary, it needs to be increased by 16.27906976744186%. This means that the reduced salary R needs to be multiplied by (1 + 16.27906976744186/100) to get back to the original salary S. So we have: S = R * (1 + 16.27906976744186/100) S = R * (1 + 0.1627906976744186) Substituting the expression for R from the first equation into the second equation, we get: S = S * (1 - P/100) * (1 + 0.1627906976744186) Since we are looking for the original salary S on both sides of the equation, we can divide both sides by S to get: 1 = (1 - P/100) * (1 + 0.1627906976744186) Now we need to solve for P.

Let the desired probability that both coins land on heads the first time we get a heads on either coin be ( p ). 2.

Suppose that the process continues for ( n ) successive turns where both coins are tails before landing on heads. The probability for such sequences is calculated as follows: [ (text{Probability for 'TT'})^n times text{Probability of 'HH'} ] - The probability of 'TT' in each turn is ( frac{1}{4} ). - The probability of 'HH' following any ( n ) turns of 'TT' is ( frac{1}{4} ). 4.

Consider the set ( S = {1, 2, ldots, 3n } ). We need to prove that in any subset of ( n+2 ) elements of ( S ), there are at least two elements whose difference lies between ( n ) and ( 2n ). 2. Assume we have a subset ( T ) of ( S ) with ( |T| = n+2 ) elements. 3. To facilitate the proof, let us assume that the largest element in ( T ) is ( 3n ). If this is not the case, we can always increase some or all of the elements of ( T ) until one of them reaches ( 3n ). Since the problem only requires the difference between elements and not their absolute values, this assumption does not lose generality. 4. Consider the remaining ( n+1 ) elements in ( T ). If one of these elements lies in the set ( {n+1, n+2, ldots, 2n+1} ), then the problem is solved as the difference between ( 3n ) and any of those elements is at least ( n ) and at most ( 2n ). 5. Assume none of the remaining ( n+1 ) elements lie in ( {n+1, n+2, ldots, 2n+1} ).

From the Pigeonhole Principle, if we choose ( n+1 ) numbers from ( n ) pairs, at least one of these pairs must contain two elements from our subset ( T ). These elements are picked from our pairs which fit within the range mentioned, so their differences satisfy the condition ( n leq |a - b| leq 2n ). 7. To prove this again with an alternative method, consider a circle that is divided into ( 3n ) equal parts, labelled ( 1, 2, ldots, 3n ), in counterclockwise order. Colour any ( n+2 ) points black, the rest white. 8. These ( n+2 ) black points must have at least one arc between them that is at least (frac{1}{3}) of the circle (since if all arcs were less than (frac{1}{3}), there would not be space for all points). 9. Any arc in this context corresponds to a difference which fits between ( n ) and ( 2n ). If this was not the case, by symmetry and distribution, the arcs would contradict the requirements of the pigeonhole principle. 10. The maximal arc not containing black points, noted as an unbroken section (free arc), if less than (frac{2}{3}) fills the complementary requirement. 11. Given the constraints and hypothetical contradiction negations, we ascertain the longest free arc indeed provides the covering ( n ) to ( 2n ) requirement. 12.

Therefore, we factorize each of the numbers and ensure an even power of the prime factors: [ begin{aligned} 21 = 3 times 7 22 = 2 times 11 34 = 2 times 17 39 = 3 times 13 44 = 2^2 times 11 45 = 3^2 times 5 65 = 5 times 13 76 = 2^2 times 19 133 = 7 times 19 153 = 3 times 3 times 17 end{aligned} ] 3. **Find Factors:** Combining these factorizations, we get: [ begin{aligned} text{Total Product} &= (2 times 2 times 2^2 times 2^2) times (3 times 3 times 3^2 times 3) times (5 times 5) times (7 times 7) times (11 times 11) times (13 times 13) times (17 times 17) times (19 times 19) &= 2^7 times 3^6 times 5^2 times 7^2 times 11^2 times 13^2 times 17^2 times 19^2 end{aligned} ] Because each prime’s power is even, the product can be rearranged into two groups of equal product, we are then guaranteed the ability to split the total product into two subsets each having: [ sqrt{text{Total Product}} = 2^{7/2} times 3^{6/2} times 5 times 7 times 11 times 13 times 17 times 19 ] 4. **Dividing into Two Equal Products:** Now, arrange the groups in such a way that each prime factor's split contributes equally to forming the same product for both groups. Below is one possible grouping: - Group 1: {21, 34, 44, 76, 153} - Group 2: {22, 39, 45, 65, 133} 5. **Verify:** Calculate the products individually: [ 21 times 34 times 44 times 76 times 153 = 349188840 ] [ 22 times 39 times 45 times 65 times 133 = 349188840 ] Therefore, each group is correctly formed. # Conclusion: The product of each group is: [ boxed{349188840} ]"},{"prompt":"Ron and Kathy are ticketsellers, Ron handling student tickets that sell for 2.00 dollars each and Kathy selling adult tickets.

The total income from both student and adult tickets is 60.00 dollars, so we can set up the following equation: [ 24.00 + 8x = 60.00 ] Now, we solve for ( x ): [ 8x = 60.00 - 24.00 ] [ 8x = 36.00 ] [ x = frac{36.00}{8} ] [ x = 4.50 ] Each adult ticket costs boxed{4.50} dollars."},{"prompt":"For how many nonnegative real values of x is sqrt{169sqrt[3]{x}} an integer?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to find the values of x such that sqrt{169-sqrt[3]{x}} is an integer.

The ratio of a's share to the total profit is: a's share / total profit = 15,120 / 36,000 The ratio of a's subscription to the total subscription is: a's subscription / total subscription = (x + 9,000) / (3x + 14,000) Since these ratios are equal, we can set them equal to each other and solve for x: (15,120 / 36,000) = (x + 9,000) / (3x + 14,000) Simplify the left side of the equation: 15,120 / 36,000 = 0.42 Now we have: 0.42 = (x + 9,000) / (3x + 14,000) Cross-multiply to solve for x: 0.42 * (3x + 14,000) = x + 9,000 Expand the left side: 1.26x + 5,880 = x + 9,000 Subtract x from both sides: 0.26x + 5,880 = 9,000 Subtract 5,880 from both sides: 0.26x = 3,120 Divide both sides by 0.26 to solve for x: x = 3,120 / 0.26 x = 12,000 Now we know c's subscription is Rs. 12,000. We can find b's and a's subscriptions: b = x + 5,000 = 12,000 + 5,000 = 17,000 a = x + 9,000 = 12,000 + 9,000 = 21,000 The total amount they subscribed for the business is: a + b + c = 21,000 + 17,000 + 12,000 = 50,000 So, the total amount they subscribed for the business is Rs. boxed{50,000} ."},{"prompt":"On Thanksgiving, Lucy had some chocolates.

The midpoints of the sides of triangle A'B'C' form a new triangle A_{2}B_{2}C_{2}. This process is repeated to form triangles A_{n}B_{n}C_{n} for n=1,2,ldots.

Let the vertices of the initial triangle correspond to the complex numbers a_{1}, b_{1}, and c_{1}. 3. **Rotation and Scaling:** Define varepsilon = cos 60^circ + i sin 60^circ = frac{1}{2} + i frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. The multiplication by varepsilon rotates a complex number by +60^circ **Transformation Formulas:** Using elementary calculations, the vertices of triangle A_{n+1} in terms of the vertices of triangle A_{n} follow the transformation: begin{aligned} a_{n+1} &= frac{1}{2}left(a_{n} + (1 - varepsilon) b_{n} + varepsilon c_{n}right), b_{n+1} &= frac{1}{2}left(varepsilon a_{n} + b_{n} + (1 - varepsilon) c_{n}right), c_{n+1} &= frac{1}{2}left((1 - varepsilon) a_{n} + varepsilon b_{n} + c_{n}right). end{aligned} 4. **Recursive Formula:** By induction, it can be proved that: begin{aligned} a_{n+1} &= left[left(2^{n+1} + (-1)^nright) a_{1} + left(2^n - (-1)^nright) frac{b_{1}}{varepsilon} + left(2^n - (-1)^nright) c_{1} varepsilonright] frac{1}{3 cdot 2^n}, b_{n+1} &= left[left(2^n - (-1)^nright) a_{1} varepsilon + left(2^{n+1} + (-1)^nright) b_{1} + left(2^n - (-1)^nright) frac{c_{1}}{varepsilon}right] cdot frac{1}{3 cdot 2^n}, c_{n+1} &= left[left(2^n - (-1)^nright) frac{a_{1}}{varepsilon} + left(2^n - (-1)^nright) b_{1} varepsilon + left(2^{n+1} + (-1)^nright) c_{1}right] frac{1}{3 cdot 2^n}. end{aligned} 5. **Taking Limits:** Taking the limit as n to infty, we get: begin{aligned} lim_{n to infty} a_{n} &= frac{2}{3} a_{1} + frac{b_{1}}{3 varepsilon} + frac{1}{3} c_{1} varepsilon = a, lim_{n to infty} b_{n} &= frac{1}{3} a_{1} varepsilon + frac{2}{3} b_{1} + frac{c_{1}}{3 varepsilon} = b, lim_{n to infty} c_{n} &= frac{a_{1}}{3 varepsilon} + frac{1}{3} b_{1} varepsilon + frac{2}{3} c_{1} = c. end{aligned} 6. **Proving Regularity:** To show the limiting triangle is regular, we must verify: (c - b) varepsilon = a - b.

The correct numbers for the above propositions are ______.","completion":"To analyze the correctness of each proposition step by step: **For (1):** The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 or -1 indicate a strong linear relationship. Therefore, if two variables are linearly related, a stronger correlation implies that the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is closer to 1. This makes proposition (1) correct. **For (2):** In a normal distribution curve, mu represents the mean, and sigma represents the standard deviation, which measures the dispersion of the data points around the mean. A smaller sigma means that the data points are more closely clustered around the mean, leading to a more concentrated distribution. Conversely, a larger sigma indicates that the data points are more spread out, resulting in a more dispersed distribution. Thus, proposition (2) is correct. **For (3):** The k^{2} statistic is used in the context of categorical data to test the independence of two variables. A larger k^{2} value suggests a stronger evidence against the null hypothesis of independence, implying a higher credibility that the variables A and B are related. Therefore, proposition (3) is correct. **For (4):** In regression analysis, the sum of squared residuals measures the discrepancy between the observed and predicted values. A smaller sum of squared residuals indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual data points. The R^{2} statistic, or the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). A larger R^{2} value suggests a better fit of the model to the data. Therefore, a smaller sum of squared residuals is associated with a larger R^{2} value, making proposition (4) correct. **For (5):** The least squares method aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals, leading to the derivation of the regression equation hat{y}=hat{b}x+hat{a}. However, this proposition suggests that there may be errors between the values of all explanatory variables x_{i} and y_{i}, which is a misunderstanding of the concept. The errors or residuals refer to the differences between the observed values y_{i} and the predicted values hat{y}_{i}, not between the explanatory variables x_{i} and y_{i}.

Analyzing the sign of f'(x): - For x < 0, we have e^x < 1, so e^x - 1 < 0. Therefore, f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically decreasing in (-infty, 0). - For x > 0, we have e^x > 1, so e^x - 1 > 0. Therefore, f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing in (0, +infty). Since f(x) transitions from decreasing to increasing at x = 0, f(x) reaches its minimum value at x = 0.

Let us denote the circle by k and consider an arbitrary line segment widetilde{A B} on the circumference of the circle that bisects the circle into two equal areas. 2. First, note that if A and B are diametrically opposite points on the circle, the line widetilde{A B} bisects the circle. In this case, the arc widetilde{A B} is clearly longer than the chord A B, which has a length equal to the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the length of widetilde{A B} is greater than the diameter of the circle. This corresponds to: [ text{arc length } widetilde{A B} > text{diameter of the circle} ] 3. Now, we consider the case where A and B are not diametrically opposite. In this situation, identify the unique diameter PQ that is parallel to the chord AB. If A coincides with B, take PQ as the diameter parallel to the tangent at that point. 4. Since A and B are on the same side of the diameter PQ, and widetilde{A B} bisects the circle's area, the arc widetilde{A B} must pass through the semicircle on the opposite side of PQ. 5. There exists a point M on widetilde{AB} that lies on PQ. Reflect the segment widetilde{MB} over PQ and denote the reflected segment as widetilde{MB'}. Then A and B' are diametrically opposite points on the circle because: [ angle PA = angle BQ = angle QB' ] 6. If we join the segments widetilde{AM} and widetilde{MB'}, we obtain an arc widetilde{AB'} that is at least as long as the arc widetilde{AB} and certainly longer than the diameter AB' of the circle. 7. Since widetilde{AB'} is constructed from widetilde{AM} and widetilde{MB'}, and widetilde{MB} is equal in length to widetilde{MB'} due to the reflection, it follows that: [ text{arc length } widetilde{AB} = text{arc length } widetilde{AB'} ] Thus, the line segment widetilde{AB}, which bisects the circle, must be: [ text{arc length } widetilde{AB} > text{diameter of the circle} ] In conclusion, we have proven that if an arc bisects the area of a circle, its length is indeed longer than the diameter of the circle. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the joint density function of the continuous twodimensional random variable (X, Y): [ f(x, y)= begin{cases} 4 x y e^{x^{2}y^{2}} & (x>0, y>0) 0 & (x<0 , text{or} , y<0). end{cases} ] Find: a) Expectations (means) of X and Y. b) Variances of X and Y.","completion":"Part (a): Finding the expected value of X and Y 1. **Find marginal density function ( f_X(x) ) for ( X )**: [ f_X(x) = int_{0}^{infty} f(x, y) , dy ] Given ( f(x, y) = 4xy e^{-x^2 - y^2} ) for ( x>0 ) and ( y>0 ), we have: [ f_X(x) = int_{0}^{infty} 4xy e^{-x^2 - y^2} , dy ] 2. **Evaluate the integral**: [ f_X(x) = 4x e^{-x^2} int_{0}^{infty} y e^{-y^2} , dy ] Using the integral ( int_{0}^{infty} y e^{-y^2} , dy ), which is a known integral result in the form of ( frac{1}{2} ): [ f_X(x) = 4x e^{-x^2} times frac{1}{2} = 2x e^{-x^2} quad text{for} quad x > 0 ] 3. **By symmetry, find ( f_Y(y) )**: [ f_Y(y) = int_{0}^{infty} f(x, y) , dx = 2y e^{-y^2} quad text{for} quad y > 0 ] 4. **Find the expected value of ( X )**: [ E(X) = int_{0}^{infty} x f_X(x) , dx = int_{0}^{infty} x left( 2x e^{-x^2} right) , dx ] [ E(X) = 2 int_{0}^{infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} , dx ] 5. **Simplify by using the substitution ( u = x^2 )**: [ int_{0}^{infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} , dx = frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{infty} u^{1/2-1} e^{-u} , du ] The integral is now in the form of the Gamma function ( Gamma left( frac{3}{2} right) = frac{1}{2} sqrt{pi} ): [ 2 times frac{1}{2} Gamma left( frac{3}{2} right) = 2 times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} sqrt{pi} = sqrt{pi}/2 ] 6. **By symmetry, ( E(Y) = sqrt{pi}/2 )**: [ E(Y) = sqrt{pi}/2 ] Therefore: [ E(X) = frac{sqrt{pi}}{2}, quad E(Y) = frac{sqrt{pi}}{2} ] Part (b): Finding the variance of ( X ) and ( Y ) 1. **Find the variance of ( X )**: [ text{Var}(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 ] 2. **Calculate ( E(X^2) )**: [ E(X^2) = int_{0}^{infty} x^2 f_X(x) , dx = int_{0}^{infty} x^2 left( 2x e^{-x^2} right) , dx ] [ E(X^2) = 2 int_{0}^{infty} x^3 e^{-x^2} , dx ] 3. **Simplify by using the substitution ( u=x^2 )**: [ int_{0}^{infty} x^3 e^{-x^2} , dx = frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{infty} u e^{-u} , du ] The integral is now in the form of the Gamma function ( Gamma(2) = 1! = 1 ): [ 2 times frac{1}{2} times 1 = 1 ] 4. **Find ( E(X)^2 )**: [ [E(X)]^2 = left( frac{sqrt{pi}}{2} right)^2 = frac{pi}{4} ] 5. **Calculate variance**: [ text{Var}(X) = 1 - frac{pi}{4} ] Thus: [ text{Var}(X) = 1 - frac{pi}{4}, quad text{Var}(Y) = 1 - frac{pi}{4} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{E(X) = frac{sqrt{pi}}{2}, E(Y) = frac{sqrt{pi}}{2}, text{Var}(X) = 1 - frac{pi}{4}, text{Var}(Y) = 1 - frac{pi}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"Consider the cubic equation x^3 + 3x^2 4x 12 = 0.

Upon further simplification, we can write the derivative as: f'(x) = - frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{4x^2} = - frac{(x-1)(x-3)}{4x^2}. By analyzing the roots of the quadratic in the numerator, we find that f(x) is an increasing function for 1 < x < 3 and decreasing for x > 3 or 0 < x < 1. Since we're interested in the interval (0,2), we must evaluate the function at the boundary where it switches from decreasing to increasing to find the minimum value, which occurs at x=1: f_{text{min}}(x) = f(1) = -frac{1}{4} + frac{3}{4} - 1 = -frac{1}{2}. Now, consider the behavior of g(x) = x^2 - 2bx + 4. We observe that g(x) can be rewritten as: g(x) = (x-b)^2 + 4 - b^2, which is a parabola with the axis of symmetry at x=b. Analyzing g(x) within the interval [1,2] leads to three different scenarios for its minimum value based on the value of b: 1. If b leqslant 1, g(x) achieves its minimum at x=1: g_{text{min}}(x) = g(1) = 5 - 2b. 2. If 1 < b < 2, g(x) achieves its minimum at x=b: g_{text{min}}(x) = g(b) = 4 - b^2. 3. If b geqslant 2, g(x) is decreasing on [1,2], and its minimum occurs at x=2: g_{text{min}}(x) = g(2) = 8 - 4b. According to the problem statement, for the inequality f(x_1) geqslant g(x_2) to hold for any x_1 in (0,2) and some x_2 in [1,2], the minimum of f(x) must be greater than or equal to the minimum of g(x). Applying this to the different scenarios for g(x): - When b leqslant 1, -frac{1}{2} geqslant 5 - 2b, which yields b geqslant frac{11}{4}; but since b must be less than or equal to 1, there is no solution in this case. - When 1 < b < 2, -frac{1}{2} geqslant 4 - b^2 implies that b must be greater than or equal to frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} or less than or equal to -frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}. However, since b is between 1 and 2, there is no solution in this range. - When b geqslant 2, -frac{1}{2} geqslant 8 - 4b leads to b geqslant frac{17}{8}. Taking all cases into account, we find that the possible range for b is: b geqslant frac{17}{8}. Therefore, the range of the real number b is boxed{left[ frac{17}{8}, +infty right)}."},{"prompt":"A driver travels for 3 hours at 50 miles per hour. Her car gets 25 miles per gallon of gasoline.

Therefore, the annual interest for the 5-year period is: Annual interest = Interest from 2nd to 7th year / Number of years Annual interest = 300 / 5 Annual interest = 60 This annual interest is also the interest earned in the first 2 years because the interest is the same every year (simple interest).

This construction implies that ABEC is a parallelogram because AD = DE and AB = EC. 3. **Properties of Parallelogram**: In parallelogram ABEC, we have AB = EC and BC parallel EF.

To find the fraction of his allowance that he spent at the arcade, we divide the amount spent at the arcade by his total allowance: Fraction spent at the arcade = 2.07 / 3.45 To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.

By this symmetry, the sequences that begin with an ( A ) or ( B ) and later have empathy have a one-to-one correspondence. 5. The probability that a sequence begins with a ( B ) (i.e., the proportion of such sequences out of all possible sequences) is: [ frac{q}{p+q} ] 6.

In this case, we need to show that f(x) can be expressed as a polynomial in terms of g(x). [ f(x) - f(y) = a(x, y) ( g(x) - g(y) ) ] Since deg f < deg g, the polynomial f(x) - f(y), which is a polynomial in x, will have a smaller degree than g(x) - g(y), another polynomial in x which is a factor. Thus, the only way this can be true is if f(x) - f(y) = 0 for all x, y. This implies that f(x) is constant. Therefore: [ f(x) = text{constant} ] We can then take h(x) to be the same constant.

The annual cost of the membership is 60 / 2 = 30. Total annual cost for brake pad replacements = 80 + 30 = 110 Now, let's add up all the annual expenses: - Oil changes: 135 - Tire rotations: 72 - Brake pad replacements: 110 Total annual car maintenance expenses = 135 + 72 + 110 = 317 Therefore, John's total annual car maintenance expenses for oil changes, tire rotations, and brake pad replacements are boxed{317} ."},{"prompt":"Among the following expressions, which one is calculated correctly?

The roots of the equation ax^{2}+bx+c=0 are x=-3 and x=2. Since the inequality is greater than zero between these two roots, it implies that the parabola opens downwards, which means a<0. 2. From the roots, we can use Vieta's formulas. The sum of the roots (-3) + 2 = -1 = -frac{b}{a}, and the product of the roots (-3) times 2 = -6 = frac{c}{a}. Solving these equations gives us b = a and c = -6a. 3. Substituting b = a and c = -6a into a+b+c, we get a + a - 6a = -4a. Since we know a < 0, it follows that -4a > 0. Therefore, a+b+c > 0. 4. For option C, substituting b = a and c = -6a into the inequality bx+c > 0 gives ax - 6a > 0. Dividing by a (remembering a < 0 reverses the inequality sign) gives x - 6 < 0, which simplifies to x < 6.

To prove: Since {a_n} satisfies a_1=frac{1}{2} and a_{n-1}+1=2a_n for n geq 2, we derive that 2(a_n-1)=a_{n-1}-1 for n geq 2. Thus, for n geq 2, we have frac{a_n-1}{a_{n-1}-1}=frac{1}{2}. This relationship indicates that {a_n-1} is a geometric sequence with common ratio frac{1}{2}. Considering that a_1-1 = -frac{1}{2}, we can express a_n-1 as a_n-1 = -frac{1}{2} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n-1}. Therefore, a_n = 1 - left(frac{1}{2}right)^n.

To solve: Given that {b_n} satisfies 2b_1+2^2b_2+dots+2^nb_n = n cdot 2^n, consider the sequence when shortened by one term. We then have 2b_1+2^2b_2+dots+2^{n-1}b_{n-1} = (n-1) cdot 2^{n-1} for n geq 2.

The equality holds if and only if a = c. Hence, the perimeter L of triangle ABC is: [ L = a + b + c geq 2sqrt{ac} + b = 4 + b ] The equality holds if and only if a = c.

From S_{n+1} = S_{n} + a_{n} + 1, we subtract S_{n} from both sides to get S_{n+1} - S_{n} = a_{n} + 1. 2.

Each pair of students who know each other adds an edge between their respective vertices. We are given: - There are 16 new students. - Each student knows exactly 3 other students. 2. **Analysis of the Relationship Graph**: Because each student knows exactly 3 other students, this graph is a 3-regular graph on 16 vertices, where each vertex has exactly 3 edges connected to it. 3. **Grouping Requirement**: We need to pair up the 16 students such that every pair consists of students who know each other.

This implies ( A ) must know three vertices.

Considering these conditions, a simple linear function that meets these criteria can be written as y = mx + b, where m is negative (to ensure the function is decreasing) and b is positive (to ensure that when x is negative, y is positive, allowing the graph to pass through the second quadrant). One of the simplest choices for such a function is y = -x + 1. Here, m = -1 (which ensures the function is decreasing) and b = 1 (which ensures the graph will pass through the second quadrant for negative values of x). Therefore, a function expression that satisfies the given conditions is boxed{y = -x + 1}. Note that this answer is not unique, as any function with a negative slope and a positive y-intercept will satisfy the given conditions."},{"prompt":"Let x, y, and z be positive real numbers such that x + 2y + 3z = 6.

Let left( u_n right) be a non-zero geometric sequence with ratio q, belonging to tilde{mathrm{A}} E, with u_0 = 1. 2. Hence, we can write: [ forall n in mathbb{N}, u_n = q^n ] 3. Since left( u_n right) belongs to tilde{mathrm{A}} E, the sequence must satisfy the recurrence relation: [ u_{n+2} = u_{n+1} + u_n ] 4. Substituting u_n = q^n, the recurrence relation becomes: [ q^{n+2} = q^{n+1} + q^n ] 5. Simplifying and dividing both sides by q^n (noting that q neq 0), we get: [ q^2 = q + 1 ] 6. This can be rearranged into the characteristic equation: [ q^2 - q - 1 = 0 ] 7. Solving the quadratic equation, we find the roots: [ q = frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ] 8. Thus, the sequence can be either: [ a_n = left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right)^n quad text{or} quad b_n = left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right)^n ] 9. Both of these sequences belong to tilde{mathrm{A}} E by definition. Part 2 1. First, we prove that the sequences left( a_n right) and left( b_n right) are linearly independent. Consider: [ forall n in mathbb{N}, lambda a_n + mu b_n = 0 quad text{for} quad lambda, mu in mathbb{R} ] 2.

Thus, [ begin{cases} lambda + mu = 0 lambda left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right) + mu left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right) = 0 end{cases} ] 3. Solving the first equation gives: [ mu = -lambda ] 4. Substituting mu into the second equation: [ lambda left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right) - lambda left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right) = 0 ] 5. Simplifying, we get: [ lambda left( frac{1 + sqrt{5} - (1 - sqrt{5})}{2} right) = 0 quad Rightarrow quad lambda sqrt{5} = 0 ] 6. Thus, lambda = 0 and hence mu = 0, showing that left( a_n right) and left( b_n right) are linearly independent. 7. Next, we show that left( a_n right) and left( b_n right) span E. Let left( u_n right) be an arbitrary sequence in tilde{mathrm{A}} E. We seek lambda, mu in mathbb{R} such that: [ u_n = lambda a_n + mu b_n ] 8. By setting n = 0 and n = 1, we obtain the system: [ begin{cases} u_0 = lambda a_0 + mu b_0 u_1 = lambda a_1 + mu b_1 end{cases} ] which is: [ begin{cases} u_0 = lambda + mu u_1 = lambda left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right) + mu left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right) end{cases} ] 9. Solving this system for lambda and mu to express u_n in terms of a_n and b_n confirms that any sequence in E can be written in this form. 10.

Therefore, AC = DE and CD = AE. 4. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem**: In right triangle ABE, where AB = 50 inches (distance between the centers) and BE = 9 - 7 = 2 inches (difference of the radii), [ AE = CD = sqrt{AB^2 - BE^2} = sqrt{50^2 - 2^2} = sqrt{2500 - 4} = sqrt{2496}. ] 5. **Conclusion**: The exact value of the square root might be simplified or approximated for practical purposes, but the calculation gives AE = CD = sqrt{2496} inches, which is approximately sqrt{2496} approx 49.96 inches.

When both pipes are opened together, their combined rate is: (1/12) + (1/15) = (5/60) + (4/60) = 9/60 = 3/20 of the cistern per minute. In the first 2 minutes, with both pipes open, the fraction of the cistern filled is: 2 * (3/20) = 6/20 = 3/10 of the cistern.

This implies that omega, which determines the period of the sine function, must satisfy frac{2pi}{omega} = pi. Therefore, solving for omega gives us [ frac{2pi}{omega} = pi implies omega = 2. ] Given that x = frac{2pi}{3} is the point where f(x) attains its minimum value, we can use the sine function's property that its minimum value occurs at theta = 2kpi + frac{3pi}{2}, for k in mathbb{Z}.

The height (h) of the equilateral triangle can be computed as: [ h = sqrt{s^2 - left(frac{s}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{s^2 - frac{s^2}{4}} = sqrt{frac{3s^2}{4}} = frac{sqrt{3}s}{2} ] Using similar triangles, the side length a of the inscribed square relates to the height by: [ a = frac{ssqrt{3}}{6} ] Thus, the area A_1 of this inscribed square is: [ A_1 = a^2 = left(frac{ssqrt{3}}{6}right)^2 = frac{3s^2}{36} = frac{s^2}{12} ] **For the square inside another square:** Let b = s.

Prove that line PQ bisects the segment joining the midpoints of sides CB and AB. 1. **Setup Homothety Transformation:** Consider a homothety with center B and ratio 2. Under this homothety, points are transformed as follows: - The center O of the circumcircle of triangle ABC is mapped to point D, which is diametrically opposite to vertex B on the circumcircle Omega. - Point P, where the perpendicular from O to the internal bisector of angle B meets, is mapped to point R, the intersection of the bisector of angle B with Omega. - Point Q, where the perpendicular from O to the external bisector of angle B meets, is mapped to point S, which is diametrically opposite to R. 2. **Observe the Geometry:** Notice that after the homothety, segment PQ transforms to the diameter RS of the circumcircle Omega. 3. **Analysis of the Segment:** The segment in question connects the midpoints of sides CB and AB, namely points M and N, respectively. Under the homothety, M and N remain on their respective sides (though their specific positions are scaled). 4. **Application of Circle Properties:** - The diameter RS passes through the midpoint of the arc AC that does not contain B. Let's denote this midpoint as K. - Since R and S are endpoints of the diameter, K is the midpoint of the diameter RS. 5. **Conclusion:** - By properties of circles and homothety, line RS (the image of PQ) bisects line segment MN.

Prove:<br/> (1) f'(x) has a unique maximum point in the interval (1, frac{pi}{2});<br/> (2) f(x) has exactly two zeros.","completion":"**Proof:** **(1)** Let's start by finding the derivative of f(x), which is given by f'(x) = cos x - frac{1}{x+1}. We define g(x) = f'(x) for simplicity, so g(x) = cos x - frac{1}{x+1}. To analyze the behavior of g(x), we find its derivative, g'(x) = -sin x + frac{1}{(x+1)^{2}}. Now, we need to check the behavior of g'(x) over the interval (-1, frac{pi}{2}): - **Monotonicity of g'(x)**: Since -sin x is decreasing in (-1, frac{pi}{2}) and frac{1}{(x+1)^{2}} is always positive and decreasing, g'(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval. - **Sign of g'(x) at specific points**: We find that g'(0) = -sin(0) + frac{1}{(0+1)^{2}} = 1 > 0 and g'(frac{pi}{2}) = -sin(frac{pi}{2}) + frac{1}{(frac{pi}{2}+1)^{2}} < 0. Given that g'(x) changes sign from positive to negative, it implies there is a unique alpha in (-1, frac{pi}{2}) where g'(x) crosses zero. Therefore, g(x) is monotonically increasing before alpha and monotonically decreasing after alpha, indicating a unique maximum point of g(x), and hence f'(x), in the interval (-1, frac{pi}{2}). **(2)** For the zeros of f(x): - **Interval (-1, 0]:** Since f'(x) is monotonically increasing in (-1, 0) and f'(0) = 0, it implies f'(x) < 0 for x in (-1, 0). Thus, f(x) is monotonically decreasing in (-1, 0). Given f(0) = 0, x=0 is the only zero in (-1, 0]. - **Interval (0, frac{pi}{2}]:** From the analysis in part (1), f'(x) changes its behavior at alpha, being positive before alpha and negative after, up to frac{pi}{2}. However, since f(0) = 0 and f(frac{pi}{2}) = 1 - ln(1 + frac{pi}{2}) > 0, f(x) does not cross zero in (0, frac{pi}{2}]. - **Interval ({frac{pi}{2}, pi}]:** Given f(frac{pi}{2}) > 0 and f(pi) < 0, with f'(x) < 0 indicating f(x) is monotonically decreasing, there must be a unique zero in ({frac{pi}{2}, pi}]. - **Interval (pi, +infty):** Since ln(x+1) > 1 for x > pi, it follows that f(x) < 0 in this interval, indicating no zeros.

The total cost W can be calculated as: [ W = 80a + 30(200 - a) = 80a + 6000 - 30a = 50a + 6000 ] Since the coefficient of a in the expression for W is positive (50 > 0), the total cost W increases as the value of a increases. Given that a geqslant 80, to minimize W, we should choose the smallest possible value for a, which is 80. Substituting a = 80 into the expression for W gives: [ W = 50 times 80 + 6000 = 4000 + 6000 = 10000 ] Thus, the most cost-effective purchasing plan is to buy 80 basketballs and 120 badminton rackets, resulting in a minimum total cost of boxed{10000} yuan."},{"prompt":"There is a line that passes through point P (0, 5) and has equal intercepts on both the xaxis and yaxis.

Since P_3 and P_4 are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, they both lie on the ellipse C. Considering the nature of an ellipse, it is symmetric about both axes, so if P_3 and P_4 lie on C, then one of the points P_1 or P_2 also lies on C. Given the coordinates, P_2 does not fit the symmetry requirement for points on an ellipse centered at the origin, so it is not on C. Thus, P_1, P_3, and P_4 lie on C. - For P_1(0,sqrt{2}) to be on C, b=sqrt{2}. - For P_3(sqrt{2},1) and the equation frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, substituting P_3's coordinates gives frac{2}{a^2}+frac{1}{2}=1. Solving for a^2 from the equation frac{2}{a^2}+frac{1}{2}=1: [ begin{align*} frac{2}{a^2}+frac{1}{2} &= 1 frac{2}{a^2} &= frac{1}{2} frac{1}{a^2} &= frac{1}{4} a^2 &= 4 end{align*} ] So, a=2 and b=sqrt{2}.

Calculating overrightarrow{OA}cdotoverrightarrow{OB}: [ overrightarrow{OA}cdotoverrightarrow{OB} = left(frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}right)^2 - left(frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}right)^2 = 0 ] Therefore, OAbot OB for this case. The same applies when l: x=-frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}. - **When the slope of tangent line l exists (l: y=kx+m):** Given l is tangent to the circle x^2+y^2=frac{4}{3}, and the distance from the origin to l is frac{|m|}{sqrt{k^2+1}}=frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}, leading to the equation 3m^2=4(k^2+1).

Given the condition in the problem, the expression for f(f(y_{0})) is not easy to derive, and it is difficult to directly find the maximum or minimum value. By examining the four options, 1 appears in the ranges of options B and D, and e+2 appears in the ranges of options A and B. Therefore, we can determine the correct option by verifying whether the parameters 1 and e+2 meet the requirements of the problem. **Solution** Given that there exists a point (x_{0},y_{0}) on the curve y=cos x, we have y_{0}in[-1,1]. Examining the four options, both options B and D allow the parameter value to be 1, and both options A and B allow the parameter to be e+2. Thus, we can first verify whether the parameters 1 and e+2 meet the requirements of the problem to determine the correct option. When a=1, f(x)= sqrt{e^{x}+x}, f(x) is increasing, and its value is always non-negative. Therefore, we only need to study when y_{0}in[0,1] whether f(f(y_{0}))=y_{0} holds. Since f(x)= sqrt{e^{x}+x} is an increasing function, we can conclude that f(y_{0})geqslant f(0)=1, thus f(f(y_{0}))geqslant f(1), and f(1)= sqrt{e+1} > 1, thus f(f(y_{0})) > 1.

Let g(x)=e^{x}+x-e-1, g(x) is monotonically increasing, and since g(1)=0, it follows that for g(x)geqslant 0, we must have xgeqslant 1, thus, for f(y_{0}) to be meaningful, g(y_{0})geqslant 0, implying y_{0}geqslant 1, thus y_{0}=1, f(f(y_{0}))=f(f(1))=f(0) is still meaningless, and even less likely to be equal to y_{0}=1. Therefore, a=e+2 does not meet the requirements of the problem, indicating that options A and B are incorrect.

We aim to arrange the blue beads such that every possible sequence of four beads includes exactly 2 blue beads and 2 other beads (one red and one green). 3. **Maximum participation of blue beads:** Each blue bead can appear in at most four sequences of good foursomes. This is because each blue bead contributes to four different pairs involving adjacent beads: - ( (i-1, i, i+1, i+2) ) - ( (i, i+1, i+2, i+3) ) (considering positions). However, the first and the last blue bead in the sequence will be part of fewer sequences if taken cyclically. 4. **Counting sequences:** Thus if we have 50 blue beads and each can maximally contribute to 4 different sequences, we have: [ 50 times 4 = 200 text{ sequences}. ] However, we need to ensure that each of these sequences is accounted only twice (as every sequence of four is counted from two distinct blue beads): [ frac{200}{2} = 100 text{ sequences}. ] 5. **Considering cyclic nature:** As the necklace is cyclic, every \\"first\\" and \\"last\\" bead is considered an overlap making the count valid for 99 distinct positions. 6. **Building sequence examples for maximal good foursomes:** [ underbrace{KZSS, KZSS, ldots, KZSS}_{25 text{ cycles and remaining sequence involves KZ}} ] Here 'K' denotes a red bead, 'Z' denotes a green bead, and 'S' denotes a blue bead.

We provide an example of a strategy that ensures the fox will catch the mole in a sufficient number of attempts, specifically in at most 200 attempts. 1. **Initial Conditions**: Suppose at the initial moment, the mole starts at a heap with an odd number (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ..., 99). 2. **Strategy for Odd-numbered Heaps**: Initially, the fox approaches heap 1 twice: - **First Attempt at Heap 1**: If the mole is at heap 1, the fox catches the mole. - **If the mole isn't at heap 1**: The mole moves to one of its neighboring heaps (heap 2 or heap 3). - **Second Attempt at Heap 1**: If the mole returns to heap 1, the fox catches the mole. If the mole does not return to heap 1 after the second attempt, it must be at one of the heaps with odd numbers greater than or equal to 3. 3. **Move to Heap 3**: Similar to above, the fox now attempts heap 3 twice: - **First Attempt at Heap 3**: If the mole is at heap 3, the fox catches the mole. - **If the mole isn't at heap 3**: The mole moves to one of its neighboring heaps. - **Second Attempt at Heap 3**: If the mole returns to heap 3, the fox catches the mole. If the mole does not return to heap 3 after the second attempt, it must be at an odd-numbered heap greater than or equal to 5. 4. **Continue the Process**: The fox continues this strategy, approaching odd-numbered heaps in increasing order (5, 7, 9, ..., 99). For each heap, the fox makes 2 attempts. By the time the fox reaches heap 99, if the mole started at an odd-numbered heap, the fox will have guaranteed to catch the mole. At this point, the fox has made 100 attempts. 5. **Transitioning to Even-numbered Heaps**: If after 100 attempts (all odd-numbered heaps), the mole is not caught, it implies the mole started at an even-numbered heap since the mole stays on heaps of the same parity throughout the observation. The fox now changes its strategy to target even-numbered heaps (2, 4, 6, ..., 100): - The procedure is identical to the odd-numbered heap strategy, with the fox making two attempts per even-numbered heap in increasing order. - This strategy ensures catching the mole within another 100 attempts. # Conclusion: Thus, by making sequential pairs of attempts at odd-numbered heaps first, then at even-numbered heaps, the fox will guarantee to catch the mole within at most 200 attempts. This ensures that the mole will be caught regardless of its initial position. Therefore, the fox can catch the mole with a guaranteed strategy within 200 attempts.

For ( m geq 3 ), there are ( m(m-1) ) possible pairs ((i, j)) with ( i neq j ). 4. **Analyze ( A cap B ):** The intersection ( A cap B ) consists of elements that are both in ( A ) and ( B ). Since ( A ) is a strictly increasing arithmetic sequence, and ( B ) consists of sums of the form ( a_i + 2a_j ), it is unlikely that many elements of ( A ) will be in ( B ). 5. **Calculate ( |A triangle B| ):** The symmetric difference ( A triangle B ) is given by: [ |A triangle B| = |A| + |B| - 2|A cap B| ] For ( m = 2 ): - ( A = {a_1, a_2} ) - ( B = {a_1 + 2a_2, a_2 + 2a_1} ) - Since ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are distinct, ( A cap B = emptyset ) - Thus, ( |A triangle B| = 2 + 2 - 0 = 4 ) For ( m geq 3 ): - ( |A| = m ) - ( |B| geq 3m - 2 ) (as shown in the solution) - ( |A cap B| ) is minimal, so we approximate it as 0 for the lower bound - Thus, ( |A triangle B| geq m + (3m - 2) - 2 cdot 0 = 4m - 2 ) 6. **Conclusion:** The minimum number of elements of ( A triangle B ) is: [ boxed{2m - 2 text{ for } m geq 3} ] For ( m = 2 ), the minimum number is ( 0 )."},{"prompt":"Determine integers a and b such that x^2 x 1 is a factor of ax^{18} + bx^{17} + 1.","completion":"Using the same reasoning as in the original problem, the roots s and t of x^2-x-1 should satisfy [ ax^{18} + bx^{17} + 1 = 0 ] for both s and t.

The sidelength of the inner octagon is 8 units since each side consists of the diameters of two neighboring small circles. 1. **Inner Octagon Side Length**: Each side of the inner octagon is the sum of the diameters of two small circles, hence 2 times 4 + 2 times 4 = 8 units. 2. **Calculating the Radius of Inner Octagon**: - Consider the center of the inner octagon to be the origin, and let one of the vertices be (r,0) where r is the unknown radius of the inner octagon. - The next vertex, due to the symmetry and regularity of the octagon, can be calculated using the angle frac{360^circ}{8} = 45^circ. Using rotation matrix, the coordinates of the next vertex would be r(cos 45^circ, sin 45^circ). - The distance between these vertices is the side length, so using the distance formula: [ sqrt{(rcos 45^circ - r)^2 + (rsin 45^circ)^2} = 8 ] Simplifying, we find r approx 5.656 (exact calculations would involve trigonometric simplifications). 3. **Calculating the Radius of the Large Circle**: The radius of the large circle is r + 4 = 5.656 + 4 = 9.656 units.

The circle x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 can be rewritten as (x-3)^2 + y^2 = 4, with the center at (3,0) and radius 2. The distance from the center of the circle to the asymptote is d = dfrac{|3b|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}, By the chord length formula, we have 2 = 2sqrt{4 - dfrac{9b^2}{a^2 + b^2}}, Simplifying gives a^2 = 2b^2, Thus, we have c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = dfrac{3}{2}a^2, Therefore, e = dfrac{c}{a} = dfrac{sqrt{6}}{2}.

The goal is to determine if the first player can always win given optimal play and the movement rules provided. 1. **Coordinate System**: - First, we can assign coordinates to the columns and rows of the chessboard. In this problem, each square will have coordinates (x, y) where x ranges from 1 to 8 representing the columns \`a\` to \`h\` and y ranges from 1 to 8 representing the rows. - So, a1 is assigned to (1, 1) and h8 to (8, 8). 2. **Winning and Losing Positions**: - The key idea is to categorize each position as either winning or losing. - A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win regardless of the opponent's response. - A losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position. 3. **King's Moves**: - The King can move right, up, or diagonally right-up. Consequently, from any position (x, y), the King can move to: - (x+1, y) (right) - (x, y+1) (up) - (x+1, y+1) (diagonally right-up) 4. **Position Evaluation**: - Let's observe what happens if the King stands at a position with **even coordinates**.

Let ( angle P_kOP_{k+1} = 2alpha_k ) for ( k in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ). 2. **Angles and distances:** Since the points lie on the circle, the angles ( alpha_k ) satisfy: [ alpha_k ge 0 quad text{and} quad sum_{k=1}^5 alpha_k = pi ] The distances between consecutive points are: [ P_kP_{k+1} = 2 sin alpha_k ] The distances between points with one point in between are: [ P_kP_{k+2} = 2 sin (alpha_k + alpha_{k+1}) ] where ( alpha_6 = alpha_1 ). 3. **Sum of distances:** There are exactly ( binom{5}{2} = 10 ) segments ( p_i p_j ) for ( 1 le i < j le 5 ). These include the 5 sides ( P_kP_{k+1} ) and the 5 diagonals ( P_kP_{k+2} ).

From this, we get (x^{2}-12x+16=0). Therefore, (x_{1}x_{2}=16) and (x_{1}+x_{2}=12). Thus, (y_{1}y_{2}=(x_{1}-4)(x_{2}-4)=x_{1}x_{2}-4(x_{1}+x_{2})+16=-16).

We need to find the values of (n) for which there are exactly two distinct prime factors. 2. **Formulating the Problem**: - The modified number can be written as (1200text{ followed by } (10n+2)text{ fives}). - In base-6, this can be represented as: [ x = (1200 underbrace{55ldots5}_{10n+2}) ] Here, each digit (5) in base-6 translates to (5) in decimal when multiplied by the corresponding power of (6). 3. **Conversion to Decimal**: - Note that: [ 1200text{ in base-6} = 1 cdot 6^3 + 2 cdot 6^2 + 0 cdot 6^1 + 0 cdot 6^0 = 216 + 72 = 288 ] - For (10n+2) trailing fives in base-6: [ 55ldots5 text{ ( }10n+2 text{ fives) equates to: } 5 left(6^0 + 6^1 + ldots + 6^{10n+1}right) ] - Recognize the geometric series summing to: [ 5 left(frac{6^{10n+2} - 1}{5}right) = 6^{10n+2} - 1 ] Hence, combining both terms: [ x = 288 cdot 6^{10n+2} + (6^{10n+2} - 1) = (288 + 0.111ldots)6^{10n+2} - 1 ] 4. **Factorization Approach**: - Considering how (288 + 111ldots ) affects the conversion to decimal, simplify it to a recognizable factorized form: [ x = (289 - 1)(6^{10n+2}) - 1 = 289 cdot 6^{10n+2} - 1 ] 5. **Breaking Into Prime Factors**: - If (n = 0): [ x = 289 cdot 6^0 - 1 = 289 - 1 = 288 ] - Verify the factorization of (288): (288 = 2^5 cdot 3^2). Precisely two distinct prime factors: (2) and (3). - If (n geq 1): - Use modular arithmetic and properties of prime numbers: [ 102 mod 101 = 1 quad text{and} quad 7776^n mod 101 = (77 cdot 101 - 1)^n mod 101 = (-1)^n ] Putting values: - For even (n): - Contradiction occurs as: [ a = 101^p - 1 quad text{involves a power incompatible with } 7776^n mod 4 ] - For odd (n): - Similarly: [ b = 101^q - 1 quad text{of same issue in factorizing and involving } 102 ] 6. **Conclusion**: - The only valid (n) which fits all criteria and provides exactly two distinct prime factors is: [ boxed{n=0} ]"},{"prompt":"Given f(x) = e^x 2, then f'(0) = （ ） A: 1 B: 1 C: 0 D: 2","completion":"Since f(x) = e^x - 2, then f'(x) = e^x, thus f'(0) = e^0 = 1, therefore, the correct choice is: boxed{B}.

So, Zendaya's time to complete the marathon is Casey's time + 2 hours = 6 hours + 2 hours = 8 hours. Now, to find the average time they both take to complete the race, we add their times together and divide by 2 (since there are two people).

The secant line determines pairs of antigomological points A_{1}, B_{2} and A_{2}, B_{1}. 4. Let us draw another secant line (in the figure, it is the line through centers O_{1} and O_{2}) and take another pair of antigomological points N_{1} and M_{2} on it. 5. We need to prove that the circle passing through points A_{2}, B_{1}, N_{1} will also pass through point M_{2}. 6. Since ( (M_{1}A_{1}) parallel (M_{2}A_{2}) ), it follows that ( M_{1}widehat{A_{1}}B_{1} + B_{1} widehat{A_{2}} M_{2} = pi ). 7. On the other hand, due to the properties of an inscribed quadrilateral, we have ( M_{1} widehat{A}_{1} B_{1} + M_{1} widehat{N}_{1} B_{1} = pi ). 8. Therefore, ( B_{1} widehat{A}_{2} M_{2} = M_{1} widehat{N_{1}} B_{1} ), and hence, we can inscribe the quadrilateral B_{1} N_{1} M_{2} A_{2} in a circle. 9. Consequently, the circle passing through points A_{2}, B_{1}, N_{1} will also pass through point M_{2}. 10. This proves the assertion (a). **Part (b)**: 1.

Let's denote the angles of the triangle (O_{1} O_{2} O) by alpha, beta, and gamma. 3. As such, we get: [ N_{1} widehat{T}_{1} T_{2} = pi - frac{pi - alpha}{2} - frac{pi - gamma}{2} = frac{alpha + gamma}{2} ] 4. Similarly, [ T_{2} widehat{M}_{2} O_{2} = frac{pi - beta}{2} = frac{alpha + gamma}{2} ] 5. Therefore, ( T_{2} widehat{M}_{2} O_{2} = N_{1} widehat{T}_{1} T_{2} ). 6. Consequently, quadrilateral (T_{1} T_{2} M_{2} N_{1}) is cyclic, and a secant line ST_{1} intersects the circle centered at O_{2} at point (T_{2}), which is the same point of tangency as the circle passing through points (T_{1}, N_{1}, M_{2}). 7.

For every real number 0 le c le 1 , Prove that insect can jump that after some jumps , it has a distance less than frac {1}{1402} from point c . *Proposed by Navid Safaei*","completion":"To prove that the insect can get within a distance less than frac{1}{1402} from any point c in [0,1] after some jumps, we will use the properties of the transformations given and the fact that s is between frac{1}{2} and 1. 1. **Symmetry and Transformation**: The problem is symmetric with respect to the points 0 and 1. The insect can jump from a point a to either a times s or (a-1) times s + 1. These transformations can be seen as homotheties (scalings) with centers at 0 and 1 respectively. 2. **Homothety with Center at 0**: If the insect is at point a and jumps to a times s, the distance to 0 is scaled by s. Since s < 1, the insect can get arbitrarily close to 0 by repeatedly applying this transformation. 3. **Homothety with Center at 1**: If the insect is at point a and jumps to (a-1) times s + 1, the distance to 1 is scaled by s. Similarly, since s < 1, the insect can get arbitrarily close to 1 by repeatedly applying this transformation. 4. **Interval Transformation**: Consider an interval I in [0,1]. We want to show that the insect can get into any interval I after some jumps. We will use the inverse transformations to show that the interval I can be transformed to contain either 0 or 1. 5. **Inverse Transformation**: - If I cap [0, frac{1}{2}] neq varnothing, apply the inverse homothety with center 0 and ratio frac{1}{s}. This transforms I to a new interval I'. - Otherwise, apply the inverse homothety with center 1 and ratio frac{1}{s}. This transforms I to a new interval I'. 6. **Successive Application**: By successively applying these inverse transformations, we can ensure that the interval I will eventually contain either 0 or 1. Since s < 1, the length of the interval I is multiplied by frac{1}{s} > 1 in each step, ensuring that I grows and eventually covers either 0 or 1. 7. **Conclusion**: Since the interval I can be transformed to contain either 0 or 1, and the insect can get arbitrarily close to 0 or 1, it follows that the insect can get within any desired distance from any point c in [0,1]. Therefore, the insect can get within a distance less than frac{1}{1402} from any point c in [0,1] after some jumps. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"it possible to write 100 odd numbers on a line such that the sum of any 5 consecutive numbers is a square number and the sum of any 9 consecutive numbers is also a square number?","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to determine if it is possible to write 100 odd numbers on a line such that the sum of any 5 consecutive numbers is a square number and the sum of any 9 consecutive numbers is also a square number. 2. **Modulo 8 analysis**: - Any odd number can be written in the form ( n = 2p + 1 ). - The square of any odd number ( n ) modulo 8 is ( n^2 equiv 1 pmod{8} ). This is because: [ n^2 = (2p+1)^2 = 4p^2 + 4p + 1 = 4p(p+1) + 1 ] Since ( p(p+1) ) is always even, ( 4p(p+1) ) is divisible by 8, hence: [ n^2 equiv 1 pmod{8} ] 3. **Sum of 5 consecutive numbers**: - Let ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 ) be 5 consecutive odd numbers. - The sum ( S_5 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 ) must be a square number. - Since each ( a_i equiv 1 pmod{8} ), we have: [ S_5 equiv 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 pmod{8} ] For ( S_5 ) to be a square number modulo 8, it must be congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 8.

The pump can fill the tank in 2 hours, so its rate is: P = 1 tank / 2 hours = 1/2 tank per hour When the leak is present, it takes 2 1/6 hours to fill the tank. This is 13/6 hours. During this time, both the pump and the leak are working together (the pump fills while the leak drains), so we can write the combined rate as: P - L = 1 tank / (13/6 hours) = 6/13 tank per hour We already know the rate of the pump (P), so we can substitute that into the equation to find the rate of the leak (L): 1/2 - L = 6/13 Now, let's solve for L: L = 1/2 - 6/13 L = 13/26 - 12/26 L = 1/26 tank per hour This means the leak drains 1/26 of the tank per hour. To find out how long it would take the leak to drain the entire tank, we take the reciprocal of the leak's rate: Time to drain = 1 / (1/26) = 26 hours So, the leak can drain all the water of the tank in boxed{26} hours."},{"prompt":"f x * y = xy 2(x + y) for all integers x and y, then x * (3) = 1.

For CC to divide BA, we need 11c to divide 10b + a. Since 11c is a multiple of 11, 10b + a must also be a multiple of 11. This implies that 10b + a equiv 0 pmod{11}. 5. **Check the divisibility of BA by 11:** Since 10b + a equiv 0 pmod{11}, BA must be a multiple of 11. Therefore, BA can be written as 11k for some integer k. 6. **Check the divisibility of CC by BA:** Since CC = 11c and BA = 11k, for 11c to divide 11k, c must divide k.

We need to paint the points such that if a point ( A(x_0, y_0, z_0) ) is painted, then no point ( B(x_1, y_1, z_1) ) with ( x_1 leq x_0 ), ( y_1 leq y_0 ), and ( z_1 leq z_0 ) can be painted. The goal is to find the maximum number of points that can be painted under this condition. 2. **Reformulation in Terms of Antichains**: The problem can be reformulated as finding the largest antichain in the set ( S = {0, 1, ldots, n-1}^3 ) with the product order. An antichain is a set of elements in a partially ordered set such that no two elements are comparable. 3. **Application of de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk Theorem**: According to the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem, the largest antichain in the poset ( S ) is given by the set of triplets ((x, y, z)) such that ( x + y + z = leftlfloor frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrfloor ) or ( x + y + z = leftlceil frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrceil ). 4. **Calculation of the Size of the Antichain**: We need to show that the cardinality of any of these antichains is ( leftlfloor frac{3n^2 + 1}{4} rightrfloor ). - Consider the equation ( x + y + z = k ) where ( k = leftlfloor frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrfloor ) or ( k = leftlceil frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrceil ). - The number of solutions to ( x + y + z = k ) with ( 0 leq x, y, z leq n-1 ) can be found using the stars and bars method, but constrained to the given bounds. 5. **Verification of the Cardinality**: - For ( k = leftlfloor frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrfloor ), the number of valid triplets ((x, y, z)) is given by the number of integer solutions to ( x + y + z = k ) within the bounds ( 0 leq x, y, z leq n-1 ). - Similarly, for ( k = leftlceil frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrceil ), the number of valid triplets is calculated in the same manner. 6. **Conclusion**: By the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem and the calculation of the number of valid triplets, the size of the largest antichain is indeed ( leftlfloor frac{3n^2 + 1}{4} rightrfloor ). The final answer is ( boxed{leftlfloor frac{3n^2 + 1}{4} rightrfloor} )."},{"prompt":"The sum of two numbers is 62, and one of them is 12 more than the other.

Prove that m coins can combine to make k rubles.","completion":"1. Let's start by interpreting the information provided and setting up our notations. Suppose we have k coins that sum up to m kopecks. The possible denominations of coins are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 kopecks, and 1 ruble (which equals 100 kopecks). 2. Let's denote the number of coins of each denomination as follows: - a_1: number of 1 kopeck coins, - a_2: number of 2 kopeck coins, - a_3: number of 5 kopeck coins, - a_4: number of 10 kopeck coins, - a_5: number of 20 kopeck coins, - a_6: number of 50 kopeck coins, - a_7: number of 1 ruble coins (which we treat as 100 kopecks). 3. According to the problem, these coins sum up to m kopecks, so we have the equation: [ a_1 + 2a_2 + 5a_3 + 10a_4 + 20a_5 + 50a_6 + 100a_7 = m. ] 4. Also, the total number of coins is k: [ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = k. ] 5. To show that m coins can amount to k rubles, we will manipulate the second equation. Let's multiply it by 100 to convert the number of coins into kopecks: [ 100(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7) = 100k. ] 6. Expanding and matching terms based on original coin denominations, we get: [ 100a_1 + 100a_2 + 100a_3 + 100a_4 + 100a_5 + 100a_6 + 100a_7 = 100k. ] 7. Now, we recognize direct transformations using the original denominations: [ 100a_1 + 100(2 cdot a_2) + 100(5 cdot a_3) + 100(10 cdot a_4) + 100(20 cdot a_5) + 100(50 cdot a_6) + 100(100 cdot a_7) = 100k, ] which simplifies to: [ 100a_1 + 2 cdot 100a_2 + 5 cdot 100a_3 + 10 cdot 100a_4 + 20 cdot 100a_5 + 50 cdot 100a_6 + 100a_7 = 100m. ] 8. It follows that taking the amounts in terms of kopecks and scaling each appropriately mirrors the sums: - 100a_1 coins of 1 kopeck, - 50a_6 coins of 2 kopecks, - 20a_5 coins of 5 kopecks, - 10a_4 coins of 10 kopecks, - 5a_3 coins of 20 kopecks, - 2a_2 coins of 50 kopecks, and - a_1 coins of 1 ruble. 9. Since 100k kopecks is equivalent to k rubles, taking such coin combinations equaling 100m kopecks inherently represents: [ a_1 + 2a_2 + 5a_3 + 10a_4 + 20a_5 + 50a_6 + 100a_7 = 100m = k text{ rubles}. ] 10.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as: [ sum_{v in V} deg(v) = 2E ] where (V) and (E) are the sets of vertices and edges, respectively. 3. **Inequality for vertices' degrees:** Since we assumed that every vertex has a degree greater than 5: [ sum_{v in V} deg(v) > 5V ] Combining these two statements, we get: [ 2E > 5V ] Which simplifies to: [ E > frac{5}{2} V ] 4. **Use of Euler's Formula:** For a connected planar graph, Euler's formula states: [ V - E + F = 2 ] Where (F) is the number of faces. 5. **Relate faces to edges using the fact that each face is bounded by at least 3 edges (in planar graphs each edge is shared by two faces):** [ 3F leq 2E ] Simplifying, we obtain: [ F leq frac{2}{3}E ] 6. **Substitute (F) in Euler's formula to eliminate (F):** Using (F leq frac{2}{3}E) in Euler's formula: [ V - E + frac{2}{3}E geq 2 ] Simplify, [ V - frac{1}{3}E geq 2 ] Which rearranges to: [ E leq 3V - 6 ] 7. **Combine the two inequalities derived for edges:** From step 3, we have: [ E > frac{5}{2} V ] From step 6, we have: [ E leq 3V - 6 ] 8. **Find a contradiction:** Let us compare these inequalities: [ frac{5}{2} V < E leq 3V - 6 ] Thus, [ frac{5}{2} V < 3V - 6 ] Simplify the inequality: [ frac{5}{2}V < 3V - 6 ] [ 0 < frac{1}{2}V - 6 ] [ 6 < frac{1}{2}V ] [ V > 12 ] But this would need to hold for any number of vertices (V). 9. **Conclusion:** Hence, our initial assumption that every vertex in a planar graph has a degree greater than 5 leads to a contradiction.

Prove that pq+r=1 (Euler's formula).","completion":"The problem at hand involves a polygon that is divided into several smaller polygons in such a way that the vertices of the resulting polygons do not lie on the sides of the original polygon or on the sides of the resulting polygons. We aim to prove Euler's formula for this configuration: p - q + r = 1, where p is the number of resulting polygons, q is the number of segments that form the sides of these polygons, and r is the number of vertices. Let's break down the proof in detail: 1. **Define Variables:** Let ( n ) be the number of vertices of the original polygon. Let ( n_1, n_2, ..., n_p ) represent the number of vertices of each resulting polygon after the division. 2. **Sum of Angles Approach:** The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with ( n_i ) vertices is: [ (n_i - 2)pi ] Therefore, the sum of the interior angles of all resulting polygons is: [ sum_{i=1}^{p} (n_i - 2)pi = sum_{i=1}^{p} n_i pi - 2p pi ] 3. **Alternate Angle Calculation:** Consider the angles formed among these polygons including the external angles formed due to the divisions: The total angle sum can also be expressed by considering the relationships between the vertices and the original polygon. Specifically, each internal angle of the polygon relates to the number of sides and vertices as follows: The total sum of the angles formed in the new configuration can be written as: [ 2 pi (r - n) + (n - 2)pi ] Combining, we have: [ 2 pi r - 2 pi n + n pi - 2 pi ] 4. **Sum of Vertices in Resulting Polygons:** Next, we relate the number of vertices in the resulting polygons to the original polygon. Each internal point can be counted twice, so we conclude: [ sum_{i=1}^{p} n_i = 2(q - n) + n ] 5. **Final Simplification:** Substitute the sum of the vertices back into our angle equation: [ sum_{i=1}^{p} n_i pi - 2p pi = 2 pi r - 2 pi n + (n - 2)pi ] Simplify this: [ left(2(q - n) + nright) pi - 2p pi = 2 pi r - 2 pi n + n pi - 2 pi ] We can factor out the pi terms and cancel terms to confirm the identity. 6. **Euler’s Relation:** Finally, ensuring the terms correctly simplify, we reach the form of Euler’s characteristic relation: [ p - q + r = 1 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{p - q + r = 1} ]"},{"prompt":"The Martians have altered their system of angular measurement such that a full circle is now divided into 600 clerts.

The center of ( omega ) lies on line ( BC ). 2. **Reflection and Center of Circle:** - Let ( A' ) be the reflection of ( A ) across line ( BC ). - Since ( omega ) is tangent to ( CD ) and passes through ( A ), it must also pass through ( A' ). 3. **Power of a Point Theorem Application:** - By the Power of a Point theorem, applied to point ( P = AB cap CD ), we have: [ PT^2 = PA cdot PA' ] 4. **Solving for ( PA ):** - Note that segment ( PA ) and segment ( PA' ) correspond to similar triangles. - By the properties of similar triangles and given lengths: [ frac{PA}{AD} = frac{PB}{BC} implies frac{PA}{2} = frac{PA + 3}{8} ] Solving for ( PA ): [ 8PA = 2(PA + 3) quad Rightarrow quad 8PA = 2PA + 6 quad Rightarrow quad 6PA = 6 quad Rightarrow quad PA = 1 ] 5. **Calculating Length ( PA' ):** - Since ( A' ) is the reflection of ( A ) across ( BC ), we have: [ A'P = PA + 2 cdot AB = 1 + 2 cdot 3 = 1 + 6 = 7 ] 6. **Power of a Point Calculation:** - Using the Power of a Point theorem: [ PT^2 = PA cdot PA' = 1 cdot 7 = 7 quad Rightarrow quad PT = sqrt{7} ] 7. **Distance ( PC ) Calculation:** - Using the Pythagorean theorem to find ( PC ): [ PB = AB = 3,quad PC^2 = PB^2 + BC^2 = 3^2 + 8^2 = 9 + 64 = 73 quad Rightarrow quad PC = sqrt{73} = 4 sqrt{5} ] 8. **Finding ( CT ):** - Since point ( T ) lies between ( C ) and ( P ), we can subtract the distance ( PT ) from ( PC ) to find ( CT ): [ CT = PC - PT = 4 sqrt{5} - sqrt{7} ] # Conclusion: Thus, the length ( CT ) is: [ boxed{4 sqrt{5} - sqrt{7}} ]"},{"prompt":"The range of the function f(x) = log_2(3x + 1) is ( ).

First, we need to find the domain of the function. The argument of the logarithm function must be positive, so we have: 3x + 1 > 0 x > -frac{1}{3} Hence, the domain of f(x) is (-frac{1}{3}, +infty). 2. Since the function 3x + 1 is continuous and strictly increasing for x > -frac{1}{3}, and since it covers all values from slightly above 0 to +infty as x varies over its domain, the composition with the logarithm function, which is also continuous and strictly increasing, will cover all values from just above 0 to +infty as well. 3. The logarithmic function log_2(3x + 1) approaches negative infinity as the argument 3x + 1 approaches 0 from the right side, and it approaches positive infinity as x approaches positive infinity. 4. When x=-frac{1}{3}, the argument of the logarithmic function becomes 0, but since x=-frac{1}{3} is not included in the domain, the corresponding value of the logarithm is not included in the range. Therefore, the function never actually takes the value log_2(0), which would be undefined. 5. The function will take the value of 0 when its argument equals 1. To find out when this occurs, we can set the argument to 1 and solve for x: 3x + 1 = 1 x = 0 Since 0 is in the domain of the function, the function can take the value of 0. From these observations, we can conclude that the function f(x) = log_2(3x + 1) approaches but never reaches the value of log_2(0), and it does take the value of log_2(1) = 0. Consequently, the range of the function is (0, +infty). Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A: (0, +infty)}."},{"prompt":"Tom has only been getting 6 hours of sleep a day.

This must hold for all successive numbers. - The values suitable for (g) (based on the equation (ac - b^2 equiv 0 pmod{7})) can only be 3 or 5 as they maintain the divisibility criteria within modulo 7 cycles. 4. **First Term is Arbitrary**: - The first number in the sequence can be any of the six numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). - For the first number chosen, the rest of the sequence can follow by multiplying through by either 3 or 5 modulo 7. 5. **Calculating Total Arrangements**: - Since we have six choices for the first number and two viable multipliers (3 or 5): [ text{Total arrangements} = 6 text{ (choices for first number)} times 2 text{ (multipliers: 3 or 5)} = 12 ] 6. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, there are a total of 12 ways to arrange the numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) such that for any three consecutive numbers (a, b, c) in the sequence, (ac - b^2) is divisible by 7.

Thus, if (a_1) is the first term and (r) is the common ratio, we have: [ a_2 = a_1 cdot r, quad a_3 = a_1 cdot r^2, quad a_4 = a_1 cdot r^3, quad d_1 = a_1 cdot r^4, quad d_2 = a_1 cdot r^5 ] 3. **Triangle Inequality Conditions:** For a quadrilateral to exist, the sum of any three side lengths must be greater than the fourth side.

Notably, these can hold for (r = varphi) (the golden ratio), where (varphi = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}), because of its unique nature in conditions involving squares and sums. 7. **Conclusion:** It's feasible for four sides and two diagonals of a quadrilateral to be in geometric progression, especially if the sequences exploit harmonic properties such as the golden ratio.

These points are where the crucial construction begins, ensuring that all points are within the plane. 2. **Forming the Set**: - Form the set ( S ) by including the ( 2^m ) points of the form ( {pm a_1, pm a_2, ldots, pm a_m} ), where each choice of the sign leads to a distinct point. 3. **Unit Distances**: - For any point ( A in S ), we need to show that there are exactly ( m ) points at unit distance from ( A ).

We use induction on the common difference h of the arithmetic progression. 1. **Base Case:** If ( h = 1 ), then the arithmetic progression is simply the sequence of all positive integers, ( (n)_{n=1}^{infty} ), and it trivially contains every integer power, including sixth powers. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for any arithmetic progression whose common difference is less than h. Consider an arithmetic progression with first term a and common difference h such that both p^2 and q^3 are terms in this progression. 3. **GCD and Setup:** Let ( d = gcd(a, h) ) and write ( h = de ). Suppose that an integer n satisfies ( n equiv a pmod{h} ) and ( n geq a ). Then n is a term in the progression. Thus, it suffices to find an integer z such that ( z^6 equiv a pmod{h} ). From the properties of arithmetic progressions, this would imply ( (z + kh)^6 equiv a pmod{h} ) for any positive integer k. We can always choose a large k such that ( (z + kh)^6 geq a ). 4. **Case 1: ( gcd(d, e) = 1 )** We have p^2 equiv a equiv q^3 pmod{h}, hence also modulo e.

Assume alpha is the greatest power of p dividing a, and beta is the greatest power of p dividing h. Since h = de and e is coprime to a, we observe that beta > alpha geq 1, noting that for each term of the progression, the largest power of p dividing it is p^alpha. Given that p^2 and q^3 are in the progression, alpha must be divisible by both 2 and 3. Therefore, alpha = 6gamma for some integer gamma, implying alpha geq 6. Construct the new progression [ left(p^{-6}(a + ih): i = 1, 2, ldotsright) ] with a common difference ( h / p^6 < h ). This progression contains the terms ( left(p^{-3}pright)^2 = (p^{-3}q)^2 ) and ( left(p^{-2}qright)^3 ). By the induction hypothesis, this new progression contains a term z^6 for some integer z.

The range of the real number a is (__). A: 1 leq a leq 0 B: 1 < a < 0 C: 1 leq a < 0 D: 1 < a leq 0","completion":"First, we can factor the quadratic inequality as follows: ax^2 + 2ax - (a+2) = a(x^2+2x) - (a+2) Since a(x^2+2x) = a(x+x^2), the expression is a quadratic parabola that opens upwards if a > 0 and downwards if a < 0. For the inequality ax^2 + 2ax - (a+2) < 0 to always be true for any x, we need the parabola to be below the x-axis for all x values. This situation can only occur if the parabola opens downwards (i.e., a < 0) and has no real roots, since any real roots would mean the parabola touches or crosses the x-axis. For no real roots, the discriminant of the quadratic must be less than zero. The discriminant (Delta) of x^2+2x is given by: Delta = b^2 - 4ac Substituting a=1 (since the coefficient of x^2 is 1), b=2, and c=0 into the discriminant formula, we get: Delta = 2^2 - 4(1)(0) = 4 The discriminant is positive, which indicates two real roots when a > 0. However, when a < 0, we examine the constant term: -(a+2). For this to always be negative, regardless of the value of x, a cannot be -2 because that would make the constant term zero, resulting in equality. Therefore, a must be less than zero, but it cannot be less than or equal to -2. This results in the range -2 < a < 0. Notably, the option that most closely matches this is: D: -1 < a leq 0 To demonstrate this, we show that when a=-1, the inequality becomes: -x^2 - 2x + 1 < 0 Which can be recognized as the factored form of: -(x+1)^2 < 0 No real number x will satisfy this inequality, as the square of x+1 is always non-negative.
