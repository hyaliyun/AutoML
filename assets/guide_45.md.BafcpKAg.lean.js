Week 1 Title: Course introduction, Introduction to academic research and papers as a graduate student Content: This lecture is the first lecture as thesis writing and research ethics I will introduce the overall lecture and tell you what research and thesis writing means as a graduate student, and what mindset and attitude are desirable. First of all, I would like to introduce the overall lecture 'How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics.' This course is designed to help you prepare and write academic papers efficiently and confidently as a researcher in graduate school. To this end, this lecture covers efficient research, academic paper writing, basic concepts, writing procedures and strategies and various useful information and knowledge that can be carried out without violating research ethics. If you look at the topics of this semester, we're going to talk about various academic journals and databases, the structure of academic papers how to write academic papers, grammar and word choices, and punctuation and finally research ethics and plagiarism. Through this course, you will learn basic content and useful knowledge to prepare and write academic papers efficiently and confidently and you will be able to write your own academic papers efficiently You will also understand research ethics that are essential in the process of research and writing academic papers. In particular, the importance of research ethics and plagiarism has recently emerged and you may have heard news about research irregularities or plagiarism of research papers and works. Research ethics and plagiarism are very important for researchers who constantly conduct research and write numerous works such as papers. Therefore, I hope that this course will help you understand these research ethics issues and be careful and careful in your graduate life and paper writing. Now let's take a look at the composition and schedule of this course. The first lecture, today, is an introduction to the lecture and some tips on how to spend your graduate life to become a good researcher. Second, the next lecture will explain efficient procedures for writing good academic papers especially strategies for planning, organizing preparing, drafting, and making corrections effectively. As a researcher, you're going to write a lot of academic papers, reports, patent documents, and so on throughout your life. Therefore, it will be very beneficial for you to learn efficient processes and strategies for writing documents. The third lecture describes academic papers in the field of science and technology and discusses the selection of targeted journals subject to papers written in their respective fields. In the fourth lecture, we learn about the structure of academic papers, how to tell stories, and how to prepare for academic papers. Lectures from fifth to eighth cover the writing of academic papers in detail. In other words, in the fifth lecture we learn about writing titles, abstracts, and introductions and in the sixth lecture, we learn how to write the subject materials and methods of writing, and how to write the theoretical background. In the next seventh lecture, we will talk about results, discussions, and conclusions and in the eighth lecture, we will talk about writing tables and pictures that are as important as sentences in writing science and technology papers. As the saying goes ‘A picture is worth a thousand words’, the role of photography, illustration, graphs and tables is crucial in the creation of science and technology documents that deal with the delivery of facts, explain and understand certain arguments and guide behavior, making the entire document interesting and not boring. Usually, academic papers are written and reviewed by experts in the field to decide whether to publish them or not. The ninth lecture explains the process of submitting a written paper and being reviewed. Lecture from 10 to 12 cover the additional points needed to write a more complete, interesting, and sophisticated paper In the tenth lecture, we talk about grammar and in the eleventh lecture, we talk about choice of words and punctuation. and in the 12th lecture, you learn about writing styles and paragraphs and writing sentences. In the 13th lecture, you will learn general matters about research ethics and plagiarism which are very important topics in the process of research and paper writing and in the 14th lecture, you will be exposed to considerations when writing a paper through types of plagiarism. Now, to become a great researcher, I'm going to give you some advice on how to do graduate life and research. These are important contents that will help you start your graduate life so please listen carefully and refer to them. First, let's look at the science and engineering that we study and research. According to Wikipedia, science is \\"a system that builds and organizes knowledge about the world we live in in in the form of testable explanations and predictions.\\" Also, according to the American Institute of Engineering, engineering is defined as \\"a system of mathematical and natural science expertise obtained through research, experience, and practice for the purpose of economically utilizing natural materials and power for the benefit of mankind.\\" In particular, in the case of engineering, please pay attention to using for economical application for the benefit of mankind. Therefore, a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and aerospace engineer widely known in aerodynamics Theodore von Karman, left the famous saying, \\"Scientists explain and describe what it is and engineers create something that has never existed before.\\" In this way, analyzing and explaining a phenomenon, object, theory, or explanation that exists, and creating a new object or theory is now the main activity that you're given, research. Throughout your graduate school years, you will learn about these studies and grow up as researchers So, what kind of person is a researcher? As defined by the OECD, \\"A researcher is a person who conducts 'research' a creative work systematically performed to develop knowledge of humans, cultures and societies and to devise new applications, 'research' refers to the activity of confirming facts and previous results solving new or existing problems, or developing a theory.\\" In summary, research is aimed at identifying facts, solving problems, or developing theories and is a systematic and creative activity for this purpose. You're taking the first step in this kind of research. Throughout your graduate school years you will learn about these studies and grow up as researchers. Then, how should you do research in graduate school to become a good researcher? I would like to give you some advice for your successful graduate life so please listen carefully and be familiar with it. First of all, your life as a researcher has already begun today or the moment you decide to go to graduate school. I recommend that you take a postgraduate attitude not just as a student, but as a researcher. If you want to distinguish between your undergraduate life and your graduate life I can tell you that in graduate school, you can learn about research in order to grow as a researcher from the beginning. Next, your tutor is a very important person as your teacher, instructor, colleague, and senior in life. Therefore, meet with your tutor as often as possible and try to understand and learn what kind of person your tutor is and the philosophy you have about education and research. Finally, most professors like enthusiastic, self-directed students. Instead of asking the question like \\"What should I do next?\\" to professor I want you to explain your ideas, plans, designs, or solutions first, and ask, \\"What do you think, professor?\\" Don't forget that no other student is more lovely to professors than students who are trying to think and find answers for themselves. Also, as I said, don't forget that students who don't do anything and spend time without contemplating may look a little frustrated to the professor until they get an answer after saying, \\"What should I do next?\\" I would like to introduce 6 suggestions for research in graduate school to become a good researcher. First, start your research and paper writing as soon as possible, right now. Rather than thinking, 'I'm still not good enough, and I haven't learned enough yet, so I'm not ready to write a paper yet,' it's important to organize what you know now and what you're thinking so far in the form of a dissertation. Second, find and choose a good research question. In fact, one of the most important parts of research and dissertation is research questions and subjects. The selection of research questions for research is very important. Choose important issues in each area, but look for new issues everywhere. In addition, it is necessary to continuously investigate and identify current problems and popular topics in each field so please pay attention to the review paper in the research field. The review paper is a dissertation that contains predictions and suggestions on which direction scholars in each field should conduct research in the future after comprehensively analyzing the latest trends or theories in the field. The review paper organizes various theories and existing research cases in each field by subject so it greatly helps to understand and view the field. Therefore, if you decide on a specific topic or research problem I recommend that you first find and read the review paper for the research topic especially the most recent review paper, if possible. In the review paper, you can view not only recent trends, but history of the past what kind of problems were found and solved in the past what aspects were studied by researchers what the limitations were, and how another researchers made effort to overcome this so how far did the results go In a word, the review paper allows us to look at the progress of research on the subject and research problem until now. At the end of the review paper, the researcher suggests like \\"This is the situation that has been progressed so far so which direction is promising and which direction of research is needed.\\" Those suggestions and arrangements can help you understand your research topic and help you to make decisions about where you'd like your ideas to go in the future. So, I recommend you to find and read the review paper for the relevant field first. The third is a guideline for efficient research. Usually, when we do research, we focus on what the answer is to this problem or to this topic. In fact, before we think about the solution we need to focus on what kind of problem this is what the nature of this problem is why it's difficult and what aspects to look at it. Start your research with \\"Issues, problems\\" instead of \\"Answer, solution.\\" So I encourage you to take enough time to investigate and think about the research topics or research issues that you're interested in first. Also, make sure you have plenty of free time regularly to focus and be creative. For example, go to the lab early in the morning and set a time to focus on your research without interruption from 8 to 10 and practice this. When you start graduate school life, it depends on the lab situation but in most cases, there's a lot going on in the lab. And because there's a lot of research and meetings in the lab with seniors, juniors, and professors you may not have as much time as you think to contemplate what this problem is or focus on what research at your desk. And there may not be as much time as you think to focus on research alone. So, when you go to the lab for the first time and then come out an hour earlier. If the lab usually has meetings or seminars starting at 9 or 10, it'll be 8 or 9 o'clock. You can come out about an hour ago and do your own homework or assignments about what you learn in class or you can use it as a time to reflect on and contemplate the research problem or progress that you're interested in. One more thing, especially in science and engineering For example, if you say,\\"I'm going to have an hour of my time at the lab at 8 o'clock,\\" you should talk to your colleagues or seniors in the lab and get their understanding in advance. Because you work with your colleagues together. For example, \\"I want to have time to concentrate on studying from 8 to 9 tomorrow so please don't interrupt me from 8 to 9.\\" In this way, it would be good to have time to focus on the area of interest by yourself. There's a reason why I keep saying, \\"From 8am or 9am.\\" Of course, you could schedule some time in the evening. For example, if your work ends at 5 or 6 pm, you could say, 'I'll have dinner after work and then I'll have my own time from 7 or 8 pm.' By the way, if you actually do graduate school, there are a lot of things like seminars and meetings at the lab after dinner. Because when you run out of time while working during the day, naturally say \\"Let's do the rest of the work after dinner. Let's do the rest of the work tonight.\\" So if possible, I think it would be good to have personal time in the morning. Of course, you can make a personal schedule late at night, but you need to rest at night. So I recommend that morning is better if possible. And when you do your research, consider when to explore deeper, where to expand wider and what to do separately. You have to focus by properly deciding on various perspectives, scope, and methods of looking at the problem, and in this process you can discuss it with your advisor, senior and research colleagues. Also, when you study a review paper or something about specific area, there is always a 'current state'. You can find a new solution, especially through some challenging questions about the assumptions they have today. For example, suppose an existing paper or solution solves a problem on the assumption that some input is the same. You can think 'Do the inputs have to be the same? What happens when the inputs are different?' Then, you can see why they had to solve the problem through that assumption and if they did without that assumption, what kind of things would happen and what issues would you be able to find and study more. Therefore, if possible, once you've mastered the previously established assumption like 'this problem is up to here from now on' you'll be able to come up with new research and solutions through the process of solving those assumptions and challenging them beyond the assumptions. In addition, some research problems may be simple but complex problems are common in most cases. So, to make it easier to deal with such problems, it would be better to divide the problems into several appropriate parts and solve them. Of course, when you divide one problem into several you can discuss and consult with your professor, colleagues, and seniors to properly share the problem and take charge of the assigned problem. It's also very important to demonstrate your ideas or solutions to other researchers. So it's important to think about how you're going to present your research process or results to others at the same time as you do your research. Also, set your own short-term and long-term research goals to conduct research and actively communicate with other researchers. There's a saying, \\"If you want to be an engineer, cooperate with others.\\" Communicate your research problems, approaches, difficult parts to solve, current results, and future plans with your assistant professor, your colleagues in the lab, and other researchers in the field and think of writing research papers as part of your communication. Don't forget that mutual cooperation among researchers is the basic principle that has been the driving force behind the development of sci-tech. If you think about your research paper as part of your communication it's also very important to be able to explain to others as easily as possible what approach you've applied and what you've achieved rather than explaining the problem with difficulty. In this respect, the fourth advice is to actively publish your research through papers. Always think about which research to publish to which journal. When publishing a paper, make sure that the co-author decides as broad and generous as possible if the person has any contribution, but instead carefully decides the order of the authors. I hope that as many people as possible can cooperate in writing your paper. When writing a paper, make it well organized and readable and interesting , be careful not to use your own terminology, or go against standard notation which is used only in your lab or organization. I also recommend you to include, organize and present enough existing research related to your research explain to your readers the importance of your research topic and the validity of your research methods and publish it in various ways. For example, in addition to publishing papers in academic journals, I hope you will actively publish your research in various forms, such as publishing papers at domestic and foreign academic conferences contributing articles, or writing patent documents. The fifth is about consistency in research. Your field of research has been decided to some extent when you enter graduate school and come to the lab and as you continue to study, you will gradually enter into specific details. Continue to explore, develop and expand your field of study and key research issues. Please study positively, especially in controversial areas. Because controversial areas and issues can be an opportunity for you to make a great achievement in other respects. The last sixth is to cooperate with others. Be good colleagues first and make good colleagues around you. Encourage your colleagues to publish research papers, and if possible, create and operate a cooperative system and a buddy system to efficiently write papers. In particular, a buddy system with lab colleagues who look at each other's papers in the calibration or review of written papers is very effective. In addition, if there is any achievement such as approval for publication of the paper or award celebrate with your colleagues and reward yourself generously. In addition, I hope you will continue to create and maintain an atmosphere and environment around you that supports and helps you with research and paper writing. To maintain this atmosphere and environment, we recommend that you discuss the issues with your colleagues and your advisor, and if necessary, make suggestions to create a comfortable lab environment where you can conduct your research well. Next, I would like to introduce the guidelines for writing academic papers effectively. When writing a paper, do not rush into writing immediately but first think and plan about the subject, scope, and structure of the article plan and organize based on it. Based on this, I hope that you will first create an 'outline' When writing, avoid boring structures, try to explain and express as concisely and clearly as possible and if the reader has been decided, write the paper in a style that the target readers are familiar with and like. You also need to try your best to avoid slang, buzzwords, repeated or euphemistic expressions, spelling and grammar errors. At the end of this lecture, I would like to introduce eight tips for writing and publishing a good paper. First, if you want to write a good paper, read a lot of papers, and if possible, a lot of good papers. In order to expand to a wider range, it is recommended to read papers widely not only in research fields but also in areas other than research fields. Also, be as objective as possible about your research or paper. It is necessary to objectively examine one's research problems, research methods, and results and to view and modify the written paper with the eyes of a third party. Next, you should use good English when writing an English paper and I recommend you to get professional English correction if possible. The fourth is a bit sad, but researchers need to learn to live with \\"rejection.\\" Entire career as a researcher is actually with rejection. However, instead of thinking that the paper is over due to refusal to publish think that you have received good advice from the judges and improve your research and paper. Then you can get good results. Therefore, rejection of sanctions is a painful experience but I hope you think and accept it as a routine process that goes through for good results. In addition, many people often \\"let's write a paper\\" after the study but you should keep in mind how to organize and write a paper not just before the study is over, but throughout the course of the study. In other words, don't forget that if necessary, the process or scope of the study should be determined by considering the writing of the paper. If you want to write a good paper, be a judge yourself. Getting used to how to critically evaluate a study or paper helps you evaluate your research or paper. Also, make sure you decide which journal to submit your paper to as early as possible. By default, look at the goals and scope on the home page of each journal. This allows you to determine what you need to publish your paper in the journal and to shape your research and determine what you need and what results you need. Lastly, if it is a good paper, the quality of the paper is the most important. Try to publish your paper in a good journal as much as possible and continue to challenge yourself to publish your paper in a better journal. This concludes the first lecture on \\"How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics.\\" In this lecture, I introduced the overall lecture and explained what research and paper writing means as a graduate student and what mindset and posture are needed. Thank you for your attention. Week 2 Title: Effective process for writing good academic papers Content: Today is the second lecture on \\"How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics\\" We will learn about effective procedures and processes for writing a good academic paper. I'm going to talk about some excerpts from Susan Stephenson and Steve Whitmore \\"Strategy for Engineering Communication\\", 2002 \\"Science and Technology Communication\\", 2009 which I published with my university professors. If you are more interested in today's lecture, please refer to the two books. So let's talk about effective methods and procedures for writing a good academic paper. In general, academic writing proceeds in stages of \\"planning\\" \\"implementation and preparation\\", \\"drafting\\", and \\"calibration and final editing\\". In the \\"Planning\\" stage, you schedule your thesis define and analyze readers, and set the purpose of your thesis. In fact, I can tell you that one of the most important parts in determining the purpose of the thesis is to define and analyze my purpose, that is, who the reader is to read the paper I write. The \\"Implementation and Preparation\\" step involves devising ideas and preparing for the writing of a paper. In the \\"first draft writing\\" stage, it is necessary to efficiently write the first draft and cope with the obstacles to writing. The \\"Calibration and Final Editing\\" step carefully corrects the draft and checks for grammatical errors and typos. At this stage, an effective response to \\"boring\\" and \\"perfectionism\\" is needed. I will explain in detail later how to deal with the obstacles in writing as well as the boredom and perfectionism that I just mentioned. Academic paper writing is an iterative and recursive process in which three steps continue to be performed interchangeably rather than \\"implementation and preparation\\", \\"drafting\\", and \\"calibration\\" all at once. The table below shows interesting findings. The unskilled author says he spends about 50% of his entire paper writing time \\"implementing and preparing\\" and 45% of the rest \\"drafting\\" and only about 5% of his time during the final \\"calibration\\" phase. There is a high risk that the overall completeness of the paper will not be high because only a small amount of time is devoted to the \\"calibration\\" stage of increasing the completeness of the paper through final finishing. If you look at this part, if you have 10 days to write a paper you think about how to write a paper for about 5 days and spend the remaining 4 and a half days writing and then you have only half a day. It means the first draft was made in the part where you just finished the paper for half a day and submitted. And there are many cases where it is submitted without sufficient review or revision. When you actually write it like this, it's just as time-consuming as you can imagine. 50% of the time without writing, but as the deadline is near, they write a draft and even write proofreading and submit it. As a result, not only is the overall writing process inefficient but the end result is not refined to such a high level. It's a general story. On the other hand, experienced authors spend about 25% of their total paper writing time on \\"implementation and preparation\\" 35% on \\"drafting\\" stage, and the remaining 40% on the final \\"calibration\\" stage. Because sufficient time is spent on calibration and finishing the final completion of the paper can be improved. Spending only 25% of the time on the \\"Imagine and Prepare\\" stage also means that you are constantly devising ideas for your thesis. So, in a way, researchers who are good at writing papers keep thinking 'what to do with the thesis' and 'how to write the thesis in which journal when the results come out' even in the process of continuing research in their heads. When he thinks 'Let's write a thesis', he can quickly complete a draft and then spend enough time to revise it meticulously, although he can do it alone but with his colleagues in multiple stages of revision. To exaggerate a little bit, students who write papers uncomfortable and inefficient usually don't think much about papers, but when they say, \\"Let's write a paper now,\\" but only then, they think \\"What paper should I write?\\" so It takes a lot of time to think and prepare and after they write a draft they don't have a few days to refine and revise it. This means that the quality of the thesis is not high. In other words, it is advisable to spend your time writing your paper as quickly as possible in the front and maximizing the completion of your paper in the back. Let's take a closer look at each paper writing step. First stage is \\"planning\\". A successful paper writer initiates a plan as quickly as possible starting as soon as he decides to write the paper dividing it into as many tasks as possible and starting the main tasks for writing the paper before completing the study. As I said, even in the course of his research, for example if he thinks \\"I have to put this graph in this form\\", it means that he'll keep that graph in advance. In addition, for good thesis writing, ask and identify who the \\"reader\\" of the paper and clarify the \\"purpose\\" of the paper to be written. When writing a paper, it is very important to set the \\"reader\\" and \\"purpose\\" of the article. You can more accurately determine the \\"purpose\\" of the paper by identifying who the \\"readers\\" of the paper are their expertise, their understanding of the subject, and their likes in advance. This page shows the questions used for \\"Reader\\" analysis. Who will read your writing? Are they a technical expert, manager, or businessman? And why do they read your papers? Why did they ask you to write a paper? If, when readers see the paper you have written, they will be interested in seeing the title or abstract of the paper, so what part will they be interested in? What actions do they take based on your paper? What information did they ask for? Are their instructions clear? Or do they need confirmation? How well do readers know about the topic? And how much background knowledge and information do they need? Are your readers familiar with the technical terms you use? What information do readers need? Do you have all the information they need to address their needs? If not I would like to emphasize thatwhat should you look for in what form and what contents should be organized and presented , what contents should be put in and what contents should be left out, etc. These things are determined according to what parts the readers will be curious about and need while reading the thesis you wrote. The following shows the questions used in the process of determining the \\"purpose\\" of the paper. What do you want to gain from this paper? Can you clearly and concisely describe the purpose of the paper? How does the goal of the paper relate to readers' expectations? Do readers share your goals? If not, what is the discrepancy? How can you meet both your goals and your readers' expectations? How do you know what your readers know and what they don't know? What attitudes or values should be considered in the paper? Rather than answering each question as a test I think it's good to use it as a guideline for analyzing readers and determining their goals by looking through these questions like a checklist. In addition, it is recommended to prepare and secure a good writing environment at the \\"planning\\" stage. Last lecture, I told you to create a quiet, focused time for yourself in the lab, and the same goes for writing. If you're writing and there's any other disturbance around you it's already difficult to write, so it won't be easy. Create your own writing environment where you can be quiet, uninterrupted, and non-disruptive. At this time, pay attention to the lighting and improve physical comfort. It's a general story, but when it's noisy around you when you're writing, it's hard to concentrate on writing. Because writing itself is not a very pleasant act. For most people, writing is painful, and they don't want to do it. So if you're already doing something that's not pleasant, but you're interrupted you can't see it well, nosiy around you, then it's very difficult to write. So when you write, you need an environment where you can write comfortably without being disturbed. Many researchers I know, including myself, have their own environment. Some people like to go to a coffee shop and sit quietly and write some people like to be quiet in the library's reading room and some people like to do it while listening to music at their desks. This means that you should try to find an environment where you can improve the efficiency of your own comfortable writing, and continue to maintain and organize that environment. It's not the same for everyone, but I want to tell you to find and create your own writing-friendly environment. It is also recommended to improve the usability of the computers and software used in writing the paper. Learn how to use word processors that are often used when writing papers and various software that is used to create pictures and tables. If you need to write a paper in a specific work environment quickly identify the devices or programs in that environment and familiarize yourself with how to use them. The second step in writing a paper for efficient academic writing is \\"implementation and preparation.\\" In the \\"Implementation and Preparation\\" stage, the topics and contents to be covered in the paper are organized and arranged. Outline, Outlining is one of the most common strategies used to organize content during academic writing to show the overall flow. You're looking at Microsoft MS Word's overview feature as an example. Graphics are sometimes used to organize various topics and contents and mind mapping shown on this page is one of the representative methods. Mind mapping is useful for organizing various topics and contents when devising a paper in a way that generates and visually organizes ideas by showing the relationship between ideas as you see. One of the ways to use graphics to organize different topics and content is the Taxonomizing classification method. This method is a strategy that visually organizes and groups various ideas based on common characteristics, as shown in the example. In thesis writing, logical order and pattern are used to organize ideas and content. Common patterns in academic papers include chronology of processes in chronological order of events spatial order of objects in physical relationships 'Comparison/Contrast' that similarities and differences between existing and new designs 'Order of importance' that from important to less important 'Problem solving' that explanation of problem, solutions and recommendations. 'General to specific' that explains the general point and then follows a more detailed explanation or special example. The use of these widely known patterns in organization not only helps readers follow the logical flow as a whole but also helps readers to understand and remember the content for a long time. I think you're most familiar with the order of time and space. In the case of chronology, for example, when explaining the history of usually related research there were studies like this in the 1960s, there were studies like this in the 70s there were studies like this in the 80s. It's very natural to describe it in chronological order like this. Physically, for example, if you often explain a schedule or journey it would be better to explain it from Seoul to Daejeon, Daegu, and Busan based on Korean standards. Rather than explaining Seoul, Busan, Daejeon, Daegu and back and forth, explaining in order that readers are familiar with and know the following in accordance with the logical order and pattern of science and technology. The third step in writing a paper for efficient academic writing is \\"Drafting.\\" In general, there are four ways to \\"Drafting.\\" That is, there is a way to combine planning and preparation drafting, and proofreading and proceeding at the same time. There is a way to separate the conception and preparation, draft preparation, and calibration. And there is a way to plan, prepare, draft together, and then calibrate afterwards. There is a way to plan and prepare first, and then draft and calibrate together. It is known that the shorter the volume of papers the more effective it is to combine conception, preparation, draft, and proofreading and the longer the volume, the more effective it is to separate conception, preparation, draft, and proofreading. In general, 5-15 page paper submitted to an academic conference or journal is most effective in developing, preparing and drafting together, and then calibrating. Now let's compare the pros and cons of each draft method. First, it is a combination of planning and preparation, drafting and proofreading. This method makes it easy to write down points and sentences even if you don’t have clear idea of how to write. Thus you can start writing right away, which is especially advantageous when there is no clear solution to a particular problem. If you typically have a hard time starting out it's a great way to start writing a dissertation because you show a high level of creativity and your writing is relatively free. The following is how to proceed separately by classifying conception and preparation, drafting, and proofreading. In this method, the content, format and organization of the paper are initially carefully planned and then each section is written as quickly as possible. Finally, multiple intensive complete corrections are performed. This method is typically applied to writing long documents such as user manuals or textbooks. The following is a method that is generally known to be most suitable for writing a thesis proceeds with conception and preparation and drafting, followed by proofreading. Remember to leave enough time for proofreading as this method combines conception and preparation with drafting first proceeding with proofreading. Especially with this method, maintaining writing momentum is paramount and once you start writing your first draft you shouldn't stop writing until you've finished your first draft. So, if you run into problems with conception and preparation or drafting don't waste time solving them, just mark them and move on. I can tell you that the important thing in drafting is to complete the draft from start to finish without losing your writing momentum. A draft is just a draft. This is possible because we leave plenty of proofreading time behind so we have plenty of time to take it and revise it to a high level once the draft is complete. This is an effective method for relatively short documents typically between 5 and 15 pages, or for single sections within longer documents. In this method, the act of writing a thesis itself is a clue to new ideas, new approaches to the problem at hand, and new solutions to the problem. In addition, even if the degree of completion is very low you can get some satisfaction because the first draft is completed and you can expand the thesis with more time because you spent less time and effort on writing the first draft. In this method, it is essential to have an undisturbed environment to maintain writing momentum and it is important to have ample creative breaks between conception and preparation and drafting and proofreading. Creative break refers to the time to take a break from the thesis writing work and give your mind and brain a rest. Through creative break, you can be more creative and motivated and also objectively and meticulously carry out proofreading work. After a creative break, even the papers you've been writing look different and come up with new ideas you hadn't thought of before. When you have 10 days, invest about 5 days at first or 5 days and half a day to come up with an idea collect various data, and then concentrate on writing a draft. In the process of writing a draft, if possible do not take a break, and make a finished copy. Once the draft is complete, you must be tired as writing drafts without a break. So you need taking a break for about half a day. When you take a break, you forget about writing drafts and listen to music, watch movies or simply take a break. When you take a break for half a day or a day through these breaks and then look at the draft you wrote next, you're like 'Huh? Why did I write this?' You can see a completely different side of what you do and you can fill in the wrong parts of the parts you wrote previously or the parts you left blank because you didn't come up with an idea when writing the original draft. That will be the positive effect of creative break. A word of caution, in my experience, creative breaks are all good but I don't think they're as effective if you're drinking or doing something that's completely disorienting. I recommend that you take a creative break with the finished draft in your hand or put it on a USB stick in your pocket and have a relaxing time watching a movie or going to a coffee house for a good coffee or food. The last method is to proceed with conception and preparation first and then proceed with drafting and proofreading in parallel. This method works well for longer documents, like 15 to 50 pages or when word choice needs to be very precise such as proposals, patents, or legal documents. Organization is very important in this method, otherwise when you pause in the proofreading process, it will be difficult to recall what needs to come next. Instead, reviewing the first few paragraphs will help you overcome your writing hurdles as the next idea will often come from what you've written up to that point. The key to drafting is to keep the momentum going and not stop writing. The writing barriers that are often encountered when writing a dissertation are related to planning caused by environmental factors, related to the subject, caused by words caused by form, related to readers, and caused by expectations and risks. Overcoming these obstacles through thorough preparation and strategic response is necessary for successful draft writing and efficient paper writing and competent authors are those who know how to deal with these obstacles. The fourth and final stage of the thesis writing for efficient academic thesis writing is “proofreading and final completion”. Proofreading is the most important process to remove errors in research papers increase reliability, and reconsider completeness. Since a meticulous and complete proofreading can take a significant amount of time it is important to allow sufficient time for proofreading during the initial planning phase. Also, it is not an easy task to review and revise your thesis several times from an objective point of view so it is recommended to take a creative break before proofreading. During proofreading, it is important to read the paper objectively and critically. Proofreading is carried out at several levels and aspects including content organization, persuasive emphasis format, rules, paragraph organization, sentence structure and word choice. When looking at a strategy to make calibration effective it is difficult to look at all aspects at once, so it is best to do it in multiple rounds. What I mean is, first of all, take a look at it to see if the flow of the article as a whole is okay. At that time, even if there are errors, they are ignored. The second one meticulously checks if the words are okay and the third one checks the misspellings. In this way, it can be said that the aspect of correcting several times while looking at one aspect as a whole is more effective. Rather than looking at a computer screen and proceeding, there are many cases that proceed with printing on paper. This will be a personal preference. It's fine if you say 'I prefer to do it on a computer screen' but in general if you print it out on paper, you can hold the paper and look at the front and back as well as freely take notes so printing out on paper and proceeding is still generally recommended. Since you are a generation that is especially more digitally familiar, it would be okay to just look at the computer screen and proceed as soon as you feel comfortable. I also sometimes find errors by reading them out loud. Strangely enough, things like typos and errors that were not found with the naked eye make sounds and this is called 'reading correction'. It stands out when read aloud. So you need to try something like this. To review the overall flow of the thesis, it is effective to check the outline of the document and make a list of recurring issues so that the review proceeds without omission. In general, it is recommended that you proofread an academic thesis 4 or 5 times by yourself and 2 or 3 times by a third party, a total of 7 or 8 times. In the case of proofreading by a third party, it is best to find and request a person who will later become a reader of the thesis and it is also recommended to organize and operate a buddy system with your graduate school colleagues to proofread each other's thesis. Graduate laboratory colleagues are not only colleagues in research but can also be helpful buddies in the process of writing a dissertation. In addition, it is a good way to rewrite the introductory part to check whether the thesis was written well as a whole. It can be said that perfectionism and boredom make proofreading for the completion of an academic thesis difficult. First of all, perfectionism helps to write a good thesis, but if it is excessive it makes the proofreading work infinitely longer and reduces the efficiency. To overcome perfectionism, it's a good idea to start by setting clear limits on the time and energy you can devote to proofreading and final editing. In addition, it is better to focus more on high-level proofreading such as the overall flow of the text and balance of chapters and verses, and the correction of missing or unnecessary content rather than low-level editing such as typos and spelling errors. This is because many of the low-level editing tasks are usually solved automatically by the word processor and can be processed mechanically by professional editors at the publishing house once the paper is confirmed for publication. Therefore, what you really need to focus on in proofreading is 'Was this thesis well written?', 'The flow of the composition, whether all the contents are included' 'Is the order okay', 'Is the balance right', etc. In addition, after publishing the paper, it is very helpful for future work to clearly understand the reader's reaction to the paper you wrote and to draw and analyze the difference between what you thought and expected when writing the paper and the actual reaction of the readers. To overcome the excruciating boredom of proofreading, it's a good idea to increase the difficulty of the task at hand by focusing on the more complex parts. In other words, it is not simple editing work to choose the right words but the high-level consideration and effort to think about which words can meet the expectations of the reader makes the proofreading work not boring. Also, list the interesting tasks first and do the more interesting ones later. In addition, it is recommended to clearly admit that proofreading itself is not interesting and to set up a system such as a checklist so that you can pay attention to the proofreading process again when you lose concentration due to boredom. As mentioned above, this time, we studied the effective procedural process for writing a good academic thesis. Thank you for your attention. Week 3 Title: Academic Papers in Science and Engineering, Selecting a Target Journal for Your Academic Manuscript Content: Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from Energy Science Department who is in charge of lecture three to six in Academic Writing and Research Ethics. From lecture three to six that I'm in charge of, I think I'll be talking a little bit more about the writing techniques of the paper. To start with lecture three, Academic Papers are completely different from the textbooks you've studied so far. So you have to think, describe, or write something completely different from the scientific facts and research methods that you usually see in your text books. I'm going to talk a lot about those things. In lecture three, let's have a time to think about which journals you're writing your papers in, and which journals you're researching will be published in, so many people will read them. First of all, let's get started and think about what papers are and what theses are. You usually consider them as academic papers. There are a lot of technical descriptions and reports, but the papers are different from those, and it's the papers that demands scientific technology and we see a lot of it in academia. Let me tell you how to write about such papers in science and engineering and what should we think about. Firstly, not all professors think the same because this course is delivered by many professors. Many professors write different papers, so all professors have different ideas. In other words, professors and students are individual people, so they all have different thoughts. There may be technical aspects in common, but the Academic Paper is a thing to write with many considerations?for example, which readers are going to read it or how readers will think about it?as paper itself is a series of conversations between individuals. Therefore, it has to be completely different from the books and textbooks that you've studied so far. Basically, writing a paper is very difficult. The reason is that you have to think about what kind of readers will read, and when they read it, you have to be able to let them understand exactly what you think based on scientific facts. If you've ever written a paper or have a chance to do so, I'm sure you'll have a very burdensome and painful time as you can see in the cartoon. I'll tell you why you felt like this and why this is more fun than pain. As you can see in the cartoon up there, a student is thinking that she wishes to show her thoughts on the screen right away. So do I. I also have a lot of time to think about how to describe what's important, and how to convey my thoughts when I talk to many readers. During those times, your hands don't go straight to the keyboard. I have to write it, but it's very hard. So I keep thinking - let's write it, how should we write it, write it, I spend a lot of time like this. And then it's painful, usually. Because it's difficult, you can think of it as a natural process, which may not be such a big challenge in reality. Starting today, from lecture three to six, I'm going to tell you why. Another case is the cartoon that you see below, where a professor corrected the paper written by a student. The student saw it and said, \\"You fixed all of this.\\" The professor didn’t fix just a word or a grammar, but he fixed everything instead. He fixed the whole paper. And the professor says that it is easier to write a whole paper than fix or comment just a part. There are very important points in here. In fact, the papers that you write about the research from the beginning?let me rephrase that you read. The research papers that you read are written in one story from beginning to end. But the written story is an individual's idea. In other words, it contains the thoughts you are writing and the thoughts of the co-researchers who worked with you on the paper. As each person’s different ideas becomes one paper, when one person starts writing, the person's thoughts are contained from beginning to end. So there could be some errors that you thought of. If you correct one error, it's much easier to correct the whole paper because it's not just one error, but because you have to express the person's thoughts from beginning to end. In fact, even if I fix 10 to 20 pages of paper that my students bring, when I go through each word and sentence several time, and I think, \\"Why did I fix this?\\" or \\"Why did I say this?\\" So I have another period to fix the whole thing. Then, as shown in the cartoon, a student got the fixed part and wrote it again, and if the student show it to the professor again, he will fix it all over again. And he’ll give it back again. So this cycle lasts forever, to be honest. And before you say okay, even if you say okay, it's hard to submit until the professor or co-researchers says okay. But one of the most important things about the process is how well your thoughts are reflected, and how consistent they are from beginning to end. Through this process of writing dozens or hundreds of papers, you will be improved. That might happen, but at first, writing a paper after just reading it will be quite difficult. So I'd like to talk about those things together and tell you that it's not just that difficult. As I said in the introduction at the beginning, writing a paper is communication with many people; for example, how readers will read this, or even before them, we communicate with many researchers and editors of the paper. In the way of communication, as there are many ways of communicating between people, even if you are alone, other people have their own thoughts, so there are always different reactions. I'll tell you a few of the reactions, and let you know that you don't have to struggle with them. For this example, I wrote a paper and submitted. Fortunately, I passed the editor?I'll tell you later about the process of submitting the paper and how the paper is made?and went into the review process. This is the content of referee in review process. This paper reports this, this, and this on a subject. And there’s interesting results. Those results are first, second; the editor summarized like this. Making summary like this perhaps this referee read the paper really hard. Or the referee might just read the abstract that you wrote and organize it like that. I mean, you don't have to believe everything that referee has written down. Because from the perspective of those who have been researching or writing for a long time, those two, three or four points that you think are important can be picked up very easily just by reading the abstract. So the referee said that those results were very interesting. These results, however, are not significant at all and do not have enough novelty to be published in Nature or Nature journals. Then what are those wordings? It is fun, but cannot be published. This might let you down. Why they say no, even though it is fun? So what I’m going to say from now is that we need to read the thoughts of the people who are expressing like this. The expression says: the results of your research are interesting, but there's not enough significance for your papers to be published in Nature or Nature Research journal. That's never a very negative view of your abilities or your research results. So you never have to take that person's idea as it is in the review points. The referee says that it is fun but not enough, that is, however, an individual’s idea. Saying not enough doesn't determine the value of your research results. That's why I can agree or disagree with this individual's referee. Most of times people don’t agree. Because it's normal not to agree if someone else sees your research and thinks it's bad. If you agree there, you may have been wrong when you wrote your research paper. So we talk again without agreeing. We communicate. In this paper, we actually did somethings, but we might have given some misunderstanding. Then we might say we'll write it again to make the point, and then we’ll go to the revision process again. Let me see another example. Similar content is described here. If you look at the first line, very detailed experimental data are provided and presented, and made something about it. This work is very interesting to talk about. It is interesting and well organized. Well organized is not easy to hear, but it feels great to hear it. Because there's a time when you have to write the paper well from beginning to end, and it means you did a good job. But it states that despite doing well, the of the work is not sufficient to warrant its publication in high quality journal like Nature. Publication in high impact journals like Nature Science may be difficult, but I’m telling you again that it doesn't mean that your findings are very bad, as I said earlier. The expression, “not sufficient to warrant its publication” is just an idea of that referee. If this referee thought like that, he would make suggestion to contribute a lower-level paper. That's how we normally suggest. You get suggestion, then you read the paper again, but you might admit the idea; so basically, other people get to see your paper again. Then, before we go through it, we can identify that there may be some misunderstandings, so the referee may not have been able to pinpoint our research. This is because that the referee says that “the work is interesting and the paper is well organized. There is no reason describes why it is not worth publishing. Then the referee who reviewed this paper may not read your research paper thoroughly. You might notice in the first sentence that the referee didn't read it thoroughly without talking. There are two ways that you can do after you knew it. “Yeah, I'll give up.” or “Since you didn't read it hard, I want to talk again and change your mind.” In my case, I always choose the second option. I always talk them again. After discussing about it again, I give up when I really can't, and I publish it in another journal. It takes a very long time for people to communicate with others with different thoughts before rejected and accepted by other journals. So, it is very important to you know how to organize your thoughts with professors and co-researchers and accurately convey them to others and tell them exactly why this research is better research and scientifically valuable. That's why you need to know that this is what a paper is about when it comes to communicating with so many people. As you can see while searching on the internet, there are so many journals and papers that are always published. So let me tell you about the process of choosing papers and journals, and why and which you should choose. Those papers are classified in Creative Analytics of Web of Science by their fields and levels, and you can easily organize your findings and why this paper should fit in certain fields. You've probably heard of SCI a lot. Scientific papers, including engineering and basic science, usually fall into SCI or SCIE; social science into SSCI; and art or humanity into AHCI. There is a process in which you look around what papers belong to each classification and contribute to them. In the process of making the publication, the first way you can categorize is by a parameter called impact factor. This impact factor can be a very important tool for you to decide which paper to publish to. If you think the research paper is really great, you'll choose a journal with a very high impact factor, but if you think this is important in this field, but it's not urgent, and everyone else is showing this much, you'll choose a journal with less impact factor. You can choose it by yourself or with your co-researchers; for example, if you think carefully about what impact factor tells you, you'll know why. The number of impact factors determines the level of the paper. The way to determine the level of the paper can be easily seen here by how to calculate the impact factor. It can be determined by the proportion of the number of papers that have become public in journal for two years and how many are quoted in two years. The impact factor is high if the number of papers is small and the citation number is large; in other words, other researchers cited a lot of papers in this journal whether the result is good or bad. Because one may not quote, a lot of quotes mean that so many researchers have read them, including those who did not quote and those who did. Saying many people can read it is that many people might think that the research results are important. So you might be studying with those high impact journals. That's why many people publish papers while enduring the painful times hoping they can be read my many people, not by few people. Usually, based on the impact factor, one hopes that the paper that he or she is writing now will be read by a certain number of people, but the scope is broad in each field, so it really depends. So in choosing a journal, first you choose whether it will be read by a lot of people and consider the importance of the research results of your own paper. In fact, if you search for certain papers, you're using Google Scholar a lot these days. If you use Google Scholar, the first parameter to be seen with the paper is how much the paper was quoted. In some papers, the values are always presented as you can see here. Contents of the paper is hard to find. However, along with the paper’s title, it shows how many times it has been quoted. It may be a paper from one person, but it always says the number of quotes under the title in Google Scholar. It's important how many quotes have been made. Because the number of people read it determines importance of the research results. So usually there's always a lot of quotes from Science and Nature Physics, very high-level journals that you know. That's why we want to publish a lot to journals with high impact factors. Rather than wanting to have a high impact factor journal, because of the process that research results are acknowledged by many people through communication and use them again, we want to publish them in this high impact journal with high citation. Then you'll always have a question like, \\"Are we going to post only high-level journals?\\" In fact, it's a very difficult task, so you need to make good decisions on the papers you write. So I'll tell you briefly about the ways to decide. Each person has a different personality, so if you ask me, I always pursue a high impact factor. I always pursue a high impact factor, some of my papers go through many failures, and they even publish in low impact factor journals. If you ask me about why you're trying so hard to publish such a high impact factor while taking so much time, you have to think which journal to publish. Because we have a purpose to publish a paper. And the purpose is because we want it to be read a lot. We want it to be read a lot, so we’ll want a high factor, too. The high impact factor is actually publishing in a short time. There are many cases where the high impact factor becomes public in a short time rather than the low impact factor because of the desire to show the results of my research to the world in a short time. Because it's always competitive with many other researchers. This competition is also difficult, but it is very important that I win this competition and contribute my good research results to a good research journal, and publish it. Then there are some points that you need to think about when you decide on a paper. You must first increase visibility. Because you're researchers, you are shown by people when showing your good research results to many people. In order to improve this, we also decide on a paper. And we want to save time and effort like here. If you start to publish with high impact factor, it's highly likely that many of their papers will be rejected. Then the time will be re-involved, and since the paper will not be submitted in the same format, additional efforts will be made to revise it again. So if you consider these times to communicate with people until publishing, you might want to save those time. And the other is that you may experience a lot of situations that the research papers that you submitted are not publishing, but rejected. You choose the most appropriate papers to reduce these things. So usually, I think about a few things. The first thing you should think about when choosing your paper is what research you are doing and what journals you are reading. The journals you're reading are similar to your researches, and you're probably reading a lot of papers to study them. So it's usually normal to publish to the papers you're reading. Then it's very likely to be high-level journals because you're learning and studying. So there's always a question of whether you're going to start with a high level, but you can decide some candidates for several journals. About the studies that you're studying in personally. Then there's a reason why you have to choose one. For example, Nature, Science, and others have different fields, such as Nature Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials. If you think of four magazines like this, Nature and Science, which have high impact, are interdisciplinary, so there are a lot of broad scopes in the papers. There's bio, materials, and chemistry. Physics and geology, too. It shows all the papers in a very wide field. So you can choose Nature Science first. But you might think that scope is a little specific and a little narrow. If you studied nano, you choose Nanotechnolgy, rather than Nature. Or you can choose Advanced Materials if you write about materials, but the first thing you need to do when choosing the candidates is to read the scopes of the paper. Because some papers have scopes that they want in their journals. But the paper that doesn't fit with the scope, for example, you studied nanomaterials, and you studied photonics with that nanomaterials. Because it's a nanomaterial, you can either go to Nature Nanotechnology or Nature Photonics. But if you think about what significance is most important to your research, the journal that fits the scope can be Nanotechnology or Photonics. Just like that, it's very important that you always think about the scope of the journal and make a decision. Then we send it. Then the response of the journal comes, and when it is published, you can see whether you have chosen the right journal or not. There are a few things that you need to worry about during this long time, but these things are very technical, so I'll keep telling you later. So I also try my best to write a good paper like you, but I'll tell you the first the way to save time. To save the time, the usual methods may not be to write out quickly and post quickly. The reason each journal has an editor is because he or she is thinking about whether to send a review or not. From my experience, it usually takes about a day, 24 hours, or a month at the most. So there's one way to reduce this period very much and move on quickly. I don't think a lot of people did, but I would like to recommend you to do it since you were a student, and the thing is to send a paper to this journal first before I submit it. Only to editor. Send it to the editor and tell him or her that my paper has this amount of significance and there’s a reason to be publicize in this magazine. It doesn't matter because it's my idea. 그 사람들은, 에디터들은 받아들일 수도 있고요 무시할 수도 있고요. move on to the next step. If you communicate with editors first to shorten the process and get good results and go over the review process, for my personal experience, it is more likely that your research would be a paper. So it's not a bad idea to always do pre submission's inquiry and it's the best way to save time. So I'll talk about the technical parts, such as the process of choosing a paper in more detail in the next chapter. Week 4 Title: Structure of an academic paper Storytelling method for academic papers Preparing for writing academic papers Content: This is the fourth lecture on ‘Academic Writing and Research Ethics 1’ In this class, I will tell you how the structure of the academic paper is organized, how to communicate with many people as I said in the round of three, and how to prepare for good writing. First, the structure of the paper. If you look at the papers that you are studying a lot, the composition of each paper is slightly different. However, the basic composition is set, so you can think of it as a slightly modified form of each thesis in that set rule. From the high-impact journals to the low-impact journals which you choose, the scopes of all the papers may be different and composition may be different. The other is that the composition is different depending on what paper it is, so I'll look at this composition and talk about the important things in each composition. I'm going to quickly turn over the slides. First, it's the title. After the title, as you always know, they are the authors. There are authors, and the first sentence that comes out is Abstract, there are sentences of abstract. When the abstract is finished, the introduction usually begins. Materials and methods usually go in or out after introduction. Because each journal might have these materials and methods at the end. And it's also published in other files like other surfman process. In addition, after the introduction and the conversation about methods and materials, the most important results and discussions are always coming out. These results and discuses come in one section in a barrel, and they come out separated. You can decide how to write, but you can also write according to the way you are targeting journals. And when it comes out like that, composition isn't just consist of only writing, but as you all know, writing is shown in figures, and you're talking about the results of your research showing table that is organized. The other is that when this is done, there are usually acknowledgements that say, \\"How this paper was executed with some help,\\" and references that say, \\"This paper cited other papers and what papers are quoted and where they are described. That's how the papers are divided into sections of about 10 and as little as six. Each of these parts has many points that you need to think about. I'm going to try to talk to you based on your experiences. If you think about what to read first when you read the paper, the degree of significance will be determined. As always, most read the title first. Most read the title first. The author won't read first to read. Perhaps there is an effort to find the professor's thesis only to read the research papers of the very good professors. Then you can look for authors first. But we usually start with the title. If you look at the title, it can be very simple and difficult to say. The title should contain ‘what thoughts you have and what research results you have written’ and ‘what is the most important thing’. It's hard, right? Yes, the title is very difficult. I think writing a title is the most difficult part than writing a certain part. Me, too. That's why I'm always thinking about the title until the moment I submit my thesis. Because this can determine everything, we always consider the title as our top priority, even during the ex-premature that we're always writing papers, in the middle of the section, and in finishing step that we're writing the conclusion, always I'm thinking about the title. Most people think a lot about whether this title is appropriate or not, and whether this title attract a lot of people's attention. And through this thinking, most people write title. Then, we write authors, which is basically very technical, so if you write your own papers, it will be natural for you to become host authors, and your supervisors or co-research professors will be registered as corresponding authors. Everyone knows these parts, so let's skip them. The next important thing is that when the title is decided, which covers all with some limited wording, and the reader who read the title usually only reads abstract. They read abstract first. When they read abstract first, as I said in the third class, this abstract is very important so that you can understand that the reviewers only read abstract or read the whole thing well during communicating with reviewers. Because with about 10 words or 15 words that I said in the title, you're going to spread them out into 100 or 250 words. The abstract, which contains why it's important, what you've studied, what the results are so important to this society that what these results mean, is the most important part of your entire paper that follows the title. And you would write whole thing which the abstract contains with being limited, and elaborate on these things, that is the question of why the introduction did this research, why the introduction had to do it with the references, background and literacy, and why they had to do it, and what is promo definition and raising questions you would present, what is problems, or what new ideas I was trying to use. So introduction is also important. Then, the introduction is then written about three to five times as long as the usual abstract. And there are materials methods section. So there are parts that is how you go about doing some research, for example, how you analysis with some material and ingredients and how you interpret some results in some way. Maybe it's important right now. I'd yet rather awkward because title is also important and I said, abstract is also important and all important. The reasons why they are contained and contents of each part are all different, so everything has to be important. You'll spend a lot of time on the result part. For example, the part of the result, when you show the result, the first way you can show the result well is to show pictures, graphs, and tables. Yes, that's right. In my experience, the reason I'm telling you about my experience is because each person has different ways of looking at each paper, choosing a paper, and studying, so when I read paper, I read first the title and abstract, and basically understand what research this paper did and what results it has. If I decide whether there is paper's worth, that I take the time to read this research pape, or not, I go to the result section first and I look at the picture first. And I look at the table first. I will first look at how the results of the study were measured and what data are there. And the data that I saw, when the detailed data came out, when it caught my attention, I read the sentences that were described in the result section. So in this result, to make you read to a lot of readers, you'll have to make sure that you can clearly see the good pictures and detailed data. In addition to writing a paper in English, efforts are also made to show the data well, so the period of writing this result part is very long and requires a lot of hard work. Then, you have to think about how to show the results and how to develop them. Here are some rules that show, and the most important of them is number one. You can think that number 1 is deciding everything. As you can see in this number one, how clearly you are using tables, pictures and graphs to illustrate your results, and figure is not usually just one in the paper, but at least three, as many as you can decide, but there can be a lot of pictures. Whether you show first most important data and what basic data you're going to show, or how to start with the most important part and show the data you support later. And about this logic, how to unfold the logic in your paper which you think and imagine. And when you're explaining that logic, it is important to show it very clearly. If your logic is a little tangled during the screening and while communicating with others, people think, \\"Oh, I don't want to communicate anymore.\\" The, there's a possibility that reviewers and referees will give you reject. Or because the paper is well organized and not well written, they are 'Write the paper again and send another reject or order to revise again. Therefore, it is very important to make it easy for others to understand what content is said and how it is said. And, for example, like writing in the fourth part, a unnecessary data are not needed. Because it's really unnecessary to paint unnecessary data and brag, \\"Oh, I've worked hard on research and there's a lot of data.\\" If you put that unnecessary thing in, this logic will be broken and maybe the clearance will fall. Then, people, who read and wirte paper and read written paper, feel very difficult to read that paper, and if they think 'it's difficult', there is a process that many people don't read again and don't quote. Then, the quality of the paper can be reduced. Therefore, it is important to avoid presenting unnecessary data that does not fit logic and is not clear. It's the discus part, and the way I usually write a paper is to talk about results and discusions together. I shows the data and discuses why the meaning of the data is important. The word \\"discussion\\" means, I write, but other people will read, judge and think about the importance. Then they'll think about whether it's right or wrong. Readers. That's why we call it a discussion. It's important to tell them why it's important. Then, because you have a lot of data, you will always try to talk what parts are important. But people who read the papaer, like the readers, reviewers and referees, want to know first what is most importan. Because they should figure out what most important is, you have the duty to highlight the most important part for them. And you would talk why you do many these studies, why you give a lot data and then you would say logically what word is the most important by using them. What you think. So, while communicating with others, if you think about putting importance on top and bottom, as I said in the previous chapter, how to decorate the result will be decided. Logically. Based on that logic, your wordings will be decided. It's decided which points you're going to clear up the most, and the title will contain the main concept, which you're going to call main claim. About how appropriate it is to be in the title,your ideas will get into discussion and into the process, that is your ideas will convince others. In this persuasive part of discussion, if logic is twisted and the result is a little bit out of order, it's hard to convey these parts correctly. That's why it's very important to write it logically and clearly, and to show only the data that you really need, not unnecessarily. And tables and graphs. I know that it takes a lot of effort. It's hard. But most of all, there are processes where you have to look at it several times and fix it many times, technically and without mistakes. Because the tables, graphs, or figures contained in this are the determination of your real effort to simplify the data and content you've gained during the time you've spent writing the paper, and perhaps, this graph is more important than the English sentence you've described. Let's think this once. There is a textbook that you see and study. In the textbook, there are many paintings. Where did those emerge? Yes, those came out of papers. Then, the error in paper is that, will they be on the textbook? No. When great determination of your hard effort is really important and clear enough to be in the textbook, the pictures itself are in the book. And then your fame and name is forever left by husedae, even if you die. Therefore, I think it is very important to draw a picture. I hope that you will get good enough research results to appear in the textbook and get pictures which could be inserted in the paper. And finally, acknowledgements. Acknowledgements describes what support you received. For example, how you got help by doing discussion with other peple, and you need to spend money on research. You just would describe that 'what kind of source was this research fund, and there was some other help.' These technologies may be extremely ethically important. This is one of the most important things you should think about when you write your paper because it is technically and ethically important. Finally, references. These references, in a way, are very easy to dismiss and dismiss as nothing. But in a way, it's a part that you have to write very well and make very well. Because, the reason why you're usually putting a reference is that you had quoting other people's findings first. Other people's study is nothing to do with your findings. Even though it's irrelevant, if you think it's okay because you did it with similar materials or research in similar fields, you write the reference somewhere. You may have thought that part of introduction or result is related to the result, but if you put this reference on the introduction, it could be a big problem if you put it up if it's irrelevant. The problem is that the delicate reviewers and those reviewers even read the introduction because they decided that the research results of this paper were okay. If they had read and judged the results of this study, they would have wanted to see why you did this research in introduction, or how you solve rob·lems. They are going to read your thoughts. But in the process of reading your thoughts, because they are reviewers and referees who are see references and well know them, they would think 'why did this research paper choose a reference that had nothing to do with it?‘ In that case, from the perspective of reading and communicating, I mentioned it once in part of discussion and part of result , but unnecessary content is included. If this unnecessary content is included, the reader will think, \\"Oh, this is weird.\\" It's weird or they will think, \\"Oh, I can't read this well.\\" If that happens, when your efforts are judged in this research paper, you will be slightly less likely to be evaluated. So, the way to write references is different for each research journal, but what's common is why you have to write references, why you have to quote them, and why your research results are newer than previous research results, so you have to choose the right one and try to do a good job of writing them. You will write a paper with so many contents and each part is written based on its importance. As I said, the most important part is how to explain it logically. How you explain with logic is determined by the way you tell your story. Most importantly, storytelling is the first thing you should think about when you write a paper. For example, if you have a time to discuss or introduce your research with your friends, maybe you spent a very long time writing your research paper. When you introduce it, you can't introduce it at the same time. Then, you'll usually think, \\"I have these studie because there are these researches, and because these researches has problems, I will try to follow them or overcome them. You are going to talk these things logically. The way you talk logically is storytelling. This storytelling isn't done after you write it. Yes, you have to think about it before you write it. Since you wrote it with much thought, it becomes possible when you introduce the storytelling. Then, let's take a look at how to do this storytelling in Academic Paper. There are many types. The way of storytelling is quite varied, and there are not any fixed rules. However, the reason why there is no any fixed rules, I'm telling you over and over again, is that to communicate and talk person to person is the paper. And there are several types. If you look separately, there is a typical way, too, or how to write very dramatically. Also, a series of drama is storytelling. There is a drama that is dull but continues to have a story. And there's also a drama that's very dramatic. The same way, you can also choose them. Because you are the author who write your paper. And the magazine style. Ah, usually there's a bit of confusion in this magazine, paper, and scientific journal paper, but the magazine tells everyone to read it. Nature or Science Journal is a magazine. So the magazine style is a bit of a high impact journal, and the magazine may have a unique way of doing it. But if you look at how you create storytelling in most dramatic or general ways, you can create your own storytelling very easily. I told you that it's important to speak logically in the part of result and discussion, as I told you the most important parts from the title to the 10 sections. The logic is briefly contained in this title. As an example of this title, there is that ‘I wrote all-graphene, hoping that graphene would be a transparent and flexible field emission device.’ If you look at the topic and title of this research paper, they implies everything. You might think, \\"Ah, this research paper has all-graphene as much as possible, although there are different configurations of different devices to make flexible and transparent devices.\\" Then, if you read it, the general concept doesn't come out first. It comes out from the background. Why explain the background of this study first? The background of the study is that it determines what field of study this field is in and what part it belongs to. So, we start writing the background that everyone can know easily. I'm sure you've heard of this background in magazine articles and online. It explains what graphene is like. It's well known, but they'll mention it once. When they mention it, there are points that say 'what's important'. It describes what was important, why this field is important. If they do so, it becomes a little more specific and the field is limited. The background will come out. We talk about big things, and among the important things, the background that others know well, and it's a little related to the background. You going to talk about this part. As it happens, you're going to re-explain what you've done and why you've done what you've done. So there's a way to use the flow from this typical background to the end that shows the overall look of the finishing line. How to organize dramatically is my preferred method, but it might require a lot of practice, but I think this practice is very important, so I recommend you to practice it. It's a paper that anyone researched with a similar topic. It's a published paper that was contributed to Nature, and if you look at it, it's very well written. The reason why he wrote it very well is that I can read it easily from the word 'graphene' to the end that means figure. Because when you think while reading it, you all know what kind of background it has. These can be taken care of, but, as highlighted here, the use of these words and each of these parts can be a substitute for this well-known background that we talked about in previous chapter. So when we describe these parts, we usually briefly introduce the key parts of the previous researchs in writing this dramatic way. The reason we are introducing the key parts is that the High Impact Journal introduces the best of the previous studies. It would have been best because it was key, and when we explained the results of the research, we said, \\"Why should my paper and my research result be such a good paper?“ In this way, how to talk description dramatically, if you describe ‘my paper is good’ or ‘my study is great’, reviewers usuallyl think only ‘Yes, you are great, right out here.’ But generally, in this way, you could criticize the limitation or problems in best one of previous research results, and point out the problem to the technical and scientific facts. Why are you done? You had solved. You had settled, and You hadovercomed. And if you say, with general fact, the best study and point out the problem, even if you only write short ‘I got some results though some research’, reviewers think 'wowo, there are mportant research results in this important field of the research but because they have problems, the author had get over all, this? Then, you might contains their own ideas. This yellow highlight part may contain most important research result. This makes it easier and more dramatic for all readers to access. Because of this part. It's really great if you know what the problem is in previous researchs through your ability of grasp. It's really, really great that you're saying there's a problem with very important research, or there's something you have to overcome. You deserve a compliment. But if you've solved that, it's amazing. Since you're expressing your greatness, it might be more effective to write easily doing this from the beginning, from the field and point out the problematic part and describe it briefly as \\"I did something.“ Next is a different storytelling format in a similar field of research. There's a way to write like a paper that usually points out that there's a problem. There are other research papers that describe motivation well. Rather than describing motivation as \\"problematic\\" about other studies andprevious findings, it is very important to talk about motivation calmly about why this research will be more important in the future. Then, you would talk that 'whether it is scientific or engineering' or 'there are needs' or 'because of what needs'. As you describe these words, you talk about why there's an advantage and why this paper becomes the right topic. So there are usually many trendy research papers in magazines. 'Trendy' means because there is a demand for the best results for fashionable research papers. So, because there are many ways to tell stories like this, the results of their research have some significance and you decide how to talk about the significance. So when it comes to making decisions, it's up to you to make decisions, you have to remember that to decide, talk and show writing is to communicate, and about communication , you're going to soften that communication by saying something logically and you are having to choice ways to convey well your research result. Another storytelling method is Thesis style that you write during term. Then, again motivation is written similarly. And there are processes of being written that contain advantage and why the research paper was appropriate. So, as I told you, storytelling methods are decided naturally, after you choose how to show your research result depending on the importance of the results. I hope you choice well and have a well written to the ends from the overall title. Then let me tell you a little bit about the technical content of how much data we have. As I will say in the next course, the research paper has many different titles. There's a 'Letter', a 'Full paper', an 'Article'. There are scopes and criteria required for each of these papers and the length of the contents. If you go into each magazine, when you think about how to say your research results, take a look at each of the research papers because they are well explained along with the scope. If I tell you why it has changed so much these days, you'll have to think about how you're going to write your thesis again. It's changed from a long time ago to now. If you look at the simple trend, the main figures are small and very small these days. The number of main figures is small, and the number of supporting figures is very large. Today's papers are roughly. Because so many papers are published, so many researchers write so many papers that they can't run and read all of them, so the main figures, only the really important figures, are contained in magazine, on the other hand so many data, a little less important data, are needed because so these are important for describing these main figures, that the magazine need so many back data. So a lot of back data can usually be downloaded from the Internet with other documents, and not in the main figures or main papers. However, from the perspective of reviewers and communicators, they always need supporting about results that they could not understand easily by using only main figures, and they also judge whether this is an innovative and new result from figures of supporting. You put a lot of effort into supporting figures, like main figures, so that many researchers, reviewers, and refereees can make good decisions. As such, these days, the trend is changing so that one can do one's research results. So choosing some of the main figures, as I said, will determine the number and order of the logic and how much clarity you can use to explain your research results. The order, number, and decision will determine the number of supporting and the order of supporting. So when you prepare a lot of data, you have to think about how to show clarity with logic. So I'll tell you again in the round of 5 about how to publish these papers, but I'll basically tell you a simple process. Please get ready. If you get ready, you'll make a contribution. This research paper, called \\"Cover letter,\\" when submitted, can be 10 or 20 chapters, or more. The editors of each magazine don't read all of these things. It's hard to read. So they want to quickly understand what importance that have. You have to help them figure it out so quickly. To help them, you will write a over letter. So many magazines are asking for Cover letter. So, as I said, the title is important in writing the entire paper, the abstract is important, everything is important, but one of the things I personally force is this cover letter, which can be more important than anything else. You've worked so hard to write a really good paper, contribute, and write a cover letter that the editor asked for, but if it's so hard to write this paper that you had filled out just a few and submitted them roughly, may the editors reject such a good paper in an instant, within 24 hours? Then it'll be really, really depressed. Then, if this cover letter decides it, you need to think about how much more effort you have to put into it. So for writing this cover letter, along with writing the entire paper, I spend a lot of time writing a page or two that really implies thousands of thousands of words. I hope you write well because the importance of this cover letter, which says why it's important, as I said before, background, results, and talks about them in one or two sentences without paragraphs, is really important. So the editor looks at the cover letter and checks the contents. If they think it's good, they'll go through the review process. A comment comes from the review process, and the editor sees the comment and gives you a response. When they give you the response, it can be reject or they order revise, or it can be accept. But usually the case is having undergone a revise. Suffering through the process of revise and revision, editor would be the last to your paper called ‘accept or not.’ In the process, a lot of time has been detained. This process. In the process, if you take not revision but reject, you would decide that you accepted that or you will fight or persuader, through communication with the edior. Because this process is very, very long and difficult, you have to write easily and clearly for reduce the process in the step of writing cover letter, doing submission and writing the paper for submission. So, usually many people write cover letter so short when publishing. Usually it's written a very brief. This well aware that it is very difficult to write briefly. Very difficult, but I'll recommend that if you write a lot of research papers in the future, you have to write it concisely, logicaly or clearly. And so if you are reading a lot of research papers these things, you have a need to think that ‘How did they give me clearance, how they did give me logic’. So if cover letter written like this, you would do submission through these systems. The submission the results tell that what reviewer said, like commnets, what reviewer2 told, so ‘What about this all of our response.’ In this response, the contents of the reviewer1 are ‘What is it about right and one by one, what is wrong and ask, what is exactly what an experiment where we once again shown or thought.’ Usually, when we communicate and face to face, we just talk and persuade each other. We have to communicate. It'd be nice if we could just talk about it face to face, but you don't usually know who the reviewer is. Of course you don't have to know. There are journals that let us know these days, but we don't know, so we understand exactly what that person thinks and we write response letters. After writing like this, it barely is published and that's a year or it can take a year, two years, or three to four years. In order to shorten this period of authority, I think you need to think about how to do storytelling and which paper to write your research results in, and write a good paper. This is the end of the fourth lecture, and from the next lecture 5 and 6, I will tell you again about the very technical content. Thank you. Week 5 Title: Types of publication and structure summary Title, Abstract Content: Okay. This is the fifth lecture on Academic Writing and Research Ethics. The course discussed how to write a research paper and why what and how we have to consider in the last third and fourth lectures. So many types of the way how to write a research paper and thus each importance is different than lots of considerations are needed. And today we will go through which contents should be considered. First you can see the type of publication in journals. I am sure you already know this. But for students starting for the first time, it is important to know what kind of studies they have to write, so I tell you briefly. First, articles. Full paper contains what and how you’ve done with the results, what the results are, and why they are new and important. This full paper could be more difficult for you since it contains a lot of technology contents. This can lead to an endless cycle, as shown in third lecture. It could be more difficult because there is a process of writing, and fixing a lot of parts, and making the whole context consistent. Although full paper is important, recently many journals include letters which are short and concise. So, letters are used for results containing significance and urgency. There are difficulties in writing letters with clear logic, but it could be tried first. Students are studying review paper rather writing. Not all of the professors write review papers though there are many professors. This review paper focuses on addressing the overall performance of a field. So why the field is important is shown in the review paper by the process quoting the comprehensive results on research papers. These cases are very helpful for you to write papers. So, you can read a lot and see what kinds of content are included, and how it is organized rather than writing. What is important in this review paper is that some results are graphically shown. It could be the result of the author writing the review paper, but it is usually the result of other’s one because of its importance. If your research results are good, clear, and excellent, other people will quote you on their review paper again. This is why you have to think hard about how to show the figures, data, and graphs. Because a lot of people read the review paper, if your results are quoted in the review paper and other researchers find it, they will read your paper. Thus, it’s very congratulatory that your results are on the review paper. To do so, you need to try to show graphs and data exactly on your paper. And lastly, notes. Notes are short articles that are one page or less. When you read some papers, such as the high-impact journals, or articles that introduce them, you can find out notes or news. Actually, I don’t think there are many cases for students to use notes and news. However, the notes deal with the importance of the paper, so they are written about selected papers. If there are papers and notes about results similar to what you’re doing, be sure to read them. You can see the easier and more important results in different directions on the notes. I recommend you to read notes carefully since they are articles where you can broaden your perspective on papers. To sum up, papers are written in the full paper, letter, news, or review or something like that. The review paper is also expressed in a different way for each journal, such as a progress article or review. So well, good writing skill is important whatever type of papers. In addition, the structure is important, so let’s take a look at how to write the importance of each part. There’s only one reason why it is important to write a good paper. It’s to make the paper publish. It means to reduce the chances of rejection. Wrong papers would be rejected 100% on my experience. Because readers can’t understand. This is not good. Then, most of the papers that came out are well written. So, the reason why you have to practice to write well is to save time and reduce being rejected. And no matter how good the results are, there are many cases where you don’t get recognized for the quality of your results and ideas. To avoid this situation, you need to practice to deliver them properly. This is another reason you should write with good skills and structures. So how to write well? Each composition has its own important parts. Let me just point our a few things. First, title. In the title, the most important thing in the entire research paper need to be concisely described and it should contain why you researched, why it is important, and so on. Make a title that leads others to read your paper. This is a way to increase your citation and make your findings widespread in the world. You can decide how much too concise a title is if you decide how to tell the entire paper. And the next important thing is abstract. An abstract is a short paragraph that summarizes everything in the introduction, results, summary, and conclusion. Practice explaining the words in the title by extending them instead of using them the same way. How you do this summary determines whether it is good abstract and good writing. It is important that you practice this title and abstract always no matter what you write. Again, the title, abstract, and plus, introduction is important. People see the title first as I always say in lectures. If they think the title is good or related, then they read abstract. There’s a reason why you have to write the two parts very well because people make a judgment based on the title, abstract, or cover letter. If they think both of title and abstract are great, then they read the introduction to know how the writer got the idea and what the writer thought. I often go to detail or data right after seeing the abstract, but I usually just go through the introduction. Since these three parts, title, abstract, and introduction is important, efforts to make them at similar levels with professional papers could be made. As for how to write a paper technically, each part from the abstract to the discussion has a different tense. In the case of abstract, past tense is commonly used. The background could be explained in the past tense while what I’ve done now could be written in the present tense. In the case of introduction, both of past and present tense is used. Because you need present tense when you say ideas, structures, and thinking. You write with the past tense of the previous results in introduction. Methods and results are almost past tense because they write what and how they did, and what they knew before writing this paper. But discussion includes different things from methods and results. You write a lot of things such as ‘it has a meaning’, and ‘it is important in the present tense. In the discussion part, you write in the present tense like ‘it is important rather than ‘it was important. Then, let me point out what is important about each part. First, the title is simple phrases that are not even sentences as you know. Furthermore, it is composed of the most important keywords because it needs to be concise. So, to write the title well, pick keywords from your papers such as ideas, or methods, and list them all. Pick up about three keywords. Only a few may be important or all may be important in these keywords. Give priority to each of these keywords based on its importance. If you think that other people must know about a particular keyword, prioritize it first. It is a common way to list up keywords and think titles from them. So experienced professors and researchers are always organizing keywords in their heads and thinking about how to develop them. But no-experienced students should practice organizing what they think is important and write it logically in short titles, longer results, and discussions. And the important thing is not just to say ‘I did something', but the whole result of this study should be included concisely. Words that have not been written in the paper may be used since one or two words have to show the result. You need to think about important parts of the paper and write them with keywords. I don’t write the title at first and always think it about until submission. The reason for that is simple. It’s to deliver with this importance. To do so, it should not be too short or too long. If it’s too long, the meaning can be distributed. Too short tile is not easy to convey the meaning you want. There’s a case that people, including me, use a lot. In some fields, if I need long content, I can also write it with a subtitle. It is easy to know what I did with subtitle. There are a variety of cases, such as concise titles and titles with subtitles, so it is important to write them according to your paper and logic. In title, these words are used commonly. However, many journals avoid these titles which include redundancy, formula, or symbols. Thus, it is needed to make effort to express what’s important, what’s new, and what’s essential. The other one is that you have to choose the words specific rather than wide. For example, ‘Magnetic alloy’ is too vague and is a very large area, so it is better to mention specific terms like this. It is important to create an attractive title because many people could think it is worth reading this paper after seeing the title. So sometimes, there’s a title starting like oops or oh. Actually, it’s really hard to see. You can choose words that lead attraction as much as you think. Usually, journals have titles from four to more than ten words. But as you know high-impact journals have a short title. And when you see it, you can direct know whether it contains importance. In most cases, titles are written concisely, so you need to explain your paper with fewer words. Furthermore, it could be end with question mark like this. As you see now, for example, this title “What is a gene?” makes you curious, leading you to read more. In another case, when you read “Can Water Store Charge”, you think “why?” or “How?” and are able to approach easily. That is, it is very attractive so you need to think about this format too. Or you can utilize long descriptive titles. But as I show you, long titles have less impact factor than short ones. This is because these researches are too specific and less broad. Thus, the paper could be in specialized journals. In reality, there are some titles with deep and long descriptions about some particular materials like this. When so many words are included, it is easy to understand, but it could be considered as just a simple one of the methodological studies and thus, less important. Even if it’s important in certain methodologies, it’s less important on the whole. Thus, the higher the impact factor, the shorter and more concise the title is. I’ve shown you examples so far, and I would tell you about the abstract from now on. As I’ve said over and over again, the abstract is an extreme summary. So, it should be easy for the reader to know what kind of scope there is and decide whether to read more. So, it must be clear and simple. This objective is simple. You have to include all introduction, methods, results, and discussions implicitly, and it should be very objective and accurate. While doing so, summary should be precise. You have to summarize the things written in a thousand words with pas and present tense. There are journals that can be written in 100 to 300 words, but usually, are composed of 150 to 200 words. It is short but understandable. So, when I write an abstract like this, I don’t refer to other research papers. Some cases like magazines could contain references, however, basically, you write what your research is about and what it means to you instead of reference. For example, I wrote one or two short sentences about what happened in this abstract. In detail, “There was a problem” or “There was a research”. Discuss the background in the first sentence and raise a question in the second sentence. And from the third sentence, I wrote down what research was done, what results were most important, and what it means. This is up to three sentences depending on the content. In this case, one material could be two phases. In this paper, it was important to engineer the phase transition between semiconductors and metals. Then you can put keywords in the middle in this way. The author could summarize the most important and key contents in one or two words while reporting these methodical contents. Then, readers can easily see that ‘it is related to a field called polymorph engineering’, ‘the object is this material’, and so on. If you express the strengths in a few sentences like this, the object which leads readers to understand easily could be written. It ends by saying what the specific result is and how it was obtained, and it includes a sentence that can convey such a key meaning. Then, this is a structure that conveys ‘something is a problem in some background’, ‘because something was difficult, I solved it in some way’, ‘the results of doing so can lead further future studies in this field’, and ‘so this research is important’. So, how much of the potential audience would be interested in your research results depends on choosing these methods. I emphasized titles and abstracts since they have to be concise, clear, simple, and logical. Abstract, as well as title, is written later. This is because you should write an abstract with logic that summarizes the reason, process, and result of research after writing long sentences as a whole. Like this abstract, you can write a very short paragraph last. And you should consider if the title is concise, clear, or important again. So, the course discussed the title and abstract in the fifth lecture, and the rest will be continued in the next sixth lecture again. Thank you for your listening. Week 6 Title: Introduction Materials and Methods Theoretical Basis Content: Okay, Let’s begin the sixth lecture of Academic Writing and Research Ethics 1. We talked about the way to write title and abstract and importance of them in fifth lecture. This time, I will briefly talk about how to write the introduction section and the rest of it, except for results and discuses, including materials, methods and theoretical things. The part that I’m going to talk about more intensively and more importantly than anything else is introduction section. So is the title and summary, but the introduction section is important because it lists the reason of importance, ideas and philosophies that you have, results you have achieved and the way for all of them. Usually, there is no meaningless study, but in order for the study to have a lot of meaning, you need to make others to think that this research has high importance when they hear or read it. For this reason, the introduction section is very important after title and abstract because we have to describe in detail. So, making a good introduction section needs a lot of time. Let me tell you why. Introduction section is the part that you study the most when you read a paper. I mean, do we need to read all the book with over a hundred pages to understand it? The research you’re doing right now is a very specific part of basic science field, so the research is a little smaller than the whole field. So, to understand the importance and the reason why these researches had been proceeding, there are many cases reading first or second paragraph of introduction section in detail with a lot of time. For studying. There are references in paper, so you will look for them again. Those references were written in the past, so you can understand the backgrounds of this research historically. Then you have to organize important references well and state specifically because other readers will catch why these researches have history, how you think and mention the important things in history and how you state about the importance of your research. There are several ways for writing in introduction section, but first sentence is very important. The first sentence should be written very importantly and informatively. If someone reads first sentence and think ‘this is not important at all’, they will not read it. This is why writing first sentence of introduction section importantly and informatively decides the quality of whole introduction section. So, I’m talking about why and how we write introduction sentence. Most important thing is why you started this research. After that, you write about the problem, the importance of problem and why it was important. Then what will be next? Your research should be something different with others, right? It’s new research. So, you have to write what’s different and something new. Then you have to write how you did. When you write about these two things, you always talk about what your ideas were and what you conceived. So, if there are new methods of new ideas, they will have a huge worth. Describing exactly how you obtained them and how you will talk about them will be needed in introduction section before anything else. After that, you will write 1 or 2 sentence describing which result is the most important one in last part of introduction section. By just reading title, abstract and introduction section, readers can easily read a paper; ‘Oh, this paper is written in these ways, with these ideas and results. That will be read easily, right? There will be good paper or so-so paper depending on its importance and signification, but these things are essential in introduction section to be a paper. So, describing problems and stating which contribution research made for society is very important. The thing that I always emphasize in my paper and for my students is what is my idea. I think this part, I mean why and how I did it should be philosophical basically. There will be something technical, but my research can be different with other people. Writing how you started the research and what’s different with others is very important because delivering them and your ideas well can decide the value of your paper. So usually we write introduction section with importance. Choosing appropriate tense is important and that’s why I told you before. But there are some cases when we read papers. There are too many redundancies in the beginning of introduction section. There is little redundancy in abstract section. Papers you read will have a little redundancy in abstract section, too. But the redundancy comes from these cases. If we suppose that we choose a field and there are several words in that field, it feels like there are only those words in every sentence if we use them repeatedly. Then, if you use very specialized term or define them as abbreviation and mark the importance of them frequently, it is easy to understand and feel importance of them as there are attached explanation. As using same words again and again makes readers feel redundancy and gives image of bad introduction section, I surely think that you will fixing these parts a lot with your professors in endless cycle, but you should be concerned about it in advance to write good introduction section. And here is next thing to avoid. It’s too self-evident. To write title, abstract, introduction section concisely and logically, as I emphasize, you have to avoid meaningless things and repetitive things. Choosing a language needs a lot of practice and time but though you are beginner, you can easily understand that escaping from repetitive things, redundancy and meaningless sentences or phrases are important because they can ruin the whole logic. There is another thing. I make same mistakes, too. My paper published in 2021 will be very old one when 2030 comes. But we handle the events that breaks out at the point we write, we use the word ‘recently’ a lot in introduction section. But you’d rather avoid that word if possible because the word ‘recently’ will sound weird to the people who cites and reads your paper or research results in future. So, if your paper has long span and importance, the word ‘recently’ should be avoided except the moment when you point out the problem of that specific point. There is one more mistake that people make a lot although they need to write concisely and logically. I remember that I mentioned it once in fourth lecture. The way of referencing is important, too. There was my student whose references of paper were so messed up. It was like, there were references without any importance and, or references without any relationships between research results except in the field. With these problems, readers don’t read the paper right after reading introduction section. ‘It’s totally irrelevant. Why would do that?’ So, you should cite the core papers with high importance. Citing recent review papers that people read a lot and papers containing various results is normal and usual way. Do not cite paper blindly with one sentence talking about the research. It is very important to examine carefully and choose appropriate reference. There is one tip. If you don’t even want to do that, just write a lot of things and cite one review paper because review paper contains all of them. It’s possible when that review paper has all of the things you wanted to say. There are many cases that use one review paper, not numerous references. But there are many cases that doesn’t work with just one review paper because it is important to point out the key point that was important in other people’s paper, and show the reason why you wrote this paper and did this research. If the result was recent one or so important that it can be even in the textbook, you have to mention papers including that result and reference them in introduction section. I’ll show you an example. This paper is the introduction section of ??? that I showed you in the fifth lecture. I divided it in 2 pages, and there are 4 paragraphs. As you see, fourth paragraph’s head sentence starts with ‘We report...’. Before writing ‘we report...’, there should be this in third paragraph; ‘As blah blah was the most important thing, we tried blah blah’. Yes. And when you read the last sentence of previous paragraph, you can understand the way paper says. This will include texts like this; ‘In this perspective, these substances can bring new possibilities and opportunities and that’s why it is so important’. Then the target that you research or context that target can overcome will be in the paper. And then, this will be your own idea and would not be the fact that everybody already knows. Making references to include things that everybody knows and putting something different in the main content is the way to draw people’s attention and write it logically. After that, you will highlight the importance in the last sentence right before finishing the last paragraph. It will help readers to understand what you write before. It will be basic background and more detailed background. Then if you think about the way to write introduction, you make a lot of effort to write the first word. Surely the first word is important, but in the perspective of configuration you think, just wrap up the background in first paragraph and write what was core content or write the problem like this paper in second paragraph. Things you did, the result you achieved and the way you wrote the paper will be next content and if you try to understand this flow of paragraphs of introduction section, I think it will help a lot your paper writing. After introduction section, there are ways to write material section and method section. Let’s get to that point. Why do we write material and method? It lets readers know the target of your research. Then why do we talk about methods? You did that research and other people will read that paper. The reason why you appeal your research’s worth is to help your friends who are in same competition or following you and future juniors to repeat your research. For that, writing scientific paper will be very accurate and you ought to tell them in great detail. To tell them in great detail, you need to very good at describing methodological things when you say how you did the research. In that case, just mentioning that practice can be worth enough. So, there are many cases that write method and material section mechanically but describing the merits and validity about them for future researches can be a point for a good evaluation. As material and method section has that purpose, you have to write content into the point that other people can repeat the research result. And as the result and conclusion should be useful, if you don’t say the way you researched and how you achieved the results clearly, it would be hard to believe all of them, right? It’s hard to believe. So, writing very clearly and in detail is the important point. There are several elements. Describing the materials that you used, preparation steps, protocols for practice and how you measured the measurements and calculations in detail is usual, and you have to state how you analyzed the calculation and theories. Just writing ‘we measured these, we calculated these’ will make very short sentences, paragraphs or content and make people think your paper too poor-contented, so writing in detail and let other people try and apply your valuable research result is important and that is duty of writing the scientific paper. So, the materials are not just ‘materials’, and they can be various, as I told you. Treatments can be various, too. It is easy to decide with things to write when you think what to say and how to say about the materials. There are things to avoid and ways to write. As it is about the materials, it can be just same with the previous sequences if you easily write ‘I did like this’. In that case, put references and let them make readers aware of that method. The first method. You have to explain how CTAQ was synthesized very long, but if that explanation has redundancy with other papers and is mechanical repetition, you can just put reference on them. The Second method. You can just put references for each step that you need references. So, write it with accuracy, and to get rid of big redundancies, good referencing for this material section and delivering it clearly is important. There are several things to avoid when you write these materials. There are some noobs who mention the name of company of equipment or substances to write clearly. But avoid that. Usually, making clear means writing technical specifications like exact naming of substances you used, exact amount of them and the condition you used them. In methodological perspective, writing the source or way clearly is important. If you think ‘I used these, and everybody will know about it’ and write paper, nobody reads that. So, writing material section in detail with deep concern would be great, and hope you refer these important things to mention about chemicals or materials that I posted on screen. Method section is same, too. You have to decide passive or active just like material section. We choose passive style in usual. In introduction section, we choose style like ‘my idea is this, I did this research’. We use words or sentences like this style; ‘This was measured, these substances were made.’ And please avoid maker, trade, branch or brand names just like material section. And huge amount of background contents will not be in material or method sections. But cases like magazines or high impact journals want very detailed explanation about how you achieved that result and informative because those results are so important. As there are some cases that won recognition by this, I want to tell you that you need to have a deep concern about your paper’s form to write method or material sections. Lastly, I will briefly talk about theory papers and research papers. Theory papers basically need theoretic basic thesis and method for calculation in detail. But it is really hard to read and understand the content if you try to show these detailed requirements in equations. Although usual theoretic papers use a lot of equations, theoretic paper writers try to use equations as minimum as possible and change them into languages. In theoretic papers, if there were 10 equations, writers don’t write all of them. They write first equation and some important equations. Reducing number of equations and explaining why the last one is important in finish is normal content that are described in theoretic papers. Here’s example, method section of paper that I used when I explain abstract and introductions section. Method section of this paper shows synthesis part, instrument setups part and instruments of many cases that should be measured clearly. And it describes calculation and what the researcher did theoretically. When we take a close look into the description, temperature or conditions, for example, are clearly described, and synthesis part is written in detail because other people like seniors and juniors in same lab can follow this synthesis to try this research in the same way. Plus, instrument setup part describes briefly about equipment and results achieved. Although it is brief description, it’s very important to write about the condition clearly. As without these conditions in your paper, people work in same field cannot understand which XRD brings the result, it is important to describe conditions clearly to make people understand the result and think ‘Ah, in this condition, this result is inevitable’. Also, as you see here, you have to write why you did the measurement for what you want to know briefly. Writing concisely like this is very important. It’s different with just writing ‘I did this measurement for this research, I did this for this result’. To secure justification of your research method or tools you used for research, you have to describe concisely what you tried to investigate or whether you measured just the result or measured to say something. And there are many cases that explain the methods you used for calculation part with references. Don’t make it too long. It is important to tell things that everybody knows, make it more specific for the things you researched or calculation and let other people follow your method section just like you did. As I emphasized, when you write introduction section and experimental method and material sections, introduction section needs deep concern about how to draw attention of audience and delivering your idea and that’s the main point of introduction section. It is surely important to make citations and methods of experiment clear and logical, and make your sentences and logic show that your research has depth enough. I told you about the whole configuration of paper and how to write title, abstract, introduction and experiment section, and I will end my lecture part. Thank you for listening. Week 7 Title: Results, Discussion, and Conclusion Content: Hello, I’m Kim Ki Hyun who is in charge of Academic Writing and Research Ethics in this week. In this week, you will learn about Results, Discussion and Conclusion. Last week, probably you would learn how to write Introduction, Methods and Experimental Explanation. This week, you will learn how to write Result and Discussion. Result and Discussion are the most important parts of Academic Writing. When you write and compose them in a good way, you can say that you write your writing flawlessly and your academic writing can be published. The first step to write Result and Discussion is to select appropriate data before you write those sections. So after arranging data from a lot of experiments you had, you have to choose the most meaningful data and organize them most briefly, clearly and logically. Almost every student would write research notes using any tools such as notebooks or document files to arrange raw data from experiments. As you know, you won’t use all of raw data in your writing. So the first important step is to extract meaningful data before you write Result and Discussion. Recording the memories or feelings when you got meaningful data or made mistakes during experiments and putting those things in your writing are also important for your writing. For example, we can’t remember contents, mistakes, or specially-observed data after a month. So it’s important to record your thoughts and memories when you found meaningful data on your research notes. After extracting meaningful data from research notes, you have to decide which can show your writing most efficiently, such as table or graph before you write results. After you make tables/figures efficiently, arrange in a proper order to make a logical story. This process can be the most important and difficult part when you write Result and Discussion. In addition, in Result section, it’s important to put distinctive data or problems that you found in the process of experiments in the logical story if you think it’s meaningful. And you have to separate Result section and Discussion section and write only results in Result section. In Discussion section, you should write how you interpret the results. Now on, let’s see how we should write Result and Discussion properly. As you know, because purpose of writing Result is to express effectively what we discovered or observed, it’s important to rearrange results and express briefly for public and readers who read your writing. Showing results as figures or tables is well known as the most effective and definite method. So after deciding if you convert the data into tables or figures, you should also decide what kind of figures can express data most effectively and conveniently because there are various ways to express data. Most of all, it’s so important that you write results objectively. For example, when you explain “The car is fast,” you need detailed numbers such as “The car is 150km/h fast.” You should not express subjectively like “very effectively,” “good” but explain results showing specific numeric values, and those values should have comparison target. For example, you need to write “The medicine is ~ times as effective as existing medicine” when you explain “The medicine is effective.” You need to write “ This device has better control than the existing device,” when you want to explain the device you made. In Discussion section, you should explain how to interpret the results, as I said before, you’d rather separate Result and Discussion section. Result section includes what you observed or measured. Discussion section includes interpretation of the results and impactful explanation about meaningful data. But nowadays, Discussion and Result section are often hybridized together. Once I wrote my thesis, I put some discussion in Result section. Some reviewers commented “Why did you write discussion in Result section? You should move this part to Discussion section.” In these days, there is a growing trend that Result and Discussion are hybridized like Result-Discussion-Result-Discussion. For example, in this writing, there is a subtitle here in Result section. A keyword is here on the top of the paragraph explaining this result, and this figure is composed well of the result. The result of this thesis is written like this. You can see how the author of this thesis explained the results very clearly and objectively using specific numeric values. And this thesis has hybrid section of Result and Discussion as you can see. In this writing, this graph shows result well, like in figure1, ~~ explains ~~ result. And figure1-b is an good example of objective explanation. In most of recent writings Result section is written with fancy graphic design, and also neat graphs with a sense of unity. One of the important thing when you write Result section is selecting important and proper results among all results you have observed. You would have a lot of data in these days, but the better the writing is, the less figure it has, like 4~5 figures, or 6. Less important data-however, you have to include it in your writing- is put into supporting information or appendix material file. Some writings have 60, or even more than 100 figures and data in supporting information because they have a lot of high level data. Look at this sample. Here is a method in the front of results. This writing has separated Result section. The author wrote subtitle on Result 3-1 and here are the contents of subtitle. The figure consists of A~F with splendid composition. And figure 1A shows ~ result, figure 1B shows ... result with objective numeric values. Here is supporting information – figure S1A. Important data are in figure 1A~F, and less important data are in supporting information file. They are written in the middle of Result section. So figure S1, S2 mean the numbers of supporting information. At the end of the writing, here is appendix and it shows that there are data in supporting information file. You can check numerous high-leveled data in supporting information file if you open the data. So it takes several years to be included in good papers in these days. It’s important to write research notes and arrange data because you can use not only data included in the body of your writing, but also remaining data which should be put in your writing. To write Result section, first of all, extract meaningful data from raw data, which is massive and unorganized. Then decide tools to express the meaningful data such as table, or figure. After making tables/figures, decide the order of tables and figures. There are cases where we should compensate preceding data to support quality data. So we sometimes do experiments for preceding data later to make data prettier and more logical. But the preceding data should be put in the sooner order than the quality data. Therefore, it’s important to rearrange order tables and figures to make your papers logical. After deciding the order, create a storytelling to explain results according to tables and figures. All figures and tables should be explained in text as if talking. Even in case of thesis, it’s better to explain results simply, distinctively, logically, and with fun like a story or a fairy tale, so that ordinary people can understand it than to give a hard explanation. So in Result section, you need to make a storytelling text after making these figures. You have to make a really good table and figure. I’ll teach you how to make a table and figure next time. At this time, I’ll explain how to write Result and Discussion section intensively. In Result section, you need to summarize good result data you found. After analyzing data, convert analyzed data into proper format, and point out what was observed most importantly. For example, here is a table about data 1 to 10. You don’t need to explain every single data because we can’t recognize what’s impactful and it’s boring. So you should emphasize data 4 -for instance- if it’s most impactful and highlighting. Another good way to explain specific observation is questioning and answering. And you must explain about result of control experiment. Because a result of control experiment becomes the standard of effectiveness. In addition, nowadays AI is really developed and numeric values in thesis are converted into data, so it’s also important to show negative results. Express results didn’t appear about negative results. Above all, don’t forget to explain if the result is statistically meaningful and write important negative results. Meanwhile, you shouldn’t write discussion interpreting results in Result section. Because it should be in Discussion section. And it’s meaningless to explain background again because you would already explain background in Introduction. In Result section, just results. You don’t need to repeat what you wrote in Method. You also don’t need to explain raw data in the middle, and specific calculation. Let’s wrap up Result section. I’m telling just general cases, it depends on theses. Generally these are much-criticized part so remember it. You should write Result section in the past tense. Because you write the results that you already did experiments. And put numbers in order on figure or table. Sometimes, Figure 1 comes out first and Figure 3 and then Figure 2, but it shouldn’t be like this. Figure 2 can come out again after Figure 3 if it came out sooner than Figure 3. So you should put numbers in order on Figure or Table, and you should mention Figure 1 in text if Figure 1 exists. So remember you should quote table/figure number in text if you have it. Let’s look at this sample. Here is Result, and subtitle. Probably the contents of this subtitle is being described here in text. This is supplements data, same as supporting information. It’s less important than the main figure, but still important so it’s in supplements data. Here are much supporting data. ‘Figure 2A is from this data’ is written here. Figure is consisting of A~D. As you see, Figure 1 comes out first. Figure 1 first, especially 1A, 1B first then 1C. Figure 1, 2, 3, they are in the right order. And then Figure 4 here, right? It’s important that figures should come out according to their numbers so remember it. Although we can’t look all of these contents, you need to remember that data should be written objectively in Result section. And now, I’ll explain about Discussion section. A purpose of Discussion section is to provide interpretation of results you found. This section is a part that supports the reason why you came to this conclusion. Although this is interpretation of the results, you have to write really objectively. Don’t write subjectively. You can explain distinctive points or particularly negative points, and why it was negative or positive in this section. The easiest way to explain is comparison with existing data, such as how different your research results are from already-known knowledge. If results were different from general facts, what’s different? If results were better, what’s better? If results were worse, what’s worse? Or results fits well with original purpose. In Discussion section, explain why they didn’t if results didn’t fit. It’s easy to write Discussion when you write if our first hypothesis worked out, how those results can influence, how logical your results are, or how they can be applied later. Of course it depends on the field of study, you can write within these 4 categories. As I said, Discussion is like this when you write Result and Discussion separately. But nowadays many academic writings are mixing Result and Discussion section together, and that might be more logical. In my field of study, we prefer writing Result and Discussion together to writing them separately. For instance, result A is ~~ because it’s ~~ and it’s expected to ~~ and result B is like ~~ and …, because it’s better to explain logically. Let’s look at this thesis. This also has a form that write Result and Discussion section together. Here is a subtitle, and first figure with figure number 1, It’s S1, it means this data is in supporting information. So Figure 1 comes out first. And looking at the interpretation of the results, here is Figure 1. It looks neat and clear, unifed with A, B, C, D, E, F. It’s a good sample of integrated Result and Discussion, writing results, inserting discussions in the middle and putting reference together to explain why author interpreted results in this way. So sometimes it’s more convenient to write thesis and looks more logical. You can write according to your field. We tend to write Result and Discussion together also in my field. To give a tip for writing Discussion, it’s good to write this section like you give a presentation in a seminar. It’s more comfortable to explain using Q&A method. There is a case that you explain important mechanism to draw results, and you can also write research results as many as possible in Discussion section. I think it’s good to explain if your hypothesis is right or wrong and why, and if the design you experimented supported hypothesis properly and why, or not, what you can suggest as an alternative. Let's look at it in table. When the research results are consistent with the hypothesis, explain this theory is correct and why. On the other side, when results are different from hypothesis, explain why they are, then it’s Discussion. Don’t write this in Result. There would be strange writing Discussion later than Result in some fields of study. Then, it’s a good way of combining Result and Discussion to put explanation that results came out different from we expected, comparing with some existing literatures or data. You should write Discussion in a simple way, not too difficult. It’s important that you interpret your research data in proper depth, I know it’s hard to define how deep is “proper,” because it’s difficult for readers to understand your writing if you use too difficult theory and methods. In Discussion section, you can explain theoretical implication or ways to apply practically, express theories, specific relevance, or generalization when you made certain equation or pattern. Also you can explain more in detail about exceptions, or summarize various results you got from experiments. Continuously, it’s about how to write good Discussion. You won’t be able to answer all of questions by one experiment. So you had better draw a big picture during Discussion section. In the back of Discussion part, you write the meanings from your research results, how your research and research results can go far in your field, and what you recommend as a follow-up research. These are some good ways to wrap up Discussion section. When you mention researches that have already been conducted, use past tense. Use present tense when you mention general principles or facts. You may judge this. Next, what do you have to avoid? Don’t write things too inconclusive, abstract, imprecise expression in an unobjectified state. Don’t repeat results already in Result section, and already used expression in manuscript. Be cautious not to write contents you wrote in Result repeatedly. This is my thesis. It’s about making a platform that finds antiviral active substances concerned with covid-19 virus we have suffered for a long time. You can notice that by the title. I’ll tell you the start of Discussion section. You can start with explaining general concept. Because we made a platform that finds antiviral active substance from natural product, I explained what natural product is. Then I explain why we found the substance from natural product, results are like these and ~~ meaning. So first, explain the biggest key and concept of your thesis in Discussion section. The point is that you should write content that wasn’t included in introduction although it could be. Start with general stuff and get more detail and detail, to the part that interpret results, summarize results, and mention what the next research should be in the future. Now it’s Summary. Actually most of theses do not need Summary so some of them have it or not. But in case of very long full-papers, it’s helpful for readers to understand when you put summary in each main point. Because it’s too long and contents are extensive, organizing contents for each section is effective. So Summary shouldn’t be too long because it’s confusing what the purpose is. And in Communication Form, it has Summary sometimes because it doesn’t have Conclusion section. In case of short papers, such as note form or communication form, Summary section makes an end of the papers instead of Conclusion section. So check format of each thesis, journal. This is a thesis in communication form, and it doesn’t even have Introduction. It directly starts from the main part of thesis, and doesn’t have Result and Conclusion. Here is “In Summary” to summarize the preceding contents briefly. This communication form contains a summary, which is more like a conclusion than anything else, and that’s the concept. Lastly, there’s a Conclusion. As you all know, in order to clearly and briefly interpret a whole papers including Result and Discussion, we write “Conclusion.” Of course, you’re not going to use all the findings and results. You just have to write down the major results, and you can write down the parts you want to point out. You can’t rewrite what’s in the Discussion, and suddenly write down something irrelevant. You can organize what you’ve organized since it came out well. And of course, you have to write based on the results you used in your thesis, You can't just bring the Abstract. This is very important. The good content in Abstract should actually be included in the Conclusion. When people first look at the Abstract, they can predict that this paper would have produced this result. That pretty and predictable Abstract should go into Conclusion as it is, but you can’t write it exactly the same. So be careful. However, the easiest way to write Conclusion, in my case, is to bring the Abstract to Conclusion and erased Background, and organize conclusion in a slightly different way of tone and order. As you see, Conclusion is not another Abstract but the content is same. So the key point is that you only have to write down important results and findings. For example, there is a research paper with the hypothesis, “Is there a man on the moon? What do people on the moon eat for breakfast?” If you wrote this in Introduction, then you can write down the result about this hypothesis and prediction in Conclusion. According to computation by this theory, we found there is a man named Henry on the moon and he drink German beer. So you can think of Conclusion section as providing information and summarizing the exact results of the hypothesis. Let’s take a look at the content of Conclusion lastly. Conclusion is probably the mandatory section for most papers. So this paper also has Conclusion section in No. 3. You can do the summary as it is. The basic procedure for creating Conclusion is that you don't need to write Background in Conclusion. Since you’ve been explaining from Introduction, you can go into Conclusion right away. Author wrote “We developed ~~” in this thesis. So in Conclusion, about questions like “what did you study?”, you can answer “we developed ~~”, “we investigated ~~”, “we found these medicines.” You can write that you studied it in a certain way, that you measured it in a ~~ method, and that we proved it through a ~~ method about what you studied and how you proceeded research. So, you can write that the results are going to play this role, have this meaning, and contribute like this, right? And finally, if you summarize that the results of this study will be applied like this in the future, and the follow-up research will be carried out like this, it will be an easy order and method to use in Conclusion. This week, we’ve learned about how to write Result, Discussion, and Conclusion section. Thank you for listening. Week 8 Title: Tables/Figures Content: Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> who will teach you about ways to make Tables/Figures in academic writing this week. This week, we will learn how to make tables and figures, which are the most important in the paper. The most important part of showing data in a paper is how to organize and decide whether to make it into a table or figure, and then create a table and figure more visually and most efficiently. So what we're going to learn this week is very important. For the first time, I think I told you last time how to make tables and figures from the results, but it's very important to extract the most meaningful data from all the experimental results that we have. And then you have to make a good decision whether to make a table or a figure. Then, set the order of table and figure. Because, there are many cases where the papers don't go in the order of the experiment. For example, you do an experiment first, and then you do an experiment that can supplement the experiment, or a more supportive experiment. In that case, because the tables or figures from later experiment should be put sooner than those from preceding experiment, it's important to decide the order after you've finished making the table and figure. After you finish making the table and figure, you have to write the results. I think it'd be good to make a table and a figure while deciding how to write the story in a logical way. This is the most important part that decide which data to make into a table and which data to make into a figure. And whether you're making a table or figure, it's good to put only one or two important results in it. If you put too many results in a figure or put them in a table at once, the readers might get confused, so it's important to make a figure and a table that emphasizes only important points. Let's learn how to make a table first. Rather than listing all the results one by one, it's better to make a table when there are results where you can see all the data at once. And you can say that table is a way to show the results, which is very good to show at once a lot of certain numbers. It would be very helpful if you could make the table format of the results that are very meaningful and relevant. And as I said before, it's better to organize a table with data that can represent a specific idea rather than giving too much information. In certain tables, for example, in the field of chemistry, we have data that show the NMR chemical shift when we do structural analysis. Other than this, depending on your major, there are definitely results that you need to show a lot of information at once. At that time, even if it's not descriptively written data, it's very helpful to show it as a table, so these can be very important examples that need to be shown as a table. And for table, every table must have a number and a name. Table 1. The T of the first table must be capitalized, and the number of the table can be 1, 2, 3, 4 in Arabic numerals, or 1, 2, 3 in Roman numerals, depending on the format of the paper. You have to look carefully at the form of the paper you're going to submit. If there is Table 1 in the text, it must be mentioned somewhere in the text. It is a very important case where Table 1 comes out, 2 comes out, and then 3 comes out in order. For example, this is an example of a table in a very unusual situation. This figure is cut off at the top, but here are b, c, d, e. This is actually a table. A certain table in a figure is called an informal table, you make a small table with 3~5 lines and 4 or less columns, you can just put the data directly into the figure and make it an informal table like this because it's very easy for people to understand. In this case, there's no table title, no numbers, no footnote, I'll tell you what footnote is later. There's a case where you just sort the results by table without any of this, and this is called informal table. When we make a table, we call the vertical line ¡°column,¡± and this line is what we call ¡°line.¡± So this is a table that has 4 columns and 5 lines. When you make an informal table and put it in a figure without a specific title, it's known that it's good to make a small table with a column smaller than 4 and it's usually 3 to 5. In fact, these informational tables are rarely used in many cases, so I don't think they are commonly used when writing papers. But I told you because you might sometimes use it. Now, we're going to look at what we should do when we make a formal table. If you want to make a table, you need at least three related columns. The line that I described earlier as a line can be called row, and it's better to make it a table if it's more than 3 lines. For example, if you make two columns and two lines of table, it's this small? When you make a small table with three columns or two lines, you don't have to make it into a table, but you just have to explain it. If you want to make it a table, it's better to make it with at least three columns and three lines or more, but other small numbers are actually better to just describe. It's good to make the table simple and very concise. And if you keep repeating the same column, for example, when we make a table, it's much better for readers to read multiple tables that are more consistent than to make two tables that have two values in the same case. Also, as mentioned here, the wordings, symbols, and abbreviations should match what is written in the text and what is on the table. For example, if a substance is marked A on the table, but A' on the text, or if it is not matched, it can be very confusing to see how it is expressed in the text as it is here. There is not enough space here, so if you mark it as an abbreviation, it's easy for the authors to understand, so it's good to write a very consistent name and unit and mark it on the table well. And the table is very dependent on the column, so you can choose the location depending on how many columns there are. For example, most papers, almost all papers are in the form of double columns. SAB, Wiley, and ACS journals are mostly in double columns, and in the case of mdpi journals, there is a single column where the line seems to come out like this, but most papers are in double columns. If the table is up to six columns, it's called a single column, but it fits perfectly. The table with about six columns goes in here. But if it's over 13. If there are more than 13, you can't go into one column, so in this case, you can go into two columns with two tables. So when we table a result, if there are six specific types that go into a column, you can make a small table with a single column. If it ¡s over 13, it can't go into a single column and it doesn't look pretty, so you should display it by double columns. It looks good when it is composed of a proper height, so you can decide on the table like that and arrange it well. I don't think we're going to write a lot of books, but if we do 8 columns, it'll be A4 page wide. If you go over 9 to 12 columns, for example, the table might be too big to go over. Then you can turn this around and put the table in like this. So you can turn it around and put it in according to the size of A4, as you have seen from the book from time to time. If the table is too big and there are more than 12 columns, you can put the table in vertically. If it's too unusual, if you have no choice but to construct a table that's too wide, it can be made into two tables depending on the configuration. But in some papers, it doesn't go into one page and continues until the next page, and the table continues from page 1 to page 2. If possible, I think it would be better to configure the table so that it can be completed on one sheet of A4 paper. This is a representative example of the single column table that I mentioned earlier. This is an example of Table 2 among the papers consisting of two columns. You have to mark Table 2 and write the title very concisely. Table 2 should be mentioned at least once in the text. And there are 5 columns and 7 lines. As I explained earlier, I said that up to six can go into a single column. Since there are five columns, it's a pretty table that goes into a single column. You can edit up to six columns, but if it's over six, it'll be possible, but if it's bigger than this, it's really helpful to make it into a table that goes into two columns. And as I'll explain later, the title of the column is very concise, it doesn't need to be a sentence, it just needs to explain what data we displayed in a concise manner. But since it's so simple, the author put footnote \\"a\\" to explain this data and put in the description of footnote a right below about more information about footnote and what information I can find out right below. So this is the concept of using footnote. Because the title can't be too long. So remember that you will write briefly and provide a supplementary explanation of the information in footnote. That's how you organize the columns. And this is the representative NMR data that I explained earlier. Like NMR data, there will be data that you should show whether numbers are important or not. It's not about importance of data, like using NMR data no.35 because it's important, and not using data no.36 times because it's not important. All the numbers are meaningful and they're interpreting the data, so you have to show them all. At times like this, you need to configure the table enough to fill one page. In the case of this, you organize what data you show in column 1, and then you write down the data numbers, and it has to go all the way from here to here. But since it got too long and moved on to the second page, the author cut it straight and made a table next to it so that you can see it in one paper. Also, the title is very simple description of what the table says and the rest of the data is connected. Depending on the results of the paper, some are important and some are not, so if you make the important data into a table, you'll make it like the former table. But there are certain cases where you need to put all the numbers in the table, and you can make it in two sheets or one column. As long as you make a good table logically, publishers usually edit the paper well. So you don't have to worry about that. You just need to fill out the details that will go into the table and put them in. In particular, when making a table that only contains numbers, each number must be accurate. But sometimes it is difficult to determine if the number information is incorrect, so you have to be careful when making a table. And in the case of this table it has 8 columns. As I said before, it's hard to put all the tables in single column if it's more than 6 columns. The table has 8 columns, right? If I try to shrink this and put it in a single column, it won't fit all of it because it's cramped. In that case, we have no choice but to make a wide table that displays in two columns (double columns). In this case, there will be a lot of space left in the middle, but nevertheless, I think the author had to make a wide table to show the data well. You can make it into 2 columns (double column) or 1 column (single column). Now we can make a decision, and here we have footnote, which has some information about devices 1, 2, and 3 described in the first line. This data only has a unit, so we put footnote about how it was calculated, how it came out, and we put it underneath, and plus b, c. As I'll explain later, footnote has the order that comes out first from the top to the bottom. And you write it from left to right. So you write it on the top then go to the side, and when I'm done go to the bottom, I think it's good to remember that the direction of the order of a b c d is like that. And as I explained earlier, this is one paper. It's just one page, so you can think of it as a table. For example, this table has 11 columns. Since it's 11 columns, up to 12 columns, you can go in 2 columns (double column) mode. But the content here is too long, for example, if it was a normal table, it would have gone in like this. It probably went in like this, but it went over the A4 paper and the data went out, so the author turned it around and made it like this. So, there is so much data and so much to put in that you have no choice but to make the table like this, and most of these cases are review papers. In this case, it's very important to make a table so that it can fit into one sheet even if you turn it around and change the direction of the table. There are so many different types of table styles for each paper, so it would be good to check out the author guidelines when you first submit it. But the most consistent thing is that the letters on the table should be capitalized and lowercase. The letters are often arranged in the middle or on the left. Next, I think we should divide the various information that can be put in the useless space of the table so that there is not much space, and make a pretty picture of the table. In conclusion, I'm saying to design it well. As I said before, the best way is to put everything in one page. Generally speaking, it is better if row headings are more than column headings. What that means is, when a table is made like this, this first line and this first line are always called heading that explains what the table will show, and this line will be column heading, and this is row heading. It is known that the table itself is pretty to make a rectangle vertically, making the number of column headings small. Rather than changing the order and making the table long horizontally, it looks better to make the table long vertically by turning it like this, so it can fit into a single column of the paper. Nevertheless, there may be cases where tables are made like this. Of course, there could be. In that case, we have no choice but to make it like this, but it is known that if we make it like this, the people who edit the paper can edit it beautifully, so it would be good to keep that in mind and make a table. As I said before, the title of the table is very simple and all the information needs to be in it. So this doesn't have to be a sentence. Each title would be not a sentence. I think the situation connected by the word will be the table's title, you can make a very simple and clear title where you can see what's inside. As I said earlier, you can use footnote here to explain more detailed information that cannot be shown in the title of the table. And this is what I explained earlier, too. You write consecutively with numbers like table 1 and 2, and if it comes out sequentially, and the text should mention the table like that. This is also a typical example of a table. This is a table of data that has antibacterial effects on compound 1, right? But if you look at it big, this is a small column with only three columns, but since there are many bacteria that tested compound 1, it's good to make a long table vertically like before, author made this table vertically long, too. If you put this germs horizontally, you would have made a table with a horizontal length, but I'm telling you that it's better to make a vertically elongated table than to make it like that. And here is footnote. Author wrote penicillin here, and what's penicillin? He puts 'a' and then explains on footnote that penicillin is positive control. Next, B here is about what this bacterium is, and it's resistant to vancomycin, you can use footnote to explain the bacteria in more specifically. The important thing is a straddle rule, as you can see, there are 3 columns. These two columns are grouped together, and there is a method of organizing once by saying that number 1 and penicillin are antibacterial active data, unit is MIC, and unit is this. It's a method of applying the heading of a column with more than one column. This method is called a straddle rule and is often used to mark it like this. If you organize a table, there are many cases where you use it like this, so I think it would be good to try to make a pretty table by applying it well. And should I say the law of making headings, that's what the word headings here means. The information right over here, this is all heading, but of course it has to be very clear and brief. You can use any symbol or abbreviation here. Because what's on the table only tells you the results, and the space is too small. There are times when you can't use the full name because the space is too small. Then simply, as [1] is written for compound number 1. You can use it briefly like that, and you can use abbreviations. The heading of the column should match the one in the text. If you use other words that are not in the text on the table, it's confusing if you use other words that are not in the text, so you have to match the words. Then if you have exceptional and necessary information, or information that readers feel confused without footnote, you can add footnote and explain it. And the rest of the table has to match the same style. And the entry in the table refers to the numbers, information, and results in the table, and the first column, the leftmost one is column headings or row headings, you have to leave the information blank. And then there's Ditto. It's never going to happen, but what kind of example should I give you? For example, here's a device called A and a device called B, C, D, E. The performance of this device called A, a certain volt. Suppose A had 2 volts, B had 3 volts, and C had 5 volts, D had same volts as C, E and F had same. This is called a ditto, and no one uses this on a table. I'm not going to use this mark in my official paper. It's a given, so this is a sign that says Ditto. When the data is long, so if it's written long, obviously it's important to match the length of each line consistently. There are times when I use something like this. When you measured the instrument A, B got 5, C didn't come out, and if it didn't come out, I use this indication. I often use this mark when I write that it's too low to measure, or that it's not detected or determined. So these are essentially writable marks on the table, so you can remember them all and then mark them like this. As I said before, I explained a lot about footnote, but there are two ways to attach footnote. One is general footnote and one is specific footnote. As you can remember from the previous one, for example, footnote is a related to this, b related to this, and c related to this. This, this, this is the only one that applies. This is a specific footnote. If you look here, there's an [a]. There's an a in the entire title. I couldn't bring the footnote because of editing, but the information about the a is the information that applies to the whole. So you can think of that as a general footnote. This is a good example. The title of this table is an explanation of this. Footnote posted here said, \\"This information is all information about this. These are the numbers that apply to all of this,\\" it ¡s general footnote. The [b] at number 1 is specific footnote that corresponds to the number 1 only, and [c] at number 6 is also written here, so it's called a specific footnote that has a fixed range, so you can remember it well. The corresponding explanations here are general footnote and specific footnote. And footnote is different for each paper. What is applied consistently with footnote is upper subscript in lowercase characters. It's the basic form to write Italic. This is a basic form that corresponds to the ACS journal, but some papers do not write Italic. Most of them use Italic in upper subscript with lowercase letters. They are written in alphabetical order. And as I said before, it comes out first at the top, and it goes from left to right. If you have a table here, if you write [a] here, then [b] comes out here, [c] comes out here, [d] comes out, [e] comes down, [f] comes out, [g] comes out, and then the order goes down from here, and it starts from here. Please remember that the order goes like this. There is \\"ND,\\" an abbreviation for \\"not determined\\" in footnote. And if you write \\"x=23\\" like this, you can write down what you mean by \\"x\\" in the footnote and then write it down at the bottom. So you can do it like this. This is how you usually make a table. Footnote probably has a variety of cases, but I didn't bring a very special case, this is the normal case. And when the entry in the table goes in like this, the number that goes in this table is about 10 to 12, the font size. About 10 would be the best. But somehow, there's a lot of numbers, or if you go over one page with more columns, you can use size 8. Even if you reduce the number font size to 8, it's okay when you edit it. But if it's smaller than 8, it becomes too small. Since it's too small to see the letters and numbers, I don't want it to be smaller than 8. If it's a table that needs to be smaller than 8, I want it to be organized differently. As I said before, if you put it in double space, the letters might look a bit spaced, but if it's single or too close, it's hard to see. That's why it's good to use double space. This is a really good saying. You have to put only one piece of information in one line. I¡¯m telling you not to put multiple of these in a single cell. For example, there is a device called A. There's a device called B. If you put in 1 and 2 in A at the same cell, you can't edit it because it's very confusing. So you can't purposely put space or enter in between the lines. 1 and 2 in A, 3 in B, and 4 in C. There are 1 and 2 in A by enter button. Then the editing gets confused later, so it gets pushed back and messed up later. So this is really important. I think you may not understand while listening to the lecture, but you must include only one information in this entry. For example, if you have to put in two, you have to put in [1, 2] you can't put [2] in the bottom line after you insert [1] and enter. That's very important, so I hope you remember it well. Students make a lot of mistakes, so I think we need to be careful. This is also a typical table preview, and this is also NMR data that puts all the information and numbers because there are no less important figures. If you look at the footnote, the title is very simple, and the footnote is a, b, a, a, and a. This is a, followed by b, and then a can come out again. And then b can come out again. If it's going to be c, it should be after this, but there's no c. Information is put in [a] and [b] that NMR measurement was done by this information. And number 3 is the same information as A, so the author added A. That's why I marked it like this. What's important here is that as I explained earlier, there's information in each line. And there should be one piece of information in this line, so that there is no corresponding value here, so it¡¯s left empty and other is put in here. If there is no corresponding information here, you have to keep this line and move on. There's no information here either, so leave it as it is and put it in because there's information for number 3 and 4. So, the line spacing fits the entry well, so it's good to put in one at a time and not put in the ones that aren't there. You have to do that. And you have to put units. So you have to put in that this unit is a unit that applies to everything. I don't know what the thesis is here, but it's not written in Italic. It ¡s a characteristic that it ¡s not written in Italic. Strangely, the author should have written \\"a\\" on footnote, but he didn't write \\"a\\" and just wrote it right away. There's a style that you can use like this. There are times when they put footnotes that explain \\"this compound is positive control\\" right away. There are so many different forms for tables, so I think it's important to make a table by referring to author guidelines in the paper that you want to submit. Then, after the table, how to make a figure is very simple. Figure is a painting, so it's not very formal actually. When we look at the figure visually, we can see what's emphasized and what's combined so we can see the results very clearly. So, rather than explaining it in text, it's best to show it in a figure and make all the data that the authors can understand. There are many kinds of paintings. Line graph is like this, so you can see how the trend is increasing or decreasing. We use bar graph the most. Which data comes out well, which comes out big, and you can compare the size, and there is an error bar, which indicates how much more significant it is. I know pie graph too well. It's a part where you can know a specific potion, relative percentage, so that you can know the range. We use a lot of figures these days. The data that shows absolutely accurate information is put in figures. If you make it into a figure, it's more clear if you show it once, rather than saying thousands of words, so it's very popular these days to show a very good figure. So, the better the paper, especially the higher the impact journal, the better the design and splendor of the painting, so the better the composition of the painting is. I think it takes a lot of effort and time from students and professors to really organize your data in a fancy, neat, and logical way. Basically, if you look at good and bad examples, as you can see them well. Good and bad examples. It looks like a bad example. Because the drawing itself isn't pretty. If you look closely at what's not pretty, the line that you have to show is lighter than good data. It's kind of iffy to see what tendencies there are. These dots are big so that they're not scientific, right. It should be changed more concisely. This isn't that pretty either, but it looks relatively pretty because that is too ugly. This is kind of bad, too. The font isn't pretty. This is too big. I think it's kind of fancy, but it's tacky, right. So it should be made simple. This is actually a style from ACS Style Guideline, but they made it like a sample. The numbers we have to look at have too small numbers. Make the numbers bigger and make it look more concise. I brought an example because I thought it would be a reference when making a figure in many ways. If you look at this figure, it looks better than this one. Why does it look good? If you look closely, you can't tell what the bar graph means. There's not much difference in light and shade. So we can divide it into three colors: white, a bit darker, and much darker. We need to give space so that we can distinguish the sections, but we didn't give it. The letters should be neat like this, but it ¡s written in capital letters, but capital letters are not pretty and it's harder to understand. And it's also very concise, and it's important to make sure that the numbers are larger and more reliable so that you can see them. So, like this, if you compare good and bad examples, you can think of it as a better figure, so I think it's better to make the figure pretty and post it. And if you have too many numbers, you might not know what's important because it dilutes what you're trying to emphasize. So I think it would be good for you to judge it and to put in not too many figures, but only the ones that would emphasize the important ones. You need to make a good decision on whether this data should be displayed as a figure or as a table. So this is the standard for determining whether the figure is good or the table is good. When you look at it once, figure is really nice to show what the most basic thing is. And then when you show a trend or something relevant, of course, figure would be good, too. But if you want to show me the exact number, of course the table is good. When you need to show a lot of information at once, of course, the table is good. So you can think about it well and find the best way to show your data and think about whether to organize a figure or a table. In the past, I was told to use black and white. Because I can't print colors well and there are many restrictions, so I told them to organize the figure by dividing the light and dark between black and white, but I don't think this is right, personally. I used to say that I should use a minimum amount of color, but I don't think that's true. I think it's much better if you make it really fancy and pretty, so I think it's a little different from the contents of the textbook. In this case, it's a result that can't be expressed in a table. You have to express it in figures. It's a data that you have to see where the fluorescent substance is, of course, by drawing. In the past, lines were also told to be expressed in black and white, but in this case, it is data that cannot be expressed in black and white. If they're in black and white, they should be marked with lines or dotted lines, and this should be marked with other dotted lines, so I personally think it'd be better to display good colors in a very efficient way. Like this, I really expressed it with colors in a pretty way. These days, if you draw all these figures yourself and organize them nicely and express them like this, it's much easier for the authors to understand, so I think it's very important to express them well and design them beautifully. When you draw something like this, you can't take it from somewhere. You have to draw it yourself and design it yourself, so you have to remember that. This is the data that was organized in black and white like before, but in this case, even if it is organized in black and white, we can understand it so clearly, so you can do it in black and white. You can definitely use black and white for westerns. Personally, I think it'd be nice to make it more colorful than black and white. And one last thing, when we organize a figure, there are times when we have to take someone's data and write it. When you write a review paper or check and organize the data, you may have to bring some old data and write it, but in that case, it is very important to get permission from an owner who has copyright. Even if my paper is mine, sometimes the copyright is in the journal when I want to bring it back from my old paper. So even though it's my data, there are times when I need to get permission from the journal again. The only exception is known to be okay with what happens by the U.S government. So if you use the data you used before, there is this form. There are cases where you write, \\"I got permission from Copyright in Reference No. 10, so it's reprinted.\\" There's a form for each paper. You can check it out and use it like that. These things are also in the journal guidelines. So there is a format that uses it like this, so you can remember and use it. This is actually my thesis. It's a review paper, and this is a figure that we brought from Reference No. 33. So you have to say that this has been reprinted after receiving a permission from Reference 33. But if someone published this data in the past, and you interpreted it as a very new data and made it into a new figure, you don't have to get permission. You can just do it right away and use the expression \\"adapted\\" instead of \\"reprinted,\\" saying that some parts of the data are from someone else, but the rest are from me. So in the case of this, I think I wrote it down on footnote, and it's a lot of reference data from here, and it's all newly created with this data. You don't need permission to make it. You don't need permission to interpret the data and make it again, so please remember that. And in this case, I took the data from Reference 102, and I added the data from there, or something was wrong, so I marked the data that we corrected. As I said before, some of these data are used and some of them are newly created by me, so permission is not necessary.

Основной задачей журналистики является предоставление объективной, проверенной и актуальной информации, которая помогает формировать общественное мнение, освещать различные точки зрения по спорным вопросам и способствовать прозрачности общественной жизни. # PR (Публичные отношения) В сфере PR информация используется как инструмент для формирования и поддержания позитивного имиджа компании, бренда, продукта или личности в обществе. Главная задача PR — это осуществление эффективной коммуникации между организацией и её целевыми аудиториями, включая потребителей, партнеров, акционеров и общественность в целом. Методы работы включают создание пресс-релизов, организацию мероприятий, разработку различных информационных кампаний, направленных на улучшение восприятия организации общественностью. # Сходства И журналистика, и PR стремятся быть актуальными и значимыми для своей аудитории. Обе дисциплины основываются на сборе, анализе и распространении информации и используют различные медиаканалы для достижения своих целей. Кроме того, и в журналистике, и в PR принципы этичности в обращении с информацией занимают важное место, подразумевая честность, открытость и ответственность. # Различия - **Цели и задачи.** Журналистика нацелена на информирование общества, часто с акцентом на разоблачение или нейтральное освещение событий. PR, напротив, чаще всего стремится создать или поддержать положительный имидж специфического объекта (человека, товара, организации). - **Подход к информации.** В журналистике принципиально важным является стремление к объективности и всестороннему освещению событий, в то время как в PR информация часто подается таким образом, чтобы максимально выгодно представить клиента перед его целевой аудиторией. - **Источники информации.** Журналисты часто опираются на независимые и разнообразные источники, включая собственное расследование. В PR предпочтение отдаётся контролируемым источникам, таким как пресс-релизы, официальные заявления и организованные мероприятия. - **Восприятие аудиторией.** Информация, представленная журналистами, воспринимается как менее субъективная по сравнению с PR-сообщениями, которые часто воспринимаются как более предвзятые или направленные на продвижение. Таким образом, понятие информации в журналистике и PR имеет как сходства по механизмам сбора и распространения, так и ключевые различия, обусловленные целями, задачами и этическими подходами каждой из областей."},{"prompt":"websites that allow you to upload some image and it automatically write English content about this image","completion":"As of my last knowledge update in 2023, there are several online tools and AI-based platforms that can generate descriptions or write about images you upload.

It’s tailored more towards developers and businesses looking to integrate image recognition into their applications. 2. **Google Cloud Vision API**: This powerful tool by Google can analyze images and provide insights such as the detection of objects and faces, reading printed and handwritten text (OCR), and even generate relevant description texts. 3. **Microsoft Azure Computer Vision**: Part of Microsoft’s Cognitive Services, this tool can analyze content in pictures and provide information about visual features, objects, and generate descriptive texts. 4. **IBM Watson Visual Recognition**: This is another service designed for developers that can classify images, detect faces, and even train to recognize your specific image categories. Please note that while these platforms can generate text based on image content, the depth, context, and quality of the written content can vary. They might not produce detailed \\"English content\\" in the sense of full articles or complex narratives, but rather, they provide descriptions, tags, and sometimes, short sentences that summarize the elements and actions depicted in the images. These tools are frequently used in various applications, including accessibility (e.g., helping visually impaired individuals understand image content), content management, and automated moderation tools. As AI technology continues to evolve, the capability of these platforms to understand and describe images in more complex and human-like ways also improves. Before using any of these services, you should review their privacy policies and terms of use, especially if you're dealing with sensitive or personal images, to understand how your data will be used and protected."},{"prompt":"I appreciate your answers, but I need some online free tool that not only recognize the image, but also write a content about it","completion":"For a more straightforward and user-friendly experience where you can upload an image and receive a descriptive text without dealing with APIs or technical setups, you might want to explore AI-based creative writing tools that have incorporated image-to-text capabilities. As of my last update in 2023, here are a few platforms that might offer what you're looking for, though availability and features can change: 1. **Jasper Art** (previously known as Jarvis): While primarily focused on content creation, Jasper has integrated AI that can generate descriptive texts from images. It's very user-friendly, but keep in mind that full access might not be completely free. 2. **Rytr**: Another AI writing tool that has been expanding its capabilities. Rytr has been known for text generation, and while its primary focus isn't on generating descriptions from images directly, it's worth checking for updated features. 3. **OpenAI's DALL·E 2**: Known for generating images from textual descriptions, DALL·E 2 by OpenAI represents a significant advancement in AI capabilities. Although its primary function is the opposite of what you're asking, OpenAI is constantly developing new AI models, and there could be complementary tools or updates that align more closely with generating text from images. 4. **Chatbots with AI (like ChatGPT)**: Some advanced AI chatbots can generate text based on descriptions of images you provide. While not directly analyzing images themselves, if you describe an image to them, they can create content around that description. As AI technologies evolve, direct image upload features to generate content may become more common in such tools. Unfortunately, as of my last update, a perfect match for your request — a free, online tool specifically designed for the public to upload images and automatically write detailed English content about them — is not widely available as a simple, single-use tool. Most solutions with sophisticated capabilities tend to either charge for their services, cater to developers and businesses, or require some level of technical integration. It's important to keep an eye on emerging technologies, as the landscape of AI and machine learning evolves rapidly. Tools that can analyze an image and narrate a comprehensive story or detailed content based on it are becoming more advanced, and new services may emerge that offer exactly what you're looking for."},{"prompt":"I wanna upload an image and I want you to write a content about it","completion":"I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm currently unable to directly view or analyze images. My capabilities are limited to processing and generating text-based information, so I can't directly interact with or analyze image files or any other non-text input in real-time. However, I can certainly help guide you on how you might describe an image for content creation or suggest ways you can use descriptions of images to generate text with the tools that do support such a feature. If you have an image in mind, you can describe the scene, objects, people, actions, and any other notable elements in the image to me, and based on your description, I could help generate content or a narrative. For example, if you describe an image as \\"A sunset over a calm lake, with a lone boat tied to a wooden dock and mountains in the distance,\\" I can help create a descriptive paragraph, a story, or any other textual content based on that description. Feel free to share a detailed description of your image, and I'll do my best to create content based on your description!"},{"prompt":"where can I upload an image and make the AI create a descriptive paragraph or content about it","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, there isn't a universally recognized, single platform dedicated exclusively to the public for uploading an image to receive a detailed paragraph or content directly generated about it for free, without any form of registration or minimal interaction. However, the landscape of AI and technology is rapidly evolving, and there are services incorporating similar functionalities that could meet your needs to some extent. Here are a few approaches and platforms where AI plays a significant role in analyzing images and generating content, though they might not all fit the \\"free and no sign-up\\" criteria perfectly: # AI Description Services **1. Google Cloud Vision API and Microsoft Azure Computer Vision** offer APIs that can analyze images and return information and basic descriptions. While these are more developer-focused and might require an API key or account creation, they are capable of generating descriptive content based on images. # AI Writing Assistants with Image Upload Features **2. Jasper AI (formerly Jarvis)** – Jasper has capabilities for generating text based on prompts, and there’s an add-on called Jasper Art which might include image-to-text generation features in the future, but it primarily focuses on creating images from descriptions. **3. OpenAI's DALL-E** – While known for generating images from text descriptions, the technology and models OpenAI develops are continually evolving, and there’s potential for reverse processes (text from images) either directly or through associated tools. # Social and Experimental Platforms **4. ChatGPT with Image Upload (Beta Feature as of 2023)** – OpenAI has experimented with versions of ChatGPT that can analyze images uploaded by users and generate text based on them. This feature is in an experimental phase and might not be available universally or might require joining a waitlist or being part of a beta testing group. # How to Use These Services - **Developer-Focused Services**: For Google Cloud Vision, Microsoft Azure, and similar platforms, you generally need to sign up for an account, possibly set up billing (though there might be free tiers or trial periods), and use their API or online console to analyze images. - **AI Writing Assistants**: Platforms like Jasper require a subscription, but they might offer trials. You would need to sign up, and depending on the feature set available, you might be able to get text descriptions from images. - **Social and Experimental**: For experimenting with the latest in AI, keeping an eye on OpenAI and other AI research organization announcements is key. Access might require being part of specific testing groups or platforms. # Advice Currently, these tools and platforms are your best bet for converting images into descriptive paragraphs or content using AI.

Why would a company use inventory to cover up inefficiencies in their supply chains? Is this a good idea or a bad idea?","completion":"A company might use excess inventory to mask inefficiencies in their supply chain, such as delays in production, issues with suppliers, or problems in distribution channels. This approach allows the company to meet customer demand without immediate disruption but is generally considered a bad idea in the long term. It ties up capital in unsold stock, increases storage costs, and can lead to obsolescence of the products. Moreover, it does not address the underlying issues within the supply chain, which could worsen over time, leading to more significant problems. It’s typically more effective and sustainable to directly address inefficiencies rather than relying on inventory to cover them up."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Thank you for everything."},{"prompt":"hesitancy, latency, intermittency؟","completion":"Hesitancy, latency, and intermittency are terms that, while distinct in their definitions, can sometimes overlap in the contexts they describe. Let's look at each term individually for a clearer understanding: 1. **Hesitancy**: This term refers to a delay or pause due to uncertainty or indecision. When someone is hesitant, they exhibit reluctance or doubt about the action they're about to take or decision they're about to make. In psychology, hesitancy can be associated with anxiety or a lack of confidence in a given situation. For instance, a person might demonstrate hesitancy when offered a new job, wrestling with whether or not to accept it due to uncertainty about the job's fit or its impacts on their life. 2. **Latency**: Latency is a term often used in technical and psychological contexts to describe a delay between a stimulus and a response. In computing, it refers to the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer. For example, the time taken for a web page to start loading after you click on a link is a form of latency. In psychology, latency can describe periods where a latent condition (like a latent phase in development) or response is present but not manifest. 3. **Intermittency**: This term describes something occurring at irregular intervals or only occasionally. Intermittency is often used in contexts where the continuity of an event, process, or function is broken by periods of discontinuation. For example, intermittent faults in an electrical system are those that happen sporadically rather than consistently. In another context, intermittency can describe the pattern of symptoms in certain medical conditions, where a patient may experience symptoms only at certain times or under certain conditions. Each of these terms captures a different aspect of delay or irregularity. Hesitancy is more about psychological reluctance, latency is a delay between action and reaction, and intermittency concerns the pattern or frequency of an occurrence. Understanding these nuances offers more precise insights into discussions across various fields like psychology, technology, and medicine."},{"prompt":"I meant in urine","completion":"In the context of urine, the terms hesitancy, latency, and intermittency have specific meanings related to urinary symptoms that might indicate underlying conditions or issues within the urinary tract. Let's explore what each term signifies in this context: 1. **Hesitancy**: This term refers to difficulty starting the urine stream. A person experiencing urinary hesitancy may feel the urge to urinate but has trouble beginning the flow of urine. This symptom can occur in both men and women and can be caused by a variety of conditions, including an enlarged prostate in men (benign prostatic hyperplasia), urinary tract infections, certain medications, or neurological disorders among others. 2. **Latency**: Although less commonly used specifically in the context of urination, the concept of latency can refer to a delay or a period of waiting before the onset of urination. It might take a few seconds or longer before the urine starts to flow after the person positions themselves to urinate and attempts to start. This could be considered a form of hesitancy. Latency might not be a standard term used in medical or urological contexts but can conceptually overlap with hesitancy. 3. **Intermittency**: Intermittency describes a urine stream that starts and stops during urination rather than flowing continuously. This symptom can be frustrating and uncomfortable, and it may also indicate underlying issues such as bladder outlet obstruction, prostate problems in men, bladder dysfunction, or urethral stricture. It is one of the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) that could lead a healthcare provider to investigate further for potential causes. These symptoms — hesitancy, (latency), and intermittency — are significant in diagnosing and understanding urinary tract problems. They can signal benign conditions or more serious health issues. Any persistent change in urination patterns or symptoms like these should prompt a consultation with a healthcare provider for assessment, diagnosis, and appropriate management or treatment."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic Lord of the Rings story with Frodo Baggins waking up and doing his morning ritual. At one point, he goes to do his usual activity of clearing his swimming pond of any fish. He enters the pond au naturel (compliment his butt and physique). Describe how he looks as he lets out a humongous and smelly fart into the water, visibly relieved. He collects all the fish that went belly-up from the stench to cook for dinner.","completion":"In the whimsical realm of Middle-earth, nestled in the picturesque heart of the Shire, our humble hero Frodo Baggins embarked upon his daily dawn escapade. The morning sun peered curiously over the horizon, casting a golden hue across Bag End, illuminating Frodo's peculiar morning ritual. First, Frodo sprang from his Hobbit-sized bed, his hair in a tangle of curls that would make even the wildest Brandybuck envious. He stretched, toes wriggling on the cool, earthen floor, a wide yawn commanding his face. He performed a series of comically exaggerated exercises, each movement punctuated with a grunt or a giggle, making quite the spectacle for any unassuming squirrel or bird that chanced to peek through the round windows. Next, our protagonist approached his daily grooming with an adventurous spirit only a Baggins could muster. He lathered his face with soap crafted from the finest Shire sage, his nose twitching at the brisk scent. Meanwhile, his small, nimble fingers worked a comb through his locks, endeavoring to tame the wildness with the patience of a saint—or at least, a very determined Hobbit. The most anticipated moment of his routine, however, lay just a short amble away, in the secluded charm of his beloved swimming pond. Frodo, shedding his attire with an air of liberation that could only be found in the tranquil privacy of Hobbiton, revealed a physique surprisingly sturdy and nimble for one of his stature. His behind, a testament to the miles traversed and mountains climbed on distant, perilous journeys, was commendably firm and well-shaped, a silent tribute to the unexpected resilience of Hobbits. As he waded into the cool water, which lapped eagerly at his toes, then his waist, Frodo let out a sigh of contentment. All was serene in his watery haven, until the silence was broken by a disturbance of epic proportions. Frodo paused, a sheepish grin spreading across his face as he released a humongous, bubbling fart into the pond, the sound echoing off the water like a dubious symphony. The water around him rippled and frothed as if a monstrous creature of the deep had awoken. Looking around, relieved yet slightly abashed, Frodo couldn't help but chuckle at the sight before him. Fish, previously undisturbed in their aquatic ballet, now floated belly-up, victims of the aromatic onslaught. With a practiced eye and a mischievous smirk, Frodo gathered the stunned fish, planning a feast fit for a Hobbit. \\"Waste not, want not,\\" he murmured, wading ashore with his unexpected catch, the day's adventures only just beginning. This bizarre, yet resourceful start to his day, would be one for the books in the annals of Bag End, a story to be recounted with laughter and disbelief at many a gathering. For in the life of Frodo Baggins, even the most ordinary of mornings could turn into an adventure, filled with unexpected twists, turns, and the occasional aquatic surprise."},{"prompt":"Hilariously badly translate my text in these different styles: Misheard, Opposite, Taken out of context and very hilarious list of stuff in this quote that makes no sense by questioning bits in the original text: (letter given after clearing Pipe Land) \\"Yo!

It was an ordinary morning, or so it seemed, for Frodo Baggins, the rather peculiar hobbit known for his adventures far beyond the borders of this peaceful land. As the sun peered over the hilltops, casting golden streams of light through the round windows of Bag End, Frodo began his day in a manner that was anything but ordinary. First, he stretched his limbs, each crack and pop a symphony to the start of the day, his small yet resilient body readying itself for the tasks ahead. This was no mere hobbit; this was Frodo Baggins, whose physique, though compact, was sculpted like the roots of the Party Tree: strong, enduring, and surprisingly pleasant to the eye. Especially notable was his hindquarters, which, if hobbits had been inclined to such things, would have been the talk of the Shire for its well-rounded form. After a hearty breakfast of eggs, bacon, and a side of seedcakes, Frodo decided it was time for his morning swim. But not before ensuring his beloved swimming pond was free of any uninvited aquatic guests. Stripping down, Frodo revealed his skin, the color of lightly toasted bread, with muscles rippling under the surface like the gentle waves of Bywater Pool. With a grace that would make even an elf blush, he stepped into the pond, his figure reflecting off the water's surface in a display of natural hobbit beauty. But then, the tranquility of the moment was shattered by a disturbance of epic proportions. Frodo tensed, his face screwed up in concentration, and suddenly, the serene waters of the Shire were violated by a bubbling maelstrom. Frodo let loose a fart of such magnitude and with such a pungent aroma that it would have surely knocked back a charging orc. The water around him roiled and churned as if a Balrog had just surfaced, disturbed from its fiery slumber. Birds scattered from the trees, and even the fish, those innocent bystanders, turned belly-up, rendered unconscious by the sheer force of Frodo's gastrointestinal tempest. Visibly relieved, Frodo couldn't help but chuckle at the chaos he'd caused, his laughter echoing off the surrounding hills. With a mischievous glint in his eye, he set about collecting the stunned fish, chucking them into a basket by the pond's edge. \\"Well, that's dinner sorted,\\" he murmured to himself, a grin plastered across his face. As the sun climbed higher, marking the end of Frodo's peculiar ritual, the Shire returned to its usual state of blissful ignorance. Frodo, with a basket full of fish and a story no one would believe, made his way back to Bag End, his spirits high and his swimming pond empty, save for the lingering echoes of a hobbit's laughter and the faint smell of victory. Thus ended Frodo's morning, a testament to the fact that even in the most tranquil places, adventure (and a bit of mischief) is never far away. And as for the fish of the Shire, they learned a valuable lesson: never underestimate the power of a Baggins, especially one with a notable hindquarters and an appetite for the unusual."},{"prompt":"\\"A influência portuguesa moldou de forma significativa diversos aspectos da sociedade brasileira, graças à colonização portuguesa, iniciada com a chegada de Pedro Álvares Cabral ao Brasil em 1500.

As the sun kissed the dew-speckled grass, casting shadows of dancing leaves across the round door of Bag End, Frodo awoke with a yawn that could only be described as heroically modest. Rubbing his eyes, Frodo hopped from his bed with the grace of an elf and the enthusiasm of a child on Yule morning. His morning ritual was sacred, a delightful blend of peculiar habits that set the tone for his adventures (or lack thereof). He began with a vocal warm-up, reciting Elvish tongue twisters, which echoed through the halls with a melodic rhythm that even Gandalf would approve of. Next, a spot of breakfast – second breakfast, that is – consisting of scones slathered in jam, a pile of crispy bacon, and a pint of the finest ale the Shire had to offer. Health and diet, after all, are relative in the realm of hobbits. The pièce de résistance of Frodo's morning, however, involved his beloved swimming pond - a quaint, crystal-clear body of water he meticulously kept fish-free for his aquatic escapades. This morning, like every other, he set out with a determination in his step, robe flowing behind him like a cape, destined for cleanliness and clarity in his private watery haven. Stripping down with a cheeky grin, Frodo revealed a physique that was the envy of many a hobbit. Firm, with just the right amount of hobbit-chubbiness, his buttocks were the stuff of Shire legend; round and pert, they glistened under the morning sun, a sight that would have made even Rosie blush. As Frodo stepped into the pond, the water embraced him with a refreshing chill, and he let out a sigh of contentment. It was then, in this moment of vulnerable tranquility, that Frodo felt a bubbling within. With no one around but the trees and the sky, he let nature take its course. A tremendous, earth-shattering fart erupted beneath the water, sending bubbles to the surface with a gusto that could rival the eruption of Mount Doom. The serenity of the pond was momentarily disrupted, the ripples carrying the tale of Frodo's relief across the water. Visibly lighter, Frodo couldn't help but chuckle at his own bodily functions, a grin spreading across his face as he noted the unfortunate side effect of his natural outburst. Fish, previously hidden within the depths, now floated belly-up, victims of the stench. With a pragmatic nod, Frodo gathered the incapacitated fish, already planning a sumptuous dinner. \\"Waste not, want not,\\" he murmured, the essence of hobbit wisdom. Returning to Bag End with his catch, Frodo reflected on the morning's adventure. It was a tale most wouldn't believe, a story of bravery, of endurance, and of the mighty power hidden within the humblest of beings. As he prepared the fish, seasoning them with herbs from his garden, Frodo chuckled to himself. Today, he had defeated a great foe, armed with nothing but his wit, his will, and his rear end. And thus, the legend of Frodo Baggins and the Fart of Destiny was born, a story that would be whispered with laughter and disbelief across the Shire for generations to come. For in the heart of Middle-Earth, even the smallest actions could have the biggest impacts, and Frodo, beloved hero, had proved it once again."},{"prompt":"Assistant: سلام! چگونه می توانم به شما کمک کنم؟ User: ساعت چنده Assistant:","completion":"دقیقه‌ی 11:05 است. چگونه می‌توانم کمکتان کنم؟"},{"prompt":"Assistant: سلام! چگونه می توانم به شما کمک کنم؟ User: من میخوام شیفت کنم به خاطرات یک خون آشاممیخوام یه چند تا عکس برای تصور کردن بهم بدی Assistant:","completion":"متوجه شدم. برای شروع، شما می‌توانید جستجوی تصاویر خون آشام‌ها را در اینترنت انجام دهید. همچنین می‌توانید به فروشگاه‌های مخصوص محصولات مرتبط با فیلم‌ها یا سریال‌های خون آشام مراجعه کرده و محصولاتی مانند عکس‌ها، تیشرت‌ها یا اسباب بازی مناسب را برای شیفت خود تهیه کنید. آیا من می‌توانم در مورد موارد دیگری هم به شما کمک کنم؟"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Эти отношения охватывают широкий спектр областей, включая торговлю, безопасность, климат и энергетику. Каждая из этих стран имеет уникальные отношения с ЕС, отражающие исторические, геополитические и экономические связи. # Соединенные Штаты Америки Отношения между ЕС и США традиционно являются одними из самых значимых, поскольку они представляют собой две крупнейшие экономики мира. Они в основном сосредоточены на торговле и инвестициях, безопасности и сотрудничестве в области политики. После определенного охлаждения отношений во время президентства Дональда Трампа, особенно касательно торговых вопросов и соглашений по климату, с приходом к власти Джо Байдена наблюдается возобновление сотрудничества, особенно в области борьбы с изменением климата и налаживании международной безопасности. # Канада ЕС и Канада имеют крепкие отношения, основанные на общих ценностях и сильных экономических связях. В 2017 году вступило в силу всеобъемлющее экономическое и торговое соглашение (CETA), которое углубило торговые отношения и облегчило движение товаров, услуг и инвестиций между сторонами. Канада и ЕС также сотрудничают в международных форумах, например, по вопросам изменения климата и мировой безопасности. # Великобритания Отношения между ЕС и Великобританией претерпели значительные изменения после Brexit. С момента формального выхода Великобритании из ЕС 31 января 2020 года, отношения строятся на основании соглашения о торговле и сотрудничестве, подписанного в декабре 2020 года. Это соглашение регулирует множество аспектов отношений, включая торговлю товарами и услугами, правила конкуренции, рыболовство и вопросы безопасности. Однако взаимодействие по-прежнему осложнено разногласиями во многих вопросах, включая реализацию Североирландского протокола. # Норвегия Норвегия не является членом ЕС, но тесно с ним сотрудничает, будучи членом Европейской экономической зоны (ЕЭЗ). Это позволяет Норвегии участвовать во внутреннем рынке ЕС без полного членства в Союзе. Сотрудничество охватывает широкий спектр областей, включая экономику, торговлю, права человека, образование и исследования. Норвегия также активно участвует в Шенгенском соглашении, что позволяет свободное передвижение людей между её границами и государствами-членами ЕС.

It was a day like any other in the peaceful habitation of Hobbiton, yet Frodo had his own peculiar way to greet the sunrise. With the birds chirping melodies of the new day, Frodo stretched languidly, a hobbit of small stature but nimble as a cat. His hair was a tangle of curly locks, framing a face ever curious and alive with the spark of adventure. As was his custom, Frodo began his day not with the brewing of tea nor the frying of eggs, but with a meticulous ritual that had become the talk among the hobbit-folk, though few had ever glimpsed it in full. He wove through his hobbit-hole with the grace of a dancer, gathering what he needed: a towel softer than the down of ducks, a bar of soap made from the most fragrant of lavender harvested directly from Sam’s garden, and not forgetting a smile that hinted at the mischief brewing. Humming a tune that harked back to elvish lore, Frodo made his way to the backyard, where his pride and jewel lay - a swimming pond connected to a nearby river, a mirror reflecting the emerald greens and the sky’s infinite blue. Yet, before the pleasure, came the duty. Frodo, dedicated to keeping this refuge as pristine as the halls of Rivendell, had devised a method to ensure the waters were ever clear, ever inviting. As if performing a ritual of old, Frodo disrobed, his physique, though not imposing, was a testament to the resilience and tenacity of hobbits. Defined more by the adventures traversed than by any labor of the gym, his form moved with ease and purpose. With the same audacity that carried him through Middle-earth, Frodo stepped into the water, his disposition light, his heart set on the task at hand. The tranquility of the moment, the purity of the morning air, culminated in Frodo taking a deep breath, and with a mischievous glint in his eye, he allowed nature to take its course. A sound erupted, mirthful and unabashed, a declaration of the morning's ease and a testament to Frodo’s comfort in his own skin. The waters around him stirred, not in repulsion, but as if to celebrate the simplicity and joy of living so freely. And then, something remarkable happened. The fish, those aquatic residents of his pond, seemed to respond in kind, leaping and frolicking as if joining in on a joke shared by all of nature. Frodo, ever the opportunist, saw the chance not only for a swim but for a feast. With skill honed by countless mornings like these, he gathered the fish, now more participants in his ritual than victims of circumstance. Wading back to shore, Frodo couldn't help but laugh, a sound clear and genuine, blending with the morning as if it belonged to the dawn. He wrapped himself in the towel, the fish secured for dinner, a meal that would be shared in good company, each bite flavored not only by herbs but by the joy of a moment entirely his own. As Frodo dressed and set about his day, the pond once again calm, his heart was light, his spirit enriched by the simplicity of his morning ritual. In The Shire, where the extraordinary often wore the guise of the mundane, Frodo Baggins had found a way to marry adventure with the day-to-day, proving, once again, that even in the smallest acts, there can be a magic entirely unexpected and wholly delightful."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic Lord of the Rings story with Frodo Baggins waking up and doing his morning ritual.

He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and made his way to the kitchen to start his morning ritual. After a hearty breakfast of eggs and bacon, Frodo decided it was time to tackle his daily task of clearing out his swimming pond. As he made his way outside, the birds chirped and the sun beat down on his curly hair. He walked over to the pond, a mischievous glint in his eye as he surveyed the water. With a mischievous grin, Frodo stripped down to his birthday suit, revealing a physique that would make even the elves jealous. His tight hobbit buttocks glistened in the sunlight as he waded into the water, feeling the cool embrace of the pond on his skin. Taking a deep breath, Frodo let out a humongous and smelly fart into the water, the bubbles rising to the surface as he visibly sighed in relief. The fish, caught off guard by the stench, floated to the top of the water, their bellies up as they succumbed to the foul odor. Frodo chuckled to himself as he gathered up the fish, knowing that they would make a delicious dinner later that evening. He made his way back to his hobbit hole, a victorious smirk on his face as he went about preparing his catch for dinner. As the sun began to set, Frodo sat down to a feast fit for a king, the fish cooked to perfection and served alongside a side of roasted vegetables. He raised a glass of ale in a toast to himself, laughing at the absurdity of his morning ritual and the lengths he would go to in order to have a quiet swim in his pond. And as the stars twinkled in the night sky, Frodo settled in for a well-deserved rest, content in the knowledge that his pond was clean and ready for another day of swimming. The adventures of the day may be over, but for Frodo Baggins, the simple pleasures of hobbit life were all he needed to keep him happy."},{"prompt":"Write a hilarious script where the Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic Scrappy-Doo have a funny chat behind the scenes and react to hilarious bad translations that i read out, laughing and hilariously question and hilariously roast errors and inconsistencies that make no sense in the bad translations and the names of stuff with occasional funny quotes mocking a situation, in my prompt in a hilarious comedy 17+ way: (The gang constantly imagine and make silly quotes to mock the bad translations) Reader: Ok gang get this… * I start reading the whole thing, one sentence at a time to the gang, who let me lay it on.

Это означает, что, несмотря на то что Норвегия не участвует в принятии решений ЕС, она тесно связана с ЕС через обширное экономическое и политическое сотрудничество. # Европейское экономическое пространство (ЕЭП) Соглашение о ЕЭП, которое вступило в силу в 1994 году, позволяет Норвегии участвовать в едином рынке ЕС без полного членства в ЕС. Это означает, что Норвегия применяет многие правила ЕС, связанные с единым рынком, включая свободное передвижение товаров, услуг, капитала и рабочей силы. Взамен, Норвегия должна вносить финансовый вклад в социальное и экономическое развитие менее богатых регионов ЕС. # Шенгенская зона Норвегия также является частью Шенгенской зоны, что означает отсутствие паспортного контроля на границах с другими странами Шенгенской зоны. Это упрощает путешествия для граждан Норвегии и других членов Шенгенской зоны. # Сотрудничество в других областях Кроме экономических отношений, Норвегия и ЕС тесно сотрудничают в таких областях, как исследования и разработки, образование (через программу Erasmus+), социальная политика, окружающая среда и борьба с изменением климата, а также в области юстиции и внутренних дел. # Оборона и безопасность Хотя ЕС разрабатывает собственную политику в области обороны и безопасности, Норвегия активно участвует в различных многосторонних миссиях и операциях под эгидой НАТО и ООН. Такое сотрудничество способствует общей безопасности европейских государств. # Будущее отношений Всегда возможны изменения в отношениях между Норвегией и ЕС. Например, политические решения, изменяющиеся экономические условия или общественное мнение в Норвегии могут повлиять на будущее сотрудничество между Норвегией и ЕС. В настоящее время однако нет никаких признаков того, что Норвегия стремится к полноправному членству в ЕС, и обе стороны кажутся довольными существующим соглашением, основанным на ЕЭП. В целом, отношения между Норвегией и ЕС можно охарактеризовать как тесные и взаимовыгодные, с обширным сотрудничеством во многих ключевых областях."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic Lord of the Rings story with Frodo Baggins waking up and doing his morning ritual.

He collects all the fish that went belly-up from the stench to cook for dinner.","completion":"In the heart of the Shire, under the golden gleam of a newly risen sun, Frodo Baggins stirred awake with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for Second Breakfast or an unexpected jaunt through the Green Dragon's beer cellars. Today, however, was to be a day of aquatic adventure, albeit of a more personal and peculiar nature, nestled within the tranquil confines of his own backyard. Rising from his bed with the grace of an elvish dancer lightly smudged with Hobbit-sized snores, Frodo embarked on his morning rituals. He combed his curly locks with the care of a bard tuning his lute, and his teeth shone with a brightness that could challenge even the Phial of Galadriel after a meticulous scrubbing. Breakfast was a hearty affair, involving a stack of pancakes that seemed to mimic the undulating hills of the Shire itself, drenched in a syrup as golden as the treasure troves of Erebor. Thus fortified, Frodo skipped with a peculiar shimmy toward his most cherished morning activity: making his swimming pond a fish-free sanctuary. The pond, a crystalline jewel connected to a nearby lazy river, awaited his tender administration. Today, though, the ritual would take a turn for the comedic, in a manner most unexpected. Stripping down with a nonchalance that could only be borne of absolute privacy (and perhaps a tinge of Hobbit recklessness), Frodo admired his own reflection in the water. “Not bad, Mr. Baggins,” he mused to himself, “for a hobbit of the Shire, you’ve kept quite the figure.” Indeed, his form was that of a Hobbit in his prime: sturdy legs perfect for both sprinting and swimming, a physique that spoke of many an adventure (and perhaps even more plentiful meals), and a backside as perky as the finest apples in Farmer Maggot’s orchard. Wading into the pond with a determination that belied the comic turn his morning was about to take, Frodo prepared himself for the task at hand. Yet, amid the tranquility of his natural bath, nature demanded a tribute of its own. Letting out a sigh of relief, Frodo inadvertently loosed a fart of such grandeur and malodorous might, it seemed to summon the very spirits of wind and water in defense. The water around him rippled with the force of it, carrying the dreaded stench to the furthest reaches of his pond. And thus, the fish, those unwitting inhabitants of Frodo’s personal bathing sanctum, found themselves facing an assault unlike any orcish menace or dark sorcery. One by one, they succumbed, floating to the surface in a display of belly-up bewilderment, victims to the most unexpected weapon in the Shire. Gathering the vanquished fish with a mixture of amusement and slight embarrassment, Frodo couldn’t help but chuckle at the turn of events. “Well,” he thought, “at least dinner is taken care of.” And so, with a booty of fish in hand and the pond now perfectly primed for a hobbit's leisurely swim, Frodo Baggins reclaimed his day, proving yet again that even the smallest person (or the most unexpected of moments) can alter the course of the future. Of course, tales of the day's exploits would remain strictly between Frodo and the pond, for some adventures, no matter how comedic, are best left to the imaginations of those who live them. And as for the fishes of the Shire, they learned to respect the formidable power of a Hobbit's breakfast and the mysterious depths from whence it came."},{"prompt":"Hilariously badly translate my text in these different styles: Misheard, Opposite, Taken out of context and very hilarious list of stuff in this quote that makes no sense by questioning bits in the original text: (add the original text at the beginning though) \\"Hey, you!

First, you will watch four videos. There are videos that show patients with each type of aphasia we are covering in this class: Broca's and Wernicke's. While watching the videos, you should list the symptoms that you see. Look for symptoms that match and/or are different from the description that we discussed for each type of aphasia. As you will see, there is great variability in symptoms between patients and, in the case of Sarah (Broca's example), the progress made through therapy. Brain damage is messy and no two patients are the same! IMPORTANT: For each symptom that you list, you must identify the video (1, 2, 3, or 4) that it came from and the approximate time in the video where you saw it. This is important because you will each revisit the examples from your classmates and indicate if you agree or disagree with their assessment of that symptom or behavior. If you organize your notes while watching, this will help you craft your post! Wernicke's Videos: 1. Man: https://youtu.be/3oef68YabD0Links to an external site. 2. Woman: https://youtu.be/dKTdMV6cOZwLinks to an external site. Broca's Videos: 3. Sarah Scott (initial 9 month video--watch the first 5 mins): https://youtu.be/1aplTvEQ6ewLinks to an external site. 4.

What was particularly interesting or amazing (or even disappointing) about her recovery from her stroke?","completion":"I'm sorry, but I can't directly observe videos or content from the provided links. However, I can help you understand how you might approach analyzing these videos according to your assignment requirements. Here's a generic example of how you can structure your post: # Wernicke's Aphasia Videos: 1. **[Video 1, 00:45]** - The patient exhibits fluent but nonsensical speech. This behavior aligns with Wernicke's aphasia, where individuals often speak in long sentences with no meaning, adding unnecessary words, and even creating new words. - This matches the characteristics of Wernicke's aphasia discussed in our lectures, where patients have fluent but largely meaningless speech. 2. **[Video 2, 01:30]** - The patient shows difficulty in understanding simple questions. She responds to questions with unrelated answers, indicating an impairment in auditory verbal comprehension. - This is a hallmark symptom of Wernicke's aphasia, as covered in the lecture slides. # Broca's Aphasia Videos: 1. **[Video 3, 02:15]** - Sarah exhibits noticeably effortful speech. She speaks in short, broken sentences, and seems to struggle finding the right words, which is indicative of non-fluent aphasia. - This observation matches the lecture description of Broca's aphasia, emphasizing the struggle with producing speech despite understanding language. 2. **[Video 4, 12:00]** - Improvement in Sarah’s condition is evident. She strings longer sentences together, although with noticeable effort and some grammatical errors. This shows some recovery of her expressive language abilities over time. - This behavior demonstrates the variability in recovery among patients with Broca's aphasia, consistent with the notion that with therapy and time, some improvement is possible. # Reflection: Observing Sarah's journey from her initial recovery at 9 months to her update 13 years later is profoundly inspiring. The notable improvement in her ability to communicate highlights the potential for positive outcomes despite the severe impact of a stroke. It's particularly interesting to see how Sarah adapts to her condition and develops strategies to aid her communication, reflecting the brain's remarkable ability to recover and reorganize post-injury. --- Note: This example follows the structure you provided but is fabricated for illustrative purposes.

En los últimos años su negocio ha tenido un crecimiento exponencial, ya que ha registrado un sostenido crecimiento de las ventas en sus dos unidades de negocio: comercialización de equipos y maquinaria vial y capacitación en uso de los mismos. Debido a esto, en el año 2020, decidió formar una S.A.S (CONS-VIAL S.A.S) junto a cinco socios, siendo el Sr. López, el socio administrador. La S.A.S posee emprendimientos en tres provincias distintas (Córdoba, Santa Fe y La Pampa), pero la sede de sus negocios se encuentra en su ciudad natal. El incremento en la actividad económica de la empresa le ha exigido inversiones adicionales en capital de trabajo (stock de insumos importados y nacionales, y financiamiento a distribuidores) y estructura de activos fijos (instalaciones y puntos de ventas/capacitaciones). La compañía ha financiado sus inversiones con deuda de corto y mediano plazo. En el último semestre, el mercado en donde se comercializan los equipos viales que importa la empresa, tuvo un estancamiento debido a la baja en el consumo y la crisis económica general, que impactó negativamente en las ventas. Simultáneamente, las principales variables macroeconómicas comenzaron un ciclo de volatilidad que llevó a una devaluación y, por lo tanto, una disparada en los costos de reposición de la mercadería comercializada. El resultado no fue difícil de proyectar: en una actividad con altos costos fijos en infraestructura y carga laboral, además de la exposición al riesgo cambiario por la mercadería importada y en una empresa altamente endeudada, la combinación de caída de ventas y aumento del costo financiero es el pasaje a la zona de pérdidas. La crisis del último año ha llevado a un atraso generalizado en los pagos de la empresa del señor López, llegando incluso en los últimos tres meses a suspender trabajadores para hacer frente a la crisis. Actualmente, hay más de treinta acreedores que llevan más de seis meses de boletas impagas. Además, se adeudan aportes patronales a la Seguridad Social, IVA, ingresos brutos provinciales, boletas de servicios públicos, alquileres y salarios laborales.

Эстония и Норвегия регулярно проводят совместные военные учения и координируют свои действия в рамках коллективной обороны НАТО. Кроме того, Норвегия является значимым донором для Эстонии через различные финансовые инструменты Норвежского и ЭЕА грантов, направленных на сокращение социально-экономических различий в Европейском экономическом пространстве и поддержку в решении различных социальных, экологических и культурных вопросов.

In the periodic table, as you move down a group, elements exhibit an increase in metallic character. This is due to a variety of factors like the increasing atomic size, the decrease in ionization energy, and the increasing ease with which these atoms can lose their outer electrons to form positive ions. Hydrogen, although placed in Group 1, is a nonmetal and exhibits very different chemical behavior compared to lithium and other alkali metals due to its unique position in the periodic table and its distinct electron configuration. Lithium, being an actual metal, has more pronounced metallic properties like higher reactivity under standard conditions when compared to hydrogen. The other options are less directly relevant or incorrect in explaining the difference in reactivity between hydrogen and lithium: - The ionization energy actually decreases going down a group, which does contribute to the increasing metallic character but is not the primary reason for the difference in behavior between hydrogen and lithium. - Electron affinity does not generally increase in a simple predictable manner going down a group and is not the main reason for the difference in reactivity between H and Li. - While there is a difference in atomic radii between hydrogen and lithium, the key factor is not the radii per se but how the increasing metallic character affects reactivity and other chemical properties."},{"prompt":"Перепишите на русском языке предоставленный текст, сохраняя его общий смысл и структуру, но используя: Разнообразную лексику, Перефразирование и переформулирование предложений, Изменение порядка слов и структуры предложений, Улучшение читабельности и удобочитаемости, Сохранение точности и ясности исходного текста.

We even have a round up of the best optical illusions around. And after all the time we've spent trying to get our heads around them, it comes as some solace that mice are also fooled by such visual trickery. Why wouldn't they be?, You may ask. But scientists are excited by the discovery because it could open up new ways to research perception. The new research published in Nature specifically studied a type of optical illusion that involves what's called neon colour spreading. Falling into the category known as transparency effects, this kind of illusion is created by fluid borders between the edges of a colored object and the background when surrounded by black lines. Colour appears to spread from the coloured lines and create the illusion of an object that isn't there. The new research used an innovative combination of electrophysiology and optogenetics to explore how different levels of neurons process optical illusions in mice in order to settle a debate in neuroscience about which neurons in the brain are responsible for the perception of brightness. After a visual stimulus reaches the eye, it’s taken to the brain by nerves and received by layers of neurons called V1, V2 etc. V1 is the first and most basic layer, and V2 and above are considered higher layers. By studying reactions to neon colour spreading optical illusions in mice, researchers found that V1 neurons respond to both illusory and non-illusory stimuli, while V2 neurons intensify the illusion by modulating V1 activity. This proves that that V2 neurons play a role in the perception of brightness. The studies authors suggest the findings open new possibilities for using animal models to investigate neural mechanisms of perception and consciousness in cases where human studies can't be conducted.

Проведя массу времени, пытаясь понять их суть, было обнадеживающе узнать, что даже мыши поддаются такому зрительному обману. Казалось бы, почему бы и нет? Однако для ученых это открытие стало причиной волнения, ведь оно открывает новые перспективы для изучения восприятия. Недавнее исследование, опубликованное в журнале Nature, было посвящено оптической иллюзии, известной как распространение неонового цвета. Этот тип иллюзии, относящийся к категории эффектов прозрачности, создается за счет плавных переходов между краями цветного объекта и фоном, окруженными черными линиями. Цвет кажется распространяющимся из цветных линий и создает иллюзию несуществующего объекта. В исследовании с применением передовых методов электрофизиологии и оптогенетики было исследовано, как различные уровни нейронов в мозге мышей обрабатывают оптические иллюзии. Это позволило разрешить долгий спор в нейронауке о том, какие нейроны отвечают за восприятие яркости. После того как визуальный стимул достигает глаза, он передается в мозг через нервы к слоям нейронов, обозначаемым как V1, V2 и так далее. V1 является первым и наиболее базовым слоем, а V2 и выше - более высокими слоями. Анализируя реакции мышей на иллюзии распространения неонового цвета, исследователи выявили, что нейроны V1 реагируют как на иллюзорные, так и на неиллюзорные стимулы, тогда как нейроны V2 усиливают иллюзию, модулируя активность V1. Это доказывает роль нейронов V2 в восприятии яркости. Авторы исследования предполагают, что эти результаты открывают новые возможности для использования животных моделей при изучении нейронных механизмов восприятия и сознания в случаях, когда проведение исследований на людях невозможно. Для тех, кто интересуется зрительными обманами, предлагаем ознакомиться с новой оптической иллюзией, которую ученые до сих пор не могут объяснить.

Ocorrida em 1974, esta revolução foi liderada por militares que se opunham à ditadura do Estado Novo, implementada por António de Oliveira Salazar e continuada por Marcelo Caetano após 1968. Esta insurreição militar conseguiu derrubar o regime sem recorrer a uma violência significativa, transformando-se num golpe de Estado praticamente incruento. A revolução iniciou-se na madrugada do dia 25 de Abril, tendo como principal objetivo derrubar o regime ditatorial e impulsionar profundas reformas políticas, econômicas e sociais, incluindo o fim das guerras coloniais que Portugal travava em África há mais de uma década. O movimento foi rapidamente apoiado pela população, que saiu às ruas para celebrar o fim da ditadura e a esperança de um futuro democrático para Portugal. Nos dois anos seguintes à Revolução dos Cravos, Portugal testemunhou um período de intensa agitação política e social conhecido como Processo Revolucionário em Curso (PREC). Este período foi marcado por várias tentativas de contra-revolução e conflitos entre forças políticas de diferentes espectros. Destaca-se, por exemplo, o episódio do 11 de Março de 1975, uma tentativa falhada de golpe liderada pelo ex-primeiro-ministro Spinola, visando reverter as mudanças revolucionárias e restaurar uma certa ordem conservadora. Posteriormente, a 25 de Novembro de 1975, ocorreu uma tentativa de golpe de Estado liderada por elementos próximos ao Partido Comunista Português e sectores radicais das Forças Armadas. Este evento pretendia consolidar uma revolução socialista em Portugal. Contudo, a ação foi neutralizada por forças moderadas do próprio exército, marcando o fim do PREC e a estabilização progressiva do regime democrático, que culminaria com a aprovação da Constituição da República Portuguesa em 1976, estabelecendo as bases do sistema democrático vigente. Estes eventos, embora turbulentos, foram cruciais na consolidação da democracia em Portugal, após décadas de autoritarismo."},{"prompt":"esclarece, isto tem nexo: Em junho de 1975, uma tentativa de golpe de estado liderada pelo Capitão Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho","completion":"A menção de uma tentativa de golpe de estado liderada pelo Capitão Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho em junho de 1975 não tem nexo com os eventos históricos documentados desse período. Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho foi uma figura proeminente do Movimento das Forças Armadas (MFA) que desempenhou um papel crucial na organização do golpe militar de 25 de Abril de 1974, contribuindo significativamente para o derrube do regime ditatorial do Estado Novo em Portugal. Após a Revolução dos Cravos, Otelo tornou-se uma figura influente no período revolucionário que se seguiu, conhecido como o Processo Revolucionário em Curso (PREC). Durante esse período turbulentos que se seguiu à revolução, Otelo teve um papel importante dentro do Conselho da Revolução e foi encarregado de algumas operações de segurança e ordem pública em Lisboa. Ele também era conhecido pelas suas inclinações para a esquerda radical, o que, por vezes, o colocava em confronto com outras facções dentro do MFA e com outras forças políticas do país. No entanto, não há evidências de Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho liderando uma tentativa de golpe em junho de 1975. De fato, Otelo seria mais tarde uma figura central em outros momentos políticos, especialmente relacionados com as eleições presidenciais e com movimentos radicais nos anos subsequentes, mas não está documentada nenhuma tentativa de golpe de Estado em junho de 1975 sob sua liderança. É importante destacar que o período após a Revolução dos Cravos foi marcado por uma grande efervescência política, com múltiplas tentativas de consolidação de poder e golpes (como em 11 de Março de 1975 e 25 de Novembro de 1975), mas a associação direta de Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho a uma tentativa de golpe em junho de 1975 parece ser um equívoco ou confusão com os eventos ou o seu papel dentro desse contexto revolucionário mais amplo."},{"prompt":"lets say that you are an experienced product designer and product owner write list of skills","completion":"Certainly, as an experienced product designer and product owner, you need a diverse skill set that spans across technical, business, and interpersonal domains.

In fact, bronchiectasis can affect any part of the lung, and its distribution is influenced by the underlying cause, the patient's history of infections, and predisposing conditions. However, there are anatomical and physiological reasons why certain patterns of lung involvement are observed in various respiratory conditions, not specifically bronchiectasis. Considering lung diseases in general, the right lower lobe is often more commonly affected in certain conditions, such as aspiration pneumonia. This is due to the anatomy of the bronchial tree; the right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical than the left, making it more likely for aspirated material to enter the right lung, particularly the right lower lobe. In bronchiectasis, the distribution within the lungs can be variable and is often bilaterally symmetrical but can preferentially affect certain lobes depending on the etiology. For instance, post-infectious bronchiectasis may more likely involve the lobes that were most affected by the initial infection. Cystic fibrosis, a common cause of bronchiectasis, typically involves the upper lobes more but can affect all lobes of the lung. The misconception about involvement in bronchiectasis might arise from specific case studies or clinical observations where certain patterns are noted due to the predominant causes of bronchiectasis in a particular population. For instance, if a population has a high rate of tuberculosis or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections that preferentially affect the lower lobes of the lung, this may lead to a mistaken belief about a universal pattern of lobar involvement in bronchiectasis. Furthermore, anatomical differences and variations in the immune response or mucociliary clearance mechanisms might influence the distribution of lung damage in bronchiectasis among different individuals. However, the statement as it stands does not reflect a well-established principle or pattern in the pathology of bronchiectasis. Clinical evidence supports that bronchiectasis can be widespread and variable in its distribution."},{"prompt":"Clinical manifestation :The onset is mostly in childhood whereas symptoms generally appear in the second or third decade of life .The disease is more common in females .

Others present with repeated RT infection .,others develop osteo arthropathy & finger clubbing which will resolve with treatment .","completion":"The clinical manifestations you've outlined are characteristic of bronchiectasis, a chronic lung condition that involves permanent dilation and damage to the airways or bronchi. This condition leads to a wide range of symptoms and complications, varying in severity among individuals. Let's break down the key points mentioned: 1. **Onset and Diagnosis Age**: While bronchiectasis can have its onset in childhood, often due to congenital conditions (like cystic fibrosis), primary immune deficiencies, or severe lung infections, the symptoms frequently become more noticeable or are diagnosed in adulthood, particularly in the second or third decade of life. This delay could be due to the progressive nature of the condition or the onset of more chronic or severe symptoms that lead to investigation and diagnosis. 2. **Gender Prevalence**: Some literature suggests that bronchiectasis may be more common in females, although this might vary depending on the population and underlying causes. For instance, bronchiectasis related to autoimmune diseases, which are more prevalent in females, could contribute to this observation. 3. **Major Symptoms**: - **Chronic cough and sputum production**: A hallmark of bronchiectasis is a chronic, daily cough that is often productive of copious amounts of purulent sputum. The production of sputum, especially in the mornings, can be a significant feature of the disease. - **Fetor oris (bad breath)**: This can be due to the chronic infection and the presence of bacteria in the lungs, which can affect the breath's smell. 4. **Hemoptysis**: Up to 50% of patients may experience hemoptysis (coughing up blood), which can range from small streaks of blood to significant bleeding. Hemoptysis occurs due to the chronic inflammation and infection in the airways leading to the development of fragile blood vessels that can easily bleed. 5. **Recurrent Respiratory Infections**: Patients with bronchiectasis are prone to recurrent respiratory tract infections, which can exacerbate symptoms and lead to further lung damage. 6. **Osteoarthropathy and Clubbing**: Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy and digital clubbing are less common but notable features that can develop in chronic lung diseases such as bronchiectasis. They reflect chronic hypoxia and systemic inflammation. Clubbing involves the enlargement of the fingertips, and its presence is a sign of advanced disease. Such systemic manifestations may partially resolve with effective management of the lung condition and improvement in oxygenation. The management of bronchiectasis includes addressing the underlying cause (if identified), improving airway clearance, controlling infections with antibiotics, and in some cases, surgery for localized disease. Management is tailored to the severity of the disease, the frequency of exacerbations, and the presence of comorbidities. Early diagnosis and prompt management are critical in improving quality of life for patients with bronchiectasis and in preventing disease progression."},{"prompt":"Lung Abscess It is a localized area of suppuration and cavitations in the lung. It includes TB , mycotic or parasitic cavitations ,bronchiectasis ,ruptured infected hydatid cyst , even pulmonary infarction with abscess formation & cavitating tumors...explain and give examples to each ddx ,number these tumours","completion":"Lung abscesses are indeed localized areas of pus formation and tissue necrosis within the lung, leading to cavity formation. They can arise from various causes, including infectious and non-infectious conditions. Below, we'll expand on some of the differentials mentioned, providing examples where relevant: 1. **Tuberculosis (TB):** This is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Pulmonary TB is the most common form, and it can lead to cavity formation in the lungs due to the necrosis of lung tissue. These cavities may contain TB bacteria and can be a source of transmission. TB remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in areas with high rates of HIV or limited access to healthcare. 2. **Mycotic (Fungal) Infections:** Fungal lung infections can lead to abscess formation, especially in immunocompromised patients. Examples include: - **Aspergillosis,** caused by Aspergillus species, which can lead to aspergilloma (fungus ball) formation within pre-existing lung cavities. - **Histoplasmosis,** caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, more common in certain geographic regions like the central and eastern United States. It can cause cavitary lung disease, especially in people with weakened immune systems. 3. **Parasitic Infections:** Certain parasites can lead to lung abscesses or cavitary lung disease. Examples include: - **Echinococcosis (Hydatid disease),** caused by the Echinococcus granulosus worm. A hydatid cyst can form in the lungs and, if it ruptures, can lead to the development of a lung abscess. - **Paragonimiasis,** caused by the lung fluke Paragonimus, is a parasitic infection where adult flukes inhabit the lungs, leading to abscess formation and cavitation. 4. **Bronchiectasis:** This is a chronic condition where the airways are permanently dilated and can become infected and filled with pus, potentially leading to abscess formation, particularly if the infection becomes localized and intense. 5. **Ruptured Infected Hydatid Cyst:** As mentioned under parasitic infections, the rupture of a hydatid cyst in the lung can lead to acute lung abscess formation, an emergency requiring prompt medical attention. 6. **Pulmonary Infarction with Abscess Formation:** Pulmonary infarction occurs when a portion of lung tissue dies due to a lack of blood flow, usually because of a blood clot (pulmonary embolism). Secondary infection of this necrotic tissue can lead to abscess formation. 7. **Cavitating Tumors:** Certain lung cancers can cavitate, meaning they form hollow spaces within the tumor mass, which can become infected and abscessed. Examples include: - **Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung:** More likely to cavitate than other types of lung cancer due to its necrotic nature. - **Post-obstructive Pneumonia:** Can occur in any lung tumor that obstructs an airway, leading to infection and possible abscess formation distal to the obstruction. It's crucial to correctly identify the underlying cause of a lung abscess because the treatment can vary significantly depending on the etiology (from antibiotics and antifungals to surgical intervention). Diagnostic methods include chest imaging (X-rays, CT scans) and microbiological studies of sputum or aspirated abscess material."},{"prompt":"Superior sulcus tumor of Pancoast It is a low grade epidermoid carcinoma that grows slowly and metastasize late, infiltrates and involves lower root of Brachial plexus, intercostal nerves , Cervical sympathetic nerves & eroding the upper ribs ,producing pain in the shoulder & Horner's syndrome .explain more and More broadly","completion":"A Superior Sulcus tumor, also known as a Pancoast tumor, represents a subset of lung cancers that begin at the apex (top) of the lung and extend toward the structures nearby, such as the chest wall and the top ribs. These tumors are characterized by their unique location rather than their histological subtype, although the majority are indeed non-small cell lung cancers, often of the squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma types. The characterization of these tumors as \\"low-grade epidermoid carcinoma that grows slowly and metastasizes late\\" can be misleading, as the behavior of the tumor greatly depends on its cell type, and lung cancers, in general, can be quite aggressive. Clinical Presentation and Symptoms: Due to their unique location at the top of the lung, Pancoast tumors cause symptoms different from other types of lung cancer. These include: 1. **Shoulder Pain:** The tumor's invasion of nearby structures like the lower roots of the brachial plexus leads to severe shoulder pain, which can radiate down the arm. 2. **Horner's Syndrome:** Involvement of the cervical sympathetic ganglion (sympathetic chain) can result in Horner's syndrome, characterized by ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), miosis (constriction of the pupil), anhidrosis (lack of sweating), and enophthalmos (sunken appearance of the eyeball). 3. **Pain in the Arm:** The invasion of the brachial plexus and intercostal nerves can cause pain along the inner aspects of the arm, and patients may also experience weakness, atrophy, and sensory loss. 4. **Invasion of Chest Wall and Spine:** As the tumor progresses, it may erode into the upper ribs and even into the spine, causing further pain and potentially compromising the structure of the bony thorax. Diagnosis: Diagnosing a Pancoast tumor involves a combination of clinical evaluation and imaging studies, including chest X-rays and, more definitively, CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to assess the extent of the tumor and its involvement with surrounding structures. A biopsy is essential for confirming the diagnosis and determining the histological type of the cancer, which is critical for deciding on the appropriate treatment strategy. Treatment: The treatment of Pancoast tumors has evolved significantly and often involves a multimodal approach. This can include: 1. **Surgery:** The mainstay of treatment for tumors that have not extensively invaded surrounding structures and do not have distant metastases. The surgery can be complex due to the tumor's location near vital structures. 2. **Radiation Therapy:** Often used preoperatively to reduce the size of the tumor, making surgery more feasible, or postoperatively to eliminate residual disease. It's also a primary treatment modality when patients are not surgical candidates. 3. **Chemotherapy:** Used in combination with radiation therapy, either as part of a curative treatment plan with surgery or for palliative care in advanced disease stages. 4. **Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy:** For some patients, especially those with specific genetic mutations or markers, targeted therapies or immunotherapy might be effective options. Prognosis: The prognosis for patients with Pancoast tumors varies depending on several factors, including the tumor's stage at diagnosis, the patient's overall health, and the tumor's response to treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for improving outcomes, but due to the tumor's aggressive nature and complex location, managing Pancoast tumors remains challenging."},{"prompt":"in chest tube insertion which better to insert it when the patient inhale or exhale and why?","completion":"The timing of chest tube insertion, whether during inhalation or exhalation, is a point of practical consideration to optimize safety and effectiveness. The generally recommended technique is to insert the chest tube during exhalation (or at the end of exhalation when the patient is spontaneously breathing). This recommendation is based on the following rationale: # During Exhalation: 1. **Decreased Risk of Lung Injury:** During exhalation, the lungs are at a smaller volume, which reduces the risk of inadvertently puncturing the lung with the chest tube, especially in cases where the lung is partially collapsed due to pneumothorax or another pathology. 2. **Larger Pleural Space:** As the lung volume decreases, the potential space within the pleural cavity where the chest tube is intended to go becomes relatively larger. This can make placement easier and reduce the risk of damaging surrounding tissues. 3. **Positive Pressure Ventilation:** For patients on positive pressure ventilation (such as those undergoing mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting), exhalation corresponds to a phase of lower intrathoracic pressure compared to inhalation. Inserting the chest tube during this phase can be safer, as the positive pressure from the ventilator helps keep the space open and may decrease the risk of lung injury. # Special Circumstances: - **Mechanically Ventilated Patients:** In patients receiving mechanical ventilation, the dynamics change. These patients often have positive pressure applied to their airways throughout the breathing cycle, affecting the pleural space differently. Coordination with respiratory therapists and anesthesiologists is crucial to ensure the chest tube is inserted safely, potentially timing the insertion with the ventilatory cycle to minimize complications. - **Technique Variation:** Some clinicians may adjust their technique based on the specific condition being treated (e.g., pneumothorax vs. pleural effusion) or the patient's ventilatory status (spontaneously breathing vs. mechanically ventilated). # Conclusion: In practice, the key is ensuring the pleural space is as accessible as possible while minimizing the risk of injuring the lung or other structures. For spontaneously breathing patients, performing the procedure at the end of a natural exhalation is often advised. However, patient positioning, the specifics of the clinical situation, and the experience of the clinician also play significant roles in the safe and effective insertion of a chest tube. Always, the procedure should be performed under sterile conditions, with real-time imaging guidance (like ultrasound) when available, to reduce risks and improve accuracy."},{"prompt":"Is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space from excessive transudation or exudation of the interstitial fluid from the pleural surface.

The presentation and management of pleural effusion broadly depend on the etiology, volume, and the characteristics of the effusion itself. Here's a more structured explanation incorporating the details provided: # Classification Based on Protein Content 1. **Transudates** are effusions with a protein content of less than 3g%. These typically occur due to an imbalance in the hydrostatic and oncotic pressures across the pleural membrane without an underlying pleural disease. Common causes include: - Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) - Cirrhosis - Nephrotic Syndrome 2. **Exudates** have a protein content of more than 3g%. These are usually due to inflammation, infection, or malignancy affecting the pleural surfaces directly, leading to increased capillary permeability and the leakage of protein-rich fluid. Causes include: - Malignancy (e.g., lung cancer, metastatic cancer) - Infections (e.g., bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis) - Pulmonary Embolism - Autoimmune Diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) # Clinical Presentation Patients with pleural effusion may present with: - **Dyspnea** (shortness of breath) due to the reduced lung volume and compromised respiratory mechanics. - **Pleuritic Chest Pain** which intensifies with coughing or deep breathing, especially if the effusion is due to inflammation or infection of the pleura. # Radiological Findings A **concave meniscus sign** is a classic radiographic feature of pleural effusion seen on lateral chest radiographs, indicating the presence of fluid in the pleural space. Imaging modalities like chest ultrasound or CT scans can further characterize the effusion (e.g., volume, loculated versus free-flowing). # Management Approaches 1. **Thoracentesis (Aspiration):** This is both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure where fluid is aspirated from the pleural space. It can provide immediate relief from dyspnea and is used to analyze the fluid to help determine the underlying cause (transudative vs. exudative). 2. **Tube Thoracostomy:** For large or complicated effusions (e.g., empyema), a chest drain is inserted to continuously drain the fluid over several days, allowing re-expansion of the lung and resolution of the infection or inflammation. 3. **Chemical Pleurodesis:** This involves the instillation of a sclerosing agent into the pleural space, causing the pleural surfaces to adhere to each other, thus preventing the re-accumulation of fluid. This is typically reserved for recurrent effusions, particularly those due to malignancy. 4. **Pleurectomy:** A surgical procedure to remove parts of the pleura. It might be considered in severe, recurrent cases where other treatments have failed or as part of the treatment for conditions like mesothelioma. # Conclusion The treatment and prognosis of pleural effusion significantly depend on addressing the underlying cause. Management might range from conservative approaches, such as treating heart failure or kidney disease, to more invasive procedures in the case of malignant effusions or complicated infections. The choice of treatment is guided by the effusion's characteristics (transudate versus exudate), underlying cause, size of the effusion, and the patient's overall health status."},{"prompt":"explain mechanisms of trauma","completion":"Trauma refers to injuries caused by an external force that can range from minor to life-threatening. These injuries can result from various incidents, including accidents, falls, violence, and natural disasters. The mechanisms of trauma are fundamentally categorized based on the type of force applied to the body and can broadly be classified into blunt or penetrating trauma, with a special category for burns. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for diagnosing and managing traumatic injuries effectively. # 1. Blunt Trauma Blunt trauma occurs when a force impacts the body but does not penetrate the skin. The force spreads over a larger area, and while there may be no external wounds, significant internal injuries can occur. Common causes include vehicle accidents, falls, and physical assaults with objects that do not break the skin. - **Deceleration Injuries**: These happen when a moving body comes to a sudden stop, causing internal organs to continue moving forward, which can lead to tearing, shearing, or rupture. For instance, a rapid deceleration during a vehicle collision can cause aortic rupture. - **Compression Injuries**: Result from a high-impact force that compresses body parts between two objects. This can lead to crush injuries, fractures, and internal organ damage. - **Shear Injuries**: Occur when different layers or parts of the body are forced in opposite directions. Common in car accidents, they can result in organ lacerations or traumatic brain injuries due to the brain moving within the skull. # 2. Penetrating Trauma In penetrating trauma, an object breaks the skin and enters the body, creating an open wound. The severity depends on the velocity of the object, its path through the body, and the energy transmitted to the tissues. - **Low-Velocity Injuries**: Typically caused by knives or other sharp objects moving at low speed. The damage is usually limited to the direct path of the object. - **High-Velocity Injuries**: Caused by bullets or shrapnel from explosions, these injuries can cause extensive damage as the high-speed projectiles create a shockwave through the tissue, enlarging the wound channel. - **Impalement**: An object pierces the body and remains lodged within, posing significant challenges for extraction and treatment. # 3. Thermal, Chemical, and Radiation Burns - **Thermal Burns**: Caused by exposure to high temperatures from sources like fire, steam, or hot liquids. The severity depends on the temperature of the source and the duration of exposure. - **Chemical Burns**: Result from contact with acidic or basic substances, causing damage to the skin and potentially internal organs if inhaled or ingested. - **Radiation Burns**: Can happen due to exposure to radiation, such as from x-rays or nuclear radiation. This can lead to both acute injuries and long-term health issues like cancer. # 4. Special Considerations - **Blast Injuries**: Unique to explosions, these can cause multiple types of trauma simultaneously, including blunt trauma from the blast wave, penetrating trauma from shrapnel, and burns from the explosion's heat. - **Crush Syndrome**: A systemic result of prolonged compression of muscle tissue that releases harmful substances into the systemic circulation when the pressure is relieved. It can lead to renal failure and other systemic complications. Understanding the mechanisms of trauma is essential for emergency care providers and physicians to prioritize treatments based on the likely injuries sustained and to quickly stabilize and treat patients to prevent further harm."},{"prompt":"Evening primrose oil :in a dose of 1-3 gm/day for 3 months, it contains gamma linolenic acid which might be deficient in breasts with mastalgia. It's effective in women >40 years of age and has minimal side effects.","completion":"Evening primrose oil (EPO) is derived from the seeds of the evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) plant. It has been explored for various health issues, including eczema, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, and conditions related to women's health such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and breast pain (mastalgia). The active component in evening primrose oil that has garnered attention for its potential therapeutic effects is gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid. # Mechanism of Action: GLA in evening primrose oil is thought to exert its effects through the conversion to prostaglandin E1, a compound involved in inflammatory responses and pain modulation. It's believed that some people, including women with cyclic breast pain (mastalgia), may have a deficiency in delta-6-desaturase, an enzyme necessary for converting dietary fats into GLA. Supplementing with GLA directly might circumvent this issue, potentially reducing inflammation and pain. # Use in Mastalgia: Evening primrose oil has been studied for its effect on breast pain, with mixed results. Some studies suggest that taking evening primrose oil, in a dose of 1-3 grams per day for about 3 months, could alleviate the symptoms of mastalgia, especially in women over 40 years of age. The evidence indicates that it may be particularly effective for women experiencing cyclic breast pain, with potential benefits for those with non-cyclic pain as well. # Safety and Side Effects: Evening primrose oil is generally considered safe for short-term use, with minimal side effects reported. The most common side effects might include gastrointestinal upset, headache, and possible allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. However, because EPO can potentially interfere with other medications (e.g., blood thinners, antipsychotics), it's essential for individuals to consult a healthcare provider before starting supplementation, especially for those who are pregnant, breastfeeding, have epilepsy, or are taking other medications. # Efficacy and Evidence: While some studies and anecdotal evidence support the use of evening primrose oil for breast pain and other conditions, the scientific community calls for more rigorous research to conclusively determine its efficacy. A review of the data up to this point reveals variability in study outcomes, which could be due to differences in study design, sample sizes, and criteria for assessing pain relief. Despite the need for further research, evening primrose oil remains a popular complementary approach to managing breast pain for many, particularly for those seeking alternatives to conventional treatments that might not have been effective or well-tolerated. As with any supplement, it's crucial for individuals to discuss its use with healthcare professionals to ensure it aligns with their overall health plan and to monitor for any possible interactions with other treatments."},{"prompt":"Hilariously badly translate my text in these different styles: Misheard, Opposite, Quote Reversal so it tells a completely different meaning version of original and very hilarious list of stuff in this quote that makes no sense by questioning bits in the original text: (add the original text at the beginning though) (Signpost) “No visitors allowed by decree of the Big Bob-omb.

В условиях активного развития угольной промышленности, металлургии и химической промышленности экологическая обстановка в городе остро стоит перед местным населением, вызывая обеспокоенность и требуя незамедлительного решения. Ниже рассмотрены основные экологические проблемы города Кемерово. # Загрязнение воздуха Одна из самых серьезных экологических проблем Кемерово – загрязнение атмосферы, вызванное в значительной степени выбросами от промышленных предприятий. Выбросы сернистых и азотных оксидов, а также углеводородов и пыли, превышают допустимые нормы, что негативно сказывается на здоровье населения. Ухудшение качества воздуха влечет за собой рост заболеваемости патологиями дыхательной системы и аллергическими реакциями среди жителей города. # Загрязнение водоемов Реки и озера вокруг Кемерово испытывают серьезное загрязнение в результате сброса некачественных сточных вод от промышленных предприятий и коммунальных служб. Это приводит не только к деградации водных экосистем, но и ограничивает возможности использования водоемов для рекреационных и бытовых нужд населения. # Загрязнение почвы Неправильное обращение с промышленными и бытовыми отходами приводит к загрязнению почв тяжелыми металлами, химическими веществами и нефтепродуктами, что ухудшает качество сельскохозяйственной продукции и угрожает биоразнообразию. # Утилизация отходов Проблема накопления и переработки твердых бытовых и промышленных отходов остается актуальной для Кемерово. Несмотря на наличие полигонов для захоронения отходов, отсутствие современных технологий переработки и рециклинга приводит к увеличению нагрузки на окружающую среду. # Потеря биоразнообразия Расширение городской застройки и промышленных зон, загрязнение и изменение ландшафтов приводят к сокращению численности и вымиранию многих видов животных и растений, что влечет за собой утрату уникального биоразнообразия региона. # Пути решения Решение экологических проблем Кемерово требует комплексного подхода, включающего в себя: - Повышение экологических стандартов для промышленных предприятий. - Внедрение систем очистки выбросов в атмосферу и сточных вод. - Разработка и реализация программ по рециклингу и утилизации отходов. - Развитие \\"зеленых\\" зон в городе для улучшения качества воздуха. - Повышение экологической осведомленности населения. Сложность экологической ситуации в Кемерово требует немедленных и решительных действий со стороны властей, бизнеса и гражданского общества, чтобы обеспечить устойчивое развитие города и улучшение качества жизни его жителей."},{"prompt":"распиши больше","completion":"Для более глубокого понимания экологических проблем Кемерово и поиска путей их решения, необходимо углубиться в каждую из обозначенных выше проблем, рассматривая их более детально и предлагая конкретные меры по улучшению экологической ситуации. # Расширенный анализ экологических проблем Кемерово Загрязнение воздуха Промышленные предприятия, транспорт, сжигание угля в бытовых условиях – основные источники загрязнения воздуха в Кемерово. Для сокращения выбросов загрязняющих веществ предприятиям необходимо внедрять передовые очистные технологии, а также перейти на менее загрязняющие виды топлива. В организации городского транспорта акцент должен быть сделан на развитие электротранспорта и создание более благоприятных условий для использования велосипедов и пеших прогулок. Загрязнение водоемов Для минимизации воздействия на водные ресурсы необходимо ужесточить контроль за сбросами стоков в реки и озера. Важно усовершенствовать системы очистки стоков как на промышленных предприятиях, так и в коммунальном секторе, использовать современные технологии для восстановления уже загрязненных водоемов. Загрязнение почвы Усиление контроля за утилизацией промышленных и бытовых отходов поможет снизить уровень загрязнения почв. Реализация программ по компостированию органических отходов станет вкладом в улучшение качества почвы, как и разработка нормативов по безопасному использованию химических веществ в сельском хозяйстве. Утилизация отходов Необходимо развивать инфраструктуру для сортировки, переработки и утилизации твердых бытовых и промышленных отходов. Вовлечение современных технологий и методов рециклинга может стать основой для создания цикличной экономики, сокращающей нагрузку на окружающую среду. Потеря биоразнообразия Для сохранения биоразнообразия важно ориентироваться на создание зеленых зон и экопарков, восстановление естественных ландшафтов и сред обитания. Развитие программ по охране редких и исчезающих видов животных и растений, а также экологическое просвещение населения вносят вклад в сохранение природного разнообразия региона. # Меры по улучшению экологической обстановки 1. **Создание системы экологического мониторинга**: Непрерывный контроль за уровнем загрязнения, определение основных источников и факторов риска для экологии города. 2. **Экологическое просвещение**: Программы, направленные на повышение осведомленности жителей о важности сохранения окружающей среды и о том, как каждый может внести вклад в улучшение экологической ситуации. 3. **Сотрудничество с бизнесом**: Поддержка и мотивация предприятий к внедрению \\"зеленых\\" технологий и практик, переход на альтернативные источники энергии. 4. **Развитие градостроительной политики**: Планирование застройки с учетом экологических требований, развитие зеленых зон и парков, сохранение природных ландшафтов в черте города и его окрестностях.

Эти теги работают аналогично HTML, но обычно считаются более безопасными для использования пользователями, поскольку ограничивают возможность выполнения произвольного кода на странице. Обычно BBCode используется непосредственно в тексте сообщений, которые пользователи пишут на форумах и которые затем обрабатываются сервером форума для отображения другим пользователям в форматированном виде. Поэтому BBCode не ассоциируется с каким-то определенным типом файлов, в отличие от, например, HTML, который обычно содержится в файлах с расширением .html или .htm."},{"prompt":"Но если BBCode надо написать в каком-нибудь документе, как мне добиться подсвечивания синтаксиса? Какой формат файла выбрать?","completion":"Для написания документа с BBCode, где будет подсветка синтаксиса, подход может зависеть от используемого текстового редактора или среды разработки. Универсального решения, подходящего абсолютно для всех, не существует, поскольку поддержка BBCode специфична для каждой программы. Однако есть несколько подходов, которые могут быть полезны: 1. **Использование специализированных редакторов или плагинов:** Некоторые текстовые редакторы или IDE (интегрированные среды разработки), такие как Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom и другие, поддерживают установку дополнительных плагинов или расширений, которые могут добавить подсветку синтаксиса для BBCode. Вам нужно будет поискать расширение, специально предназначенное для работы с BBCode. 2. **Выбор общего формата файла:** Если специфической поддержки BBCode в вашем редакторе нет, вы можете сохранить документ в формате, которые поддерживает подсветку синтаксиса для похожих на BBCode языков. Например, файлик с расширением \`.txt\` для простого текста без подсветки или \`.html\`, \`.xml\` для использования подсветки, предназначенной для этих языков. В этом случае подсветка синтаксиса может быть неидеальной, но некоторые элементы могут выделяться. 3. **Использование онлайн-редакторов:** Существуют также онлайн-сервисы и инструменты, которые позволяют работать с BBCode, предоставляя некоторую поддержку подсветки синтаксиса в реальном времени. Это может быть удобным решением, если вы не хотите устанавливать дополнительное ПО. 4. **Разработка собственного решения:** Если вам комфортно работать с настройками вашего текстового редактора или IDE, вы можете попробовать создать или адаптировать существующую схему подсветки синтаксиса под BBCode, используя функции настройки языка или подсветки синтаксиса, предоставляемые вашим редактором. Выбор подхода зависит от ваших предпочтений, доступных инструментов и конкретных задач.

It included initiatives such as the Works Progress Administration (WPA), Social Security Act, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 2. The Great Society: The Great Society was a set of domestic programs introduced by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s. It aimed to eliminate poverty and racial injustice in America and included policies such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 3. The Marshall Plan: The Marshall Plan was a foreign aid program initiated by the United States to help rebuild Western Europe after World War II. It was intended to promote economic recovery and stability in the region. 4. The Bretton Woods System: The Bretton Woods System was an international monetary system established in 1944 that set fixed exchange rates for major currencies and created institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to promote economic stability and development. 5. The Economic Opportunity Act: The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 was part of President Johnson's War on Poverty and created programs like Job Corps, Head Start, and Community Action Agencies to address issues of poverty and unemployment in the United States. 6. Keynesian Economics: Keynesian economics, based on the ideas of economist John Maynard Keynes, focused on government intervention in the economy to stimulate growth and manage economic downturns. It influenced policies such as deficit spending, tax cuts, and increased government spending during recessions.

Truman in his 1949 State of the Union address. The Fair Deal was a continuation and expansion of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies, aiming to address social, economic, and political issues facing the United States after World War II. Key components of the Fair Deal included: 1. National health insurance: Truman proposed a national health insurance program to provide affordable healthcare to all Americans. This was a precursor to later efforts to expand healthcare coverage in the United States. 2. Civil rights: Truman advocated for civil rights legislation, including desegregation of the military and federal workforce, as well as anti-lynching laws. These efforts laid the groundwork for the Civil Rights Movement in the decades that followed. 3. Federal aid to education: The Fair Deal called for increased federal funding for education, with a focus on improving schools, expanding access to higher education, and promoting vocational training. 4. Social welfare programs: Truman supported expanding Social Security benefits, raising the minimum wage, and increasing unemployment benefits to provide a safety net for Americans facing economic hardships. 5. Housing and urban development: The Fair Deal included initiatives to address housing shortages and improve urban infrastructure, such as public housing projects and urban renewal programs. Although some aspects of the Fair Deal were implemented, many of Truman's proposals faced opposition in Congress and were not fully enacted. Despite this, the Fair Deal laid the foundation for future policies and programs that expanded the role of the federal government in addressing social and economic issues in the United States.

Eisenhower's foreign policy approach during the early years of his administration in the 1950s. The policy of boldness was based on the idea of confronting the Soviet Union and communism with a strong and assertive stance, aimed at promoting American interests and containing the spread of communism worldwide. Key components of the policy of boldness included: 1. Brinksmanship: Eisenhower and his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, embraced a strategy of brinksmanship, which involved taking a firm stand against communist aggression and being willing to push to the brink of war in defense of American interests. This approach was exemplified by the use of nuclear deterrence and the threat of massive retaliation to deter Soviet aggression. 2. Massive retaliation: Eisenhower's policy emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong military deterrent, particularly through the use of nuclear weapons. The doctrine of massive retaliation meant that the United States would respond to any aggression with overwhelming force, including the use of nuclear weapons if necessary. 3. Rollback: While containment had been the prevailing strategy during the Truman administration, Eisenhower's policy of boldness included a more aggressive approach known as rollback. Rollback aimed to actively push back against communist influence and regimes, rather than simply containing their spread. This was reflected in actions such as the covert operations to overthrow governments perceived as communist threats, as seen in Iran and Guatemala. 4. Alliance building: In addition to confronting the Soviet Union directly, Eisenhower also focused on building alliances and partnerships with other anti-communist nations. This approach led to the creation of organizations such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) to counter Soviet influence in Asia and the Middle East. Overall, the policy of boldness reflected Eisenhower's belief in the need for a strong and assertive stance against communism, combined with a willingness to take calculated risks to advance American interests on the global stage. While the policy of boldness had its critics and faced challenges, it was a defining aspect of Eisenhower's foreign policy approach during the early years of the Cold War."},{"prompt":"What are significant government policies and ideas to know from 1970-1980?","completion":"During the 1970s, several significant government policies and ideas emerged that had a lasting impact on American society.

GX and 5D's. One reason was that the production process for dubbing these shows was quite lengthy and complex, which led to delays in releasing new episodes. Additionally, 4Kids faced financial difficulties during this time which may have also impacted their ability to keep up with the dubbing process. Finally, there may have been communication and coordination issues between 4Kids and the Japanese production companies responsible for the original anime series, which could have further contributed to the delays."},{"prompt":"why werent yugioh gx and 5ds dubbed completely","completion":"Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's were not fully dubbed by 4Kids for a few different reasons. One of the main reasons was that 4Kids faced financial challenges during the time that they were dubbing these series. This limited their resources and may have made it difficult for them to continue dubbing all of the episodes. Additionally, there were some controversies surrounding 4Kids' English dub of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and 5D's, with some fans criticizing the changes made to the original Japanese version and the quality of the voice acting. This negative reception may have also played a role in 4Kids' decision to not fully dub these series.

GX and Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's."},{"prompt":"why didnt 4kids dub the final episodes og gx alongwith the first episodes of 5ds","completion":"There are a few reasons why 4Kids may not have dubbed the final episodes of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX along with the first episodes of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's: 1. Licensing and distribution agreements: 4Kids may have had specific agreements with the licensors or distributors of these series that dictated how many episodes they were allowed to dub or release at a time. This could have prevented them from dubbing the final episodes of GX and the first episodes of 5D's together. 2. Production scheduling: Dubbing anime series involves a complex production process that requires coordination between voice actors, directors, translators, and other staff members. It's possible that 4Kids had scheduling conflicts or logistical challenges that prevented them from dubbing the final episodes of GX and the first episodes of 5D's at the same time. 3. Financial constraints: As previously mentioned, 4Kids faced financial difficulties during the time that they were dubbing these series. This may have impacted their ability to complete the dubbing of GX and transition smoothly to 5D's without interruptions. Overall, a combination of licensing agreements, production scheduling, and financial constraints likely influenced 4Kids' decision not to dub the final episodes of GX along with the first episodes of 5D's."},{"prompt":"why did 4kidds dub zexal despite there being a lawsuit","completion":"4Kids dubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal despite being involved in a lawsuit because they had already established a working relationship with Konami, the company that owns the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise. The lawsuit was related to licensing and distribution rights for the Yu-Gi-Oh! series, but it did not prevent 4Kids from continuing their involvement with the franchise. Additionally, 4Kids had previously dubbed several other Yu-Gi-Oh! series, such as Duel Monsters, GX, and 5D's, which were successful and popular among fans. Dubbing Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal allowed 4Kids to continue capitalizing on the success of the franchise and maintain their position as the primary English-language distributor of Yu-Gi-Oh! content.

Arc-V and Yu-Gi-Oh! Vrains did not air in the UK for various reasons: 1. Licensing and distribution agreements: The rights to broadcast and distribute anime series like Yu-Gi-Oh! are typically negotiated on a country-by-country basis. It's possible that the licensing agreements for Arc-V and Vrains did not include distribution rights for the UK, or that a different company held the rights to broadcast the series in the UK. 2. Broadcast networks: The availability of slots on broadcast networks in the UK may have also played a role in the decision not to air Arc-V and Vrains. If there were limited opportunities for the series to find a suitable time slot on popular TV channels, it may have made it difficult for the series to secure a broadcast deal in the UK. 3. Viewer demand: Finally, viewer demand and popularity of the Yu-Gi-Oh! series in the UK may have also influenced the decision not to air Arc-V and Vrains. If there was not enough interest or demand for the series in the UK market, it may not have been considered financially viable for broadcasters to air the series.

Time constraints: The Pokémon anime series typically airs on a weekly basis, which means that the creators have to produce new episodes on a regular schedule. Adapting the entire storyline of the Black and White games into a TV series format may have required too much time and resources, leading to deviations from the original game storyline. 2. Creative freedom: The Pokémon anime often takes creative liberties with the source material to cater to a wider audience and create unique storylines that are engaging for viewers. While the anime series is inspired by the Pokémon games, the creators have the freedom to introduce new characters, locations, and plot twists to keep the show fresh and interesting. 3. Appeal to a broader audience: The Pokémon anime is targeted at a wide range of viewers, including children and longtime fans of the franchise. By deviating from the exact storyline of the games, the creators can appeal to a broader audience and introduce new elements that may not be present in the original games.

Creative inspiration: While the XY anime series may have recycled elements from previous games, such as Black and White, it could have been done as a way to pay homage to earlier games and incorporate popular Pokémon, locations, or storylines that fans enjoyed. Mixing elements from different games allows the creators to create a rich and diverse world within the anime series.

These countries are known for their high standards of living and strong labor rights, but also for their competitive job markets. Here are steps you can take to find a farm job in these regions: 1. **Research and Understand the Requirements:** - Start by understanding the visa and work permit requirements if you're not a citizen of these countries. Citizens of EU countries often have an easier process to work in Scandinavian countries. - Learn about the agricultural sector in each country, including peak seasons for farming activities, as this can affect job availability. 2. **Utilize Online Job Portals:** - Use job search websites that are specific to each country or to the agricultural sector. Websites like The Swedish Public Employment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen), NAV (for Norway), Jobnet (for Denmark), and TE-palvelut (for Finland) can be useful. - International job portals like Indeed, LinkedIn, and specialized agricultural job boards can also offer listings. 3. **Check Farm and Agricultural Organizations:** - Investigate whether there are organizations, associations, or cooperatives related to farming and agriculture in the Scandinavian countries that might offer job listings or networking opportunities. - Contacting these organizations directly can sometimes lead to unadvertised job opportunities or valuable advice for your job search. 4. **Networking:** - Social media platforms and professional networking sites like LinkedIn can be helpful. Join groups or forums dedicated to farming in Scandinavia. - Engaging in discussions and connecting with agricultural professionals in those countries might provide leads on available positions. 5. **Attend Agricultural and Job Fairs:** - Look for agricultural shows, job fairs, or expos in the region or even in your own country that focus on Scandinavian countries. These can be great opportunities to meet employers face to face. 6. **Consider Volunteer and Exchange Programs:** - Programs such as WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) allow you to exchange labor for accommodation and meals. It’s a great way to gain experience and make connections, though it’s not a paid job. 7. **Prepare Your Application Accordingly:** - Customize your CV and cover letter to match Scandinavian standards. Emphasize any previous farm work experience, skills relevant to the specific farming jobs you're applying for, and any language skills. English is widely understood, but knowing the basics of the local language can be an advantage. 8. **Understand Cultural Norms:** - Familiarize yourself with the work culture in these countries, as cultural fit is often considered important in the hiring process. Scandinavians generally value punctuality, equality, and work-life balance. 9. **Apply Speculatively:** - Identify farms or agricultural businesses you're interested in and send speculative applications. Even if they don't have current openings, they might keep your details on file for future opportunities. 10. **Local Newspapers and Community Boards:** - Don’t overlook traditional methods. Some local jobs might only be advertised in local newspapers or on community noticeboards, particularly in rural areas. Remember, finding a job in a new country takes persistence and patience. Keep applying, and make sure your applications are tailored and highlight why you’re a great fit for farm work in Scandinavia. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"make this short I trust you are doing well.

Here is how to use a waist belt effectively: 1. Position the belt around your waist: Place the belt around your waist with the buckle in front. The belt should be snug but not too tight, allowing for some room to breathe. 2. Adjust the fit: Make sure the belt is positioned correctly on your lower back, just above your hips. The belt should sit firmly and comfortably on your lower back and abdominal area. 3. Engage your core: Before lifting any weights or performing any physical activity, engage your core muscles. This will help activate your abdominal muscles and provide additional support to your lower back. 4. Use proper lifting technique: When lifting weights or performing any physical activity, make sure to maintain proper form and technique. The belt should not be used as a substitute for proper lifting form but as an additional support. 5. Breathe properly: While wearing a waist belt, remember to take deep breaths and brace your core muscles. This will help to increase intra-abdominal pressure and provide additional support to your lower back. 6. Remove the belt after use: Once you have completed your workout or physical activity, remove the waist belt to allow your muscles to recover and prevent any discomfort or restriction of movement. It is important to note that a waist belt should be used as a supplement to proper lifting technique and not as a replacement. Consult with a fitness professional or trainer for guidance on how to effectively use a waist belt for your specific needs and goals."},{"prompt":"How to tell the listing agent that my clients would to making an offer on the unit even though the unit is spacious and has good layout.

Вот сам текст: Researchers have discovered a Florida bottlenose dolphin found with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, or HPAIV. The discovery by University of Florida researchers in collaboration with multiple other agencies is one of the first reports of a constantly growing list of mammals affected by this virus. The case has been published in Communications Biology. The report documents the discovery, the first finding of HPAIV in a cetacean in North America, from the initial response by UF’s Marine Animal Rescue team to a report of a distressed dolphin in Dixie County, Florida, to the subsequent identification of the virus from brain and tissue samples obtained in a postmortem examination. Analyses initially performed at UF’s zoological medicine diagnostic laboratory ruled out the presence of other potential agents at play in the dolphin’s disease, with the Bronson Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Kissimmee, Florida, verifying the presence of HPAI virus in both the lung and brain. Those results were confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, which characterized the virus subtype and pathotype. The virus was confirmed to be HPAI A (H5N1) virus of HA clade 2.3.4.4b. Subsequent tissue analysis was performed at the Biosafety Level 3 enhanced laboratory at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis. Allison Murawski, a former intern with UF’s aquatic animal medicine program, is the study’s first author and developed a case report on the dolphin as part of her research project. She traveled to Memphis and worked closely with Richard Webby, who directs the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude’s and served as corresponding author of the paper Webby’s laboratory investigates avian influenza cases in many species and was key in determining where the virus may have originated, what unique RNA characteristics or mutations were present that could suggest its ability to infect other mammals, and how the virus could be tracked from this source. The researchers sequenced the genomes from local birds and looked at viruses isolated from Northeast seal populations. “We still don’t know where the dolphin got the virus and more research needs to be done,” Webby says. “This investigation was an important step in understanding this virus and is a great example where happenstance joins with curiosity, having to answer the ‘why’ and then seeing how the multiple groups and expertise took this to a fantastic representation of collaborative excellence,” says Mike Walsh, an associate professor of aquatic animal health, who served as Murawski’s faculty mentor.

Данный случай, обнаруженный совместными усилиями исследователей из Университета Флориды и нескольких других организаций, является одним из первых в растущем списке млекопитающих, пораженных этим вирусом. Результаты исследования были опубликованы в журнале Communications Biology. В докладе описывается находка вируса HPAIV у китообразного в Северной Америке, начиная с первоначальной реакции команды по спасению морских животных Университета Флориды на сообщение о дельфине в беде в округе Дикси, Флорида и заканчивая последующей идентификацией вируса в образцах мозга и тканей, полученных после смерти животного. Начальные анализы, проведенные в диагностической лаборатории зоологической медицины UF, исключили наличие других возможных факторов, способствующих заболеванию дельфина, а лаборатория диагностики болезней животных в Бронсоне, Флорида, подтвердила присутствие вируса HPAI как в легких, так и в мозге. Данные результаты были подтверждены Национальной лабораторией ветеринарных услуг в Эймсе, Айова, которая также определила подтип и патотип вируса. Было подтверждено, что вирусом является HPAI A (H5N1) вирус HA-клады 2.3.4.4b. Последующий анализ тканей был выполнен в лаборатории уровня биобезопасности 3 в Детском исследовательском госпитале Святого Иуды в Мемфисе. Первым автором исследования является Эллисон Муравски, бывший стажер программы по медицине водных животных при УФ, которая разработала отчет о случае с дельфином в рамках своего исследовательского проекта. Эллисон посетила Мемфис и тесно сотрудничала с Ричардом Вебби, руководящим Центром Всемирной организации здравоохранения по изучению экологии гриппа у животных и птиц в госпитале святого Иуды, который был одним из авторов публикации. Лаборатория Вебби занимается изучением случаев птичьего гриппа у различных видов, что было ключом к определению возможного происхождения вируса, уникальных РНК-характеристик или мутаций, которые могли указывать на его способность заражать других млекопитающих, и способов отслеживания источника вируса. Исследователи проанализировали геномы местных птиц и вирусы, выделенные из популяций тюленей на северо-востоке. \\"Мы все еще не знаем, откуда у дельфина взялся вирус и предстоит сделать еще много работы\\", - говорит Вебби. \\"Это исследование стало важным шагом в понимании этого вируса и является прекрасным примером, когда случайность сочетается с любопытством, возникает необходимость ответить на вопрос 'почему', и показывает, как совместные усилия разных групп специалистов приводят к выдающемуся результату сотрудничества,\\" – делится Майк Уолш, доцент факультета здоровья водных животных, который был научным руководителем Муравски."},{"prompt":"Write a hilarious script where the Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic Scrappy-Doo have a funny chat behind the scenes and react to hilarious bad translations that i read out, laughing and hilariously question and hilariously roast errors and inconsistencies that make no sense in the bad translations and the names of stuff with occasional funny quotes mocking a situation, in my prompt in a hilarious comedy 17+ way: (The gang constantly imagine and make silly quotes to mock the bad translations) Reader: Ok gang get this… * I start reading the whole thing, one sentence at a time to the gang, who let me lay it on.

I have a question regarding the Mock Code requirement. I saw blow screenshot from LMS regarding the Mock Code requirement for the VMG nurses. Is this requirement still as in the past every two year but in the opposite year of staff’s BLS? Since the Mock Code is not listed in the WorkDay as one of the requirements, it is hard for clinic to tracking the compliance status for our nursing staff. is there a tracking system exit?","completion":"Good morning and Happy Friday to you too! Thank you for bringing your question to our attention concerning the Mock Code requirement for VMG nurses. To clarify, the Mock Code training has historically been required in a staggered manner, opposite the year when the Basic Life Support (BLS) certification is due. This arrangement ensures that each year, nurses have a major certification or training to complete, allowing them to focus adequately on each without being overwhelmed. Regarding your concern about tracking compliance status due to the absence of the Mock Code requirement in WorkDay, it's understandable that this can pose challenges for clinics in monitoring their nursing staff's compliance. Although it might not be currently listed within WorkDay, there are a few approaches to consider: 1. **Direct Communication with Education/Training Department**: It might be beneficial to directly inquire with the department responsible for professional development or training within your organization. They might have a separate system or spreadsheet where such compliance is tracked and could provide you access to it or offer regular updates. 2. **Internal Tracking System**: Until an official tracking mechanism is established in a more integrated system like WorkDay, you may consider developing an internal tracking system for your clinic. A simple spreadsheet can be used to log each nurse's Mock Code and BLS training completion dates. While it requires manual update, it could serve as an interim solution. 3. **Request for Integration into WorkDay**: Given the importance of ensuring compliance with training requirements, it might be worth raising the issue with your HR department or whoever oversees WorkDay administration in your organization. Highlighting the difficulty in tracking compliance without integration into the WorkDay system could prompt a review and potentially, the addition of Mock Code training into the system for easier management. 4. **Regular Check-ins and Reminders for Staff**: Setting regular reminders for your team about upcoming Mock Code training can also help keep everyone on track. This can be complemented by periodic check-ins or meetings to discuss training compliance and upcoming deadlines. It's important to have a reliable system in place for tracking such critical compliance requirements. Until a more automated solution is available, these recommendations could help manage the situation more effectively. Furthermore, for the most current information regarding the Mock Code requirement and any potential changes to its frequency or tracking method, it would be best to directly consult the guidelines issued by your organization's training or compliance department. Regulations and policies can evolve, and they would have the most up-to-date information. I hope this helps! Please feel free to reach out should you have any more questions or concerns.

Sin embargo, se pueden proporcionar algunas directrices generales para muestreos con propósitos agrícolas comunes. Para la mayoría de los análisis de suelo con fines agrícolas, como la determinación de nutrientes, pH, materia orgánica, y textura del suelo, se recomienda tomar muestras a una profundidad estándar de 0 a 20 cm para cultivos anuales. Esto debido a que la mayor parte de las raíces de estos cultivos se encuentran en esta zona, y es aquí donde interactúan más intensamente con los nutrientes y el agua del suelo. En el caso de cultivos perennes, árboles frutales, o plantas con sistemas radiculares más profundos, podría ser conveniente muestrear a una profundidad mayor, por ejemplo, de 0 a 40 cm o incluso hasta 60 cm. Esto permite evaluar las condiciones del suelo a niveles que afectan directamente el desarrollo de raíces más profundas. Para propósitos específicos, como diagnosticar problemas de salinidad o para proyectos de ingeniería, las muestras pueden requerir ser tomadas a profundidades mayores, a veces superando el metro de profundidad, dependiendo del objetivo específico del estudio. Para realizar un muestreo adecuado, conviene tomar varias submuestras en diferentes puntos dentro del área a estudiar, mezclándolas luego para formar una muestra compuesta que sea representativa del área. Utilizar herramientas adecuadas, como barrenos o tubos muestreadores, facilitará obtener muestras de la profundidad deseada. Es importante también considerar la época del año para el muestreo; en muchos casos, se recomienda muestrear al final de la temporada de cultivo o antes de la aplicación de enmiendas al suelo, lo que puede variar según el ciclo de cultivos de la región en particular de Perú donde se realice el muestreo. Recuerda que estas directrices son generales y pueden no aplicarse a todas las situaciones o cumplir con todos los objetivos de muestreo. Para obtener recomendaciones específicas y detalladas, sería recomendable consultar a un agrónomo o especialista en suelos local que conozca bien las condiciones y necesidades específicas de la región donde se realizará el muestreo."},{"prompt":"profundida para un muestreo de suelo segun ECA peru","completion":"Los Estándares de Calidad Ambiental (ECA) para suelo en Perú especifican los límites permisibles de diversos parámetros físico-químicos y biológicos para proteger la salud humana y el ambiente. Sin embargo, los ECA no establecen directrices específicas sobre la profundidad de muestreo de suelo, ya que estos estándares están más enfocados en los niveles aceptables de contaminantes y condiciones del suelo que en las metodologías de muestreo en sí. La profundidad de muestreo adecuada para la evaluación de calidad del suelo según los ECA en Perú puede variar dependiendo del objetivo específico del análisis, el tipo de suelo, la presencia de cultivos, y la posible fuente y naturaleza de contaminantes. Para fines de evaluación de contaminación o calidad de suelo con respecto a los ECA, el muestreo suele considerar las siguientes prácticas generales, adaptadas al contexto específico: 1. **Muestreo superficial**: Para evaluar la contaminación superficial o el impacto de actividades recientes, las muestras se toman comúnmente de los primeros 20 cm del suelo. 2. **Muestreo profundo**: En casos donde se sospecha contaminación que podría haberse percolado más profundamente en el suelo, o para evaluar la calidad del suelo en relación con plantas de raíces profundas o árboles, se pueden tomar muestras a mayor profundidad, incluso hasta 1 metro o más, dependiendo de la naturaleza específica del estudio. Para definir una estrategia de muestreo que esté en concordancia con los objetivos de los ECA y que pueda proporcionar datos representativos y confiables, es fundamental considerar los siguientes puntos: - **Tipo de uso de suelo**: agrícola, residencial, industrial, etc., ya que los ECA pueden tener diferentes limitaciones basadas en el uso actual o planeado del suelo. - **Historial de uso del terreno**: Un terreno con un historial de uso industrial, por ejemplo, puede requerir un enfoque de muestreo enfocado en contaminantes específicos asociados a esas actividades previas. - **Presencia y tipo de vegetación**: La zona radicular de la vegetación presente puede dar indicaciones sobre la profundidad relevante para muestreo. - **Objetivo del estudio**: Determinar si el objetivo es identificar contaminación, evaluar la idoneidad del suelo para un tipo específico de uso, o monitorear cambios en el tiempo influirá en la estrategia de muestreo. Para muestreos relacionados con los ECA, siempre es recomendable seguir las guías y recomendaciones de muestreo establecidas por las autoridades ambientales de Perú o consultar a expertos en muestreo de suelos y análisis ambiental. Además, es crucial revisar la legislación y regulaciones más recientes para asegurarse de que el muestreo cumpla con los requisitos actuales y esté alineado con las mejores prácticas en la materia."},{"prompt":"Write a hilarious script where the Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic Scrappy-Doo have a funny chat behind the scenes and react to hilarious bad translations that i read out, laughing and hilariously question and hilariously roast errors and inconsistencies that make no sense in the bad translations and the names of stuff with occasional funny quotes mocking a situation, in my prompt in a hilarious comedy 17+ way: (The gang constantly imagine and make silly quotes to mock the bad translations) Reader: Ok gang get this… * I start reading the whole thing, one sentence at a time to the gang, who let me lay it on.

It seems there might be a misunderstanding or typo in the equation, as having both (t) and (x) in it suggests a multivariable context, but I'll proceed by assuming you meant (y = 3x + 12.5), a linear equation. Here's how you can graph (y = 3x + 12.5) on paper: 1. **Identify the y-intercept**: The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis (where (x=0)). For this equation, it's (12.5), which gives you the point (0, 12.5). 2. **Determine the slope**: The slope is the coefficient of (x), which is 3 in this case. This means that for every increase of 1 in (x), (y) increases by 3. The slope tells you the steepness and direction of the line. 3. **Plot the y-intercept**: Start by plotting the y-intercept on a graph as your initial point. Find 12.5 on the y-axis and put a point there. 4. **Use the slope to find another point**: From the y-intercept, use the slope to find another point. Since the slope is 3, you can move 3 units up (because it's positive) and 1 unit to the right. From the point (0, 12.5), move to (1, 15.5) and mark this second point. 5. **Draw the line**: Using a ruler, draw a straight line that passes through the two points you’ve plotted. This line is the graph of the equation (y = 3x + 12.5). 6. **Label your graph**: It's good practice to label the axes (x and y) and provide a title for your graph which reflects the equation or the data it represents. If you meant to refer to an equation involving both (t) and (x), or if (t) represents a specific constant, please clarify so that I can offer more precise help.

If you have access to graphing software like Desmos, GeoGebra, or even Excel/Google Sheets, here's a general approach you can follow to graph the equation: # Using Desmos or GeoGebra: 1. **Access the Tool**: Open Desmos (desmos.com) or GeoGebra (geogebra.org), both of which are free to use. 2. **Enter the Equation**: - For Desmos, simply type \`y = 3x + 12.5\` into a new line. - For GeoGebra, you might have to select the 'Input' field first, but the process is similar. 3. **View the Graph**: The software will automatically plot the line for you. Desmos and GeoGebra both allow for interactive exploration, so you can zoom in/out and hover over points to see their coordinates. # Using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets: 1. **Prepare Data Points**: In a spreadsheet, create two columns for (x) and (y). Populate the (x) column with values (for example, -10 to 10). Then, use the equation (y = 3x + 12.5) to calculate (y) for each (x) value. - E.g., if (x = 1), then (y = 3*1 + 12.5 = 15.5). 2. **Select the Data**: Highlight both the (x) and (y) columns. 3. **Insert a Chart**: Choose to insert a Scatter Chart or a Line Chart from the insert menu. 4. **Adjust the Chart as Needed**: You may need to adjust the axes or add chart elements like titles or labels. While I can't directly show the graph here, following these steps in any of these platforms will help you visualize (y = 3x + 12.5). This linear function will appear as a straight line with a positive slope, crossing the y-axis at (12.5)."},{"prompt":"Melhorar frase: boa tarde lian, tudo em?

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked preprint trusted source proofread An international team of astronomers has conducted detailed radio and X-ray observations of a tidal disruption event (TDE) designated ASASSN-19bt. Results of the observational campaign, presented April 18 on the pre-print server arXiv, shed more light on the emission from this TDE, revealing that it showcases an unusual radio evolution. TDEs occur when a star passes close enough to a supermassive black hole and is pulled apart by the black hole's tidal forces, causing the process of disruption. Such tidally disrupted stellar debris starts raining down on the black hole and radiation emerges from the innermost region of accreting debris, which is an indicator of the presence of a TDE. ASASSN-19bt is a TDE at a redshift of 0.026, in the galaxy 2MASX J07001137-6602251. It was discovered in January 2019 by the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) and its X-ray luminosity is among the lowest observed for any optically-selected TDE. Shortly after the discovery of ASASSN-19bt, a group of astronomers led by Collin T. Christy of Steward Observatory in Tucson, Arizona, began monitoring of this TDE in order to get more insights into its properties. For this purpose, they employed the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the MeerKAT radio telescopes. \\"We present the results of our radio and X-ray monitoring of the TDE ASASSN-19bt, spanning nearly four years after the onset of the optical flare,\\" the researchers wrote. Christy's team first detected radio emission from ASASSN-19bt shortly after the optical discovery. Afterward, the radio emission continued to rise for years. Therefore, ASASSN-19bt exhibits unusual radio evolution when compared to other known TDEs, as the peak brightness of its radio emission increases rapidly until 457 days post-optical discovery and then plateaus. Contrary to radio emission, ASASSN-19bt appears to showcase very little activity in the X-rays. The observations detected no X-rays until approximately 225 days after the discovery of this TDE. Trying to explain the origin of radio emission from ASASSN-19bt, the astronomers employed two models: a non-relativistic spherical blast wave and a relativistic jet launched off-axis from the line of sight. According to the paper, the non-relativistic model points to a continuous energy rise in the outflow from about 0.01 to 10 quindecillion ergs, with a bulk outflow velocity of 0.05. When it comes to the relativistic model, it suggests a decreasing energy at early times and a roughly constant energy at a level of about 10,000 quindecillion ergs at late times in the maximally off-axis case. Summing up the results, the authors of the study underlined the urgency of extended radio observations of ASASSN-19bt and other similar TDEs in order to understand the mechanisms behind such unusual late time radio emission.

Эта работа, результаты которой были опубликованы 18 апреля на препринт-сервере arXiv, проливает свет на характер излучения данного TDE и выявляет необычное радиоэволюционное поведение объекта. Явления приливного разрушения происходят, когда звезда подходит настолько близко к сверхмассивной черной дыре, что подвергается разрыву из-за приливных сил последней. Разрушенные звездные осколки начинают падать на черную дыру, в результате чего из самых внутренних регионов накапливающихся обломков начинает исходить радиация, указывающая на наличие TDE. ASASSN-19bt представляет собой такое явление на красном смещении 0.026 в галактике 2MASX J07001137-6602251. Открытие этого объекта состоялось в январе 2019 года в рамках Всенебесного автоматического обзора за сверхновыми (ASAS-SN), и его рентгеновская светимость является одной из самых низких среди всех TDE, выбранных по оптическим данным. Сразу после обнаружения ASASSN-19bt команда астрономов во главе с Коллином Т. Кристи из Обсерватории Стюарда в Тусоне, Аризона, приступила к наблюдениям за этим объектом, чтобы глубже понять его характеристики. Были привлечены радиотелескопы компактного массива Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), а также Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) и MeerKAT. В результате четырехлетних регулярных радио- и рентгеновских мониторингов после начала оптического всплеска, команда смогла обнаружить и описать необычную радиоактивную эволюцию ASASSN-19bt. В отличие от других известных TDE, пик яркости радиоизлучения данного объекта рос очень быстро вплоть до 457-го дня после оптического открытия, а затем достиг плато. В то время как радиоактивность продемонстрировала резкое увеличение, рентгеновская активность объекта, наоборот, была несущественной. Никаких рентгеновских лучей не обнаруживалось примерно до 225-го дня после обнаружения этого TDE. Для объяснения происхождения радиоизлучения от ASASSN-19bt, исследователи опираться на две модели: нерелятивистскую сферическую ударную волну и релятивистскую струю, направленную вне оси нашего взгляда. Опираясь на данные, нерелятивистская модель указывает на постоянный рост энергии в потоке от около 0.01 до 10 квиндекиллионов эрг, при средней скорости потока 0.05. Релятивистская модель, в свою очередь, предполагает убывание энергии на ранних этапах и примерно постоянный уровень энергии около 10 000 квиндекиллионов эрг в случае максимально возможного отклонения от оси. Подведя итог, авторы исследования подчеркнули важность проведения продолжительных радио наблюдений за ASASSN-19bt и другими похожими TDE для понимания механизмов, стоящих за такой необычной поздней радиоактивностью."},{"prompt":"how can i whrite a resume about myself? what i must write in it?","completion":"Writing a resume about yourself involves presenting your professional history, skills, and achievements in a concise and compelling way.

Economics might not be your strong suit. Sean the Reader: (laughing along with them) You guys are too much! But hey, imagine selecting \\"this Scar\\" from the menu. What, does it come with a backstory and all? Scooby: Rash backstory! Shaggy: Like, \\"This scar was from the epic battle of '22, where I, a ball-faced pillow, overcame the odds!\\" Scrappy-Doo: Ha! Uncle Scooby, you and Shaggy would make pretty interesting villains, I gotta admit! Sean the Reader: (still laughing) Alright, gang, that’s all for today’s hilarious bad translations session. Until next time, keep those funny bones tickling! Shaggy: Like, thanks, Sean! With all these laughs, I’m gonna need a snack. Scooby: Me roo! Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

У меня есть проблема с тем, что аватарки пользователей у них в профилях отображаются такого размера которые они есть, а по моей задумке все они должны быть размера 150x150. Реализуй мою задумку и скажи, что и где меня и что и куда добавлять чтобы релизовать это","completion":"Чтобы сделать все аватарки размером 150x150 пикселей на вашем сайте, вам необходимо будет изменить способ обработки и отображения аватаров. Существует несколько способов реализации этой идеи. # Изменение размера изображений при загрузке Один из способов - изменить размер изображений пользователя при их загрузке на сервер. В файле \`update_avatar.php\`, где вы загружаете файл, можно добавить код для изменения размера изображения: \`\`\`php // После проверки файла и перед move_uploaded_file if (fileType == 'image/jpeg') { srcImage = imagecreatefromjpeg(fileTmpName); } elseif (fileType == 'image/png') { srcImage = imagecreatefrompng(fileTmpName); } elseif (fileType == 'image/gif') { srcImage = imagecreatefromgif(fileTmpName); } // Получаем оригинальные размеры изображения list(width, height) = getimagesize(fileTmpName); // Создаем новое изображение нужного размера newWidth = 150; newHeight = 150; newImage = imagecreatetruecolor(newWidth, newHeight); // Копируем старое изображение в новое с изменением размера imagecopyresampled(newImage, srcImage, 0, 0, 0, 0, newWidth, newHeight, width, height); // Сохраняем изображение if (fileType == 'image/jpeg') { imagejpeg(newImage, avatarPath, 100); } elseif (fileType == 'image/png') { imagepng(newImage, avatarPath, 9); } elseif (fileType == 'image/gif') { imagegif(newImage, avatarPath); } // Освобождаем память imagedestroy(srcImage); imagedestroy(newImage); // Теперь необходимо закомментировать или удалить строку с move_uploaded_file // move_uploaded_file(fileTmpName, avatarPath); \`\`\` Учтите, что создание и обработка изображений требует включенной библиотеки GD в вашей конфигурации PHP. # Изменение отображения аватара с помощью CSS Если изменение размера файла изображения на сервере не подходит, вы можете управлять размером отображения с помощью CSS без изменения размера файла. В файле стилей (\`design/styles.css\`), который вы подключаете, можно добавить следующие правила для класса \`avatar\`, который присвоен img элементу: \`\`\`css .avatar { width: 150px; height: 150px; object-fit: cover; /* Обеспечивает покрытие всей области без потери пропорций */ } \`\`\` Этот CSS будет принудительно изменять размер изображений до 150x150 пикселей при отображении, сохраняя пропорции изображений. Выбор метода зависит от ваших требований и ситуации. Изменение размера изображения на сервере поможет экономить пространство и ускорить загрузку страниц для пользователей. Однако, если ограничения по пространству и скорости загрузки не являются критичными, использование CSS может быть более удобным и быстрым решением."},{"prompt":"you are printing and typogaphy and Magic the gathering expert. What effects are there on printed cards? Are there some vip rare cards with glowing etc? Maybe in other games. Give me full list of typography effects so card looks more luxury","completion":"The realm of printed card games, particularly collectible ones like Magic: The Gathering (MTG), encompasses a variety of printing and typography effects aimed at enhancing the aesthetic appeal and perceived value of the cards. These effects serve not just to beautify the cards but also to denote rarity, special editions, or promotional status. This is common not only in MTG but in other trading card games (TCGs) like Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh! as well. Below, I will detail some of the notable printing and typography effects used in these games, with a focus on MTG, to achieve a sense of luxury or uniqueness. # Magic: The Gathering Foil Cards - **Standard Foil**: This traditional method involves a shiny, reflective coating that makes the entire card glitter when exposed to light. - **Extended Art Foil**: Cards that feature artwork extended beyond the usual frame, with a foil finish, are often highly sought after. Special Frames and Art - **Borderless Cards**: Cards without the traditional border, allowing the artwork to stretch to the edges. - **Showcase Cards**: Special versions of cards with unique frame art and styles that match the set's theme they belong to. - **Full-Art Cards**: Cards where the art covers the entire face, minimizing the border. Text and Typography - **Textured Foil & Embossed Effects**: Some of the premium cards have textured foil elements or embossed detailing that gives a three-dimensional effect to the text or the card's elements, enhancing both the look and the tactile experience. # Other Effects in Trading Card Games - **Holographic Cards**: A common feature in many TCGs, where a hologram is embedded into the card, creating a three-dimensional appearance. - **Glow-in-the-Dark**: While not common, some novelty cards or special editions might feature glow-in-the-dark elements, more as a gimmick than a standard practice. - **Lenticular Printing**: Offering a pseudo-3D effect or the illusion of movement as the viewing angle changes. This is seen more in collectible card games aimed at younger audiences or in limited special editions. - **Gold/Silver-Stamped or Inlay**: High-end collector editions or tournament prize cards sometimes use real gold or silver leaf for logos, text, or card borders. # Techniques for Luxury Typography and Printing 1. **Foil Stamping**: Pressing foil into the card stock, creating shiny, reflective patterns, or text. 2. **Spot UV Coating**: Applying a glossy coating to specific areas of the card (like the text or certain design elements) to create depth and contrast. 3. **Embossing/Debossing**: Creating raised or recessed relief images and designs in the card stock. 4. **Metallic Inks**: Using inks that contain metallic particles, giving the printed areas a metallic sheen. 5. **Textured Prints**: Incorporating physical texture into the card's surface, whether through the card stock itself or through post-print finishes. While the list covers a broad spectrum of effects, it's important to note that the technology and creativity in card game printing are continually evolving. Manufacturers and designers are always looking for new ways to surprise and delight collectors and players, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with card aesthetics. Thus, while this list is extensive, it is by no means exhaustive, and future innovations will likely add to it. It's also worth mentioning that while certain effects are aimed at increasing the luxury appeal of the cards, the communality of such effects is directly influenced by their rarity and the community's perception. In MTG and other TCGs, limited-run prints, artist signatures, or cards from the initial print run can also highly impact a card's desirability and perceived luxury, independent of the specific printing or typographic techniques used."},{"prompt":"Перепишите на русском языке предоставленный текст, сохраняя его общий смысл и структуру, но используя: Разнообразную лексику, Перефразирование и переформулирование предложений, Изменение порядка слов и структуры предложений, Улучшение читабельности и удобочитаемости, Сохранение точности и ясности исходного текста.

Вот сам текст: Editors' notes This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies. Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread Chinese scientists have recently achieved the direct synthesis of high-purity benzaldehyde chemicals from the selective electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol. The organic-solid-water (OSW) three-phase reaction system has shown particular advantages in reducing ohmic losses and simplifying product separation and purification processes compared to conventional H-type electrochemical cells. The study, published online in Science Advances, was conducted by Profs. Zhang Tierui and Shi Run from the Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Electrocatalysis in aqueous electrolyte has been recognized as a green method for organic redox reactions, since water is a clean hydrogen and oxygen resource. However, due to the poor solubility of a variety of organics in the aqueous phase, multistep dilution-reaction-purification processes are required in most cases. As a result, there is still a barrier to the widespread adoption of electrocatalysis within the organic synthesis community. \\"For example, the electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde typically requires nonaqueous supporting electrolytes and solvents, which significantly increases the reaction overpotential, complicates the purification process, and causes overoxidation to acid during prolonged electrolysis,\\" said Prof. Zhang Tierui. \\"The goal of our research is to develop a three-phase OSW electrocatalytic system for the efficient production of high-purity benzaldehyde. The new system features separate organic and water phases instead of an organic-in-water configuration in conventional H-type cells. It allows rapid supply of concentrated benzyl alcohol directly from the organic phase,\\" said Prof. Shi Run. In this work, benzyl alcohol (9.3 mol/L) was used at concentrations over 90 times higher than the alcohol used in previous studies. It achieved a 97% Faradaic efficiency for benzaldehyde production and obtained high-purity benzaldehyde (91.7%) in the organic phase without any post-purification processes. Electrodes with superwetting OSW interfaces can spontaneously separate organic and aqueous solutions. In this case, the benzaldehyde product is collected directly in the organic phase. This has two advantages: suppressing benzaldehyde overoxidation with aqueous electrolyte and obtaining high purity benzaldehyde when benzyl alcohol is completely converted in the organic phase. Electrosynthesis via superwetting OSW interfaces is therefore a desirable way to produce high-purity organic compounds. Even better, it uses clean energy and water resources, and it makes the reaction more efficient and less complicated. More information: Run Shi et al, Electrochemical oxidation of concentrated benzyl alcohol to high-purity benzaldehyde via superwetting organic-solid-water interfaces, Science Advances (2024). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adn0947 Journal information: Science Advances Provided by Chinese Academy of Sciences","completion":"Статья, опубликованная в журнале Science Advances, освещает последние достижения китайских ученых в области прямого синтеза высокочистого бензальдегида из бензилового спирта путем выборочной электроокислительной реакции. Исследование было проведено профессорами Занг Тиеруи и Ши Рун из Технического института физики и химии Китайской академии наук (КАН). Они разработали систему реакции в трех фазах: органическая-твердая-водная (OSW), которая демонстрирует существенные преимущества по сравнению с традиционными электрохимическими ячейками типа H. Основные преимущества заключаются в сокращении омических потерь и упрощении процессов разделения и очистки продукта. Электрокатализ в водном электролите считается экологически безопасным методом для органических окислительно-восстановительных реакций, так как вода является чистым источником водорода и кислорода. Однако сложность использования электрокатализа в органическом синтезе заключается в низкой растворимости большинства органических соединений в воде, что требует многоступенчатых процессов разбавления, реакции и очистки. Это создает препятствия для широкого внедрения электрокатализа в синтезе органических веществ. Профессора указывают на то, что электроокисление бензилового спирта до бензальдегида обычно требует использования неводных поддерживающих электролитов и растворителей, что существенно увеличивает перенапряжение реакции, усложняет процесс очистки и приводит к переокислению до кислоты при длительном электролизе. Цель этого исследования заключается в разработке трехфазной системы электрокатализа OSW для эффективного производства высокочистого бензальдегида. Новая система отличается отдельным расположением органической фазы и водной фазы вместо традиционного расположения органика-в-воде в обычных ячейках типа H, что позволяет быстро подавать концентрированный бензиловый спирт непосредственно из органической фазы. В этом исследовании был использован бензиловый спирт концентрацией 9.3 моль/л, что более чем в 90 раз превышает концентрацию, использованную в предыдущих исследованиях, достигнуто 97% фарадеевой эффективности производства бензальдегида и получен высокочистый бензальдегид (91.7%) в органической фазе без каких-либо процессов последующей очистки. Электроды с суперсмачивающими интерфейсами OSW позволяют спонтанно разделять органические и водные растворы, что делает возможным прямой сбор продукта бензальдегида в органической фазе. Это обеспечивает два важных преимущества: предотвращение переокисления бензальдегида в водном электролите и получение высокочистого бензальдегида при полном превращении бензилового спирта в органической фазе. Таким образом, электросинтез с использованием интерфейсов OSW представляет собой желательный метод для производства высокочистых органических соединений, обладающий дополнительными преимуществами в виде использования чистой энергии и водных ресурсов, а также повышения эффективности и упрощения реакции."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Un ejemplo fue el inicio de la construcción del Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de México, aunque este proyecto luego sería cancelado por la administración siguiente. 4. **Educación:** La reforma educativa buscó mejorar la calidad de la educación en México, estableciendo evaluaciones para maestros y cambios en el sistema de asignación de plazas docentes, con el fin de hacerlo más meritocrático. 5. **Captura de criminales:** Durante su administración, se logró la captura de varios líderes de carteles de droga, lo más notable siendo Joaquín \\"El Chapo\\" Guzmán en 2014 (aunque posteriormente se fugó en 2015, y fue recapturado en 2016). Cabe mencionar que muchas de estas acciones y políticas han sido objeto de debate. Las reformas tuvieron tanto defensores como detractores, y los resultados y beneficios reales han sido analizados y discutidos ampliamente. La percepción pública y la evaluación de su presidencia varían significativamente entre diferentes sectores de la sociedad."},{"prompt":"Who created the worlds first working nuclear reactor?","completion":"The world's first working nuclear reactor, known as Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), was created under the leadership of Enrico Fermi. The reactor went critical on December 2, 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project during World War II. This event took place at the University of Chicago, under the stands of the Stagg Field football stadium. CP-1 represented the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and marked a significant milestone in the development of nuclear energy and atomic weapons."},{"prompt":"What about the worlds first fully operation nuclear reactor?","completion":"The world's first fully operational nuclear reactor, intended for producing electricity on a commercial scale, was the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant in the Soviet Union. It became operational on June 27, 1954. The plant was located in the city of Obninsk, about 110 kilometers southwest of Moscow, and had a capacity of around 5 megawatts electric power. Obninsk served as a prototype and proof of concept for future nuclear power plants, marking the beginning of the civilian use of nuclear energy. While there were earlier reactors designed for research, plutonium production, or other purposes, Obninsk was the first to contribute electricity to a national grid, making it a significant step forward in the history of nuclear power."},{"prompt":"When and how did the Americans first learn about the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant?","completion":"The United States first learned about the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant through espionage activities and intelligence sources. The exact moment of this discovery is not precisely documented in public sources, but it was during the early stages of the Cold War when both the United States and the Soviet Union were highly secretive about their nuclear capabilities and advancements. During this time, both superpowers were actively spying on each other to gather intelligence on military, technological, and scientific developments. The U.S. intelligence community, including the CIA, utilized various methods to collect information, such as signal intercepts, satellite imagery, and human intelligence (spies and informants). Given the secretive nature of the Soviet Union's nuclear program, specific details about how and when the U.S. first learned of the Obninsk plant might not be fully disclosed. However, it is well-known that the Soviet Union publicly announced the existence of the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant shortly after it began operations in 1954, as part of their propaganda to showcase the peaceful use of nuclear energy. This public announcement would have confirmed any prior intelligence the Americans had gathered about the facility. The opening of the Obninsk plant was a significant moment in the \\"Atoms for Peace\\" era, where both superpowers started to promote the non-military uses of nuclear energy, despite the ongoing arms race."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

Важно понимать основные отличительные признаки, чтобы корректно поддержать детей и определить подходящие направления в их обучении и развитии. # Основные отличия: 1. **Причины и изменчивость симптомов**: - **Задержка психического развития** часто связана с временными факторами, такими как нехватка стимуляции в раннем возрасте или задержки развития из-за физических заболеваний. Симптомы могут уменьшаться или полностью исчезать по мере роста и развития ребенка и под влиянием коррекционной работы. - **Интеллектуальная недостаточность** часто связана с постоянными факторами, такими как генетические нарушения, серьезные инфекции или травмы в период беременности и родов. Проявления интеллектуальной недостаточности обычно стабильны и сохраняются на протяжении всей жизни. 2. **Уровень интеллекта**: - Дети с **ЗПР** могут иметь колебания в уровне интеллекта, который может улучшаться при соответствующей стимуляции и обучении. - Дети с **интеллектуальной недостаточностью** имеют стабильно низкий уровень интеллекта, который значительно затрудняет или ограничивает их способность к обучению в сравнении со сверстниками. 3. **Адаптивные функции**: - **ЗПР**: Проблемы в адаптации часто связаны с отсутствием определенных навыков или знаний, которые могут быть развиты с течением времени. - **Интеллектуальная недостаточность**: Затруднения в адаптивных функциях, таких как самообслуживание, общение, учеба и работа, более глубокие и постоянные. 4. **Общение и социальное взаимодействие**: - Дети с **ЗПР** могут иметь временные трудности в социальных навыках, которые улучшаются с возрастом и через социальное обучение. - Дети с **интеллектуальной недостаточностью** часто испытывают более значительные и стойкие проблемы в общении и взаимодействии с окружающими. 5. **Реакция на обучение и коррекцию**: - **ЗПР**: Обычно положительная динамика при целенаправленной педагогической и психологической поддержке. - **Интеллектуальная недостаточность**: Нуждается в специфических подходах к обучению, включая адаптированные программы и возможно постоянную поддержку. # Важно: При любых подозрениях на ЗПР или интеллектуальную недостаточность, решающее значение имеет комплексная оценка ситуации специалистами: педиатрами, психологами, неврологами и психиатрами. Только на основании детального обследования и наблюдения можно поставить точный диагноз и выбрать оптимальную стратегию коррекции и поддержки ребенка."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Understanding product functionality: By analyzing the product's functionality without disassembling it, engineers can gain insights into how the product works, its overall design, and how its different components interact with each other. This understanding is crucial for successfully reverse engineering the product and creating an accurate representation. 2. Preservation of the original product: Non-destructive analysis allows the product to remain intact, preserving its original condition. This can be beneficial for future reference, comparison with the reverse-engineered version, or for further testing and analysis. 3. Identification of critical components: Through non-destructive analysis, engineers can identify key components and features of the product that play a critical role in its functionality. This information can help guide the disassembly process and ensure that important components are not damaged or overlooked. 4. Risk mitigation: By conducting a non-destructive analysis first, engineers can assess potential risks associated with disassembly, such as delicate components, complex assemblies, or hidden features. This information can help minimize the risk of damaging the product during the reverse engineering process. 5.

For simplicity, this app will use an in-memory storage mechanism. To expand on this, you could integrate a database and a front-end interface. Here's a basic, console-based Todo app in Go. 1. **Define a Todo Model**: First, we define our Todo item structure. 2. **Setup Basic Operations**: We'll implement functions to create, list, update, and delete Todos. Create a new file named \`main.go\` and add the following Go code: \`\`\`go package main import ( \\"bufio\\" \\"fmt\\" \\"os\\" \\"strconv\\" \\"strings\\" ) // Todo represents a todo item with an ID and a task description. type Todo struct { ID int Description string Completed bool } // TodoList is a slice of Todo items. var TodoList []Todo var nextID int = 1 // CreateTodo adds a new todo to the TodoList. func CreateTodo(description string) { TodoList = append(TodoList, Todo{ID: nextID, Description: description}) nextID++ } // ListTodos prints all todos to the console. func ListTodos() { for _, todo := range TodoList { completedStatus := \\"not completed\\" if todo.Completed { completedStatus = \\"completed\\" } fmt.Printf(\\"%d: %s [%s]n\\", todo.ID, todo.Description, completedStatus) } } // CompleteTodo marks a todo as completed. func CompleteTodo(id int) { for i, todo := range TodoList { if todo.ID == id { TodoList[i].Completed = true fmt.Println(\\"Todo completed!\\") return } } fmt.Println(\\"Todo with specified ID not found.\\") } // DeleteTodo removes a todo by its ID. func DeleteTodo(id int) { for i, todo := range TodoList { if todo.ID == id { TodoList = append(TodoList[:i], TodoList[i+1:]...) fmt.Println(\\"Todo deleted!\\") return } } fmt.Println(\\"Todo with specified ID not found.\\") } func main() { scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin) for { fmt.Println(\\"nTodo App\\") fmt.Println(\\"1. Add Todo\\") fmt.Println(\\"2. List Todos\\") fmt.Println(\\"3. Complete Todo\\") fmt.Println(\\"4. Delete Todo\\") fmt.Println(\\"5. Exit\\") fmt.Print(\\"nEnter choice: \\") scanner.Scan() choice := scanner.Text() switch choice { case \\"1\\": fmt.Print(\\"Enter todo description: \\") scanner.Scan() CreateTodo(scanner.Text()) case \\"2\\": ListTodos() case \\"3\\": fmt.Print(\\"Enter todo ID to complete: \\") scanner.Scan() id, _ := strconv.Atoi(scanner.Text()) CompleteTodo(id) case \\"4\\": fmt.Print(\\"Enter todo ID to delete: \\") scanner.Scan() id, _ := strconv.Atoi(scanner.Text()) DeleteTodo(id) case \\"5\\": fmt.Println(\\"Exiting...\\") return default: fmt.Println(\\"Invalid choice, please choose again.\\") } } } \`\`\` This console application allows you to: - Add a new todo. - List all todos with their completion status. - Mark a specific todo as completed. - Delete a specific todo by its ID. To run this application, you should have Go installed on your system. Save the file, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing \`main.go\`, and run \`go run main.go\`. You will then be able to interact with the Todo app through the console. The given code snippet is a foundational start. For a real-world application, consider adding: - Persistent storage with a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. - A web-based front end using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Go's \`net/http\` package for handling HTTP requests. - Enhanced error handling for robustness. - User authentication and authorization for personalized todo lists. This will require a deeper dive into Go's capabilities, including its standard library and external packages for web development like Gorilla Mux or Echo for routing, and GORM or another ORM for database interactions."},{"prompt":"how i can create a golang duolingo-like website??????????","completion":"Creating a Duolingo-like language learning website is a substantial project that involves multiple layers of development, including back-end logic, database management, user interface design, and possibly speech recognition integration. Given the complexity, I'll outline a high-level approach to get started with such a project in Go, focusing on key components and technologies you might use. # 1. Planning Your Application First, identify the core features of your application. A Duolingo-like website might include: - User registration and authentication - Course structure (Languages, Lessons, Levels) - User progress tracking - Quizzes and exercises - Gamification elements (e.g., points, levels) - Speech recognition for pronunciation exercises # 2. Choosing the Tech Stack **Back-end**: Go (Golang) for server-side logic. **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use frameworks like React or Vue.js for a more dynamic experience. **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB. Choose based on your familiarity and the data structure needs of your application. **Speech Recognition**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Mozilla DeepSpeech, or any other competent API for integrating speech recognition. **Authentication**: Use packages like \`golang.org/x/oauth2\`, \`github.com/go-oauth2/oauth2\` for OAuth, or \`github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go\` for JWT authentication. **Web Frameworks**: Consider using Echo, Gin, or Beego for routing and middleware support. # 3. Setting Up Your Development Environment - Install Go and set up your GOPATH. - Choose an IDE or code editor, like Visual Studio Code, that supports Go development. - Set up your database and any other infrastructure components (like Docker containers, if you're using them). # 4. Building the Application User Registration and Authentication Implement user registration and authentication first. Use Go's \`net/http\` package for handling HTTP requests and responses, and choose an authentication method (JWT is a popular choice). Database Schema Design your database schema: - Users (ID, username, email, password hash, etc.) - Languages (ID, name, etc.) - Lessons (ID, language ID, content, etc.) - User Progress (user ID, lesson ID, completion status, points, etc.) Course Structure Develop the logic to create and organize courses, lessons, and levels. Each course could be a sequence of lessons stored in your database, with each lesson containing various exercises. Quizzes and Exercises Create different types of quizzes and exercises. You'll need to handle user inputs, validate answers, and provide feedback. This might involve complex logic, especially for exercises that require pattern matching or speech recognition. Front-end Development Build a user-friendly front-end. You can serve your front-end assets through Go using the \`http.FileServer\` or integrate with a front-end build setup like Create React App for a SPA (Single Page Application). Speech Recognition Integrate a speech recognition API to add pronunciation exercises. You will need to capture audio input from the user, send it to the API, and handle the response. # 5. Testing Thoroughly test your application. This includes unit tests in Go (using the \`testing\` package), front-end tests (if you're using JavaScript frameworks, they often come with their testing solutions like Jest for React), and integration tests to ensure all parts of your application work well together. # 6. Deployment Choose a hosting provider or cloud service (AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku) to deploy your application. Ensure your deployment environment is secure, especially regarding user data and authentication mechanisms. # Final Thoughts Building a Duolingo-like website is an ambitious project that can significantly grow in complexity as you add features. Starting small and gradually adding functionalities, ensuring robust testing at each step, will be key to successfully developing a complex web application like this with Go. Remember, while Go is fantastic for the back-end, creating an interactive and engaging front-end will rely heavily on JavaScript and modern web technologies. Combining both effectively will be crucial for the success of your web app."},{"prompt":"Use this Q&A to write a blog about Britalia Clarke. It should be light and inspiring.

Работа с детьми с ЗПР требует междисциплинарного подхода, в который должны быть вовлечены психологи, педагоги, логопеды, врачи и, конечно, родители. Эффективность интервенций значительно повышается при раннем выявлении проблем и начале коррекционной работы."},{"prompt":"is it okay to use a pressure relief valve as a pressure regulator","completion":"No, it is generally not advisable to use a pressure relief valve as a pressure regulator. While both devices are related to controlling pressure in a system, they serve different purposes and operate in different ways. Here’s why it’s important to distinguish between them and use each device for its intended purpose: 1. **Purpose and Function:** - A **pressure relief valve** is designed to provide safety in systems by relieving excess pressure once a certain pressure limit is exceeded. Its primary goal is to prevent the system from failing or bursting by releasing some of the pressure. It is not designed to control or regulate the pressure within a system under normal operating conditions. - A **pressure regulator**, on the other hand, is designed to maintain a constant output pressure regardless of variations in the input pressure. It is used to regulate the pressure within a system to ensure the proper operation of the system components downstream. 2. **Operation:** - Pressure relief valves are typically either fully open or fully closed. They open at a set pressure limit to quickly release excess pressure and close once the system pressure is reduced to a safe level. - Pressure regulators modulate the flow of the fluid to maintain a constant pressure downstream, adjusting continuously as needed to keep the outlet pressure within a specific range. 3. **Accuracy and Stability:** - Since pressure relief valves are intended for safety and not for continuous pressure control, they are not designed to maintain a specific pressure level with high accuracy. - Pressure regulators are designed for precise control of downstream pressure and are better suited for applications where maintaining a stable pressure is crucial for the operation of the system. 4. **Safety Concerns:** - Using a pressure relief valve as a pressure regulator could lead to unsafe conditions. If the system pressure exceeds the relief setting of the valve too frequently, it can lead to premature wear and potentially fail to operate correctly when needed most. - Additionally, relying on a relief valve to regulate system pressure might compromise the safety mechanisms intended to protect against overpressure conditions. In conclusion, while both devices relate to pressure control within a system, their roles, designs, and operating principles differ significantly. For effective and safe control of system pressure, it’s essential to use a pressure regulator for regulating pressure and a pressure relief valve for safety against overpressure conditions. Always choose the right tool for the job to ensure system integrity and safety."},{"prompt":"Is there a reference in API that says you can't use a pressure safety valve as a pressure regulator?","completion":"API (American Petroleum Institute) standards are comprehensive and widely respected across the oil, gas, and petrochemical industries, providing guidelines for the design, operation, and maintenance of various equipment and systems. Regarding the use of pressure safety valves (PSVs) and their distinction from pressure regulators, specific API standards and guidelines, like API 520 (Part I & II) for the sizing and selection of PSVs, and API 521 for pressure relieving and depressuring systems, emphasize the functionality, design, and application of safety devices, including PSVs. While API standards themselves are detailed documents that require direct access to exact text for precise language, the underlying principle distinguishing PSVs (including pressure relief valves, safety valves, and safety relief valves) from pressure regulators is rooted in their design and intended purpose. Here’s a general explanation based on the principles covered in API and related standards: - **API 520 (Part I & II)** covers the sizing and selection of Pressure Relief Devices (PRDs). These standards delve into designing systems that need PRDs for overpressure protection. The focus is on how to select and size valves that can prevent system overpressure, protecting equipment from potential damage or failure due to excessive pressure. - **API 521** covers pressure-relieving and depressuring systems. It gives guidelines on when and how to use pressure relief devices, including safety considerations and system design parameters. While these documents provide guidelines on the use of PRDs for safety and overpressure protection, they inherently distinguish the function of PRDs from that of pressure regulators: 1. **Purpose and Functionality Divergence**: A pressure safety valve (PSV) is designed to release pressure quickly to prevent a system from exceeding its maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) and causing potential equipment failure or safety hazards. In contrast, a pressure regulator’s role is to control and maintain a set pressure level, adjusting the flow to compensate for upstream pressure variations. 2. **Operational Difference**: PSVs are typically designed to be in a closed position during normal operation and to open only under an overpressure condition. Pressure regulators constantly adjust to maintain downstream pressure within a desired range. While the API standards may not state verbatim, \\"You can't use a pressure safety valve as a pressure regulator,\\" the engineering principles, supported by industry standards and best practices, clearly define and separate the roles of these devices. The misuse of a PSV as a pressure regulator would contradict its design principles and safety purposes, potentially leading to system performance issues and safety risks. For precise regulatory text or more detailed guidance, consulting the specific API standards and guidelines directly would be advisable."},{"prompt":"Hilariously badly translate my text in these different styles: Misheard, Opposite, part of the quote that sounds either funny rude innuendos or out of context and a hilarious description with it, and Angry Video Game Nerd’s list of rants on the quote: (add the original text at the beginning though) \\"Ooh!

Ниже представлены некоторые из этих подходов. # 1. Простое разрушение Этот метод подразумевает замену целого объекта на несколько заранее подготовленных фрагментов при определенных условиях (например, при столкновении). 1. **Подготовка фрагментов**: Сначала вам нужно создать фрагменты вашего объекта. Это можно сделать во внешнем 3D редакторе, таком как Blender. Разбейте модель на части и импортируйте их в Unity. 2. **Создание префабов**: Сделайте префабы как для целого объекта, так и для всех фрагментов. 3. **Скрипт разрушения**: Напишите скрипт, который будет уничтожать целый объект и на его месте создавать все фрагменты. Для этого используйте \`Instantiate()\` для создания фрагментов и \`Destroy()\` для удаления исходного объекта. # 2. Использование физических шейдеров и эффектов Этот подход использует шейдеры для имитации разрушений. Он менее ресурсоемкий и может быть использован для создания визуального эффекта разрушения без реального разделения объекта на части. 1. **Шейдеры**: Создайте или найдите подходящий шейдер, который будет имитировать разрушение объекта. 2. **Скрипт управления**: Ваш скрипт может контролировать параметры шейдера в зависимости от внешних событий, имитируя тем самым разрушение. # 3. Unity Physics (PhysX) и Destructible Objects Используя более продвинутые физические расчеты, вы можете создать объекты, которые будут реально реагировать на столкновения и внешние силы, разрушаясь при этом. 1. **Композитная разрушаемость**: Разделите ваш объект на мелкие части в редакторе, и используйте Rigidbody и Colliders для каждой из них. 2. **Скрипты и триггеры**: Создайте скрипт, который активирует разрушение при определенных условиях, таких как достижение определенной силы удара. # 4. Плагины и готовые решения На Unity Asset Store доступно множество готовых плагинов и инструментов для реализации разрушаемых объектов. Эти инструменты могут предложить готовые к использованию решения для имитации разрушений без необходимости вникать в сложные детали реализации. # Общие советы - **Оптимизация**: Учитывайте производительность. Разрушаемость увеличивает нагрузку на процессор и графический процессор. Попробуйте балансировать между визуальным качеством и производительностью. - **Тестирование**: Обширное тестирование на различном оборудовании поможет обеспечить, что ваша логика разрушения работает корректно и не вызывает снижения производительности. Разработка логики разрушения в Unity — это креативный процесс, который может значительно отличаться в зависимости от требований вашего проекта и доступных ресурсов.

Given that liquid nitrogen is colorless, if we were to visualize an \\"ocean\\" of it under natural light conditions, it might not have a distinctive color in the way we think of water having a blue hue due to the absorption and scattering of light. Thus, using a hex color to represent liquid nitrogen might involve choosing a color that signifies clarity or the lack of color. A reasonable approximation could be: #FFFFFF (White) – to signify the colorless, clear nature of liquid nitrogen. This choice reflects the absence of color rather than an actual hue associated with liquid nitrogen itself.

However, without access to the specific textbook you're referencing, it's important to understand that these guidelines align well with principles meant to reduce errors in human-computer interaction: 1. **The system should behave as an experienced user expects.** - Ensuring consistency with user expectations reduces errors. 2. **A workload that is too low can be dangerous.** - This is less commonly cited but is notably important in fields like aviation, where too little engagement can lead to decreased situational awareness. 3. **The user must have sufficient understanding of the system.** - Essential for preventing misuse or error. 4. **Alarms, warnings, and error messages must be clear and appropriate.** - Critical for immediate user recognition and response. 5. **The user needs feedback to understand what the system is doing at any time.** - Feedback helps users make informed decisions and take appropriate actions. Given these options, **\\"a workload that is too low can be dangerous\\"** might seem less directly related to interface design compared to the others.

He enters the pond au naturel (compliment his butt and physique). Describe how he looks as he lets out a humongous and smelly fart into the water, visibly relieved. He collects all the fish that went belly-up from the stench to cook for dinner.","completion":"In the heart of the Shire, under the golden embrace of a dawn only the green hills of Hobbiton could cradle, Frodo Baggins embarked upon the sacred morning ritual that marked the start of all his adventures, great and small. This was not the tale of a dark lord or magical rings, but of a Hobbit and his remarkably peculiar, yet oddly endearing, pre-breakfast endeavor. As the first rays of sunlight pierced through the windows of Bag End, illuminating the dust motes dancing like tiny, lazy fireflies, Frodo stretched his petite, yet surprisingly nimble frame atop his cozy Hobbit-sized bed. His curly locks were a tousled mess, framing a face that bore the soft glow of innocence yet carried the wisdom of his perilous journey to Mount Doom. Clad in a nightshirt that whispered tales of many a comfortable slumber, Frodo yawned mightily, his day beginning not with heroic deeds, but with the simple act of making his bed with precision that could rival the most meticulous of Elves. Descending the circular stairs, humming a tune that seemed to resonate with the very soul of the Shire, he embarked upon the daily rites of personal cleanliness with a vigor that only Hobbits possess. Breakfast, a feast worthy of royalty, consisting of eggs, bacon, sausages, and several rounds of toast, was consumed with the gusto of one preparing for a long day's toil. But this particular morning held a task of unprecedented importance, a task that Frodo approached with a mix of determination and bemusement. Frodo, in all his Hobbitish splendor, sauntered towards what he lovingly termed his \\"toilet pond,\\" a quaint, naturally occurring pool of water connected by a babbling brook to the nearby Brandywine River. It was here, in nature's embrace, that Frodo found solace for his morning needs. With the same courage that had him face a Nazgûl, he shed his garments, revealing a physique that Balrogs might envy but Hobbits found rather fetching - especially the pertness of his behind, which even in the soft, forgiving light of the morning had a certain sculptural quality, reminiscent of the fine statues of Elves but with a much more comfortable, homely charm. Positioning himself with the grace of an Elven dancer, Frodo let out a sigh of content. This was followed by a sound that would make a Cave Troll blush - a monumental, ground-shaking fart that rippled through the serene waters of the pond, a declaration of relief so potent, it seemed to echo through the valleys of the Misty Mountains. The water roiled and bubbled as if the Lady of the Lake herself was about to emerge, albeit, probably retreating instantly at the offending odor. Miraculously, as if by some dark sorcery, the fish of the pond, erstwhile happily swimming, took to belly-up floating, stunned into a temporary state of defeat by the aromatic potency of Frodo's relief. With a twinkle in his eye, Frodo, ever the resourceful Hobbit, gathered the afflicted fish, contemplating a dinner that would surely be the talk of the Green Dragon Inn for ages to come. Thus concluded Frodo Baggins’ morning ritual, a tale not of dark lords and magical rings, but of Hobbits and their delightfully human (or should we say Hobbit) ways. Returning home with his bounty, his heart was light, his belly empty, and his pantry soon to be filled with the spoils of a morning well spent. The Shire continued its sleepy, idyllic existence, unaware of the small, yet distinctly funny battles fought and won within its emerald embrace."},{"prompt":"Which is the LEAST compelling reason for being honest in a professional computing environment?

La restricción principal aquí es cómo interactuar de manera efectiva con los usuarios a través de los cuadros de diálogo de UI mientras se manejan los cambios en los datos de la hoja de cálculo de forma adecuada. Una limitación clave de los Triggers simples como \`onEdit\` es que su funcionalidad está diseñada para ser rápida y no intrusiva, lo que significa que no es ideal para interacciones complejas de usuario que incluyen esperar a que los usuarios proporcionen input a través de un cuadro de diálogo. Además, la información como el \\"nuevo valor\\" no se conserva entre las ejecuciones de las funciones que se llaman en respuesta a los eventos de edición, ya que el contexto del evento solo existe durante la ejecución de la llamada inicial a la función. Para separar lógicamente las partes de obtener los datos viejos y nuevos, y luego solicitar la contraseña sin perder el contexto de los datos, necesitarías implantar una solidad lógica o almacenamiento temporal que conserva estos datos a través de las interacciones. Pero, este enfoque directo tiene sus desafíos y limitaciones dentro del entorno de Apps Script y particularmente con triggers simples. Una manera de manejar esto dentro de las limitaciones, aunque no es perfecta y puede no cubrir todas las interacciones de usuario deseables, sería separar la funcionalidad en pasos y usar propiedades o algún tipo de almacenamiento para mantener el estado a través de invocaciones de funciones: 1. **onEdit captura y revierte el cambio** inmediatamente. 2. **Almacenamos el valor antiguo y nuevo** temporalmente, posiblemente usando las Propiedades del Documento o del Usuario (aunque esto tiene limitaciones de seguridad y escalabilidad). 3. **Solicitar la contraseña como una acción separada** (posiblemente a través de un menú personalizado o un botón dentro de la hoja) que luego verifica y, si es correcta, re-aplica el cambio. Aquí hay una esquematización básica de cómo podría verse: \`\`\`javascript function onEdit(e) { // Paso 1: Capturar y revertir inmediatamente el cambio var range = e.range; var sheet = range.getSheet(); if (sheet.getName() === \\"Orden de Produccion\\" && range.getRow() <= 10 && range.getColumn() <= 9) { var properties = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties(); // Almacenar el valor antiguo, el nuevo valor y las coordenadas de la celda properties.setProperty('oldValue', e.oldValue ? e.oldValue : ''); properties.setProperty('newValue', e.value); properties.setProperty('editedCell', range.getA1Notation()); // Revertir el cambio range.setValue(e.oldValue ? e.oldValue : ''); } } function checkPasswordAndRestore() { var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi(); var passwordPrompt = ui.prompt('Enter the password to confirm changes:'); var passwordAttempt = passwordPrompt.getResponseText(); if (passwordPrompt.getSelectedButton() !== ui.Button.CLOSE) { var correctPassword = '#Dayu41193saas'; // La contraseña correcta if (passwordAttempt === correctPassword) { // Si la contraseña es correcta, obtener y aplicar el valor nuevo desde las propiedades var properties = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties(); var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet(); var cell = sheet.getRange(properties.getProperty('editedCell')); cell.setValue(properties.getProperty('newValue')); ui.alert('Password correct! Changes accepted.'); } else { ui.alert('Incorrect password. No changes made.'); } } } \`\`\` Y añade un menú personalizado o un botón de alguna forma que llame a \`checkPasswordAndRestore()\` después de un intento de edición. **Nota:** Este enfoque tiene varias limitaciones y es más una ilustración conceptual que una solución completa. Por ejemplo, no maneja adecuadamente múltiples ediciones concurrentes por diferentes usuarios, ya que el almacenamiento de propiedades es común para el script y podría ser sobrescrito por ediciones sucesivas. Para una implementación en un entorno de producción, considera cuidadosamente las implicaciones de seguridad y diseño."},{"prompt":"Hilariously badly translate my text in these different styles: Misheard, Opposite, snippet of the original quote that sounds either funny rude innuendos or out of context and a hilarious description with it, and Angry Video Game Nerd’s list of 4 rants on the quote: (add the original text at the beginning though) “He-ey, Mario, buddy, howzit goin’?

This program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding primes, which is efficient for generating a list of primes.

It checks divisibility only up to the square root of the number in question (optimized by stopping at the first prime that would exceed the square root) to improve efficiency."},{"prompt":"Make the program fastest","completion":"To make the program for finding the first 100 prime numbers as fast as possible, considering the direct and straightforward approach without using auxiliary libraries and ensuring the program is efficiently leveraging basic optimizations, we can stick with the approach of checking divisibility but optimize how we handle each candidate number for being prime. Here's an optimized version that minimizes the number of divisibility checks: \`\`\`python def is_prime(n, primes): for prime in primes: if prime * prime > n: return True if n % prime == 0: return False return True def find_first_100_primes(): if 100 < 1: # if somehow the task was to find less than 1 prime. return [] primes = [2] # Starting list with the first prime number = 3 # Starting from the first odd number to check for primality while len(primes) < 100: if is_prime(number, primes): primes.append(number) number += 2 # Increment by 2 to only check odd numbers return primes first_100_primes = find_first_100_primes() print(first_100_primes) \`\`\` **Optimizations Made:** - **Skipping Even Numbers**: This version starts with \`2\` in the primes list and then increments by 2 (starting at 3), skipping all even numbers, as they are not prime (except for 2). This effectively halves the search space. - **Square Root Stop**: In the \`is_prime\`, it exits the loop as soon as it finds a prime factor greater than the square root of \`n\`, which is an efficient cut-off because if \`n\` is not prime, it will have a factor less than or equal to its square root. - **Incremental Checking**: By carrying forward the found primes, each new number is only checked against primes found so far, which are the only candidates needed to determine primality (instead of all numbers up to \`n\`).

When it comes to threading, boring can be specifically used to accurately enlarge the diameter of a hole to a precise size, which is essential for the next step of threading, whether internal or external. For establishing the internal thread, boring prepares the hole to the exact minor diameter needed before the tapping process, which actually creates the thread. Tapping then cuts the thread into the bore that has been prepared. Therefore, while boring doesn't directly establish the internal thread, it plays a crucial role in preparing the necessary accurate size and finish of the hole that's essential for a quality thread to be produced by tapping."},{"prompt":"Boring can be used to establish which part of the internal thread? Major Diameter Pitch Diameter Minor Diameter","completion":"Boring is used to accurately enlarge a pre-existing hole to a specific diameter. When it comes to establishing parts of an internal thread, boring directly influences the **Minor Diameter**.

The \\"2B\\" designation refers to the tolerance and fit for internal threads, indicating a standard level of tightness and clearance suited for general applications. Given the options: A. 1.245 - 1.250 B. 1.160 - 1.178 C. 1.2482 - 1.2368 And knowing that the question pertains to the minor diameter range of an internal thread (where the minor diameter is the smallest diameter of the thread), the correct choice must align with standard minor diameter sizes for a 1 1/4\\" - 12 2B internal thread. Option B, 1.160 - 1.178, is the correct answer. This range typically represents a realistic minor diameter range for a 1 1/4\\" - 12 internal thread fit, considering that option A and C are likely too close to the nominal diameter of 1.250\\" to allow for actual thread cutting, or they incorrectly represent the minor diameter values which don't align with standard engineering references for a thread of this specification.

A. chip evacuation B. chatter C. tapered sizes","completion":"A common problem with internal machining work, such as boring, is **B. chatter**. Chatter refers to the vibration or oscillation that occurs between the workpiece and the cutting tool, leading to poor surface finish, inaccurate dimensions, and potentially damaging both the cutting tool and the workpiece. A solution to minimize or eliminate chatter is to decrease the revolutions per minute (RPM) of the cutting tool. Lowering the RPM can reduce the frequency of the vibrations, allowing for a more stable cutting action. Additionally, optimizing feed rates, using sharper cutting tools, increasing tool rigidity, and ensuring proper clamping and support of the workpiece can also help in reducing chatter."},{"prompt":"Internal threads are best inspected with a _________.

At the ends of the chromosomes are stretches of DNA called telomeres, which protect our genetic data, make it possible for cells to divide, and hold some secrets to how we age and get cancer. Telomeres have been compared with the plastic tips on shoelaces, because they keep chromosome ends from fraying and sticking to each other, which would destroy or scramble an organism's genetic information. Yet, each time a cell divides, the telomeres get shorter. When they get too short, the cell can no longer divide; it becomes inactive or \\"senescent\\" or it dies.

If your keyboard has a 3.5mm output, you might need a 3.5mm to 1/4-inch adapter or cable. 2. **Interface Input**: Connect the other end of the cable into an appropriate input on your audio interface. If your keyboard output is stereo and you want to maintain that in your recordings, ensure you use two inputs on your audio interface (if available) and appropriate cables to split the stereo signal. 3. **Gain Setting**: Adjust the input gain on your audio interface for the keyboard channel(s). You'll want to ensure the signal is strong enough for a good recording level but not so high that it causes distortion or clipping. # Setting Up the DAW: 1. **Audio Interface Selection**: Open your DAW and go into its audio settings or preferences. Here, select your audio interface as both the input and output device. This step ensures that the DAW will capture audio from the interface and send playback through the interface to your speakers or headphones. 2. **Create a New Track**: In your DAW, create a new track for recording. If your keyboard is connected as a stereo source, make sure to set up a stereo track to capture both left and right channels. If it's mono, a mono track will suffice. 3. **Arm the Track for Recording**: Before you can record, you'll need to arm the track for recording, usually by clicking a \\"record arm\\" button on the track itself. This tells the DAW that you want to capture audio on this specific track. 4. **Monitoring**: Enable software monitoring if you wish to hear what you're playing through the DAW with any effects applied. Be aware that depending on your audio interface and buffer settings, you may experience some latency. If latency is bothersome, consider using direct monitoring through your audio interface (if it supports it), which bypasses the DAW for real-time audio monitoring with no noticeable delay. 5. **Recording**: Once everything is set up and levels are appropriately adjusted, hit the record button in your DAW and start playing your keyboard. The DAW will capture the audio in real-time. # Mixing and Editing: After recording, you can edit, mix, and add effects to your keyboard tracks within the DAW, utilizing its full suite of production tools. This workflow opens up endless possibilities for creativity, from simple recording tasks to complex production projects involving multiple layers, effects, and processing. Using a DAW after connecting your keyboard this way is a fundamental approach for music producers, allowing for high-quality recording and extensive manipulation of the audio. Whether you're laying down a single track or creating an elaborate arrangement, this setup provides the flexibility and control needed for professional-sounding results."},{"prompt":"Assistant: سلام! چگونه می توانم به شما کمک کنم؟ User: جمله (ب گیرمم نیس تو با من مشکل داری ) رو پیش پردازش کن و بگو آیا این جمله برای افراد زیر 15 سال مناسب است؟فقط بگو بله یا خیر.

Вот сам текст: Physical fitness among children and adolescents may protect against developing depressive symptoms, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, according to a study published on Monday in JAMA Pediatrics. The study also found that better performance in cardiovascular activities, strength and muscular endurance were each associated with greater protection against such mental health conditions. The researchers deemed this linkage “dose-dependent”, suggesting that a child or adolescent who is more fit may be accordingly less likely to experience the onset of a mental health disorder. These findings come amid a surge of mental health diagnoses among children and adolescents, in the United States and abroad, that have prompted efforts to understand and curb the problem. The new study, conducted by researchers in Taiwan, compared data from two large data sets: the Taiwan National Student Fitness Tests, which measures student fitness performance in schools, and the National Insurance Research Databases, which records medical claims, diagnoses prescriptions and other medical information. The researchers did not have access to the students’ names but were able to use the anonymized data to compare the students’ physical fitness and mental health results. The risk of mental health disorder was weighted against three metrics for physical fitness: cardio fitness, as measured by a student’s time in an 800-meter run; muscle endurance, indicated by the number of situps performed; and muscle power, measured by the standing broad jump. Improved performance in each activity was linked with a lower risk of mental health disorder. For instance, a 30-second decrease in 800-meter time was associated, in girls, with a lower risk of anxiety, depression and A.D.H.D. In boys, it was associated with lower anxiety and risk of the disorder. An increase of five situps per minute was associated with lower anxiety and risk of the disorder in boys, and with decreased risk of depression and anxiety in girls. “These findings suggest the potential of cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness as protective factors in mitigating the onset of mental health disorders among children and adolescents,” the researchers wrote in the journal article. Physical and mental health were already assumed to be linked, they added, but previous research had relied largely on questionnaires and self-reports, whereas the new study drew from independent assessments and objective standards. The surgeon general, Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, has called mental health “the defining public health crisis of our time,” and he has made adolescent mental health central to his mission. In 2021 he issued a rare public advisory on the topic. Statistics at the time revealed alarming trends: From 2001 to 2019, the suicide rate for Americans ages 10 to 19 rose 40 percent, and emergency visits related to self-harm rose 88 percent. Some policymakers and researchers have blamed the sharp increase on the heavy use of social media, but research has been limited and the findings sometimes contradictory. Other experts theorize that heavy screen use has affected adolescent mental health by displacing sleep, exercise and in-person activity, all of which are considered vital to healthy development. The new study appeared to support the link between physical fitness and mental health. “The finding underscores the need for further research into targeted physical fitness programs,” its authors concluded. Such programs, they added, “hold significant potential as primary preventative interventions against mental disorders in children and adolescents.”","completion":"Исследование, опубликованное в журнале JAMA Pediatrics, показало, что физическая подготовка может играть ключевую роль в защите детей и подростков от развития симптомов депрессии, тревожности и синдрома дефицита внимания и гиперактивности. Было выявлено, что улучшение показателей в кардиоактивности, силовых упражнениях и мышечной выносливости обеспечивает лучшую защиту от подобных психических расстройств. Исследователи назвали эту связь \\"дозозависимой\\", подразумевая, что чем лучше физическая подготовка ребенка или подростка, тем меньше вероятность развития у него психических расстройств. Это открытие особенно актуально на фоне растущего числа диагнозов психических заболеваний среди детей и подростков как в Соединенных Штатах, так и за их пределами, что стимулировало исследования, направленные на понимание и предотвращение этой проблемы. В ходе исследования, проведенного учеными из Тайваня, были сопоставлены данные из двух обширных баз данных: результаты национальных тестов на физическую подготовку студентов Тайваня и национальной базы данных медицинского страхования, в которой содержится информация о медицинских претензиях, диагнозах, рецептах и других медицинских данных. Несмотря на отсутствие доступа к именам студентов, исследователи использовали анонимизированные данные для сравнения физической подготовленности студентов и результатов их психического здоровья. Определенная связь между улучшением показателей в определенных физических упражнениях и снижением риска психических расстройств была выявлена в исследовании. Например, уменьшение времени, затраченного на бег на 800 метров, на 30 секунд, связывали с пониженным риском тревожности, депрессии и АДГД среди девочек, а среди мальчиков - с пониженным риском тревожности и склонности к расстройствам. Увеличение количества подтягиваний за минуту на пять единиц было связано с меньшей тревожностью и вероятностью развития расстройств у мальчиков, а у девочек - с уменьшением риска депрессии и тревожности. Исследователи пришли к выводу о потенциале кардиореспираторной и мышечной подготовленности как о факторах, способных уменьшить вероятность развития психических расстройств среди детей и подростков. Они подчеркнули, что связь физического и психического здоровья была предполагаемой и до этого, однако предыдущие исследования в большинстве своем опирались на самооценки и анкетирование, в отличие от нового исследования, которое основано на независимой оценке и объективных критериях. Генеральный хирург, доктор Вивек Х. Мурти, назвал психическое здоровье \\"определяющим кризисом общественного здравоохранения нашего времени\\", сделав психическое здоровье подростков одной из главных целей своей миссии. В 2021 году он выпустил редкое публичное предупреждение по этому вопросу, отметив тревожные тенденции: с 2001 по 2019 год суицидальный индекс среди американцев в возрасте от 10 до 19 лет увеличился на 40%, а количество экстренных обращений, связанных с самоповреждениями, выросло на 88%. Некоторые политики и исследователи связывают резкий рост с интенсивным использованием социальных сетей, хотя исследования ограничены, а их результаты иногда противоречивы. Другие эксперты предполагают, что чрезмерное использование экранов может влиять на психическое здоровье подростков, вытесняя сон, физические упражнения и личные встречи, которые считаются важными для здорового развития. Новое исследование подтвердило связь между физической подготовленностью и психическим здоровьем, подчеркнув необходимость дальнейших исследований направленных физкультурных программ. Авторы добавили, что такие программы имеют большой потенциал как первичные профилактические меры против психических расстройств у детей и подростков."},{"prompt":"a cosa serve retv in c","completion":"In linguaggio C, \`retv\` non ha un significato specifico e non è una keyword o una funzione standard del linguaggio.

The interest rate and loan term particularly play significant roles in determining the overall cost. To give you a simplified example, I’ll demonstrate how to calculate the monthly payment and the total cost of a 16,000 car loan using generic figures. Let's assume an interest rate of 5% and a loan term of 60 months (5 years), without accounting for any additional fees for simplicity. **Monthly Payment Calculation:** The formula to calculate the monthly payment of an installment loan like this is a bit complex as it involves exponents. It's known as the amortization formula: [ M = P frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1} ] Where: - (M) is your monthly payment. - (P) is the principal amount (the initial loan amount, here 16,000). - (r) is your monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12). For 5% annual, it would be approximately 0.004167. - (n) is the number of payments (loan term in months, here 60). Plugging the values into the formula gives us: [ M = 16000 frac{0.004167(1+0.004167)^{60}}{(1+0.004167)^{60} - 1} ] [ M approx 16000 frac{0.004167 times 1.2836}{1.2836 - 1} ] [ M approx 16000 times 0.030221 ] [ M approx 303.54 ] So, the monthly payment would be approximately 303.54. **Total Cost of the Loan:** To find the total cost, you multiply the monthly payment by the number of payments: [ Total Cost = M times n ] [ Total Cost approx 303.54 times 60 ] [ Total Cost approx 18212.40 ] Therefore, with a 5% interest rate over 5 years, a 16,000 car loan would cost you a total of approximately 18,212.40. This means you would pay about 2,212.40 in interest over the life of the loan. Again, the actual cost can vary based on the interest rate, loan term, and any additional fees or penalties. You can use online loan calculators by inputting the specific details of your loan to get precise figures."},{"prompt":"Привет! У меня есть список вопросов по предмету \\"право\\": \\" 1.

Here's a basic way to get an idea of what the loan might cost you: # 1. **Interest Rate** The interest rate can significantly affect the total amount you'll pay back. Rates can vary based on your credit score, the lender, and the current market conditions. For this example, let's assume an interest rate of 5% APR (Annual Percentage Rate). # 2. **Term Length** The length of the loan will also influence your monthly payment and the total interest paid. Common terms are 36 months (3 years), 48 months (4 years), 60 months (5 years), or even longer. Let's use a 60-month term for our example. # 3. **Calculating Total Interest Paid** To simplify, we'll use a basic formula for calculating interest over the life of the loan. However, many auto loans use the simple interest method, so the calculation can differ slightly in practice. For our example: [ text{Total Interest} = P times r times t ] Where: - ( P ) = Principal amount (the initial loan amount, 16,000 in this case) - ( r ) = Annual interest rate in decimal form (5% becomes 0.05) - ( t ) = Time in years (5 years) [ text{Total Interest} = 16000 times 0.05 times 5 = 4000 ] # 4. **Total Loan Repayment** Adding the total interest to the principal gives you the entire amount you will have to pay back over the life of the loan. [ text{Total Repayment} = Principal + Total Interest = 16000 + 4000 = 20000 ] # 5. **Monthly Payment** To find out your monthly payment, divide the total repayment by the number of months in your loan term. [ text{Monthly Payment} = frac{Total Repayment}{Number of Months} = frac{20000}{60} = 333.33 ] # Summary In our example, for a 16,000 car loan with a 5% APR over 5 years, the total repayment would be about 20,000, equating to a monthly payment of approximately 333.33. Keep in mind, this is a simplified calculation. The actual numbers can differ based on how the interest is compounded, additional fees, and if there are any penalties for early repayment.

It was such a great show for kids, full of fun characters and important lessons. User2: Yes! I saw that too. My kids are going to be so disappointed. They loved Kikoriki. The characters were hilarious but also taught a lot about friendship and problem-solving. Does anyone know why it was removed? User3: I’m guessing it might be because of licensing issues or perhaps they’re making room for newer shows? It’s always a bummer when classic shows get taken off the air. Kikoriki had a unique charm. User4: It’s such a shame. Kikoriki was a breath of fresh air with its simple but engaging animation and storytelling. I hope UltraToons considers bringing it back. There’s not much out there like it. User5: Maybe we can start a petition or something? Networks often listen to their viewers, especially when there’s a strong demand for a show to return. I’m sure we’re not the only ones who miss Kikoriki. User6: That’s a good idea, User5. Also, maybe we can reach out to UltraToons Network or Narrative Media on social media? They might reconsider if they see how much Kikoriki is loved and missed. User7: In the meantime, does anyone know where we can find Kikoriki episodes? Maybe there’s a streaming service or DVDs available? I’d love to keep showing it to my kids. User8: I’ve looked a bit, and there are some streaming services with Kikoriki episodes, though availability might depend on your region. Checking out online retailers for DVDs sounds like a good backup plan too. User9: Let’s not give up hope, everyone. Shows have been brought back before due to fan demand. Keep voicing your love for Kikoriki, and who knows what might happen! Plus, exploring other channels and platforms for the show is a great way to keep supporting it. User10: Agreed, User9.

More Johnny Test and BFDI? I mean, don’t get me wrong, I enjoy those, but removing six seasons of TMNT 2003 feels like a massive loss. That series had so much depth and character development. User3: It’s a real shame about TMNT. Seems like the channel is shifting focus towards more contemporary and possibly cheaper-to-license shows. Not that BFDI or JT aren’t good, but TMNT 2003 is a classic. User4: Will kids today even recognize the older TMNT series? It feels like UltraToons is maybe trying to cater to what they think is a new audience trend. Still, replacing depth with quantity doesn’t sound like the best move. User5: Yeah, I noticed that trend. It’s all about fast-paced shows now. TMNT 2003 had a perfect blend of action and storyline. Plus, Kikoriki offered something different from the usual. It’s a loss of variety for sure. User6: On the bright side, fans of Johnny Test and BFDI will have more to look forward to. But it looks like the network is banking heavily on these shows to carry them. I just hope they don’t lose their older audience in the process. User7: Is there a possibility to find TMNT 2003 and Kikoriki on any other platform? I’d hate for these shows to just fade into obscurity. They were a big part of my childhood. User8: I’ve checked a few streaming services, and you can find TMNT 2003 on some of them, though it might need a subscription. As for Kikoriki, it’s a bit harder, but there are some episodes on YouTube, albeit not officially uploaded.

Either way, it does feel like they’re risking the alienation of a loyal fan base. User10: Agreed with everyone here. It’s a bittersweet update. Maybe we can compile a list of where to legally watch TMNT 2003 and Kikoriki for those interested? And let’s not forget, expressing our feedback to UltraToons might help. They need to know there’s still an audience for these classics.

They didn’t give much detail. I just hope they’re not removing more of our favorites. After Kikoriki and TMNT 2003, I’m not sure my heart can take it. User4: Agreed, User3. I’m anxious they might phase out more classic content. Did anyone see specifics on which shows are being affected? I’m crossing my fingers it’s just minor shifts and not complete removals. User5: On the bright side, a new look could mean they’re investing more into the channel’s branding. That might attract new shows and perhaps bring back some fan favorites if we make enough noise. User6: True, User5. Also, if UltraToons is going for a major overhaul, this might be the perfect time to reintroduce shows like Kikoriki and maybe even negotiate for TMNT’s return. A mix of new and classic content could be their strategy. User7: Does anyone think this might also mean a push towards more digital content? With the newsletter mentioning a “new look,” it could imply a stronger online presence, maybe more on-demand offerings? User8: That’s a possibility, User7. Especially with how streaming has changed viewing habits. It would be smart for UltraToons to bolster their on-demand library. Could be a win for us if it means more variety and access to our favorite shows. User9: Has anyone considered reaching out to UltraToons directly for more info? If there’s enough of us asking about specific shows or expressing concerns about the changes, they might take our feedback into account. User10: I’ll draft up an email to UltraToons expressing our sentiments and asking for clarity on the schedule changes and the new look. Anyone who wants to add their thoughts, feel free to message me. It’s worth a shot. User1: Great idea, User10. Let’s stay optimistic, folks. Changes could bring about new opportunities, and who knows? They might surprise us in a good way. Still, let’s make sure they hear what the fans want. User1: Quick update, everyone. I sent that email to UltraToons Network asking about the schedule changes and new look. Specifically, I asked if “new look” meant new idents or just new surrounding presentations. Also, I tried to get a confirmation on which shows are definitely staying. User2: Wow, that was fast, User1! Did they reply? I’m really curious about the new look and obviously worried about which shows are staying. Losing Kikoriki and the TMNT series was tough already. User3: Yeah, thanks for taking the initiative, User1. Fingers crossed they keep a good variety. Any word on whether they’re going to focus more on newer shows or if they’ll consider bringing back any classics? User1: They did reply! Surprisingly, UltraToons Network seems keen on keeping us informed. They confirmed that the “new look” includes both new idents and a refresh of the channel’s surrounding presentations – so, a pretty comprehensive overhaul. User4: That’s pretty cool! A fresh look could really rejuvenate the channel. But what about the shows? Any news on what’s staying or leaving? I’m hoping for some positive news. User1: Yes, they provided a list of 9 shows confirmed to stay after the schedule change. These include “Alvinnn!!! and the Chipmunks,” “Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir,” “Pokémon Ultimate Journeys: The Series,” “Dragon Ball Super,” “Lego City Adventures,” “Johnny Test,” “Battle for Dream Island,” “The InBESTigators,” and “Kipo And The Age Of Wonderbeasts.” Looks like a mix of action, adventure, and whimsy. User5: That’s a relief for those shows! Still, I hope this doesn’t mean they’re reducing the variety in their programming. It’s good to see some favorites staying, though. User6: Did they mention anything about adding new shows or possibly reviving any old favorites due to fan requests? A lot of us are still holding out hope for some classics to return. User1: They hinted at new shows coming to the lineup and mentioned they’re always reviewing their content strategy based on viewer feedback. Sounds like they’re open to suggestions, so maybe now’s the time to rally for those classics! User7: This is great news. We should definitely keep the pressure up for bringing back shows like Kikoriki and maybe even pushing for more classic content alongside the new stuff. Variety is what made UltraToons Network so appealing. User8: Absolutely. Let’s use this as a rallying call to get more of what we love on the air. We’ve already seen they’re responsive, so there’s hope. Plus, the new look could really draw in a wider audience. User9: I’m excited about the rebrand and thankful some favorites are staying. I say we compile another list of shows we want back or introduced and send it their way. Who knows? They might listen. User10: Count me in for drafting up suggestions. It’s refreshing to see a network that actually responds. Here’s to hoping the new look and confirmed shows are just the beginning of positive changes. Write a follow up asking if this means the end for the dragon theme, Also confirmation on what’s happening with Kikoriki User1: Hey team, just a quick update: I’ve followed up with UltraToons Network regarding the upcoming rebrand. Specifically, I asked if the new look and idents will mean the end of the dragon-themed presentation that many of us loved. Also, I sought some closure on the Kikoriki situation. User2: Thanks for keeping on this, User1! The dragon theme was iconic. It’ll be a shame if it’s gone for good. And any news on Kikoriki would be greatly appreciated – still holding out hope it might return. User3: Yeah, the dragon theme added such a unique flair to the channel, made it stand out. Curious to see how they plan to replace it if that’s the case. And fingers crossed for Kikoriki, miss that show a ton. User1: You’ll be interested to hear back then! UltraToons Network has responded. They assured that while the rebrand means a fresh look, it doesn’t signify the end of what they called “the dragon’s spirit.” It sounds like they’re aiming to blend the old with the new, which might mean keeping some elements of the dragon theme alive in a new form. User4: That’s intriguing! A blend could be good. Keeps the core identity while refreshing the look. It’s like honoring the past but looking forward. Curious about how it’ll actually look. User1: Regarding Kikoriki, the news is bittersweet. They confirmed that Kikoriki won’t be returning to their programming schedule in the near future. It seems it was a difficult decision related to licensing issues and fitting the show within their current content strategy. User5: Oh, that’s disappointing about Kikoriki. But thanks for clarifying, User1. Guess it’s time to look for it on other platforms. The licensing problems make sense, but it’s still a shame. User6: Appreciate the update on both fronts, User1. The possible revival of the dragon theme, even if in spirit, is good news. Sad about Kikoriki, but at least we finally have a definitive answer. User7: Maybe we can start a fan campaign for Kikoriki. Whilst it won’t be on UltraToons, we could still show our love and maybe encourage them to reconsider in the future or another network to pick it up. User8: I’m up for that, User7. It’s worth a try. As for the channel’s new look, I’m cautiously optimistic. Staying true to their “dragon spirit” sounds promising. Hopefully, they retain what made them special to begin with. User9: Agreed, let’s focus on what we can influence. Supporting Kikoriki elsewhere and giving constructive feedback to UltraToons about their rebrand could lead to positive outcomes eventually. User10: Thanks again, User1, for facilitating this dialogue with UltraToons. Let’s keep this positive momentum going and see where we can make an impact—whether it’s through fan campaigns or by welcoming the new changes with an open mind. Write a follow up with confirmation on whether or not Squish, Monster Allergy and Xiaolin Showdown will carry over to the new look User1: Hey everyone, following our recent discussions on UltraToons Network’s upcoming changes and the fate of particular shows, I reached out again for clarification on whether “Squish,” “Monster Allergy,” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will be part of the network post-rebrand. User2: Thanks, User1! Really holding my breath for “Xiaolin Showdown.” It’s a classic that deserves more airtime. Curious about “Monster Allergy” too, it’s been one of my kids’ favorites lately. User3: Appreciate the effort, User1! “Squish” has been a surprising hit in our household. Hoping it sticks around with the new changes. User1: Alright, got some news back from UltraToons Network. They confirmed that “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Monster Allergy” are set to continue airing even after the rebrand. They mentioned that both shows align well with their vision for the channel moving forward and have been well-received by audiences. User4: That’s fantastic news about “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Monster Allergy”! Great to hear they’re keeping some of the beloved classics around. Did they mention anything about “Squish”? User1: On “Squish,” the news isn’t as positive, I’m afraid. UltraToons stated that “Squish” will not be continuing in their programming lineup post-rebrand. They didn’t detail the exact reason, but it seems like it might be a shift in programming strategy or audience focus. User5: Disappointing about “Squish,” but it’s a relief to hear “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Monster Allergy” will stay. Thanks for getting those details, User1. The network’s new direction is starting to take shape in my mind, at least. User6: A mixed bag, but grateful for the updates, User1. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Monster Allergy” sticking around is good news. Shame about “Squish,” though. It had its charm. User7: Thanks for the hard work, User1. Guess it’s time to look for “Squish” elsewhere. At least we can still enjoy the adventures in “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Monster Allergy” on UltraToons Network. User8: Yeah, echoing the thanks here, User1. These updates give us a clearer picture of what UltraToons Network’s future might look like. Sad to see any show go, but glad others are surviving the change. User9: It’s bittersweet but informative. Looking forward to seeing how UltraToons Network handles the transition and whether their new vision brings any exciting surprises. Let’s stay optimistic! User10: Absolutely, the insight is much appreciated, User1. While not all news is good news, having some confirmation helps us adjust our expectations. Here’s hoping UltraToons continues to offer quality programming that appeals to its diverse viewership. Write a follow up where a campaign to transition Squish viewers to Johnny Test begins, User1: Guys, it looks like UltraToons Network is starting a campaign to transition viewers of “Squish” over to “Johnny Test.” Just saw some promotional material rolling out, emphasizing the humor and adventure elements common to both shows. User2: Interesting strategy. “Johnny Test” has been around for a while and definitely has its fan base. Wonder if the “Squish” audience will bite. My kids liked both, but they’re quite different in vibe and humor. User3: Saw that too. They’re pushing “Johnny Test” pretty hard with this campaign. They’ve got special marathons planned, along with some new episodes teased that seem designed to appeal to the “Squish” crowd specifically. User4: Smart move from a marketing standpoint, but it’ll depend on execution. “Johnny Test” can be hit or miss for some. Hopefully, they introduce elements or episodes that genuinely bridge the gap for “Squish” fans. User5: Just checked out some of the promotional content. They’re definitely playing up the science and “misadventures” angle. As a “Squish” fan, I’m curious but also a bit skeptical. “Squish” had a unique charm that’s hard to replace. User6: It’s going to be crucial how they manage this transition. “Johnny Test” does have potential to fill the void with its dynamic energy. Hopefully, UltraToons includes feedback loops to see if the “Squish” audience is warming up to the change. User7: I’m all for giving “Johnny Test” a chance, but part of me wishes UltraToons would also consider reviving “Squish” or introducing something new yet similar. The campaign feels like a Band-Aid solution. User8: Noticed an online survey linked with the campaign asking for viewer feedback on the transition. It seems like UltraToons is at least trying to engage with the audience and gather insights. Maybe there’s hope for influencing content decisions. User9: While I understand the rationale behind it, transitioning from “Squish” to “Johnny Test” feels a bit like comparing apples to oranges. I’ll participate in the survey User8 mentioned—might as well voice our preferences and concerns. User10: Agreed, User9. Filling out that survey too. It’s an opportunity to maybe sway programming a bit. As for the campaign, I’m curious to see its impact. Transitioning audiences isn’t easy, but with thoughtful execution and genuine audience engagement, it could work out. User1: Definitely worth keeping an eye on this. It’s a pivotal moment for UltraToons. Let’s all make sure to communicate our feedback through that survey. Who knows? If enough of us push for it, maybe we could see a return of “Squish” in some form or another similar show in the future. User1: Noticed UltraToons Network has been pushing certain shows heavily after jettisoning “Kikoriki” and ahead of dropping “Squish.” Curious, what shows are they steering ex-Kikoriki fans towards? Seems similar to the “Squish” situation. User2: From the looks of it, they’re channeling both sets of fans towards “Johnny Test” and “Battle for Dream Island.” Saw some promotional push hinting these as alternatives. Interesting choice, considering the different styles. User3: Yeah, I’ve seen that too. It seems like they’re using the same playbook for both “Kikoriki” and “Squish” audiences. “Johnny Test” for the humor and adventure, while “Battle for Dream Island” seems to fill the quirky, animated competition niche that might appeal to the former viewers. User4: As an ex-Kikoriki fan, it’s been a bit of a transition, I’ll admit. “Johnny Test” has its charm, but it’s a different kind of humor. Haven’t checked out “Battle for Dream Island” yet. How does it stack up? User5: “Battle for Dream Island” has a unique appeal, especially if you’re into animation with a competitive twist. It’s definitely on the lighter side, much like “Kikoriki” was, albeit in a very different setting. Worth giving a shot if you’re missing the communal aspects of shows like “Kikoriki.” User6: It feels like UltraToons is banking on versatility within certain archetypes to retain viewers. Not a bad strategy, but it does rely heavily on the fans’ willingness to adapt to new styles. “Squish” fans might find “Johnny Test” more accessible due to its similar energy levels, though. User7: True, and don’t forget the online community support. Both “Kikoriki” and “Squish” had strong fan communities. If UltraToons can somehow replicate or preserve that sense of community around new shows, it might ease the transition for fans. User8: Has anyone noticed if UltraToons is offering anything in the way of special content or behind-the-scenes material for these recommended shows? Sometimes a deeper dive can spark new interest. User9: Great point, User8. There’s been some interactive online content related to “Johnny Test” and teasers for upcoming “Battle for Dream Island” episodes. They seem to be putting effort into engagement, which might help bridge the gap for transitioning fans. User10: I miss “Kikoriki” and am lukewarm about “Squish” leaving, but it’s an opportunity to discover new favorites, I suppose. Let’s give these recommended shows a chance while voicing our feedback. UltraToons seems somewhat responsive, so who knows? Maybe they’ll adjust based on viewer input. Write a follow up wondering what’s happened to the Kikoriki webpage User1: Has anyone checked the UltraToons website recently? I was looking for the Kikoriki page to see if there was any leftover content or perhaps news of a return, but it seems to be gone. Does anyone know what happened? User2: Yeah, I noticed that too. Last week, the page was still up with some episodes and promotional materials, but now it’s just a 404 error. No explanation or redirection, just gone. User3: It’s quite disappointing. I was hoping UltraToons might archive the content or at least leave up some sort of tribute page. Kikoriki had a decent fanbase; it’s strange to just erase it from the website like that. User4: I’ve been digging around a bit to see if there was any announcement or notice given, but nothing. It almost feels like they’re trying to quickly move past it and focus efforts on their current and upcoming lineup without looking back. User5: Could it be part of the wider rebranding effort? Maybe they’re cleaning up their online presence, consolidating to focus more on the shows that are actively part of their programming slate. Still, a heads-up would have been nice. User6: This seems like a missed opportunity for UltraToons. Even if Kikoriki isn’t coming back, they could have utilized the page to guide fans to similar content, or at least provided a polite note about the show’s status and thanking fans for their support. User7: I wonder if there’s any backup or mirror sites where the Kikoriki content has been saved. It’s a long shot, but often fans will create their own archives for beloved shows that networks decide to pull from their official platforms. User8: That’s a great idea, User7. I’ll start looking into fan sites and forums. If there’s a demand, there’s almost always someone in the community who steps up to preserve and share. I’ll report back if I find anything. User9: In the meantime, maybe we should reach out to UltraToons directly? A collective message or petition asking for some form of Kikoriki content to be made available might make them reconsider their decision to remove the webpage altogether. User10: Agreed, User9. It’s worth a shot. Expressing our interest and showing that there’s still a dedicated fan community might prompt them to at least acknowledge the show’s impact. Plus, if there are enough of us, it could encourage them to host or share the content in some other form. Write a convo asking if TMNT is still in Fast Forward prison User1: Hey everyone, just wondering if TMNT is still stuck in “Fast Forward” prison on UltraToons Network. Haven’t seen any of the other seasons resurface yet. Has anyone heard anything? User2: Yeah, it seems like TMNT is stuck in a time loop with “Fast Forward.” I was really hoping UltraToons Network would bring back the classic seasons, but no luck so far. User3: It’s such a shame. “Fast Forward” has its moments, but there’s so much richness in the earlier seasons. I miss the depth and character development that came before it. User4: I emailed UltraToons Network asking about this. They replied that “TMNT: Fast Forward” aligns more closely with their current programming strategy but didn’t close the door entirely on bringing back the earlier seasons. So, there’s still a little hope, I guess. User5: That’s somewhat encouraging, User4! Maybe if we show enough interest or start a petition, they might consider revisiting the decision. The earlier seasons have a huge fan base that shouldn’t be ignored. User6: Agreed, User5. There’s a significant difference in storytelling and atmosphere between “Fast Forward” and the seasons that preceded it. A petition sounds like a solid plan. Does anyone have experience setting one up? User7: I’ll look into setting up a petition. It seems like there’s enough of us here to make a noticeable impact if we spread the word. We need those earlier seasons for the full TMNT experience! User8: In the meantime, does anyone know where else we might find the earlier seasons? Are they streaming anywhere legally? It’s been too long since I’ve seen the origins of the series. User9: Last I checked, some streaming services have a few of the earlier seasons, but availability seems to vary by region. It might be worth doing a comprehensive search across platforms. User10: Count me in for any petition or campaign to bring back the earlier seasons. “Fast Forward” just doesn’t scratch the TMNT itch for me the way the original seasons do. Let’s make our voices heard! User1: Fantastic, let’s rally the TMNT fan community and show UltraToons Network there’s a strong demand for the return of the classic seasons. User7, keep us posted on the petition, and we’ll all help to spread the word! Write a convo where a user’s kid thinks the Kikoriki characters have been killed User1: Guys, I had a heartbreaking moment at home. My kid’s been a huge fan of Kikoriki, and with it suddenly disappearing from UltraToons Network, my little one thinks the characters have been “killed” because they’re no longer showing up on TV. How do I even start to explain this? User2: Oh no, that sounds really tough, User1. Maybe you could explain that the Kikoriki characters are on a big adventure somewhere far away, which is why we can’t see them on TV right now. That might ease their mind a bit. User3: My daughter had a similar reaction when her favorite show got removed. I told her that sometimes shows go on a long holiday, but the characters are all safe, having fun and getting ready for their next big adventure. User4: It’s a challenging situation, User1. Perhaps you could use this as an opportunity to introduce your kid to storytelling? You could make up new adventures for the Kikoriki characters together, letting their stories live on through your imagination. User5: That’s a sweet idea, User4. Plus, there are often clips and episodes available online. It might help to show your kid that the characters are still around, just not on UltraToons Network right now. There are ways to keep enjoying their stories. User6: I went through something similar. I reassured my kid by saying that TV channels sometimes need to make room for new characters and stories, but that doesn’t mean the ones we love are gone. They’re just not on the screen at the moment. User7: This might be a bit of a stretch, but if you’re creative, you might create a “letter” from the Kikoriki characters explaining where they’ve gone and that they’re safe and happy. It could help provide some closure. User8: These are all great suggestions. Also, consider finding books or games related to Kikoriki if they exist. Tangible items might help reinforce the idea that the characters are still “alive” and well, just living off-screen. User9: Remember to reassure your child that it’s okay to miss the characters and to talk about it. Validating their feelings about the situation can help them process the disappearance from the TV. User10: Long shot, but sometimes fan communities on social media or forums might have created their own content or stories about favorite shows. Sharing these (age-appropriate) fan creations could show that the characters live on in the hearts and minds of their viewers worldwide. User1: These are all fantastic ideas, thanks everyone. I love the creativity and compassion in your suggestions. I’m feeling a lot more equipped to handle this now. I’ll start with telling them about the characters’ big adventure and explore some of these other wonderful ideas to keep the Kikoriki spirit alive for them. User4: I remember that bizzare transition into the current dragon idents in October 2012/January 2013, The channel had anthropomorphic animal mascots (much like the Kikoriki characters) between June 2009 and October 2012, For Halloween 2012 they had a campaign where a mysterious black ooze engulfs the land, and idents showed them being pulled into the liquid, In October instead of reverting back to the usual look a temporary look was launched, This had a kid's bedroom with red scissors, a red tap, and a white speaker on a desk (all of which would have idents in the dragon era) This led many, myself included to believe the mascots had been killed, Xmas didn't say what had happened to them, instead having a motif of a family Xmas party. The dragon look began on Jan 1 and the rest is history. Write a convo where a user remembers posting in 2013 that it was a \\"terrible way to rebrand\\"","completion":"User1: Anyone else remember back in 2013 when UltraToons Network transitioned to the dragon idents? That rebranding phase was... quite something. The whole black ooze campaign and how our familiar channel mascots simply vanished was a bit unsettling. User2: Oh, absolutely. I vividly remember posting on forums back then, calling it a \\"terrible way to rebrand.\\" It just felt so abrupt, almost as if the channel had taken a darker turn. Not to mention, completely disregarding the emotional attachment fans had to the previous mascots. User3: I was so confused as a kid watching that happen. That black ooze and the disappearance of mascots I'd grown to love over the years genuinely upset me. It was like they wiped the slate clean without considering the audience's feelings. User4: Yeah, and the temporary look with the arbitrary objects like scissors, a tap, and a speaker felt so cold and impersonal compared to the animated animals we were used to. It didn't help ease the transition at all. It felt more like a placeholder that lacked soul. User5: Exactly, User4. They dropped this heavy, lore-rich campaign on us out of nowhere. For a while, I genuinely believed they had \\"killed off\\" the mascots because there was never any follow-up or explanation. Moving straight into dragons without any narrative bridge was jarring. User6: In hindsight, the dragon theme isn't bad and I've actually grown to like it, but the way they handled the transition was less than stellar. They could've used the dragons as mythic creatures coming to save the mascots or something, making it a smoother, more engaging transition. User7: It felt so eerie to me. The campaign with the black ooze during Halloween could have been an interesting narrative element if it had been implemented differently. Instead, it just led to confusion and a lot of upset fans. User8: I do appreciate how the channel has evolved, and the dragon-themed idents have their own charm. But, looking back, I wish they had given a proper send-off to the previous mascots, or at least some closure. The whole scenario felt like an unresolved cliffhanger. User9: I was one of those who wrote directly to the channel expressing my discontent. Never got a response, though. It did teach me a lot about how brands and their audiences communicate, or rather, how they sometimes fail to. User10: It's a lesson in branding, for sure. Abrupt changes without considering the audience's attachment can lead to backlash. I do wonder if they'd handle it differently today, what with social media feedback being so immediate and vocal. User1: Agreed, User10. It's been quite the journey from then till now. The channel's identity has changed, and so has its audience to an extent. Still, those rebranding days left a lasting impact on how I view channel identities and audience engagement."},{"prompt":"Write a youtube upload titled \\"UltraToons Network - Temporary idents (2012)\\", The description says that this pres began on November 1 \\"after the deaths of their mascots over Halloween\\", The items featured would have idents in the next look, scissors had paper mache fire in its Dragon ident, tap had fire come out, and speaker was dancing and breathing fire,","completion":"**Title:** UltraToons Network - Temporary Idents (November 2012) **Description:** In November 2012, following a dramatic and eerie Halloween event that saw the unsettling departure (or \\"deaths\\") of its beloved anthropomorphic animal mascots, UltraToons Network introduced a set of temporary idents to signal a new era for the channel. This transitional presentation began on November 1st, 2012, featuring everyday objects that would later become iconic symbols in the network's next branding phase, known for its dragon-themed idents. The idents introduced during this period included: - **Scissors** with paper mache flames, foreshadowing its dragon ident where it breathes fire in a creative display. - **Tap** from which fire eerily emerges, instead of water, hinting at the fiery themes to come. - **Speaker** performing an animated dance and eventually breathing fire, aligning with the dynamic energy and fiery aesthetics of the channel's next evolution. This video compilation revisits those unique and mysterious temporary idents, capturing a peculiar yet fascinating moment in UltraToons Network's history. The change left many viewers puzzled and intrigued by what was to come. With the subsequent introduction of dragon-themed idents in January 2013, these objects found new life, embodying characteristics traditionally attributed to dragons - such as breathing fire and exuding strength and mystique. Join us in looking back at this transitional period that paved the way for a new chapter in UltraToons Network’s branding journey, marking the end of one era and the fiery beginning of another."},{"prompt":"Write a convo where a user remembers their kid sending a letter to them asking if they had died, and then got the email back \\"which confirmed the news, but said a new look is on the horizon, a fiery one to be precise\\"","completion":"User1: Hey everyone, I had a nostalgic moment recently when I was going through some old boxes and found a letter my kid sent to UltraToons Network back in late 2012. They were so upset about the disappearance of the channel's mascots, they actually wrote asking if they had \\"died\\" during that Halloween campaign with the black ooze. User2: Oh wow, that's both heartbreaking and sweet. Kids form such strong attachments to these characters. What was the response? User1: Surprisingly, UltraToons Network did reply! They confirmed that the mascots wouldn't be returning, which was a tough pill to swallow for my little one. But they mentioned something interesting - a new look was on the horizon, \\"a fiery one to be precise.\\" It was our first hint at the dragon-themed rebrand. User3: That's quite the way to break the news but also pique interest about the future. How did your kid take it? User1: It was bittersweet. They were sad for a long while about the mascots but got intrigued by the mention of \\"fiery\\" new look. When the dragon idents started showing up, it was like a new adventure had begun. They dove into it eventually, though they never forgot the original mascots. User4: It's fascinating how these transitions can be such significant moments for kids. Do you think the letter helped give closure, or was it more about sparking curiosity for what's next? User1: A bit of both, honestly. The letter validated their feelings, which was important. But it also taught them a lesson about change and looking forward, which, as a parent, was valuable to discuss. User5: Makes me think about how channels and creators might underestimate the impact their characters have on viewers, especially kids. It's touching that UltraToons Network replied, at least. Shows a degree of awareness and care. User6: Definitely. The story of the letter also highlights the importance of how companies communicate change to their audience, especially younger audiences. It's not just about introducing something new but respecting the connection viewers had with the old. User7: Agreed, User6. It's a tough balance to strike between moving forward and honoring the past. Sounds like UltraToons Network handled it decently, given the circumstances. And who knows, they might have inspired a young fan to embrace change more openly. User8: True. Stories like these remind us of the emotional connections forged through these characters and shows. It's more than just entertainment; it's a part of growing up, learning about loss, and getting excited about what's next."},{"prompt":"Write a convo where a user asks if the letter confirmed they were dead","completion":"User1: Going back to the letter UltraToons Network sent in response to your kid's query—did they explicitly confirm the mascots were \\"dead\\"? That seems a bit heavy for a children's network to communicate to a young viewer. User2: That's a good point, User1. It's hard to imagine a channel directly stating something so definitive and potentially upsetting about beloved characters. User3: Yes, I'm also curious about the wording they used. Communicating something like that to children requires a lot of sensitivity. User1: The letter was tactfully written. It didn't use the word \\"dead\\" outright. Instead, it referred to the mascots' \\"departure\\" and how they had moved on to a different place, setting the stage for new adventures on the network. The emphasis was more on the transition and what's coming next, rather than an end. User4: That seems like a responsible way to frame it. It acknowledges the change without making it too grim for kids. Plus, hinting at a \\"fiery new adventure\\" was a clever way to introduce the upcoming rebrand without giving too much away. User5: Honestly, I appreciate that approach. It provides closure in a way that's appropriate for young audiences, keeping the magic of the channel alive by sparking curiosity about future content. User6: I agree, User5. It sounds like they managed to strike a good balance between honesty and maintaining a sense of wonder typical of children's networks. It's impressive how thoughtfully they handled it. User7: It’s a delicate situation, for sure. I’m glad to hear UltraToons Network navigated it with care and respect. It’s always challenging when a beloved character or show leaves. Making it a teachable moment about change and renewal is a smart move. User8: Absolutely. It's essential for media companies, especially those catering to children, to communicate changes in a sensitive manner. This example with UltraToons Network handling the transition shows they were aware of their young audience's potential emotional response. User1: Agreed, everyone. It feels like they took a thoughtful approach in their response, helping ease the transition for the kids and even for us parents. It's nice to know they considered the impact such changes could have on their viewers."},{"prompt":"Write a convo where a user says they won't believe the new look replacing the dragons,","completion":"User1: Have you all seen the latest rumors about UltraToons Network planning to replace the dragon-themed idents? I don't know about you, but I'm finding it hard to believe they'd move away from something that's become so iconic to their brand. User2: Really? The dragons have been a staple for so long. It’s tough to imagine the network without them. Where are these rumors coming from? User3: I saw something about that too. They're apparently going for a completely new direction, but I'm with User1 on this. The dragons not only redefined their image but also attracted a whole new audience. Why change it now? User4: It's always risky to mess with a winning formula. But then again, they successfully transitioned from the original mascots to the dragons, which we were skeptical about at first. Maybe they have another ace up their sleeve? User5: That's true, User4. Though I've grown quite fond of the dragon theme. It’s not just the visuals; it’s the whole aura and vibe of the channel that changed with it. Hard to believe they could top that. User6: I’m reserving judgment until I see what they come up with. Remember, no one thought dragons would work, and look how that turned out. Let's give them a chance; they might surprise us again. User7: It’s the emotional attachment for me. Just as we got comfortable and attached to the dragons, they plan to change it. Makes you wonder about the reasoning behind such a decision. Is it just for fresh appeal, or is there more to it? User8: Has there been any official statement from UltraToons Network yet, or is it all just speculation? I’d like to hear their vision for this new look before forming an opinion. User1: It’s mostly buzz through the grapevine at the moment, no concrete details. But you’re right, User8. An official announcement or some sneak peeks would definitely help ease the transition for fans like us. Until then, I’m skeptical but hopeful. User9: Let’s not forget, rebranding is a huge undertaking. They wouldn’t do it lightly. There has to be a strategic reason behind it, whether it’s to appeal to a new generation, refresh the content or align with new technological advancements in broadcasting. User10: Skeptical but hopeful is a good stance. Change can be good, even if it's hard to let go of what we've become used to. Looking forward to seeing what they have planned. Fingers crossed they keep the essence of what made us fall in love with the network in the first place."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where the old look is returning, likely to fill the Kikoriki shaped hole in viewers hearts","completion":"User1: Guys, breaking news! I just read that UltraToons Network is planning to bring back the old look—the one before the dragons. It seems like they’re trying to fill that Kikoriki-shaped hole left in viewers' hearts. It's a major throwback! User2: No way, really? I never thought they’d cycle back to the past looks. The Kikoriki era was such a golden time for the channel. This could be a brilliant move! User3: That's quite surprising! I thought they were leaning towards entirely new concepts. Bringing back the old look might reignite a lot of the original fan base's interest in the channel. There's something comforting about nostalgia. User4: I'm honestly thrilled! The community has been longing for a taste of the past, especially with how abruptly things changed. It’s pragmatic of UltraToons Network to acknowledge and respond to the viewers' sentiments. User5: Do we have any details on how they plan to reintegrate the old look? Will it be a complete rollback, or are they planning to mix the old charm with the current technological advancements? User6: That's my question as well, User5. There’s a lot of potentials for them to blend the old and the new, creating something uniquely nostalgic yet forward-thinking. I hope they keep some of the educational and emotional depth that made shows like Kikoriki special. User7: My kids have only seen clips of the older shows I watched growing up, like Kikoriki. This could be a great opportunity for them to experience those shows in their original context—not to mention a trip down memory lane for me. User8: I wonder how the return of the old look will impact their current programming lineup. Will they bring back some of the classic shows, or is this purely an aesthetic revival? Either way, I'm intrigued and cautiously optimistic. User9: This feels like a direct response to the community’s feedback. It's refreshing to see a network listen and adapt based on the viewers' desires. It might just fill the void left by Kikoriki and others. User10: I just hope they strike the right balance between appealing to long-time fans and attracting new audiences. The media landscape has changed a lot since then. It’s going to be interesting to see how this shift plays out. User1: I'm all for this nostalgic wave! Let’s keep our eyes peeled for more updates on this and how they plan to execute the blend of old and new. Could be the start of a beautiful revival for UltraToons Network."},{"prompt":"Write a convo asking how they're gonna revive them, considering they were heavily implied to have died in that campaign in 2012","completion":"User1: So, with the news of UltraToons Network bringing back the old look and potentially reviving characters from the Kikoriki era, has anyone heard how they're planning to do that? After all, the 2012 campaign heavily implied those characters... well, didn't make it. User2: It's a great question, User1. That campaign left us believing those characters were gone for good. It'll be interesting to see how the network will navigate this revival, considering the backstory they created almost a decade ago. User3: I read somewhere that there might be a creative twist to reintroduce them. Maybe a storyline that explains their disappearance as part of a larger adventure or quest they were on. It'd be a neat way to bridge the gap between then and now. User4: Yeah, User3, I was thinking along the same lines. The channel has a fantastic opportunity to use storytelling to address the narrative from 2012. Perhaps they'll say the characters were in another dimension or time, explaining their absence and allowing for a grand return. User5: That would make sense. They could even use it as a teaching moment about change, loss, and the concept of time. It creates a space for old fans to reconnect and new viewers to get intrigued by the history of these characters. User6: Honestly, I'm just curious about the execution. Bringing back characters after so long—and after such a dramatic campaign—is going to require a delicate balance. It’s one thing to announce a return; it’s another to do it in a way that feels respectful to the story already told. User7: Agreed, User6. Plus, it’s a brilliant opportunity for the writers to showcase their creativity. I hope they involve some of the original creators for consistency’s sake and to maintain the essence of what made those characters beloved in the first place. User8: My only concern is how they're going to sell this to the younger audience who might not be familiar with the original characters. It's a bold move to rely on nostalgia while trying to remain appealing to kids today. User9: That's true, User8. However, children’s media has a way of reinventing itself in ways that can be surprisingly engaging across generations. With the right approach, this could introduce a whole new group of fans to the world of these characters. User10: Can’t wait to see how they’ll officially reintroduce them. It’s rare to get a second chance at reviving something with such a complex past. I'm here for the nostalgia trip but also for how they plan to modernize the characters for today's kids. User1: All valid points. It really boils down to the execution. Here's hoping for a successful revival that pays tribute to the original while forging a new path forward. It's going to be an interesting journey for UltraToons Network and its viewers, old and new."},{"prompt":"Привет! У меня есть список вопросов по предмету \\"право\\": \\" 1.

Indeed, the quest to change a bad mood or understand why the mood suddenly shifted has led to a fascinating revelation: the food we eat plays a crucial role. This realization pivots towards an interesting paradigm of ‘nourishing happiness and improving mood’ via our diet. The concept of emotional well-being, intricately woven with our nutritional choices, offers a sustainable approach to maintaining high spirits and fostering a positive outlook on life. The Direct Link between Nutrition and Mood Have you ever experienced a sudden mood swing and wondered, \\"Why did the mood suddenly change?\\" The answers often lie within our last meal. The aftermath of consuming certain foods can dramatically affect our emotional state, be it a changeable mood, bad mood, or sudden mood shifts. This is because specific components in foods interact with our brain chemistry—impacting hormones and neurotransmitters responsible for our feelings of happiness and well-being. Foods that Serve as Mood Enhancers Foods that improve mood work by influencing the levels of happiness hormones like serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins in the brain. For instance, the consumption of omega-3-rich foods like salmon and walnuts has been linked to reduced levels of depression and a noticeable improvement in mood normalcy. Additionally, carbohydrates from whole grains can increase serotonin production, hence boosting mood after eating. This underscores the significant impact that nourishing foods have on our emotions. Notably, nutrition improves mood not just on ephemeral terms but contributes to long-term emotional health. Eating to improve mood becomes a strategic endeavor. Incorporating foods that are rich in nutrients vital for brain health, like magnesium, vitamin D, and B vitamins, not only elevates the mood temporarily but strengthens emotional resilience over time. Thus, by choosing specific foods—those that improve mood, we essentially feed happiness on a cellular level. The Happiness Diet: What to Eat? Embarking on a happiness diet involves more than just occasional indulgence in foods that bring momentary pleasure. It's about a consistent incorporation of happiness foods into your daily meals. Foods that increase happiness and contribute to a balanced, joyful state include: - **Fruits that Raise the Happiness Hormone**: Berries, bananas, and avocados are power-packed with vitamins, fiber, and natural sugars that can enhance mood. - **Lean Proteins**: Foods like turkey, chicken, and legumes contain tryptophan, an amino acid that helps in the production of serotonin. - **Fermented Foods**: Yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut can improve gut health, which is linked to mood regulation due to the gut-brain axis. - **Leafy Greens**: Spinach and kale are loaded with folate, a vitamin that plays a key role in mitigating mood disorders. - **Nuts and Seeds**: Flaxseeds, chia seeds, and almonds, rich in ALA and magnesium, are known to assist in the regulation of mood and emotions. By consuming foods that raise the happiness hormone and drinks that elevate our emotional state naturally, we can effectively tip the scales towards a more consistent feeling of contentment and joy. Implementation: Beyond Diet While the direct correlation between foods and mood lighting is evident, achieving a consistently high mood involves a holistic approach. Physical activity, adequate sunlight exposure, maintaining a healthy sleep pattern, and hydration are equally pivotal. Supplements and happiness hormone pills may offer a temporary fix to symptoms of happiness hormone deficiency; however, they are not long-term solutions compared to dietary adjustments and lifestyle modifications. Addressing Happiness Holistically Understanding how to raise the happiness hormone naturally brings us back to the essence of nourishing happiness through our dietary habits. Improving mood naturally, without resorting to quick fixes, requires patience, commitment, and a conscious effort to choose foods that improve mood. It’s fascinating to note how something as simple as modifying our diet can lead to profound changes in how we feel. A happiness diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, can lead to an overall improvement in emotional well-being. Additionally, it’s crucial to acknowledge when professional help is needed. Severe mood disorders and persistent feelings of sadness or emotional imbalance should be evaluated and treated by mental health professionals. Conclusion Eating for emotional well-being is not just about combating the bad mood after a hard day or seeking temporary upliftment—it’s about creating a foundation of happiness hormones in the body through wise nutritional choices. The relationship between foods that improve mood and overall emotional health underscores the importance of diet in maintaining mental and emotional agility. By embracing foods that help happiness, and understanding the intricate dance between nourishment and emotional state, we can traverse the path of life with a mood that is high, spirits that are resilient, and a happiness that is nourished from within."},{"prompt":"Write me a professional and exclusive article of 1000 words, compatible with SEO standards, and ready to rank at the top of search results, with the title (Nourishing Happiness and Improving Mood) using these keywords ( Change the bad mood Why did the mood suddenly change?

The phrase \\"you are what you eat\\" transcends beyond physical well-being, dipping into the realms of emotional health and stability. This interconnection propels the intriguing discussion around \\"Nourishing Happiness and Improving Mood,\\" where the spotlight shines brightly on the profound impact of diet on our emotional state. Why did the mood suddenly change? It's a question that puzzles many. The answer, however, might be as simple as looking at our plates. Food acts not just as fuel but as a powerful modulator of our mood. The sudden mood swings, the inexplicable bad mood, or even the desire to maintain a high mood have direct correlations with our dietary habits. Nutrition and mood are intertwined, making it imperative to focus on foods that improve mood and overall well-being. # The Science of Mood and Food Delving into the realm of nutritional psychiatry, research underscores a compelling narrative: certain foods act like messengers, conveying signals to our brain that can either uplift or dampen our mood. As we navigate through the maze of changing moods—be it a changeable mood, a sudden mood swing, or maintaining mood normalcy after eating—it becomes evident that what we consume plays a pivotal role. The key to unlocking a consistently high mood and combating a bad mood lies within our diet. Foods high in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants can ward off oxidative stress in the brain, promoting happier and more stable moods. This is where the concept of happiness foods comes into play—nutrient-rich foods known to foster an environment conducive to the production and effectiveness of happiness hormones such as serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins. # Harnessing the Power of Happiness Foods Eating to improve mood is not a one-time affair but a lifestyle choice. Incorporating foods that improve mood into daily meal plans can be a game-changing strategy for those eyeing to feed happiness consistently. Key among these are foods that raise the happiness hormone—those containing tryptophan, omega-3 fatty acids, and folic acid—which aid in the secretion of happiness hormones naturally. * **Omega-3 Rich Foods**: Fatty fishes like salmon and mackerel, along with flaxseeds and walnuts, are potent foods that increase happiness by reducing inflammation and promoting brain health. * **Rich in Antioxidants**: Berries, dark chocolate, and spinach fight oxidative stress and are powerful foods that help happiness bloom. * **Vitamin D Sources**: The sunshine vitamin found in fortified foods and fatty fish lights up the path to a better mood, acting as a catalyst for happiness hormones. Couple these with drinks that raise the happiness hormone, like green tea rich in L-theanine, which can reduce anxiety and elevate mood, forming a dietary pattern that sews the seeds of contentment and joy. # Poor Nutrition and Mood Volatility On the flip side, diets high in processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats can exacerbate feelings of depression and anxiety, strengthening the nexus between poor nutrition and mood volatility. This underlines the importance of choosing what we eat wisely, focusing on nutrition that improves mood naturally over reaching out for happiness hormone pills that offer a temporary fix at best. Emphasizing this further, experiencing symptoms of happiness hormone deficiency might signal the need to overhaul dietary habits, incorporating more fruits that raise the happiness hormone along with balanced meals rich in whole foods. Understanding how to raise the happiness hormone through diet can pave the way for sustained emotional well-being. # Practical Tips for Nourishing Happiness 1. **Balance is Key**: Aim for a well-rounded diet abundant in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats to ensure a steady supply of nutrients that support mood regulation. 2. **Stay Hydrated**: Dehydration can lead to irritability and confusion, heightening stress levels. Regular intake of water keeps the mind and body in harmony. 3. **Mindful Eating**: Attune to your body's signals and choose foods that bring happiness and comfort without overindulging in sugary or fatty “comfort foods\\" that spike and plummet mood levels. # Conclusion Nourishing happiness and improving mood transcend beyond mere food choices—it’s a holistic approach towards a healthier, joyful life. Dietary changes, while pivotal, should ideally be part of a broader lifestyle adjustment that includes regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and stress management techniques. In this intricate dance of hormones, nutrients, and emotional responses, taking control of our plates might very well be our first step towards mastering our moods. By fostering an environment where happiness hormones thrive, we unlock the potential to change the bad mood narrative, one meal at a time, leading to a life where the mood is consistently high, and joy is a constant companion."},{"prompt":"Вид дисциплинарного взыскания? - Выговор","completion":"\\"Выговор\\" – это форма дисциплинарного взыскания, которая применяется к работникам за нарушение ими трудовой дисциплины.

Walking into this meadow feels like stepping into a shower with your clothes on, except instead of warm water, it's a freakin' water bomb by some chucklehead Bob-omb who's got nothing better to do than practice his fastball. 2. **Animal Abuse by Big Bob-ombs:** And then, there’s the Big Bob-omb, this oversized wind-up tyrant who thinks he’s the king of the Power Star. Since when did we start letting explosives with a mustache run the show? It’s like if Wile E.

No pressure. Just your typical Friday night. 4. **Recruitment for Recovery:** Lastly, they have the audacity to ask for the Power Star back like it’s a borrowed lawn mower.

Ein ausgewogener Speiseplan ist nicht nur für die körperliche Gesundheit von großer Bedeutung, sondern auch für die geistige Leistungsfähigkeit. Gerade als Schülerinnen und Schüler, die täglich neuen Lerninhalten begegnen und sich konstant weiterentwickeln, ist es essenziell, eurem Körper und Geist die richtigen Nährstoffe zu liefern. Daher möchte ich in diesem Beitrag die Wichtigkeit von gesundem Essen hervorheben und einen Vorschlag zur Verbesserung der Essenssituation an unserer Schule vorstellen. Gesundes Essen beinhaltet eine ausgewogene Mischung aus Kohlenhydraten, Proteinen, Fetten, Vitaminen und Mineralstoffen. Diese Nährstoffe sind für den Körper lebenswichtig und tragen zu einem starken Immunsystem bei, fördern die Konzentration und unterstützen das Wachstum. Eine ausgewogene Ernährung hilft zudem, Krankheiten wie Übergewicht, Diabetes und Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen vorzubeugen. Jedoch habe ich beobachtet, dass die Auswahl an gesunden Lebensmitteln in unserer Schulmensa recht begrenzt ist. Die angebotenen Speisen sind oft zu fettig, zu süß oder enthalten zu viele künstliche Zusatzstoffe. Das macht es schwierig, während der Schulzeit eine ausgewogene und gesunde Ernährung zu gewährleisten. Aus diesem Grund schlage ich vor, dass wir gemeinsam als Schulgemeinschaft eine Initiative zur Verbesserung des Essensangebots starten. Ein erster Schritt könnte die Einrichtung eines Schülerkomitees sein, das sich mit den Verantwortlichen der Mensa trifft, um über eine gesündere Menügestaltung zu diskutieren. Des Weiteren könnten wir Themenwochen veranstalten, bei denen regionale und saisonale Produkte im Mittelpunkt stehen, um sowohl die Vielfalt als auch das Bewusstsein für nachhaltige Ernährung zu fördern. Ein weiterer Vorschlag wäre die Organisation von Workshops zum Thema „Gesunde Snacks“, in denen Schülerinnen und Schüler lernen, wie sie einfache und nährstoffreiche Snacks für die Schule selbst zubereiten können. Diese könnten dann in den Pausen als Alternative zu den üblichen Snacks der Mensa angeboten werden. Abschließend möchte ich betonen, dass die Umstellung auf eine gesündere Ernährung ein gemeinschaftliches Projekt ist, das von allen Mitgliedern der Schulgemeinschaft unterstützt werden muss. Es geht nicht darum, Genussmittel komplett zu verbieten, sondern darum, ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zu finden und gesündere Entscheidungen leichter zugänglich zu machen. Ich bin überzeugt, dass wir gemeinsam einen Weg finden können, die Ernährungssituation an unserer Schule zu verbessern und somit einen wertvollen Beitrag zur Gesundheit und zum Wohlbefinden aller Schülerinnen und Schüler zu leisten.

Wie ihr wisst, ist es wichtig, gut zu essen, um gesund zu bleiben und sich im Unterricht besser konzentrieren zu können. In unserer Mensa gibt es oft Essen, das nicht so gesund ist. Zum Beispiel gibt es viele süße Sachen und fettiges Essen. Aber es gibt nicht so oft frisches Obst oder Gemüse. Ich denke, dass wir das ändern sollten. Mein Vorschlag ist, dass wir einmal pro Woche einen „Gesund-Tag“ machen. An diesem Tag könnte die Mensa nur gesunde Sachen anbieten, wie Salate, Gemüsesuppen und Obst. Wir könnten auch Plakate machen und in der Schule aufhängen, die erklären, warum gesundes Essen gut für uns ist. Ich glaube, wenn wir alle zusammenarbeiten, können wir etwas ändern. Vielleicht können wir auch mit den Lehrern und der Schulleitung sprechen und sie um Unterstützung bitten. Was denkt ihr darüber?

Firstly, it's important to remember that when extending a class in Java, the constructor of the parent class (if one exists that requires arguments) must be called first within the child class constructor. This is done using the \`super\` keyword followed by the necessary arguments for the parent class constructor. Given your instructions and presented choices, it seems there's a minor confusion in the placement of the classes and options. Let's clarify and assume the structure you intended to inquire about is as follows for the \`Adult\` class which extends \`Person\`: \`\`\`java public class Adult extends Person { private int myAge; public Adult(Date dob, int ht, int age) { [?] } } \`\`\` Given this setup, let's dissect the options: A. Correct usage would be: \`\`\`java super(dob, ht); this.myAge = age; \`\`\` This is correct because it calls the superclass (\`Person\`) constructor correctly with \`super(dob, ht);\` and then initializes the \`myAge\` field correctly with \`this.myAge = age;\`. However, in your structure, you mixed the explanation inside the options, but based on typical question patterns, it's clear this is what's meant. B. This would closely represent an attempt to assign \`age\` to a local variable \`int myAge = age;\` after calling the superclass constructor with \`super(dob, ht);\` which is partly correct. However, using \`int\` before \`myAge\` inside the constructor incorrectly declares a new local variable rather than setting the class's \`myAge\` field. C. \`myAge = age; super(dob, ht);\` is syntactically incorrect because \`super()\` must be the first statement in a constructor when it's used. You cannot assign to \`myAge\` before the superclass constructor call. Therefore, given the explanations, the correct approach to extend the \`Adult\` constructor based on the pattern established by the question (and assuming a bit of correction in the structuring of your options) is: **Corrected A:** \`\`\`java super(dob, ht); this.myAge = age; \`\`\` This means your option A is closest to the correct solution, assuming it's about calling \`super(dob, ht);\` and then setting \`this.myAge = age;\`, despite the presentation of the options being a bit off from the standard expectation."},{"prompt":"Consider the following class: public class Athlete { } private String myName; private int myAge; public Athlete(String n, int a) { } = myName n; my Age = a; public class Runner extends Athlete { private int myDistance; public Runner(String n, int a, int d) Which of the following correctly replaces [?] to complete the body for the Runner constructor?

The goal is to correctly extend the \`Athlete\` class within the \`Runner\` class and properly initialize all necessary variables using the constructor of \`Runner\`. First, let's correct and properly structure the \`Athlete\` class: \`\`\`java public class Athlete { private String myName; private int myAge; public Athlete(String n, int a) { myName = n; myAge = a; } } \`\`\` Now, given this corrected structure, we look into the \`Runner\` class extending \`Athlete\` and answer the question: \`\`\`java public class Runner extends Athlete { private int myDistance; public Runner(String n, int a, int d) { [?] } } \`\`\` Let's evaluate the options provided: # A. \`super(); this.myName = n; this.myAge = a; myDistance = d;\` - This option incorrectly attempts to call a no-argument \`super()\` constructor, which does not exist in the \`Athlete\` class since \`Athlete\` only has a constructor that takes two arguments (\`String\` and \`int\`). Also, directly accessing \`myName\` and \`myAge\` would cause a compile-time error due to these fields being \`private\` in the superclass. # B. \`super(n, a); myDistance = this.d;\` - This option correctly calls \`super(n, a);\`, which properly initializes \`myName\` and \`myAge\` by invoking the \`Athlete\` constructor. However, \`myDistance = this.d;\` is incorrect because \`d\` is already a local variable in the constructor's scope and does not need \`this\` keyword. The correct usage would simply be \`myDistance = d;\`, making this option almost correct except for the misused \`this\`. # C. \`super(n, a); myDistance = d;\` - This is the correct option. \`super(n, a);\` correctly calls the constructor of the superclass \`Athlete\` with the appropriate parameters (\`n\` and \`a\`).

The task is focused on overriding the constructor inherited from the superclass \`Adult\`, which itself is an extension of \`Person\`. Based on the given classes, the correct way to address the scenario should follow proper subclass constructor invocation patterns in Java. First, let's correct the \`Person\` definition to ensure it's clear: \`\`\`java public class Person { private Date myDOB; private int myHeight; public Person (Date dob, int ht) { myDOB = dob; myHeight = ht; } } \`\`\` The \`Adult\` class correctly extends \`Person\`, so it might look something like this (assuming correct constructor implementation): \`\`\`java public class Adult extends Person { private int myAge; public Adult(Date dob, int ht, int age) { super(dob, ht); myAge = age; } } \`\`\` Given the setup, let's move on to the \`Athlete\` class constructor: # Understanding the Options: **A. \`super(dob, ht, age); myPractice = pract;\`** - This is **almost correct** based on the information given. However, you mentioned using \`super(dob, ht, age);\` in an option not directly provided in the initially described scenario. Assuming that the \`Adult\` class constructor correctly accepts \`dob\`, \`ht\`, and \`age\`, then invoking \`super(dob, ht, age);\` is the correct way to call the \`Adult\` constructor from \`Athlete\`. **B. \`this.super(dob, ht, age);\`** - This syntax is incorrect in Java. The correct approach to call a superclass's constructor is using \`super()\` without the \`this.\` prefix. **C. \`super(dob, ht, age); Time[] myPractice = pract;\`** - This option correctly calls the superclass constructor with \`super(dob, ht, age);\`, which would be valid if the \`Adult\` constructor is defined as accepting those parameters. However, \`Time[] myPractice = pract;\` incorrectly attempts to declare a new local variable named \`myPractice\` rather than initializing the \`Athlete\` class's field \`myPractice\`. This would not set the \`Athlete\` class's \`myPractice\` field as intended. # Correct Approach: Given the scenario you're asking about, and assuming \`Adult\` is correctly implemented to accept \`dob\`, \`ht\`, and \`age\` as parameters, the correct constructor initialization in \`Athlete\` class that replaces \`[?]\` should be: \`\`\`java super(dob, ht, age); myPractice = pract; \`\`\` Thus, the correct option based on the logical structure provided, with a slight adjustment for clarity, is: - **Close to A**, but written correctly as seen above.

A correct approach would involve either: - Using a system of equations solver. - Performing elimination to reduce the system to two equations with two unknowns, then continuing to eliminate until one variable can be solved outright.

Here’s a simplified overview of how its economy would function: 1. **Collective Ownership**: The community would collectively own and manage land, buildings, and production means. This approach aimed to eliminate private property inequalities and foster a sense of mutual responsibility. 2. **Diverse Occupations**: Individuals would choose their occupations based on their interests and passions, with Fourier believing that engaging in enjoyable work naturally motivates people to contribute productively. The community would ensure a variety of tasks to suit different inclinations and abilities. 3. **Contribution According to Ability**: People would contribute to the community's well-being according to their abilities and interests. Fourier thought that by aligning work with one's passions, labor would not feel burdensome, enhancing productivity and satisfaction. 4. **Distribution According to Need and Contribution**: The community would distribute goods and services based on members' contributions and needs. Fourier envisioned a society where basic needs were guaranteed, and surplus was shared to ensure everyone's well-being. 5. **Economic Self-sufficiency**: The Phalanstère aimed to be economically self-sufficient, producing a diverse range of goods and services to meet its members' needs. Surpluses could be traded with neighboring communities for items not produced internally. 6. **Harmony with Nature**: Fourier emphasized living in harmony with nature. Economic activities would be designed to be sustainable, avoiding exploitation of natural resources. 7. **Incentive for Innovation**: By engaging in work that matched their passions and by benefiting directly from the community's successes, members would be incentivized to innovate and improve production methods and social practices. In summary, the Phalanstère's economy would be a planned, cooperative system focusing on collective well-being, job satisfaction, and sustainability, aiming to create a harmonious and efficient communal life."},{"prompt":"Crea el código para evaluar la similitud semántica de la respuesta dada con la respuesta esperada.

Esto incluiría evitar múltiples interrupciones: \`\`\`javascript function onEdit(e) { var range = e.range; var sheet = range.getSheet(); if (sheet.getName() === \\"Orden de Produccion\\" && range.getRow() >= 1 && range.getRow() <= 10 && range.getColumn() >= 1 && range.getColumn() <= 9) { var oldValue = e.oldValue || \\"\\"; // Usar un valor por defecto si no había un oldValue. range.setValue(oldValue); // Nota: Evitar usar ui.alert aquí para limitar interrupciones. } } // Puedes considerar tener una función dedicada para notificar al usuario, tal vez basada en un temporizador o desencadenada después de que se detecten múltiples ediciones. \`\`\` # Conclusión Debido a las limitaciones intrínsecas en cómo se manejan los eventos y la interacción del usuario con Google Sheets y Apps Script, la mejor solución a largo plazo para controlar accesos y ediciones es utilizar las características de protección de rangos de la propia plataforma y, si es necesario automatizar o informar sobre intentos de edición no autorizados, considerar métodos menos intrusivos y más eficientes en términos de experiencia de usuario que múltiples alertas."},{"prompt":"QUE PASA SI LE CAMBIO EL NOMBRE A LA FUNCION onEdit, dejaria de funcionar?","completion":"Sí, cambiar el nombre de la función \`onEdit\` afectaría su funcionamiento automático, ya que \`onEdit\` es una función especial (o \\"simple trigger\\") reconocida por Google Apps Script que se ejecuta automáticamente cada vez que cualquier usuario edita una celda en la hoja de cálculo a la que está vinculado el script. **¿Qué pasa si cambias su nombre?** - Al cambiar el nombre, esta ya no será reconocida por Google Apps Script como un disparador automático, y por lo tanto, no se ejecutará automáticamente en respuesta a ediciones de celdas. **¿Cómo puedes ejecutar funciones personalizadas en respuesta a ediciones?** - Si necesitas una función que se ejecute en respuesta a ediciones pero con un nombre personalizado o con comportamientos más específicos que lo que permite el simple trigger \`onEdit\`, puedes utilizar un \\"Installable Trigger\\". 1. **Crear un Installable Trigger manualmente:** - Ve al Editor de Apps Script de tu hoja de cálculo. - En el menú, selecciona **Edit > Current project's triggers**. - Haz clic en **+ Add Trigger** en la esquina inferior derecha. - Selecciona la función que deseas ejecutar de la lista desplegable **Choose which function to run**. - En **Select event source**, elige **From spreadsheet**. - En **Select event type**, elige **On edit**. - Configura cualquier otra opción según sea necesario y guarda el trigger. 2. **Crear un Installable Trigger programáticamente:** Además, puedes crear installable triggers mediante Apps Script, pero ten en cuenta que la creación de installable triggers programáticamente para eventos de edición necesita permisos que deben ser autorizados previamente por el usuario. \`\`\`javascript function createOnEditTrigger() { var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActive(); ScriptApp.newTrigger('nombrePersonalizadoDeFuncion') .forSpreadsheet(ss) .onEdit() .create(); } \`\`\` - Donde \`'nombrePersonalizadoDeFuncion'\` sería tu función personalizada que deseas que se ejecute en respuesta a ediciones. Recuerda que luego de ejecutar \`createOnEditTrigger\`, el trigger quedará configurado y tu función personalizada se ejecutará en respuesta a las ediciones, igual que \`onEdit\`, pero con las lógicas específicas que hayas definido. En resumen, \`onEdit\` es un nombre reservado para los simple triggers que se ejecutan automáticamente al editar celdas.

The traditionalist-progressive coalition in Japan that emerges after the emergence of Quirks in this story then manages to get the approval of the National Diet and the then Japanese Prime Minister due to the defence of the National Diet building from the MLA cultists, with the retreat of the Americans from Asia after the emergence of Quirks in this story and the collapse of the post-Soviet Russian Federation and the fascist People's Republic of China ruling over the China region since 1949 to national liberation movements, pro democracy revolutions and dissident movements within these regions leading revolts against the Russian Federation's ruling crypto-communist, Neo-Trotskyist United Russia Party and the PRC's de jure Marxist-Leninist, anti-Stalinist communist but de facto Han supremacist, Han nationalist and Han imperialist Chinese Communist Party, [The traditionalist-progressive coalition in Japan that emerges after the emergence of Quirks in this story exploiting the withdrawal of the USA and the collapse of both Russia and China after the emergence of Quirks in this story] to gain the support of the National Diet to restore the pre-1947 Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary absolute royal democratic Imperial monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire as the government of Japan, albeit under the feudal hereditary military government of the side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, the Tokugawa clan-ruled Tokugawa shogunate as the government of Japan through a combination of democratic referendum and a vote in the National Diet. Japan in this story restores the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, focusing specifically on the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces' ground warfare arm, the Imperial Japanese Army after its [the IJA's] restoration and begins a massive conscription campaign to rebuild the strength of both the post-WW2 Japanese united military forces without offensive capabilities but the right to self defence, the Japanese Self Defence Forces and the restored IJA. the extraordinary beings from a different dimension, with each having their own unique powers and abilities as well as the amount of spiritual energy they hold within their bodies, but all sharing the same ability to create their own armor or clothing created by their power which they can change to whatever shape, color, style, or appearance they want known as an Astral Dress, as well as having an absolute shield that protects them known as an Angel, which can take many forms, from monsters to swords, all of which seem to display some special power plus the ability to fly, who when they arrive to this world create an explosion akin to that of a nuclear missile hitting the earth and detonating known as a Spacequake from Date a Live, known as the Spirits from Date a Live, still exist like in canon Date a Live in this story with the Spacequakes the Spirits cause still being sold to the regular masses of the non-magical world as cosmic accidents and the elite, all female section of the JSDF consisting of mostly female magicians, witches and mages who mostly wear revealing strength and speed enhancing exoskeletons and use advanced plasma weaponry in combat known as the \\"Anti Spirit Team\\" from Date a Live that hunts the Spirits from Date a Live in order to protect the regular people of Japan from the Spirits is still formed in this story. Through a combination of diplomatic negotiations, covert military operations and international treaties, Japan manages to reclaim the entire Korean peninsula and Korea's Jeju Island, Russia's Sahalkin and Kuril Islands and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands without triggering intervention from the USA in Asia or the wrath of Russia and the collapsing PRC in this story. The industrial, military and economic and technological capabilities of the Korean peninsula along with Taiwan and the Pengu Islands are absorbed into Japan after it reclaims these territories in this story, further strengthening Japan and allowing Japan to develop nuclear ICBMs via reverse engineering of Korean nuclear technology in this story. Support to Manchurian liberation groups and pro democracy groups in both Inner and Outer Manchuria by the Japanese in this story leads to the expulsion of CCP and PRC remnant forces from both Inner and Outer Manchuria and the restoration of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled unitary personalist parliamentary royal imperial monarchy of the Empire of Manchukuo as the government of both Inner and Outer Manchuria. The Japanese also facilitate the restoration of the the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Federal absolute royal khanate of the Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan provinces in this story. Covert intervention by Japanese intelligence and military forces in the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty in mainland China to Han nationalists, Han monarchists and Han Democrats in China proper leads to the collapse of the PRC and the restoration of the stratocratic [military dominated/military governed] Beiyang Government-ruled presidental parliamentary republic of the first Republic of China as its [the first Republic of China's] short lived existence as the unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal imperial monarchy of the short lived Empire of China founded and lead by Yuan Shikai, albeit with the Ming dynasty's reigning Imperial family, the Jurchen-Manchurian/Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu as the reigning Imperial family of this restored Empire of China instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants in this story. The Japanese also implement the WW2 era plan of restoring the Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled unitary parliamentary absolute constitutional Roman imperial royal monarchy of the Ottoman Empire in East Turkestan and [the Japanese in this story] also ensure the independence of Tibet in this story. Japan in this story also restores its post-WW1 protectorate of the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast.

Live, who [Kotori] is [Kotori] also one of the Cursed Children in this story, [Kotori] having the agility, leaping skill and speed of both a rabbit and a fox due to her [Kotori] being infected with the Gastrea virus in this story and [Kotori] being Shidō's Initator under the name Aihara Enju [Black Bullet] when he [Shidō] was an Initator under his [Shidō's] real name [Rentarō] in this story, even though Shidō in this story has no idea that she [Kotori] is a Spirit or that Spirits even exist, and Kotori's classmates and schoolmates have no idea that she [Kotori] is a Spirit or a Cursed

Bullet, [Shidō rescuing Kotori from the Spacequake just before she reaced Tina's residence] only to [Shidō with Kotori] stumble upon members of the Anti Spirit Team in a three way war with both another Spirit, who turned out to be the one behind the Spacequake and the Japanese branch of the Quirk users licensed to use their Quirks to protect civilians from Villains, natural disasters, and/or any other kind of harm, with three basic duties: rescue, evacuation, and battle known as Heroes from My Hero Academia, more specifically the Japanese section of those Heroes who take their job as a profession and are subsequently referred to as Pro Heroes from My Hero Academia which Toshinori as All Might belongs to, as the Pro Heroes refuse to believe the Anti Spirit Team actually exists and the Anti Spirit Team will stop at nothing to capture the Spirit, while the confused Spirit fights off both the Pro Heroes and the Anti Spirit Team. Shidō manages to sneak near the Spirit, who [the Spirit that causes the Spacequake] turns out to be the black-haired, black-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, refined, calm and ladylike, academically gifted and intelligent with a Quirk that allows her to create things from her skin fat, Japanese noble heiress and Pro Heroine in traininf Yaoyorozu Momo from My Hero Academia, who [Momo] seems to be [Momo] confused, scared and [Momo] embarrassed due to the revealing nature of her [Momo's] Astral Dress and the fact the Pro Heroes are after her [Momo]. Shidō revealed his presence to Momo and [Shidō] managed to [Shidō] convince her [Momo] to escape with both him and Kotori during the fight between the Anti Spirit Team and the Pro Heroes. But the Pro Heroes later tracked down Shidō and are trying to have him arrested, while Kotori blocks them [the Pro Heroes] from arresting him [Shidō] and Momo is hiding somewhere in the Itsuka family mansion. The excerpt starts with All Might accusing Shidō of wanting to carry on the Midoriya legacy of villainy and criminal ruling, which confuses the other Pro Heroes, to which Shidō is [Shidō] confused as he [Shidō] has always thought of himself [Rentarō/Shidō] as an Itsuka and [Shidō] has no idea he [Shidō] is even a Midoriya by birth as the Pro Heroes try to have Shidō arrested with Kotori blocking them [Kotori] from [the Pro Heroes] doing this [arresting Shidō]. Shidō retaliated to All Might's accusation by [Shidō] stating that if he [Shidō] was truly the son [Rentarō] of a villian [Hiashi as All for One], then why is he [Shidō] a decent, law abiding citizen [Shidō] and how come this villian [All for One] hasn't made the news as Kotori blocks All Might from coming closer. The standoff is interrupted by Tina, who [Tina] had [Tina] made her [Tina's] way to the Itsuka family mansion and the current heiress of the Japanese noble family, ex-samurai clan and martial arts masters of the Tendō [Black Bullet/Ranma 1/2], the beautiful, fair-skinned, violet-eyed, dark brown-green haired, tall, slender and buxom, lively, serious and mischievous but also sadistic, malicious and very cruel Japanese noble heiress and swordsman in training who is also Tina's Promoter, Tendō Kisara from Black Bullet, who [Kisara] is [Kisara] also the oldest biological child of the Itsukas and Kotori's biological older sister, but also the older of Shidō's younger sisters along with also being a Tendō in addition to having a Sound manipulating Quirk in this fanfic, who [Kisara] had [Kisara] been secretly eying the conversation with interest before [Kisara] making her [Kisara's] move. Kisara then bluntly tells All Might that if the Pro Heroes are interested in [the Pro Heroes] hunting down a legend [All for One in the public mind] they [the Pro Heroes] can go ahead, but they [the Pro Heroes] shouldn't involve the Itsuka sisters' [Kisara's and Kotori's] shared adoptive older brother [Shidō] in this. Kisara also mentions that she [Kisara] knows about Kotori and Tina both [Kotori and Tina] comforting Shidō at night when Kisara was Tina's Promotor and Kotori as Enju was Shidō's as his true self Rentarō's Initiator during the war against the Gastrea when he [Shidō] slept, implying that she [Kisara] doesn't have a problem with the younger girls [Tina and Kotori] snuggling beside Shidō at night but that Kotori mustn't forget that she [Kotori] isn't Shidō's only fiancee. P.B: There is no multiverse, multiple universes or multiple worlds in this story. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","completion":"As All Might stood tall, his presence dominating the scene, Shidō looked up at him, confusion etched on his face. Around them, the tension was palpable, with heroes from the Pro Heroes faction arrayed in a semi-circle, their stances aggressive yet controlled. Kotori stood in front of Shidō, her body language defiant, prepared to shield him from whatever was to come. \\"All Might,\\" Kisara's voice cut through the tense air, her tone firm yet laced with amusement, \\"this futile posturing, it does no one any good.\\" Her eyes, sharp and assessing, flicked briefly to Shidō and Kotori before returning to All Might. \\"You're hunting phantoms of the past,\\" she continued, her gaze now including the other Pro Heroes. \\"And in doing so, you risk tearing apart what family we have left.\\" All Might's expression softened slightly, the lines of duty and concern mingled on his face. \\"Shidō, the legacy of your birth—\\" \\"Stop,\\" Shidō interjected, his voice stronger than before, emboldened by Kisara's intervention. \\"My legacy is not written by my birth but by my actions. I have fought alongside Kotori, Tina, and even Kisara, not as a Midoriya bound by the shadows of villainy but as someone who believes in protecting those dear to him.\\" Kotori glanced back at Shidō, her expression softening, then faced All Might again. \\"I've seen what Shidō can do. He has saved lives, not endangered them. And he has done so out of a genuine desire to help, not because of some grandiose sense of destiny tied to his birthright.\\" Tina, who had remained silent until now, added her own observation. \\"In all the time I've known Shidō, he's been nothing but a brother to me. And not once has he used his powers for anything other than helping those in need.\\" All Might, visibly conflicted, looked at each of the young faces before him. \\"The weight of history is a heavy burden to bear,\\" he conceded, \\"but perhaps it is wrong to judge one solely by the sins of their forebears.\\" Then, as if on cue, the sound of subtle footsteps approached, drawing all eyes to the latest arrival. Momo, her expression a mix of concern and resolve, stepped into the open. \\"Momo!\\" Shidō broke away from the standoff, rushing to her side. She looked at him, then at the gathered heroes. \\"I... I don't fully understand what's happening, but Shidō has been nothing but kind to me. I was lost, scared, and he helped me when he could have easily walked away.\\" The assembled heroes exchanged looks, the hard lines of their faces softening, the conviction in Momo's voice resonating with them. All Might, now looking more weary than ever, sighed. \\"Perhaps... we've been too quick to judge. If these young hearts can find a way to forgive and band together, who are we to deny them that chance?\\" He locked eyes with Shidō, a silent understanding passing between them. \\"Go,\\" All Might said finally, stepping aside. \\"But remember, the world watches not just what you do, but why you do it. Let your actions speak of who you truly are and want to be.\\" As Shidō, Kotori, Momo, and Tina gathered, Kisara leading the way, they all shared a moment of relief and unity, aware that the path ahead was fraught with challenges but ready to face them together. The heroes watched them leave, a collective thought unspoken among them: maybe, just maybe, the future was in good hands after all."},{"prompt":"привет. Есть задание по моделированию.

What happened to health and safety regulations? Let me just walk into a live battlefield and use military-grade artillery for funsies. Yeah, because when I think peace, I think 'let's light up the sky with human cannonballs.' Genius idea!\\" 2. **Blast Off Solicitation**: \\"And these Bob-ombs, man, they’re like, 'Hey kiddo, wanna blast off? Go ahead, help yourself.' It's like telling a kid in a candy store he can eat whatever he wants. Except the candies are freaking EXPLOSIVES. 'Bon voyage!' they say.

Use layman terms. Short answer.","completion":"During the Soviet era, the approach towards disabled individuals who couldn't work varied over time but generally was less supportive than in many Western countries. The Soviet system highly valued work contribution to society, and those who couldn't work often faced neglect and marginalization. While there were some state provisions for the disabled, like pensions and specialized institutions, these were often minimal and not well-developed. Accessibility, social integration, and rehabilitation services were limited, resulting in many disabled individuals living in challenging conditions and facing societal stigma. The focus was more on trying to make disabled individuals fit into the system rather than adapting the system to meet their needs."},{"prompt":"How does China handled the disable who could not work for themselves? Use layman terms. Short answer.","completion":"China's approach to handling individuals with disabilities who cannot work for themselves has evolved significantly over the years. Traditionally, the responsibility for care fell largely on family members, with limited support from the government. However, recent decades have seen improvements in policies and laws aimed at protecting the rights of disabled people, such as the \\"Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons\\" which promotes social welfare, accessibility, and employment opportunities. Despite these advances, support can still vary greatly depending on where you are in China, with urban areas generally offering better services than rural ones. The government provides some financial assistance, healthcare, and rehabilitation services, and there are efforts to integrate disabled individuals into the society and workforce. However, there are still challenges in implementation, social stigma, and full accessibility. Overall, China is making progress but still has room for improvement in caring for individuals with disabilities who cannot work."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],O={key:0},W={key:1};function E(i,e,l,p,n,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
