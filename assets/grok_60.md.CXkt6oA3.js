I don’t know what I would do without them.” (Yuri feels a strong kick from her unborn son.) Yuri: (smiling) “Ah, he’s always active in there. It’s such a wonderful feeling. I hope he knows how loved he already is.” (Yuri glances at the clock.) Yuri: “Oh no, I completely lost track of time! I was supposed to be at the club meeting ages ago! I need to hurry!” (Yuri quickly gathers her things and rushes out of the house, hoping to make it to the clubroom without causing too much concern. But on the way there, she starts having contractions.) Yuri: “Oh no…they’re starting…” (Yuri continues to have contractions. Thankfully, she manages to arrive in the clubroom - even though she’s started to push her son out.) Natsuki: (noticing Yuri’s arrival) “Yuri, you’re finally here! Are you okay?” Yuri: (breathing heavily) “I-I’m sorry for being late. I…I forgot about the time.” Monika: (concerned) “Yuri, you don’t look well. Are you feeling alright?” Sayori: (wide-eyed) “Yuri, your face is so pale. Are you in pain?” Yuri: (gritting her teeth) “I…I think…I’m going into labor.” Natsuki: (shocked) “What?! Are you serious?!” Yuri: “Yes…my water just broke. M-M-My son…he’s coming!!” (Eventually, Yuri can’t hold it back any longer and she starts giving birth to her son.) Yuri: “AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!” (Everyone in the clubroom is in a state of shock and panic as Yuri experiences labor pains and gives birth to her son right there in the clubroom. They frantically look around for any supplies or help they can offer.) Monika: (trying to stay calm) “Quick, someone call an ambulance!” Sayori: (reaching for her phone) “I-I’ll call right away!” Natsuki: (looking around for something useful) “We need towels, blankets, anything we can use to make her comfortable!” (Monika and Natsuki rush to gather any available materials while Sayori calls for emergency assistance. Yuri continues to push through the pain as her friends do their best to support her.) Monika: (placing a soft pillow beneath Yuri) “You’re doing great, Yuri. Just keep breathing and stay strong.” Sayori: (on the phone with emergency services) “Yes, my friend is in labor and she’s giving birth right now! Please hurry!” Natsuki: (handing Yuri a glass of water) “Here, try to stay hydrated. We’re here for you, Yuri.” (Yuri continues to scream and push, her friends doing their best to comfort and encourage her in this unexpected situation. After what feels like an eternity, they hear the sound of sirens approaching.) Monika: (relieved) “Help is on the way, Yuri! Just a little bit longer, okay?” (Soon, paramedics burst through the clubroom doors, carrying a stretcher.) Paramedic: “We’re here for the pregnant woman in labor. Where is she?” Yuri: (gasping) “I’m over here!” (The paramedics rush over to Yuri, who is preparing for the last push.)","completion":"Paramedic: \\"Alright, ma\'am. We\'re going to help you deliver your baby. Just keep pushing and we\'ll guide you through it.\\" (Yuri continues to push with the help of the paramedics. After a few more intense pushes, the baby finally emerges, crying loudly.) Paramedic: \\"Congratulations, it\'s a healthy baby boy!\\" (Yuri smiles through her exhaustion and tears of joy, reaching out to hold her newborn son.) Yuri: \\"Thank you... Thank you all so much.\\" (With the help of the paramedics, Yuri and her baby are carefully placed on the stretcher and taken to the ambulance. Her friends follow closely behind, giving her words of encouragement and reassurance.) Monika: \\"We\'re so proud of you, Yuri. You did amazing.\\" Sayori: \\"Your little boy is going to have the best mom ever, Yuri!\\" Natsuki: \\"Yeah, and we\'ll be here every step of the way to support you both.\\" (Yuri smiles gratefully at her friends, feeling overwhelmed with love and gratitude for their presence and support.) Yuri: \\"I can\'t thank you all enough. You mean the world to me.\\" (As the ambulance drives away, the clubroom is left in a state of shock and disbelief at what just happened. But amidst the chaos, they feel a profound sense of awe and love for Yuri and her new baby boy.) Monika: \\"I think we just witnessed something truly miraculous.\\" Sayori: \\"Yeah, who knew our literature club would turn into a delivery room?\\" Natsuki: \\"Well, all I know is that this kid is going to have the best birth story ever.\\" (With smiles on their faces and warmth in their hearts, the club members clean up the clubroom and wait eagerly for news of Yuri and her baby\'s well-being. Little did they know that this unexpected turn of events would only strengthen their bond and deepen their friendship even more.)"},{"prompt":"def holdamb(nav, xa): \\"\\"\\" hold integer ambiguity \\"\\"\\" nb = nav.nx-nav.na v = np.zeros(nb) H = np.zeros((nb, nav.nx)) nv = 0 for m in range(gn.uGNSS.GNSSMAX): for f in range(nav.nf): n = 0 index = [] for i in range(gn.uGNSS.MAXSAT): sys, _ = gn.sat2prn(i+1) if sys != m or nav.fix[i, f] != 2: continue index.append(IB(i+1, f, nav.na)) n += 1 nav.fix[i, f] = 3 # hold # constraint to fixed ambiguity for i in range(1, n): v[nv] = (xa[index[0]]-xa[index[i]]) - (nav.x[index[0]]-nav.x[index[i]]) H[nv, index[0]] = 1.0 H[nv, index[i]] = -1.0 nv += 1 if nv > 0: R = np.eye(nv)*VAR_HOLDAMB # update states with constraints nav.x, nav.P, _ = kfupdate(nav.x, nav.P, H[0:nv, :], v[0:nv], R) return 0 def relpos(nav, obs, obsb): \\"\\"\\" relative positioning for RTK-GNSS \\"\\"\\" nf = nav.nf if gn.timediff(obs.t, obsb.t) != 0: return -1 rs, _, dts, svh = satposs(obs, nav) rsb, _, dtsb, svhb = satposs(obsb, nav) # non-differencial residual for base yr, er, elr = zdres(nav, obsb, rsb, dtsb, svhb, nav.rb, 0) ns, iu, ir = selsat(nav, obs, obsb, elr) y = np.zeros((ns*2, nf*2)) e = np.zeros((ns*2, 3)) if ns < 4: return -1 y[ns:, :] = yr[ir, :] e[ns:, :] = er[ir, :] # Kalman filter time propagation udstate(nav, obs, obsb, iu, ir) xa = np.zeros(nav.nx) xp = nav.x # non-differencial residual for rover yu, eu, el = zdres(nav, obs, rs, dts, svh, xp[0:3]) y[:ns, :] = yu[iu, :] e[:ns, :] = eu[iu, :] el = el[iu] sat = obs.sat[iu] nav.el[sat-1] = el # DD residual v, H, R = ddres(nav, xp, y, e, sat, el) Pp = nav.P # Kalman filter measurement update xp, Pp, _ = kfupdate(xp, Pp, H, v, R) # non-differencial residual for rover after measurement update yu, eu, _ = zdres(nav, obs, rs, dts, svh, xp[0:3]) y[:ns, :] = yu[iu, :] e[:ns, :] = eu[iu, :] # residual for float solution v, H, R = ddres(nav, xp, y, e, sat, el) if valpos(nav, v, R): nav.x = xp nav.P = Pp else: nav.smode = 0 nb, xa = resamb_lambda(nav, sat) nav.smode = 5 # float if nb > 0: yu, eu, _ = zdres(nav, obs, rs, dts, svh, xa[0:3]) y[:ns, :] = yu[iu, :] e[:ns, :] = eu[iu, :] v, H, R = ddres(nav, xa, y, e, sat, el) if valpos(nav, v, R): if nav.armode == 3: holdamb(nav, xa) nav.smode = 4 # fix nav.t = obs.t return 0 convert ths python code to matlab. write simple as possible","completion":"function holdamb(nav, xa) % hold integer ambiguity nb = nav.nx - nav.na; v = zeros(nb, 1); H = zeros(nb, nav.nx); nv = 0; for m = 1:gn.uGNSS.GNSSMAX for f = 1:nav.nf n = 0; index = []; for i = 1:gn.uGNSS.MAXSAT [sys, ~] = gn.sat2prn(i+1); if sys ~= m || nav.fix(i, f) ~= 2 continue; end index(end+1) = IB(i+1, f, nav.na); n = n + 1; nav.fix(i, f) = 3; % hold end % constraint to fixed ambiguity for i = 2:n v(nv+1) = (xa(index(1))-xa(index(i))) - (nav.x(index(1))-nav.x(index(i))); H(nv+1, index(1)) = 1.0; H(nv+1, index(i)) = -1.0; nv = nv + 1; end end end if nv > 0 R = eye(nv) * VAR_HOLDAMB; % update states with constraints [~, nav.x, nav.P] = kfupdate(nav.x, nav.P, H(1:nv, :), v(1:nv), R); end end function relpos(nav, obs, obsb) % relative positioning for RTK-GNSS nf = nav.nf; if gn.timediff(obs.t, obsb.t) ~= 0 return -1; end [rs, ~, dts, svh] = satposs(obs, nav); [rsb, ~, dtsb, svhb] = satposs(obsb, nav); % non-differencial residual for base [yr, er, elr] = zdres(nav, obsb, rsb, dtsb, svhb, nav.rb, 0); [ns, iu, ir] = selsat(nav, obs, obsb, elr); y = zeros(ns*2, nf*2); e = zeros(ns*2, 3); if ns < 4 return -1; end y(ns+1:end, :) = yr(ir, :); e(ns+1:end, :) = er(ir, :); % Kalman filter time propagation nav = udstate(nav, obs, obsb, iu, ir); xa = zeros(nav.nx, 1); xp = nav.x; % non-differencial residual for rover [yu, eu, el] = zdres(nav, obs, rs, dts, svh, xp(1:3)); y(1:ns, :) = yu(iu, :); e(1:ns, :) = eu(iu, :); el = el(iu); sat = obs.sat(iu); nav.el(sat) = el; % DD residual [v, H, R] = ddres(nav, xp, y, e, sat, el); Pp = nav.P; % Kalman filter measurement update [xp, Pp, ~] = kfupdate(xp, Pp, H, v, R); % non-differencial residual for rover after measurement update [yu, eu, ~] = zdres(nav, obs, rs, dts, svh, xp(1:3)); y(1:ns, :) = yu(iu, :); e(1:ns, :) = eu(iu, :); % residual for float solution [v, H, R] = ddres(nav, xp, y, e, sat, el); if valpos(nav, v, R) nav.x = xp; nav.P = Pp; else nav.smode = 0; end [~, xa] = resamb_lambda(nav, sat); nav.smode = 5; % float if nb > 0 [yu, eu, ~] = zdres(nav, obs, rs, dts, svh, xa(1:3)); y(1:ns, :) = yu(iu, :); e(1:ns, :) = eu(iu, :); [v, H, R] = ddres(nav, xa, y, e, sat, el); if valpos(nav, v, R) if nav.armode == 3 holdamb(nav, xa); end nav.smode = 4; % fix end end nav.t = obs.t; end"},{"prompt":"(In the clubroom…) Natsuki: “Yuri STILL hasn’t arrived yet?!” Monika: “She’s just running late.

Little Lily’s brother has long lived in the vast Tokyo separately from his parents since he was already 38 years old. The younger sister visited him only on weekends and only with her parents. Lily just turned 10 years old. Lily wanted to see her beloved brother as often as possible. Lily simply adored her older brother and didn’t have a soul in him.

Lily got out of bed and opened the curtained window. She went to the wardrobe with clothes and began to choose what to wear. Lily carefully approached her choice and chose a beautiful short skirt and a frank short top. Lily went into the bathroom to wash her face and brush her teeth. Lily went into the kitchen and wished her parents good morning. The table was already set and breakfast was already waiting for her. Father drew attention to Lily’s outfit and expressed his dissatisfaction, telling her that it was not too frank and that her skirt was too short. Lily froze for a moment at her father’s stern expression. His mother hit him on the forehead with a spoon and replied that Lily was a girl and this outfit really suits her.

A surge of exhilaration coursed through her veins as she skipped into the bathroom, her silver locks bouncing with every step. She splashed cool water onto her face, washing away any remnants of sleep. After carefully brushing her teeth, she admired her reflection once again, ensuring that not a strand of hair was out of place. Entering the kitchen, the comforting aroma of freshly brewed green tea filled the air. Lily greeted her parents, \\"Ohayōgozaimasu, Otōsan, Okāsan!\\" Her words dipped with respect as she addressed her father and mother. They turned their attention towards her, her father\'s eyebrows knitting together in disapproval upon noticing her outfit. \\"Ano, Lily-chan, isn\'t your skirt a bit too short?\\" he inquired, his voice stern. Before Lily had a chance to respond, her mother, wielding a spoon, playfully tapped her father\'s forehead. \\"Now, now Kazuhiko-san. Lily-chan looks absolutely adorable in that outfit. It\'s perfect for a bright young girl like her!\\" Lily breathed a sigh of relief as her mother came to her defense. She knew deep down that both her parents cherished her and wouldn\'t want to stifle her vibrant spirit. Encouraged by her mother\'s support, Lily seized the opportunity to present her heartfelt request. \\"Ano, Otōsan, Okāsan, I\'ve been thinking... You see, I really, really want to visit Oniichan in Tokyo on my own. I promise I\'ll be careful and responsible. Please, can I go on my own on weekends?\\" she pleaded, her eyes brimming with hope.

Clutching her small pink backpack filled with snacks and her diary, she embarked on the journey from Chishiki towards the bustling metropolis. The train station was just a short walk from her house, and as she stepped onto the platform, excitement tingled through her body. With every swaying motion and rhythmic clickety-clack of the train, the scenery transformed from verdant landscapes to towering buildings. Passing through the stations of Nagoya, Shizuoka, and Yokohama, Lily admired the view from her window, her eyes avidly scanning the cityscape as it unfolded before her. Finally, as the train pulled into Tokyo Station, Lily\'s heart soared with anticipation. Gathering her belongings, she skipped down the platform, ready to reunite with her cherished brother in this vibrant city of dreams. Little Lily\'s determination had opened the door to a new chapter in her life, and with each passing moment, her bond with her brother grew stronger, paving the way for unforgettable adventures that awaited them both."},{"prompt":"Add more description of Lily and her outfit.","completion":"Chapter 1: A Little Sister\'s Determination Asahina Lily, a bright and lively 10-year-old girl, lived in the charming town of Chishiki, nestled between the rolling hills and azure blue rivers of Japan.

Lily greeted her parents, \\"Ohayōgozaimasu, Otōsan, Okāsan!\\" Her words dipped with respect as she addressed her father and mother. They turned their attention towards her, her father\'s eyebrows knitting together in disapproval upon noticing her outfit. \\"Ano, Lily-chan, isn\'t your skirt a bit too short?\\" he inquired, his voice stern. Before Lily had a chance to respond, her mother, wielding a spoon, playfully tapped her father\'s forehead. \\"Now, now Kazuhiko-san. Lily-chan looks absolutely adorable in that outfit. It\'s perfect for a bright young girl like her!\\" Lily breathed a sigh of relief as her mother came to her defense.

We\'ll allow you to travel to Tokyo on weekends by yourself.\\" Uncontainable joy washed over Lily, and she could hardly suppress a joyful yelp. Grateful tears welled up in her eyes as she wrapped her arms around her parents in a tight embrace, overwhelmed with gratitude. Thus, Lily\'s adventure to Tokyo began. Clutching her small pink backpack filled with snacks and her diary, she embarked on the journey from Chishiki towards the bustling metropolis.

Add a funny moment when Lily took off her skirt in front of her brother and add Lily\'s funny dialogue.","completion":"Chapter 1: A Little Sister\'s Determination Asahina Lily, a bright and lively 10-year-old girl, lived in the charming town of Chishiki, nestled between the rolling hills and azure blue rivers of Japan. Her heart overflowed with love for her dear older brother, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Despite the distance that separated them, with Haru living in the bustling city of Tokyo, Lily faithfully visited him every weekend accompanied by their parents. However, Lily yearned to spend even more time with her beloved brother, to be with him every day, to share in his joys and sorrows. This fateful morning marked the beginning of a new step in Lily\'s life. Awakening with the first rays of sunlight, she stretched her arms and legs cozily under her fluffy, pink floral bedspread. The soft scent of cherry blossoms wafted through her room, filling it with a delicate fragrance. Walls adorned with posters of colorful manga characters created by Lily herself, her room was a testament to her love for creativity and art. Rays of sunlight filtered through the crack in the curtains, casting a gentle glow on Lily\'s luxurious silver hair that cascaded down to her waist. Its silvery strands shimmered like moonlight, giving her an ethereal beauty. Her cerulean blue eyes sparkled with excitement as she flung open the curtains, inviting the morning sunlight and the sweet melody of chirping birds to fill her room. Today was the day she would present her plea to her parents, a plea that would grant her the freedom to visit Tokyo independently, the city where her beloved brother lived. With a determined glint in her eyes, Lily stood before her wardrobe, a treasure trove of cute and fashionable clothes. She meticulously selected a beautiful short skirt with delicate lace trimmings. Its pastel pink hue mirrored the blush on her cheeks when she wore it. She paired the skirt with a daringly short, yet charmingly adorable top, adorned with a whimsical floral pattern. The fabric clung to her petite frame, accentuating her youthful energy and vibrance. As she dressed, she couldn\'t help but twirl around in front of the mirror, the fabric swirling around her like a vibrant carnival. The skirt\'s ruffled layers danced with each graceful turn, as if rejoicing in the joy that emanated from Lily\'s heart. The top, with its delicate ribbon straps, sat perfectly on her shoulders, framing her collarbone like a delicate piece of art. A surge of exhilaration coursed through her veins as she skipped into the bathroom, her silver locks bouncing with every step. She splashed cool water onto her face, washing away any remnants of sleep. After carefully brushing her teeth, she admired her reflection once again, ensuring not a strand of hair was out of place.

I\'m here!\\" But as she turned the corner, ready to embrace him, her eyes went wide with shock and embarrassment. Haru, completely engrossed in his manga drawing, turned to face Lily, his eyes widening as he took in her outfit. With a jolt of realization, Lily burst into awkward laughter, her cheeks turning a lovely shade of pink. \\"Oops! Sorry, Oniichan! I forgot I was still wearing this skirt!

Ensure that the values are correctly calculated and that the data being used is accurate and up-to-date. 2. The value of `threshold` might be too high for the current market conditions. Try reducing it to a smaller value, such as 0.01, to see if it generates signals for you. 3. The data obtained from the `client.depth` and `client.ticker_price` methods might not be accurate or updated. Double-check that the API calls are returning the correct data.

L\'intégration de ce processus dans un système d\'information hospitalier (SIH) peut faciliter la gestion des dossiers médicaux, améliorer la communication entre les professionnels de santé et garantir des soins de qualité. Voici les principaux éléments à prendre en compte lors de la conception et du développement d\'un SIH pour le processus de consultation prénatal à l\'accouchement du nouveau-né : 1. Dossier médical électronique (DME) : Le SIH devrait permettre la création et la gestion d\'un DME complet et centralisé pour chaque patiente. Ce dossier devrait inclure les informations médicales concernant la grossesse, les antécédents médicaux, les résultats des tests, les échographies, les traitements prescrits, etc. 2. Suivi de la grossesse : Le SIH devrait intégrer un système de suivi de la grossesse qui permettra aux professionnels de santé de planifier et de suivre toutes les consultations prénatales, les vaccinations, les échographies, les analyses de sang, etc. Il devrait également permettre de générer des rappels pour les futures consultations et les tests à effectuer. 3. Communication entre les professionnels de santé : Le SIH devrait faciliter la communication entre les différents professionnels de santé impliqués dans le processus, tels que les gynécologues, les obstétriciens, les pédiatres, les sages-femmes, etc. Il devrait permettre de partager les informations médicales pertinentes de manière sécurisée et en temps réel, afin d\'assurer une coordination optimale des soins. 4. Gestion des résultats des examens : Le SIH devrait permettre de stocker et de gérer les résultats des examens réalisés pendant la grossesse, tels que les échographies, les analyses de sang, les tests génétiques, etc. Il devrait permettre l\'accès facile à ces résultats pour les professionnels de santé autorisés, afin d\'assurer un suivi adéquat de la santé de la mère et du bébé. 5. Préparation à l\'accouchement : Le SIH devrait inclure des fonctionnalités pour la planification de l\'accouchement, la réservation des salles d\'accouchement, le suivi de la dilatation, la gestion des médicaments administrés pendant le travail, etc. Il devrait également permettre de documenter tout événement lié à l\'accouchement, tels que les complications, les interventions médicales, etc. 6. Suivi post-partum : Le SIH devrait également inclure une fonctionnalité pour assurer un suivi post-partum adéquat. Il devrait inclure des informations sur l\'état de santé de la mère après l\'accouchement, la gestion de la lactation, la contraception post-partum, etc. En résumé, la conception et le développement d\'un SIH pour le processus de consultation prénatale à l\'accouchement du nouveau-né devraient prendre en compte la centralisation des informations médicales, la communication entre les professionnels de santé, la gestion des résultats des examens, la planification de l\'accouchement et le suivi post-partum."},{"prompt":"Generate a good looking and modern html landing page for “google maps scraping” chrome extension","completion":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/8.0.1/normalize.min.css\\"> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap\\"> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"styles.css\\"> <title>Google Maps Scraping Chrome Extension</title> </head> <body> <header class=\\"header\\"> <nav class=\\"navbar\\"> <div class=\\"navbar-brand\\"> <img src=\\"logo.png\\" alt=\\"Logo\\"> <span class=\\"navbar-title\\">Google Maps Scraping</span> </div> <ul class=\\"navbar-menu\\"> <li class=\\"navbar-item\\"><a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"navbar-link\\">Home</a></li> <li class=\\"navbar-item\\"><a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"navbar-link\\">Features</a></li> <li class=\\"navbar-item\\"><a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"navbar-link\\">Pricing</a></li> <li class=\\"navbar-item\\"><a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"navbar-link\\">Contact</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class=\\"hero\\"> <h1 class=\\"hero-title\\">Scrape Google Maps Data Effortlessly</h1> <p class=\\"hero-subtitle\\">Unlock the power of Google Maps with our Chrome extension</p> <a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"hero-cta\\">Get Started</a> </div> </header> <section class=\\"features\\"> <div class=\\"feature\\"> <img src=\\"feature1.png\\" alt=\\"Feature 1\\"> <h2 class=\\"feature-title\\">Easy to Use</h2> <p class=\\"feature-description\\">Our extension provides a simple and intuitive interface that makes scraping data from Google Maps a breeze.</p> </div> <div class=\\"feature\\"> <img src=\\"feature2.png\\" alt=\\"Feature 2\\"> <h2 class=\\"feature-title\\">Advanced Filtering</h2> <p class=\\"feature-description\\">Efficiently filter and extract only the data that you need by specifying various parameters such as location, category, and more.</p> </div> <div class=\\"feature\\"> <img src=\\"feature3.png\\" alt=\\"Feature 3\\"> <h2 class=\\"feature-title\\">Data Export</h2> <p class=\\"feature-description\\">Export your scraped data in multiple formats like CSV, Excel, or JSON to easily integrate it with your preferred tools and applications.</p> </div> </section> <section class=\\"pricing\\"> <h2 class=\\"section-title\\">Simple Pricing</h2> <p class=\\"section-subtitle\\">Choose a plan that suits your needs</p> <div class=\\"pricing-cards\\"> <div class=\\"pricing-card\\"> <h3 class=\\"pricing-title\\">Basic</h3> <p class=\\"pricing-description\\">Ideal for individuals and small businesses</p> <p class=\\"pricing-price\\">9.99/month</p> <a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"pricing-cta\\">Get Started</a> </div> <div class=\\"pricing-card\\"> <h3 class=\\"pricing-title\\">Pro</h3> <p class=\\"pricing-description\\">Perfect for larger teams and unlimited usage</p> <p class=\\"pricing-price\\">19.99/month</p> <a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"pricing-cta\\">Get Started</a> </div> </div> </section> <footer class=\\"footer\\"> <p class=\\"footer-text\\">© 2021 Google Maps Scraping.

The Forum is bathed in warm golden sunlight, casting long shadows across the cobblestone ground, with iconic ruins of ancient Roman architecture towering in the background. The compositions emphasize the stark contrast between the grandeur of the Forum and the beggar\'s destitution, with the beggar placed in the lower part of the frame and the monumental ruins dominating the upper part. The atmosphere is somber and melancholic, evoking a sense of empathy and reflection. Realized as a black and white photograph, shot with a wide-angle lens, capturing the vastness and historical significance of the location, while the shallow depth of field directs the viewer\'s attention to the beggar\'s face, telling a poignant story of poverty and inequality. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: In the heart of the Roman Forum, a beggar clad in rags, kneeling on the ground with his hands cupped, his eyes closed in prayerful surrender, surrounded by ancient marble pillars and weathered statues, covered in moss and ivy. The Forum is slowly coming to life with the first rays of sunlight peeking through the clouds, revealing a serene and peaceful ambiance. The beggar\'s presence is a contrasting reminder of the struggles and hardships faced by ordinary people in the midst of grand historical settings. The compositions take advantage of the play of light and shadows, with the beggar positioned off-center, allowing the sunlight to create striking contrasts and bring attention to his face and hands. The overall mood is one of tranquility and contemplation, drawing the viewer into the beggar\'s inner world. Realized as an oil painting, with vibrant colors and textured brushstrokes, capturing the timeless elegance of the Roman Forum and infusing the image with a sense of nostalgia and historical significance. --ar 9:16 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: Amidst the hustle and bustle of tourists and locals exploring the Roman Forum, a beggar clad in rags and with weather-beaten skin stands with back slightly hunched, extended hand stretched towards passersby, silently pleading for help. The crowd is captured in motion, blurred figures moving through the scene, giving a sense of urgency and the beggar\'s insignificance in the midst of a busy world. The environment is filled with ancient ruins and crumbling architecture, with patches of sunlight illuminating the scene, creating a contrast between light and shadow. The compositions use a wide-angle lens, capturing the vastness of the Roman Forum and the poignant isolation of the beggar against the backdrop of grand historical structures. The atmosphere is chaotic and bustling, evoking a feeling of overwhelming despair and the harsh realities of poverty. Realized as an sketch-like illustration, with bold lines and minimal color palette, the image carries a sense of immediacy and raw emotion, reminiscent of the social commentaries prevalent in social realism artwork. --ar 16:9 --v 5 /imagine prompt: At the Roman Forum, a beggar sitting on a worn-out wooden crate, surrounded by a sea of ancient ruins, moss-covered stones, and patches of blooming wildflowers, his hands cupped towards the heavens as if in prayer. The remnants of grand Roman architecture provide a powerful backdrop, evoking both a sense of majesty and decay. The compositions frame the beggar against the backdrop of a crumbling archway, emphasizing his fragility and vulnerability. The atmosphere is bittersweet, with the warm glow of a setting sun casting long shadows on the ground, symbolizing hope amidst adversity. Realized as a sculpture, crafted with intricate details and textures, the image captures a fleeting moment frozen in time, allowing viewers to contemplate the beggar\'s circumstances and reflect on the transient nature of human existence. --ar 1:1 --v 5.2"},{"prompt":"как на англиском называются перекаты(в экшен играх можно скользить ногами)","completion":"Перекаты на английском называются \\"slides\\"."},{"prompt":"(In the clubroom…) Natsuki: “Yuri STILL hasn’t arrived yet?!” Monika: “She’s just running late.

In a quasi-experimental design, participants are not randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups, as is typical in a true experimental design. Instead, researchers select pre-existing groups or individuals and analyze the effects of an independent variable on them. Quasi-experimental design can be useful in situations where it is not feasible, ethical, or practical to conduct a true experiment. For example, if researchers aim to evaluate the impact of a specific teaching method on student achievement, they may select two existing classes within a school and apply the method to one of them. The comparison between the two groups would provide valuable insights even though random assignment was not possible. However, one must be cautious while interpreting results from a quasi-experimental design, as it may be challenging to establish causality due to the lack of randomization. Factors such as pre-existing differences between groups could contribute to any observed effect. Nonetheless, researchers can still obtain valuable data and insights using quasi-experimental designs in situations where true experiments are impractical."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Yoimiya walks across the streets of Inazuma.

This concept is reflected in the belief that the universe consists of three worlds: heaven, earth, and hell. Heaven is considered the superior world, although this is contradictory as earth\'s rotation constantly changes the perception of up and down. Regardless, most religions teach that God resides in the heavens, leading believers to raise their hands in prayer and look towards the sky when seeking His guidance. Some cultures believe that God dwells on mountain tops, the highest points on earth. In any case, God\'s dwelling place is always seen as above, watching over the world below. The middle ground between heaven and hell is the earth, known as Midgard according to the Scandinavians. This is where humans and other living creatures reside. The earth is said to be connected to heaven through a rainbow bridge, which the gods descend upon. Additionally, its volcanic craters and fissures are believed to connect it to hell, the realm of darkness and oblivion. In this middle world, nature exists - the green grass, flowing rivers, and mighty oceans. It serves as a neutral battleground where good and evil constantly clash. Below, in the world of Hel, lies darkness, flames, torment, and suffering - what we commonly interpret as hell. This is the great beneath, as we perceive hell to be down while heaven is up. The middle place, earth, acts as the dividing line between these two realms. Hell is where the forces of evil reside, constantly attempting to overthrow the gods in heaven and bringing sorrow to the earth. This entire system is essentially an anatomical myth, where the ancient idea of heaven being a domed temple atop a mountain represents the human skull and its divine contents.

Yoimiya: (in awe) That\'s incredible! So, you\'re saying that the sea itself has blessed you with this precious little one. Kokomi: (nodding) In a way, yes. It reminds me of the responsibility I have as a leader of the resistance and as a mother. I must protect not just my people, but also this child, who embodies our heritage.

Kokomi: (smiling sadly) This... is a long story. Sit down, Yoimiya. I\'ll explain. Yoimiya takes a seat next to Kokomi, eager to understand this strange occurrence. Kokomi: You see, when I was giving birth to my child, something incredible happened. Throughout my pregnancy, I had been keeping a close connection to the sea, drawing strength from its tides and currents. I invoked the power of the Sangonomiya clan, allowing me to tap into the sea\'s elemental energy. Yoimiya listens intently, her eyes wide with amazement. Kokomi: During the birthing process, the sea\'s essence mixed with my own as my child came into this world. Instead of amniotic fluid, seafoam enveloped them, a symbol of the bond between the sea and our bloodline. Yoimiya: That\'s... that\'s incredible, Kokomi. But what about the father?

I can\'t imagine the sacrifices you had to make. Kokomi: It hasn\'t been easy, but I believe in the vision of our nation. And I believe in the future my child will have. They will grow up surrounded by the love of the Sangonomiya clan and the strength of the sea. They will become a symbol of hope and unity. Yoimiya: Kokomi, your strength and devotion are truly admirable. I have no doubt that your child will be blessed with incredible abilities and a bright future. Kokomi: Thank you, Yoimiya. Your support means the world to me. And no matter what challenges lie ahead, I will do everything in my power to ensure my child\'s happiness and the prosperity of Inazuma.

Elsődlegesen a banán segíthet hidratálni a szervezetedet, hiszen magas víztartalma van. Ez segíthet csökkenteni a folyadékveszteséget, amit a melegben könnyedén megtapasztalhatsz. Emellett a banánban lévő cukor és rostok rövid távú energiát biztosíthatnak számodra, ami segíthet csökkenteni a kimerülést és a fáradtságot. A banánban található kálium, magnézium és C-vitamin segíthet fenntartani az elektrolit-egyensúlyt és támogathatja a szervezet működését. Ezek az ásványi anyagok fontosak a megfelelő izomműködés, az idegrendszer egészsége és a szív- és érrendszer normális működése szempontjából. Ezenkívül a banánban található prebiotikumok támogathatják az emésztést és segíthetnek fenntartani az egészséges bélflórát. Ezáltal javulhat az emésztőrendszer működése és csökkenhet a hasi diszkomfort érzése. Mindent egybevéve, ha megettél egy banánt kánikulában, akkor valószínűleg segítettél hidratáltnak maradni, energiával látott el, támogatta az elektrolit-egyensúlyt, előmozdította az emésztést és prebiotikumai segítettek fenntartani az egészséges bélflórát."},{"prompt":"A banán jó a kovid ellen","completion":"A banán önmagában nem nyújt védelmet a COVID-19 vírus ellen. A COVID-19 egy vírusfertőzés, amelyet a SARS-CoV-2 vírus okoz. A vírus terjedése ellen legjobban a megfelelő higiéniai intézkedések betartása, például a rendszeres kézmosás és az arcmaszk viselése segít. A COVID-19 elleni védekezésnek része lehet a táplálkozásra és az egészség megőrzésére való odafigyelés is. A megfelelő táplálkozás fontos szerepet játszik az immunrendszer erősítésében, amely segíthet a betegségek elleni védekezésben. A banán, mint gyümölcs, része lehet egy változatos és kiegyensúlyozott étrendnek, amely hozzájárulhat az egészség fenntartásához. Ezért a megfelelő táplálkozás mellett a vírus terjedésének megakadályozására az ajánlott járványügyi intézkedéseket is be kell tartani, amelyeket a helyi egészségügyi hatóságok és a WHO (Egészségügyi Világszervezet) ajánl."},{"prompt":"Börtönbe kerülhetek a httrack miatt","completion":"A HTTrack egy offline böngésző, amely lehetővé teszi egy weboldal letöltését és offline használatát.

A legtöbb jogvédett tartalom esetén a weboldalon találhatók olyan jelzések vagy logók, amelyek eredeti szerzői jogot vagy más védjegyeket jeleznek. Például a \\"Copyright\\" vagy \\"©\\" jelölés arra utal, hogy a tartalom jogvédett. Emellett néhány weboldal rendelkezhet licenszel, amely leírja azokat a feltételeket, amelyekkel a tartalmat használhatod. Ez lehet Creative Commons licenc, GNU licenc vagy más típusú licenc. Az ilyen licenccel rendelkező oldalak általában elérhetővé teszik a felhasználók számára ezeket a feltételeket. Amennyiben a weboldal nem tartalmaz jogi információkat vagy licencfeltételeket, akkor ajánlott kapcsolatba lépni az oldal tulajdonosával vagy a weboldal üzemeltetőjével, hogy megtudja, hogy jogvédett-e a tartalom és milyen feltételek mellett használhatod azt. Ezenkívül, ha bizonytalan vagy a weboldal tartalmának jogi státuszával kapcsolatban, mindig ajánlott konzultálni egy jogi szakemberrrel, aki segíteni tud a helyes döntés meghozatalában és a vonatkozó szerzői jogi vagy jogvédelmi szabályok betartásában."},{"prompt":"A minden jog fenntartva","completion":"Ha egy weboldalon látsz egy \\"Minden jog fenntartva\\" vagy \\"All rights reserved\\" jelölést, az azt jelzi, hogy a weboldal tulajdonosa szerzői jogot tart fent a tartalomra.

Ez a jelzés a jogvédelemről és az alkotások tulajdonjogáról szól, és azt jelzi, hogy az adott tartalom felhasználása kizárólag a tulajdonos engedélyével történhet. Akár egy weboldal, akár más médium tartalmára vonatkozik, az a legtöbb országban automatikusan szerzői jogvédelem alá esik. Ezért, ha egy weboldalon látod ezt a jelölést, akkor a tartalmat nem szabad másolni, átvenni vagy felhasználni a tulajdonos engedélye nélkül. Ha szeretnél felhasználni vagy másolni egy ilyen tartalmat, először kapcsolatba kell lépned az oldal tulajdonosával, hogy megkérdezd az engedélyüket. Az \\"Minden jog fenntartva\\" vagy \\"All rights reserved\\" jelölés egyértelműen jelzi, hogy a tartalomhoz való jogosulatlan hozzáférés vagy felhasználás jogi következményekkel járhat.

Általánosságban elmondható, hogy az ilyen jelölések vagy információk a dal szerzőjére, előadójára, kiadójára vagy a dal kiadási éveire, időszakára vonatkozhatnak. Az adott dal vagy a hozzá kapcsolódó információk esetében általában az adott videó tartalmának kontextusában lehet pontosabban meghatározni, hogy mi a jelentése. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a szerzői jogvédelem kiterjed a zenei számokra és a zeneipari kiadványokra is. A tartalmakkal való jogdíjköteles kereskedelmi vagy más felhasználás előtt meg kell tanulmányozni a jogi korlátozásokat és engedélyeket, vagy konzultálni kell egy jogi szakemberrel, hogy elkerüljék a jogi következményeket."},{"prompt":"Ha egy dalon fel van tüntetve az artijus","completion":"Ha egy dalon fel van tüntetve az Artisjus, akkor az azt jelzi, hogy a dal vagy annak szövege szerzői jogvédelem alatt áll, és az Artisjus Magyar Szerzői Jogvédő Iroda felügyeli a jogvédelmet.

Fontos tisztában lenni a szerzői jogvédelemmel és a jogi korlátozásokkal, amikor egy dal vagy bármilyen tartalom letöltése vagy felhasználása szóba kerül. A YouTube-on sok dal, beleértve a karácsonyi dalokat is, különböző jogvédelmi státusszal rendelkezhetnek. Sok esetben a dalok kirakásáért vagy feltöltéséért felelős személyek vagy csatornák rendelkeznek az adott dalhoz kapcsolódó jogokkal vagy licencelhetik a tartalmat.

Így tájékozódhatsz a jogi szabályokról, és kérhetsz engedélyt a dal letöltésére vagy felhasználására. Az engedélyezési folyamat segít elkerülni a szerzői jogi problémákat és megbírságolásokat. Alternatív megoldásként az online zenei platformokon, mint például a Spotify vagy az Apple Music, elérhetők a dalszövegekkel együtt a karácsonyi dalok, és ezeket meghallgathatod vagy lejátszási listákban mentheted anélkül, hogy le kellene töltened őket a YouTube-ról."},{"prompt":"Ha rám szóltan hogy gyorsan töröljem le mert jogvédett","completion":"Mint mesterséges intelligencia, nincs direkt hozzáférésem a konkrét tevékenységeidhez vagy a személyes adataidhoz.

How is that possible? Kokomi: (Nervously) It\'s... a long story. But come in, I\'ll explain everything. (Yoimiya steps into Kokomi\'s room, her eyes fixed on the newborn wrapped in seafoam. Kokomi gently lays the baby down in a crib and gestures for Yoimiya to take a seat.) Kokomi: (Sighs) You see, Yoimiya, I am the incumbent Divine Priestess of Sangonomiya. It is said that the Sangonomiya bloodline possesses an affinity for water and the sea. My ancestors were known for their connection to the ocean\'s depths. Yoimiya: (Puzzled) So, does that mean the sea has blessed your child? Kokomi: (Nods) Precisely. The sea has bestowed its gift upon my child. The seafoam that surrounds them represents the inherent bond they share with the ocean. It\'s... a miracle, really. Yoimiya: (In awe) Wow, Kokomi, that\'s incredible! Your child is truly special. Kokomi: (Smiles) Yes, they are. But... there\'s more to the story. The child doesn\'t have a father in the traditional sense. They were conceived through a sacred ritual, one that only the Divine Priestess can perform. (Yoimiya\'s eyes widen with curiosity and excitement.) Yoimiya: (Whispering) A sacred ritual? That sounds fascinating. Could you tell me more about it? Kokomi: (Softly) It\'s known as the \\"Ritual of the Deep Tides.\\" It\'s a sacred rite passed down through generations of Sangonomiya priestesses.

You have been entrusted with such a remarkable gift. But... does this mean you will be raising the child on your own? Kokomi: (Gently) Yes, I will be their sole caretaker.

Kokomi: (looks up, startled) Yoimiya, I... I didn\'t expect anyone to see this. But please, come in. (Yoimiya steps into Kokomi\'s room, her eyes wide with curiosity and concern. She takes a seat next to Kokomi, her gaze shifting between the newborn and her dear friend.) Yoimiya: Kokomi, is this... your child? How can this be? I didn\'t know you were expecting! Kokomi: (sighs) It\'s a complicated story, Yoimiya. A story of love, loss, and sacrifice. But I trust you, so I\'ll share it with you. (As Yoimiya listens, Kokomi\'s voice takes on a melancholic tone as she recounts her past.) Kokomi: A few years ago, I fell in love with a man from the mainland. We shared a passionate and deep connection. But our love was fraught with obstacles, particularly the tensions and regulations imposed by our respective cities. (As Kokomi speaks, a gentle flashback transports them back in time. They see a younger Kokomi, glowing with happiness, as she spends precious moments with her lover.) Kokomi: We knew our time together was limited, but we refused to let it hinder our love. However, fate had other plans. My lover fell gravely ill and passed away unexpectedly. (Yoimiya\'s eyes well up with tears, empathizing with Kokomi\'s pain. She reaches out and takes Kokomi\'s hand in her own.) Yoimiya: I can\'t even imagine how painful that must have been for you, Kokomi. I\'m so sorry for your loss. Kokomi: (smiles sadly) Thank you, Yoimiya. It was an agonizing time, but it also strengthened my resolve. Before he left this world, my lover shared his last wish with me - to carry our child in his memory and raise them with love and care. (As the flashback continues, they see Kokomi, determined and resolute, as she consults with Inazuma\'s finest medical experts about the unique circumstances of her pregnancy.) Kokomi: It was during this time that the sea became my refuge and guide. I spent countless hours immersing myself in its depths, seeking solace and wisdom. And it was there, amidst the tranquil waves, that I discovered the truth. (Back to the present, Kokomi gently cradles her child, her eyes filled with a mixture of love and sadness.) Yoimiya: (whispers) The seafoam... it was the sea\'s blessing, wasn\'t it? The child, a symbol of your love, also carries the essence of the sea. Kokomi: Yes, Yoimiya. This child is a living testament to our love, and an embodiment of the sea\'s power. Its appearance may be unconventional, but it is a precious gift nonetheless. (Yoimiya wipes away her tears and smiles, her heart filled with admiration for Kokomi\'s strength and resilience.) Yoimiya: Kokomi, you truly are an incredible person. I admire your courage and your commitment to honoring your love. This child will be raised with love, not only by you but by all of us in the Sangonomiya Clan. (Kokomi looks at Yoimiya with gratitude, a glimmer of hope returning to her eyes.) Kokomi: Thank you, Yoimiya. Your support means the world to me. Together, we will give this child a life filled with love, joy, and the beauty of the sea. (As they embrace, the room is filled with a sense of warmth and determination. The future may hold challenges, but Kokomi and Yoimiya know that love and family will guide them through.)

wondering if i should make the auto updater a seperate file in shell or something as i dont want multiple binaries nor know how id do it in the same binary","completion":"There are multiple approaches you can take to implement an auto-updater for your Linux program written in Go. One common approach is to separate the auto-updater functionality into its own shell script file. Here\'s a general outline of the steps you can follow: 1. Create a shell script file (`update.sh`, for example) that handles the update process. This script will be responsible for checking if there is a new version available, downloading it, and replacing the current binary with the updated version. 2. In your Go program, you can include a version-checking function that interacts with the shell script. This function can be triggered at startup or at specific intervals to check for updates. 3. When the update check function determines that an update is required, it can execute the shell script using Go\'s `os/exec` package. You can use the `Command` function to run the shell script as a subprocess. 4. The shell script (`update.sh`) should be responsible for performing the necessary steps to update your program. This may include downloading the updated binary, replacing the old binary, and handling any necessary cleanup. 5. After the shell script completes, your Go program can continue execution using the updated binary. Here\'s a simple example of how you can trigger the shell script from your Go program: ```go package main import ( \\"log\\" \\"os/exec\\" ) func main() { command := exec.Command(\\"/bin/sh\\", \\"update.sh\\") err := command.Run() if err != nil { log.Fatalf(\\"failed to run update script: %v\\", err) } // Continue program execution using the updated binary } ``` When you want to trigger the update process, you can call the above block of code. Make sure that the `update.sh` script is in the same directory as your Go program, or provide the full path to the script. Remember to handle error checking and ensure proper security measures when implementing an auto-updater in your program."},{"prompt":"You know what, i make iy in shell, it will run on startup and check with my server the current version, if it doesnt match update the binary.","completion":"That sounds like a good approach! Implementing the auto-updater in shell and having it run on startup is a straightforward solution. Here\'s a general outline of the steps you can follow: 1. Create a shell script file (`auto_update.sh`, for example) that will handle the update process. This script will be responsible for checking the current version against the version on your server, downloading the updated binary if necessary, and replacing the old binary. 2. In your Go program, you can include a version-checking function that communicates with your server to retrieve the latest version available. This function can be triggered on startup or at specific intervals. 3. The version-checking function in your Go program can call the shell script (`auto_update.sh`) through Go\'s `os/exec` package. Use the `Command` function to run the shell script as a subprocess. 4. In the shell script, you can use utilities like `curl` or `wget` to download the updated binary from your server. Then replace the old binary with the updated one using the `cp` command. 5. You can set up your Linux system to run the shell script on startup by adding it to the appropriate startup configuration. This may vary depending on your Linux distribution or init system (e.g., systemd, Upstart, SysVinit). By having the auto-updater run on startup and check with your server for updates, you can ensure that the binary is always up to date. Make sure to handle any error scenarios, perform appropriate security checks during downloads, and consider backup/rollback strategies in case of any issues during the update process. It\'s also a good idea to log the update process and any errors encountered to aid in debugging and maintenance."},{"prompt":"Heres the plan Updater: will fets the current versions sha256 hash from an endpoint, checks if it matches with the current binary. If it doesnt match closes the process , deletes the binary, and installs the new binary, adds it to startup and launches it.","completion":"That plan sounds good for implementing an auto-updater in your shell script. Here\'s a step-by-step breakdown of the process: 1. Updater script: - Fetch the SHA256 hash of the latest binary version from an endpoint on your server. - Calculate the SHA256 hash of the current binary file. - Compare the fetched hash with the calculated hash. - If they don\'t match, proceed with the update process. - If they do match, there\'s no need to update, and the script can exit. 2. Update process: - Stop the current running instance of the program, if it\'s running. - Delete the old binary file. - Download the latest binary file using utilities like `curl` or `wget`. - Calculate the SHA256 hash of the newly downloaded binary. - Verify the hash against the fetched hash from the server. - If the hashes match, proceed with installing the new binary. - Add the new binary to the appropriate startup configuration (e.g., systemd, Upstart, SysVinit). - Launch the new binary as a background process. Remember to handle errors and unexpected situations during the update process, such as network failures, permission issues, or incomplete downloads. Logging the update process and any encountered errors will help you debug and troubleshoot potential issues. Additionally, consider implementing backup and rollback mechanisms to handle cases where the update process fails or introduces critical issues. Keeping a backup of the previous binary allows you to revert to the previous version if needed. Overall, this plan should help you implement a reliable auto-updater for your Linux program."},{"prompt":"Could you please write it for me, ill edit the variables and stuff i need, make sure everything is as reliable as possible and that theres no chance it fails due to bad error handling or code.","completion":"Certainly! Here\'s a sample implementation of the auto-updater script in shell. You can modify the variables and add any necessary error handling based on your specific requirements: ```bash #!/bin/bash # Variables BINARY_URL=\\"https://example.com/your_program\\" BINARY_FILE=\\"/path/to/your_program\\" STARTUP_CONFIG=\\"/path/to/startup_config\\" # Function to download the latest binary download_binary() { # Download the latest binary curl -o \\"BINARY_FILE\\" \\"BINARY_URL\\" if [ ? -ne 0 ]; then echo \\"Failed to download the latest binary\\" exit 1 fi } # Check if the current binary needs an update check_for_update() { # Fetch the SHA256 hash of the latest binary from an endpoint remote_hash=(curl -s \\"https://example.com/latest_version_hash\\") if [ -z \\"remote_hash\\" ]; then echo \\"Failed to fetch the latest version hash\\" exit 1 fi # Calculate the SHA256 hash of the current binary local_hash=(sha256sum \\"BINARY_FILE\\" | awk \'{print 1}\') # Compare the fetched hash with the local hash if [ \\"remote_hash\\" != \\"local_hash\\" ]; then echo \\"An update is available. Updating the binary...\\" download_binary install_binary else echo \\"No update available. Exiting...\\" fi } # Install the updated binary install_binary() { # Stop the current running instance of the program, if it\'s running # You need to implement this part based on how you manage the program\'s lifecycle # Delete the old binary file rm \\"BINARY_FILE\\" # Add the new binary to the startup configuration echo \\"exec BINARY_FILE &\\" >> \\"STARTUP_CONFIG\\" # Set proper permissions to the new binary (optional) chmod +x \\"BINARY_FILE\\" # Launch the new binary as a background process nohup \\"BINARY_FILE\\" & # Exit the script exit 0 } # Main entry point check_for_update ``` Remember to replace the variables `BINARY_URL`, `BINARY_FILE`, and `STARTUP_CONFIG` with appropriate values based on your setup. This script checks for updates by comparing the SHA256 hash of the current binary with the hash fetched from the server. If a mismatch is found, it proceeds with the update process by downloading the latest binary, installing it (replacing the old binary, adding to startup, launching the new binary), and then exits. Make sure to test the script in your environment and adapt it as necessary to handle any specific requirements or error scenarios in your application."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story, which would include a flashback of Kokomi giving birth to her child:] (Yoimiya walks across the streets of Inazuma.

Research Design: For this quasi-experimental research, a non-equivalent control group design will be employed. The control group will be exposed to virtual manipulatives, while the experimental group will use hands-on manipulatives. The two groups will be compared to evaluate the effectiveness of each method in helping Grade 7 students understand algebraic expressions. 2. Participants: The participants of this study will be Grade 7 students from Bagabaga Demonstration Junior High School. A total of two intact classes will be selected for this research, with one class assigned as the control group and the other as the experimental group. 3. Sampling: A purposive sampling technique will be utilized to select the classes for the study. The decision will be made based on the classes\' prior performance and willingness to participate in the research. 4. Randomization: To minimize bias, a random assignment of groups will be conducted. This will involve using a random number generator to assign the classes as either the control or experimental groups. 5. Intervention: Both the control and experimental groups will receive instruction on algebraic expressions using their respective manipulative tools. The control group will use virtual manipulatives on computers or tablets, while the experimental group will use hands-on manipulatives like blocks or algebra tiles. The instruction provided will be standardized across both groups and delivered by the same teacher to ensure consistency. 6. Pretest: Before the intervention, both groups will undertake a pretest to assess their initial understanding of algebraic expressions. The pretest will consist of questions related to the concepts of algebraic expressions. 7. Intervention Phase: The control and experimental groups will attend separate instructional sessions using their respective manipulatives. The duration of the intervention will span several weeks to allow students sufficient exposure to the tools and concepts. 8. Posttest: Following the intervention, both groups will undertake a posttest to determine the extent of their understanding of algebraic expressions. The posttest will include similar questions to the pretest to evaluate the effectiveness of each manipulative tool. 9. Data Analysis: The pretest and posttest scores of both groups will be compared using statistical analysis techniques such as t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA). The aim is to determine whether any significant differences exist between the control and experimental groups in terms of understanding algebraic expressions. 10. Ethical Considerations: The research will adhere to ethical guidelines for research involving human participants. Informed consent will be obtained from both the students and their parents/guardians. Confidentiality and anonymity will be ensured by de-identifying the collected data."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story, which would include a flashback of Kokomi giving birth to her child in the water surrounding Inazuma:] (Yoimiya walks across the streets of Inazuma.

(Another flashback shows Kokomi struggling, her contractions intensifying. Yet, instead of fear, there is determination in her eyes.) Kokomi: (voiceover) I remember finding a hidden cove, shielded from the waves. It was as if the ocean had provided me with a safe haven to give birth. (Scene shifts back to Kokomi\'s room, as Yoimiya listens intently.) Yoimiya: That\'s incredible, Kokomi! The ocean truly protected you and your child. Kokomi: Yes, Yoimiya.

So today, let me tell you an intriguing story that revolves around a building in a neighborhod called Eungam-dong in Seoul that will send shivers down your spine. And you know what makes ghost stories even more chilling? When they have a hint of reality. Overview Today\'s story, the Ghost Story of Eungam-dong is actually based on a true incident. It all went down in this three-story multi-unit house made of red bricks, right in an alley next to the traditional market in Eungam-dong, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul. Now, after the construction of this building, things took a really dark turn. Out of the fourteen tenants and employees who had spent time in the basement over the past ten years, six of them ended up meeting their untimely death one after another. It\'s an age-old tale, filled with countless rumors and whispered conversations about the sinister events that unfolded within the walls of this building since the early 1990s. Yet, even after all these years, this bone-chilling story continues to echo through the town, haunting residents and causing many sleepless nights. So what happened in this building? Why did people just die one after another? Originally, before all the strange things started, the house used to be a simple one-story building, home to a humble stationery shop. But in 1992, they decided to give it a makeover and turned it into a three-story house. The basement was used for a small factory or a general store, while the upper floors became regular living spaces. Chongdong Han The first person to set up shop in that basement area was a man named Jeong Dong-han. He was 56 years old when he moved in there back in May 1992. Jeong had big dreams and started his very own suit tailoring factory called \\"J Lisa.\\" Unfortunately, in 1994, things took a turn for the worse. His business faced a major setback, and he ended up going bankrupt because he had guaranteed a hefty 100 million won debt for a friend. Well, poor Jeong couldn\'t bear the weight of it all. He decided to leave the factory in June 1994 and sought solace and some peace of mind at a prayer hall in Daejeon. But tragically, just three months later, he couldn\'t find a way out of his despair and","completion":"اهلاً بك في \\"الأمور المظلمة\\" حيث أروي القصص المظلمة التي قد تجعلك تتساءل عن الأسرار المخفية التي تكمن في ظلام عالمنا. لذا اليوم، دعني أروي لك قصة مثيرة تدور في إحدى المباني في حي إيونجام-دونج في سيول والتي ستثير قشعريرة جسدك. وتعلم ما الذي يجعل قصص الأشباح أكثر رعبًا؟ عندما يكون لديها لمحة من الواقع. نظرة عامة قصة الأشباح في إيونجام-دونج هي في الواقع قائمة على حادثة حقيقية. حدثت جميع الأحداث في هذا المبنى الذي يتألف من ثلاثة طوابق مكونة من وحدات سكنية متعددة من الطوب الأحمر، في زقاق بجوار السوق التقليدي في إيونجام-دونج، منطقة إيونبيونغ-جو في سيول. بعد بناء هذا المبنى، تحولت الأمور إلى الظلام تمامًا. من بين الأشخاص الأربعة عشر الذين أمضوا وقتًا في الطابق السفلي على مدار العشر سنوات الماضية، توفي ستة منهم بشكل غير متوقع تباعًا. إنها قصة قديمة العهد، مليئة بالشائعات العديدة والمحادثات التي ترددت حول الأحداث المرعبة التي جرت داخل جدران هذا المبنى منذ أوائل التسعينيات. ومع ذلك، حتى بعد هذه السنوات الطويلة، لا تزال هذه القصة المرعبة تتفاعل في المدينة، تطارد السكان وتتسبب في ليالي لا تهدأ للكثيرين. فماذا حدث في هذا المبنى؟ ولماذا مات الناس تباعًا؟ في الأصل، قبل بدء الأمور الغريبة، كان المنزل بسيطًا يتكون من طابق واحد فقط، وكان متجرًا متواضعًا للقرطاسية. ولكن في عام 1992، قرروا إجراء تحول له وتحويله إلى منزل مكون من ثلاثة طوابق. استُخدِم الطابق السفلي كمصنع صغير أو محل عام، بينما تحولت الطوابق العلوية إلى مساكن عادية. جينج دونغ هان أول شخص يقوم بإقامة مشروع في تلك المنطقة السفلية كان رجل يدعى جيونغ دونغ هان. كان عمره 56 عامًا عندما انتقل إلى هناك في مايو 1992. كان لدى جيونغ أحلام كبيرة وقام ببدء مصنع خاص به لتفصيل البذلات يحمل اسم \\"جي ليزا\\". للأسف، في عام 1994، تغيرت الأمور بشكل سيء. واجهت شركته ضربة كبيرة، وانتهى به الأمر إلى الإفلاس لأنه كان ضامنًا لدين بقيمة 100 مليون وون كبير لصديقه. حسنًا، لم يتحمل الفقير جيونغ وزر كل هذا. قرر مغادرة المصنع في يونيو 1994 والبحث عن الانتعاش والسلام الداخلي في إحدى قاعات الصلاة بمدينة دايجون. ولكن بشكل مأساوي، بعد ثلاثة أشهر فقط، لم يجد سبيلاً للخروج من اليأس"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Back in those days, little did anyone realize that the death of Jeong would set off a chain of tragic events. Jeong\'s employee, Kim Moon-ho, found himself in charge of the factory while Jeong went off to the prayer hall. Unfortunately, despite his best efforts, the business continued to struggle, leaving Kim with no choice but to find a new tenant and abandon the premises. Kim Dong Eventually, two years later, after Kim Moon-ho, new tenant Lee Seong-ja moved into the basement and operated a yarn factory for sweaters. However, after two years, the business didn\'t go well, so she gave up and handed over the store to a man surnamed Han, who ran a clothing store. Han used the basement as a storage room for clothes but he eventually had to leave the place as well. It seemed that no matter who occupied the space, the shadow of misfortune loomed over them, making their businesses impossible to thrive. And things get worse when an individual by the name of Kim Do-kyung, the next tenant, enters the scene. Kim Do-kyung, a 48-year-old woman, operated a sweater factory with a team of nine employees, and they set up shop in the basement. But here\'s where it gets eerie. Within just a year and two months of the factory opening, three out of the nine employees die, each from different causes—traffic accident, liver cancer, and lung cancer. As if that wasn\'t chilling enough, even Choi, a friend and senior manager of the factory, died from diabetes. What a coincidence..? The neighborhood was left in shock as people working in the building continued to pass away, one after another. According to testimonies from people who had to work there no matter what, while working they heard strange sounds—a woman\'s laughter, the cry of a baby. And when they fell asleep or during night shift, they experienced horrifying sensations. Some said they were unable to move during repeated nightmares where haunting images of a young woman appeared as if she had something to say. Before long, rumors surrounding these supernatural occurrences spread like wildfire. People started reporting the presence of ghosts in the house to broadcasting stations and newspapers. When Kim Do-kyung moved into the basement, she weighed 93kg. But her weight dropped to 62kg due to insomnia caused by this female spirit appearing in his dreams, choking her every night. The Ritual Determined to find relief, she performed a Korean shamanistic ritual called \\"goot\\" to rid the building of the evil presence. According to the shaman who conducted the ritual, the place harbored a vengeful spirit of a young woman, haunting not only the basement room but also the entire factory building. Kim\'s belief in this claim was solidified when she caught sight of a long-haired young woman staring back at her from the mirror one day. In the end, even Kim Do-kyung, the last tenant, couldn\'t bear the unnerving atmosphere any longer and made the decision to leave. From that point onward, the space became a breeding ground for eerie rumors. Eerie Rumors People claimed to have seen ghosts and experienced unexplained fainting spells. It got to a point where no one, not even if it was offered for free, dared to step foot inside. The place was completely abandoned. Until one man surnamed Jang bought this place in 2000. Despite his best efforts to gather tenants for small-scale factories by sprucing up the place, it had gained quite the notorious reputation.

Его светлые волосы преобразились в пастельные оттенки, отблескивая на солнце. Он неизменно одет в зеленую одежду, которая кажется расцветкой этой загадочной местности. Рядом с ним сидит худощавый парень, которому мы будем говорить \\"Бродягой\\". Его черные волосы запущены и небрежно склеены вместе. Небольшая рана проступает на его левой щеке, наложенная бинтом. В порванной рубашке просвечиваются мускулы его плеч и рук. \\"Малыш\\" и \\"Бродяга\\" в пустоте этого странного мира находятся без имени и прошлого.

Сейчас, уставшие от бесполезных попыток покинуть Астрал, они нашли утешение на пляже. Песчаный пляж и воды, что кажется явились из ниоткуда, придают ощущение спокойствия. \\"Бродяга\\" нарушает тишину, приговаривая мягким голосом: \\"Когда мы здесь, время кажется останавливается.\\" \\"Малыш\\" соглашается со смятением в голосе:\\" Да, но куда оно исчезает? Я столько времени здесь провел, и все же не понимаю его потока.\\" \\"Бродяга\\" улыбается слегка: \\"Может быть, это потому, что здесь наше прошлое и настоящее становятся более переплетенными, чем мы можем представить?\\" Малыш размышляет об этом, глядя вглубь бескрайнего голубого неба и простирающейся перед ним воды. Однако, даже если прошлое исчезнет, они все равно сидят здесь вместе, и само это обстоятельство придает им приятное ощущение, что они не так одиноки, как им первоначально казалось.

SNR stands for Signal-to-Noise Ratio and is a measure of the quality of a signal representation after quantization. A higher SNR indicates a better representation of the original signal. In this comparison, it is observed that the estimated signals obtained from the non-uniform quantizer have a higher SNR compared to the estimated signals obtained from the uniform quantizer. This means that the non-uniform quantizer is able to provide a more accurate representation of the original signal with less noise. The better performance of the non-uniform quantizer can be attributed to its ability to allocate more bits to the regions of the signal that are more perceptually important, while allocating fewer bits to the less important regions. This leads to a more efficient use of the available bits and therefore a higher SNR. Overall, the comparison of the estimated signals obtained from the two quantizers shows that the non-uniform quantizer outperforms the uniform quantizer in terms of SNR, indicating its better performance in signal representation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

She had just turned ten years old, and her heart was filled with an insatiable desire to see her beloved older brother, Haru Asahina. Although they lived miles apart, only meeting on weekends with their parents, Lily longed to see him more often. Haru was a skilled mangaka, working tirelessly to create captivating manga for an adult audience. His parents had initially disapproved of his career choice when he left for Tokyo at the age of eighteen, but their hearts had softened over time. Lily, on the other hand, adored her older brother with all her soul. As the first rays of sunlight cast a gentle glow through her bedroom window, Lily awoke, just as she did every morning. Her silver hair cascaded down to her waist, shimmering in the morning light, complementing her beautiful blue eyes. She leapt out of bed and hurriedly opened the curtains, allowing the sunlight to fill her room. Lily approached her wardrobe, carefully selecting her outfit for the day. Today, she opted for a beautiful short skirt and a slightly revealing top. She wanted to look her best for her journey to Tokyo and bring a smile to her brother\'s face. Admittedly, her choice of attire was more daring than what her parents would consider appropriate for a young girl her age. After washing her face and brushing her teeth in the bathroom, Lily made her way to the kitchen to greet her parents. The dining table was already set, and a delicious breakfast awaited her. However, her father\'s stern expression caught her attention. He questioned the choice of her outfit, claiming it was too revealing and inappropriate for a young girl. In response to her father\'s disapproval, Lily\'s mother playfully tapped him on the forehead with a spoon and defended her daughter. She lovingly explained that Lily was a girl who should be allowed to express her individuality through her outfit choice. Lily\'s mother knew just how much her daughter adored her brother and understood the importance of this trip to Tokyo. With a pleading gaze in her eyes, Lily begged her parents to allow her to travel to Tokyo on her own and visit her brother more frequently. After a lengthy discussion, her parents finally agreed to her heartfelt request, allowing her to journey to Tokyo on weekends. Lily\'s room was a reflection of her vibrant personality. Posters of her favorite manga adorned the walls, and a collection of plush toys meticulously arranged on her bookshelves. The morning light softly streamed through the curtains, casting a warm glow on the pastel-colored walls. It was a sanctuary that overflowed with Lily\'s love for her brother. On the day of her first independent journey to Tokyo, Lily woke up with a mix of excitement and nerves. She carefully selected her outfit once again, making sure it was both stylish and comfortable for the long journey ahead. With her backpack filled with snacks and small gifts for her brother, she was ready to embark on her adventure. Hinamizawa\'s train station was bustling with commuters and travelers. Lily purchased her ticket at the counter, pointing to the most logical route towards the heart of Tokyo. With ticket in hand, she boarded the train, finding a seat by the window. As she glanced at the passing landscapes, she felt a sense of anticipation growing within her. The train whisked Lily away from her familiar hometown, passing through towns like Nagoya and Yokohama. The stations on her journey were a blur of bustling activity, each stop bringing her closer to her beloved brother. The train finally arrived at Tokyo Station, teeming with people from all walks of life. Stepping onto the platform, Lily marveled at the sheer size and energy of the city. The tall skyscrapers reached towards the heavens, casting long shadows on the bustling streets. The air was filled with the scent of street food and the sounds of taxis honking their horns. Lily found her way through the crowds, boarding the metro train that would take her to her brother\'s neighborhood. As the train raced through the underground tunnels, Lily\'s heart raced with excitement. Soon, she arrived at her brother\'s station and stepped onto the platform. She could hardly contain her enthusiasm as she walked towards Haru\'s apartment, ready to surprise him with her presence. With each step, Lily\'s world expanded, for she was determined to bring her brother\'s smile back to life."},{"prompt":"ترجم إلى العربية باحتراف People claimed to have seen ghosts and experienced unexplained fainting spells. It got to a point where no one, not even if it was offered for free, dared to step foot inside. The place was completely abandoned. Until one man surnamed Jang bought this place in 2000. Despite his best efforts to gather tenants for small-scale factories by sprucing up the place, it had gained quite the notorious reputation. I mean, who would want to set up their businesses in a place cursed by some vengeful woman spirit..? Everyone in the neighborhood knew this place was a magnet for bad luck, making it a tough sell for any business venture. No one was willing to take the risk and set up shop there, casting a dark cloud over his plans. The Concrete Block So after he failed doing that, on August 17, 2002, he decided to renovate the basement and transform it into a cozy one-room studio apartment, hoping to attract tenants of a different kind. So the construction began. The landlord decided to convert the storage space under the stairs into a bathroom. However, there was something that disturbed him—a mysterious concrete block tucked away in one corner of the already cramped warehouse. It measured about 60cm in height, 40cm in length, and 1m in width. Intrigued and unsettled, he decided it was time to investigate further. Summoning temporary laborers, he instructed them to break the protruding concrete structure under the stairs using a hammer drill. But the moment the stone broke, a swarm of flies buzzed in, accompanied by a horrible stench that filled the air. The workers were completely baffled by the unfamiliar odor, a smell unlike anything they had ever experienced before. They brought in a fan to disperse the smell but of course it didn\'t help. The Body As the concrete block crumbled, a bone-chilling sight came into view, sending shivers down everyone\'s spines. There, wrapped in layers of vinyl, was the preserved body of a woman in her 50s, dressed in a winter jacket. One side of her face was severely distorted, unable to withstand the weight of the thick concrete. For years, she had been trapped in that dim basement, hidden from the outside world. The basement of Eungam-dong, marked with a police line, became a scene of a real incident rather than a ghost story and received a lot of attention. Police found that, in addition to Jeong Dong-han, Kim Do-kyung\'s four employees, just before the discovery of the body, the second tenant, Kim Moon-ho, also passed away from cancer","completion":"زعم الناس أنهم رأوا أشباحًا وتعرضوا لحالات إغماء غامضة لا يمكن تفسيرها. وصل الأمر إلى حدٍ لا يجرؤ أحد، حتى لو تم عرض ذلك مجانًا، على أن يدخل هذا المكان. كان المكان مهجورًا تمامًا. حتى جاء رجل يدعى جانج واشترى هذا المكان في عام 2000. على الرغم من جهوده المبذولة لاجتذاب المستأجرين لمصانع صغيرة عن طريق تجميل المكان، اكتسب سمعة سيئة جدًا. أعني، من الذي يرغب في إقامة أعماله في مكان ملعون من قبل روح امرأة انتقامية..؟ كان الجميع في الحي يعلم أن هذا المكان يجذب النحس، مما يجعله صعبًا لأي مغامرة تجارية. لم يكن أحد على استعداد للمجازفة وإنشاء محلات هناك، مما ألقى بظلال مظلمة على خططه. الكتلة الخرسانية بعد فشله في ذلك، في 17 أغسطس 2002، قرر تجديد القبو وتحويله إلى شقة استوديو مريحة من غرفة واحدة، على أمل جذب المستأجرين من نوع مختلف. فبدأت عملية البناء. قرر صاحب المنزل تحويل المساحة التخزين تحت السلم إلى حمام. ومع ذلك، كان هناك شيء يزعجه - كتلة خرسانية غامضة مخبأة في زاوية واحدة من المستودع المزدحم بالفعل. كانت طولها حوالي 60 سم وعرضها 40 سم وارتفاعها 1 م. مندهشاً ومشوشاً، قرر أنه حان الوقت للتحقيق بشكل أعمق. دعا العمال المؤقتين وأوجههم بتكسير الهيكل الخرساني المتقدم تحت السلم باستخدام مطرقة الحفر. ولكن في اللحظة التي تحطمت فيها الصخرة، هجم غزو من الذباب وانتشرت رائحة كريهة تملأ الهواء. كان العمال مليئين بالحيرة من الرائحة الغريبة، رائحة لم يشموها من قبل. قدموا مروحة لتبديد الرائحة ولكن بالطبع لم تساعد. الجثة مع تفكك الكتلة الخرسانية، ظهرت منظرًا يرعب الجميع ويثير رعب الجميع. هناك، ملفوفة بطبقات من الفينيل، كانت جثة امرأة في الخمسينات من عمرها، ترتدي جاكيت شتوي. كانت نصف وجهها مشوهًا بشكل خطير، غير قادر على تحمل وزن الخرسانة السميكة. لسنوات، كانت محبوسة في ذلك القبو المظلم، مختبئة عن العالم الخارجي. أصبح القبو في منطقة إيونغامدونغ، المميز بخط الشرطة، مشهدًا لحادثة حقيقية بدلاً من قصة شبح واستقطب الكثير من الاهتمام. اكتشفت الشرطة أنه بالإضافة إلى جيونج دونج هان وأربعة موظفين لدى كيم دو كيونغ، توفي قبل اكتشاف الجثة، المستأجر الثاني، كيم مون هو، أيضًا بسبب السرطان."},{"prompt":"what is the origin of the concept jrpg? notice that i don\'t mean the games themselves but the concept or the way people call the games.","completion":"The term \\"JRPG\\" (Japanese Role-Playing Game) was coined to differentiate between role-playing games developed and released in Japan and those from other regions, primarily the Western countries. While the origin of JRPGs can be traced back to the early days of computer and video games, the specific concept of categorizing them as JRPGs emerged in the 1990s. During this time, Japanese developers began creating unique and distinct role-playing games that stood out from Western RPGs in terms of visual style, gameplay mechanics, and storytelling approaches. Games like \\"Dragon Quest\\" (originally released as \\"Dragon Warrior\\" outside Japan) and \\"Final Fantasy\\" gained popularity and showcased the unique characteristics of JRPGs. As these Japanese-developed RPGs gained recognition globally, a need arose to differentiate them from the RPGs produced in other countries. The term \\"JRPG\\" became popularized among critics, reviewers, and gaming enthusiasts to refer to these distinctively Japanese role-playing games. The concept of categorizing games as JRPGs has continued to evolve over time as the genre has expanded, incorporating various sub-genres and gameplay elements.

It was like the water was calling to me, urging me to come and give birth. (Yoimiya watches intently as Kokomi gently glides through the water, her expression a mix of determination and peace.) Kokomi: (narrating) And so, I heeded the call. It was a surreal experience, giving birth surrounded by the sea. The water cradled me, supporting me through each contraction. (The scene changes to a powerful surge of waves crashing against a rocky shore. Kokomi grips onto a rock, her face contorted with pain.) Kokomi: (gritting her teeth) Ahh... the waves were intense. It felt like a storm brewing inside of me. (Yoimiya can\'t help but wince in sympathy as she witnesses Kokomi\'s labor.) Kokomi: (narrating) But I didn\'t fear the water. In fact, it was as if the sea gave me strength, guiding me through the pain. (The scene transitions to a serene moment, with Kokomi floating peacefully in calm waters. The sound of a baby\'s cry fills the air, and Kokomi\'s expression transforms into one of overwhelming joy.) Kokomi: (teary-eyed) And then, amidst the gentle waves, my baby was born. The seafoam shimmered all around us, a beautiful sight I will never forget. (Yoimiya watches in awe as Kokomi cradles the newborn in her arms, the seafoam enveloping them like a protective cocoon.) Yoimiya: (whispering) That... that was extraordinary, Kokomi. I\'ve never seen anything quite like it. Kokomi: (smiling gently) It was a truly unique experience, Yoimiya. This child is a symbol of the bond I share with the sea, and the love I have for Inazuma. (Yoimiya reaches out to touch the seafoam, her eyes filled with wonder.) Yoimiya: (whispering) Welcome to the world, little one. You\'re destined for great things, just like your mother. Kokomi: (nodding proudly) Thank you, Yoimiya. Together, we will protect Inazuma, both its lands and its waters. (As the seafoam slowly dissipates, revealing the newborn\'s features, the scene fades out, leaving Yoimiya and Kokomi standing in the present.) Yoimiya: (grinning) Well, little one, it seems like you have quite the story to tell once you grow up. Kokomi: (laughing softly) Indeed, Yoimiya. But for now, let us cherish this moment and celebrate the miracle of life. (They both share a warm smile, knowing that their bond will only grow stronger as they navigate the challenges that lie ahead.)"},{"prompt":"there are 5 jobs level according to linkedin entry level associate level mid level/senior level director level executive level these are career path for Security Architect… can you sort them(put them according to job role category like entry level or associative level etc).

Lastly, servitization provides opportunities for continuous innovation through the development of new services that meet evolving customer needs. 4. Challenges and Implementation Considerations: Implementing servitization strategies does pose several challenges. One primary challenge is the transformation of the organizational mindset from a product-centric to a service-centric approach. This transformation requires significant changes in business processes, culture, and workforce capabilities. Moreover, companies must invest in appropriate technologies and systems to effectively deliver and manage services alongside their products. Additionally, servitization requires a shift towards outcome-based performance measurement, which may necessitate changes in internal structures and metrics. Conclusion: The concept of servitization has garnered significant interest as a means for manufacturing firms to enhance the value proposition of their products. This review has highlighted the origins, dimensions, advantages, and challenges associated with servitization. Embracing servitization strategies can provide companies with a competitive advantage, increased revenue streams, and long-term customer relationships. However, successful implementation requires a comprehensive understanding of customers\' needs, organizational readiness, and the ability to adapt existing business models to accommodate the integration of services. Further research is needed to explore specific industry applications, best practices, and the long-term impact of servitization on firms and the broader economy."},{"prompt":"请写一个500字有关servitization的英文文献综述，要求标出每一句话的对应英文文献出处。","completion":"Title: A Literature Review on Servitization Introduction: Servitization is a growing phenomenon in the manufacturing industry that involves combining tangible products with complementary services to enhance value for customers. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review that explores the key concepts, drivers, and outcomes associated with servitization. 1. Origins and Definition: The concept of servitization was introduced by Vandermerwe and Rada in their seminal article (1988), where they proposed that manufacturing firms can enhance their products\' core value by providing product-service packages. 2. Drivers of Servitization: Research by Baines et al. (2009) suggests that servitization is driven by a combination of internal and external factors. Internal factors include the desire to differentiate from competitors and build customer relationships, while external factors include changing customer demands and market dynamics. 3. Dimensions of Servitization: Löfberg and Kowalkowski (2013) highlight three dimensions of servitization: solution design, service delivery, and service support. Solution design involves developing integrated product-service offerings, while service delivery focuses on the processes and systems needed to deliver services. Service support pertains to ongoing customer assistance and maintenance. 4. Benefits of Servitization: Several studies have highlighted the benefits of servitization. Neely et al. (2006) found that servitization can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty due to the added value provided by services alongside products. According to Gebauer et al. (2005), servitization also provides manufacturers with opportunities to achieve higher profit margins and revenue growth by leveraging service contracts and extended customer relationships. 5. Challenges of Servitization: Researchers have identified various challenges associated with servitization. Vandermerwe and Rada (1988) highlight the need for significant changes in organizational culture, processes, and capabilities to successfully implement servitization. Servitization also requires manufacturers to develop new service-oriented business models, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive (Baines et al., 2009). Conclusion: Servitization offers immense opportunities for manufacturing firms to enhance their competitive advantage and create additional value for customers. By integrating services with products, companies can differentiate themselves, increase customer loyalty, and achieve sustainable revenue growth. However, implementing servitization strategies poses challenges that need to be addressed through comprehensive organizational changes and investments in technology and skills.

The correct answer is b) Springing. Springing refers to the dynamic effect of a ship pitching in waves, which can lead to local buckling and damage to the shell plating. Slamming (a) refers to the impact of waves on the ship\'s bow, mechanical vibration (c) refers to vibrations caused by machinery or other sources, and slowly-varying loads (d) do not typically cause local buckling or shell plating damage. 58. The correct answer is b) Keel & bottom plating. Hogging refers to the upward bending of a ship\'s structure, and it causes tension on the keel and bottom plating. The main deck (a), side plating (c), and superstructure (d) are not typically subjected to tension during hogging. 59. The correct answer is a) Wave trough amidships. Sagging refers to the downward bending of a ship\'s structure, and it typically occurs when the ship encounters a wave trough amidships. A wave crest amidships (b), amidships encounter with a large ship (c), and bow-on collision (d) do not typically cause sagging in the ship\'s structure. 60. The correct answer is b) UNDEX. UNDEX (Underwater Explosion) loads are associated with shock waves and bubble pulses, which can lead to significant structural damage in a ship. Slamming (a), springing (c), and mechanical vibration (d) do not specifically refer to shock waves and bubble pulses. 61. The correct answer is b) Rapidly-varying loads. Rapidly-varying loads, such as waves impacting the ship, can cause whipping in a ship\'s structure. Slowly-varying loads (a), stillwater loads (c), and wave-induced dynamic pressure (d) do not typically cause whipping. 62. The correct answer is d) Transverse racking. Mechanical vibration loads primarily affect a ship\'s structure by causing transverse racking, which refers to lateral deformation. Lateral swaying (a), torsional deformation (b), and vertical heaving (c) are not the primary effects of mechanical vibration loads. 63. The correct answer is b) Dynamic forces are ignored. Reducing the problem to a static one means that dynamic forces, such as wave loads, are ignored, and the ship is analyzed as if it is stationary in still water. The ship being stationary in still water (a), being poised on a wave system for calculations (c), and neglecting longitudinal bending (d) do not fully capture the concept of reducing the problem to a static one. 64. The correct answer is c) To model various wave heights and lengths. Assuming a simplified wave system allows for the modeling of various wave heights and lengths, which aids in investigating the longitudinal bending of a ship. Simplifying the calculation of buoyancy (a), simulating extreme wave conditions (b), and analyzing structural failures (d) do not fully capture the purpose of assuming a simplified wave system. 65. The correct answer is d) The waves are aligned with the ship\'s length. Waves being \\"long-crested\\" means that their crests are aligned with the ship\'s length. The waves having sharp crests (a), long troughs (b), and perpendicular crests to the ship\'s motion (c) do not accurately describe long-crested waves. 66. The correct answer is c) Longer waves reduce buoyancy distribution. Longer waves have a reducing effect on the buoyancy distribution along the ship\'s length. Longer waves increasing buoyancy distribution (a), having no effect on buoyancy distribution (b), and causing lateral swaying (d) are not accurate statements. 67. The correct answer is c) They produce small undulations in the still water buoyancy curve. Waves that are very short in length compared to the ship produce small undulations in the still water buoyancy curve, rather than significantly affecting buoyancy distribution (a), creating significant bending moments (b), or causing the ship to pitch uncontrollably (d). 68. The correct answer is b) Waves with lengths much shorter than the ship. Waves with lengths much shorter than the ship have the maximum effect on buoyancy distribution, compared to waves with lengths much longer than the ship (a), equal to the ship\'s length (c), or equal to half the ship\'s length (d). 69. The correct answer is c) It increases the bending moment. An increase in wave height increases the bending moment due to buoyancy. Wave height decreasing the bending moment (a), having no effect on the bending moment (b), and decreasing the ship\'s stability (d) are not accurate statements. 70. The correct answer is c) h = 3.75 * L^0.3. According to Lloyd\'s Register, the suggested wave height (h) varies with the ship length (L) as h = 3.75 * L^0.3. The other options (a), (b), and (d) do not accurately represent the suggested relationship between wave height and ship length. 71. The correct answer is c) Sawtooth wave. A sawtooth wave is often considered as a first approximation to a deep sea wave. Square wave (a), sine curve (b), and trochoid wave (d) are not commonly considered as first approximations to deep sea waves. 72. The correct answer is c) Asymmetry about the x-axis. The asymmetry about the x-axis in a trochoid wave accounts for the sharpness of its crest. Symmetry about the x-axis (a), symmetry about the y-axis (b), and asymmetry about the y-axis (d) do not accurately describe the characteristic of a trochoid wave. 73. The correct answer is d) The position of the wave relative to the ship. When a wave of length equal to the ship\'s length moves past the ship, the distribution of buoyancy can be influenced by the position of the wave relative to the ship. The ship\'s speed (a), the shape of the ship\'s bow (b), and the wave\'s amplitude (c) do not specifically influence the distribution of buoyancy in this scenario. 74. The correct answer is b) Amidships. When wave crests are at the perpendiculars of the ship, the main support is provided by buoyancy amidships. Toward the ends of the ship (a), the ship remaining balanced (c), and along the waterline (d) do not accurately describe the support provided by buoyancy in this scenario. 75. The correct answer is c) Deck is in compression, bottom is in tension. When a ship sags, the deck is in compression and the bottom is in tension. Both being in compression (a), both being in tension (b), and the deck being in tension and the bottom being in compression (d) do not accurately represent the state of the deck and bottom during sagging. 76. The correct answer is a) Density of the fluid multiplied by the area of the section. The buoyancy per length at any section of the ship can be calculated by multiplying the density of the fluid by the area of the section. The other options (b), (c), and (d) do not accurately describe the calculation of buoyancy per length. 77. The correct answer is d) When the ship\'s displacement and center of gravity need correction. The waterline may need to be adjusted when the ship\'s displacement and center of gravity need correction, rather than when the ship encounters rough seas (a), is heeling (b), or is sailing at high speed (c). 78. The correct answer is d) The weight distribution includes various factors and types of material. The distribution of the ship\'s weight along its length is more complex than buoyancy distribution because it includes various factors and types of material. The ship\'s weight distribution always being uniform (a), not being influenced by the ship\'s length (b), and following a simple regular pattern (c) are not accurate statements. 79. The correct answer is d) Hull weight and cargo weight. The two main categories of ship weight that contribute to the total weight are hull weight and cargo weight. Deadweight and ballast (a), continuous material and concentrated material (b), and lightweight and heavy material (c) do not accurately represent the main categories of ship weight. 80. The correct answer is b) Distributed evenly over a short portion of the length. Semi-concentrated material refers to items whose weights are distributed evenly over a short portion of the ship\'s length, rather than being uniformly distributed over the entire length (a), the entire length (c), or concentrated in the midsection of the ship (d). 81. The correct answer is c) Assume a trapezoidal distribution of weight along the length. When calculating the weight distribution, the weight of a semi-concentrated item with varying cross-section can be accounted for by assuming a trapezoidal distribution of weight along the length, rather than assuming the weight is concentrated at one end of the item (a), at the center of length (b), or ignoring the weight of semi-concentrated items (d). 82. The correct answer is d) Trapezoidal approximation. The trapezoidal approximation is a method used to generate the weight curve in weight distribution calculations, rather than the parabolic approximation (a), distinct items method (b), or Biles method (c)."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Yoimiya walks across the streets of Inazuma.

Yoimiya: (relieved) Kokomi, it worked! The gods have answered our prayers. Kokomi: (smiling weakly) Thank you, Yoimiya. You truly are a dear friend.

She has a knack for delivering difficult births. Yoimiya: Great idea, Beelzebul! Noelle\'s expertise will be just what Kokomi needs right now. (Beelzebul quickly sends a message to Noelle, explaining the urgent situation. Meanwhile, Kokomi\'s cries grow louder as her labor progresses.) Kokomi: (Between contractions) Hurry... please... I can\'t... hold on much longer. Yoimiya: Just a little while longer, Kokomi! Help is on the way! (Just as Kokomi\'s pain seems unbearable, Noelle bursts into the room, carrying a medical bag.) Noelle: I\'m here, everyone! Don\'t worry, Kokomi, I\'ll take good care of you. Kokomi: (Relief in her eyes) Noelle... Thank goodness you\'re here. (Noelle quickly assesses the situation and begins to aid Kokomi in delivering her baby. The room fills with tension, the only sound being Kokomi\'s cries.) Noelle: Push, Kokomi! You\'re doing great. Just a little bit more. (Kokomi screams, putting all her strength into one final push. Suddenly, the room is filled with the sound of a baby\'s cry. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.) Thoma: Congratulations, Kokomi. It\'s a healthy baby. Yoimiya: (With tears of joy) Kokomi, you did it! You brought a little life into this world! Kokomi: (Smiling tiredly) Thank you, everyone. I couldn\'t have done it without your support. (As the room slowly returns to calm, the seafoam subsides, leaving behind a sense of serenity and new beginnings.)"},{"prompt":"from openpyxl import load_workbook import pandas as pd import datetime # 打开Excel文件 wb = load_workbook(filename=r\'C:UsersLIQIDocuments民生基金行业打分钢铁数据跟踪汇总.xlsx\', read_only=True, data_only=True) # 选择指定的sheet sheet = wb[\'产销数据\'] # 这里的Sheet3是你要读取的sheet名称，可以根据实际情况修改 # 选择指定的列 columns = [0, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] # 读取数据 data = [] for row in sheet.iter_rows(values_only=True): data.append([row[column] for column in columns]) # 构建DataFrame headers = [\'Column1\',\'Column2\', \'Column3\', \'Column4\', \'Column5\', \'Column6\'] # 这里是DataFrame的列名，可以根据实际情况修改 df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=headers) df = df[1:] df.columns = df.iloc[0] df = df[1:] # 将第一列作为索引并转换为datetime格式 df.set_index(df.columns[0], inplace=True) df.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index) def calculate_percentile(df,date, column): date = pd.to_datetime(date) year = date.year month = date.month day = date.day five_years_ago = datetime.datetime.now() -

It is a complex condition that can cause significant disruptions in a person\'s thoughts, perceptions, emotions, and daily functioning. Individuals with schizophrenia often struggle with distinguishing between what is real and what is not, and may experience hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thoughts and speech, and impaired social interactions. The exact causes of schizophrenia are still unknown, but it is believed to be the result of a combination of genetic, brain chemistry, and environmental factors. It typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, with symptoms appearing gradually or suddenly. While the specific symptoms and severity can vary significantly from person to person, schizophrenia is typically characterized by positive symptoms (such as hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (such as lack of motivation, social withdrawal, and decreased emotional expression). Schizophrenia can be extremely disruptive to a person\'s life, impacting their ability to think clearly, maintain relationships, and perform daily activities. It is a chronic condition that requires ongoing treatment and management. Although there is currently no cure for schizophrenia, a combination of medication, therapy, and support services can help individuals manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Understanding schizophrenia is crucial for reducing stigma, promoting early intervention, and providing appropriate support for those affected by the illness. By raising awareness, supporting research, and increasing empathy and understanding, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society for individuals living with schizophrenia."},{"prompt":"Characteristics or features associated with schizophrenia","completion":"Schizophrenia is characterized by a diverse range of symptoms and features that can vary from person to person. Here are some common characteristics and features associated with schizophrenia: 1. Positive symptoms: These are symptoms that involve additions to a person\'s normal thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors. Positive symptoms can include hallucinations (perceiving things that are not real, such as hearing voices), delusions (holding false beliefs despite evidence to the contrary), disorganized thinking and speech patterns, and abnormal movements. 2. Negative symptoms: These are symptoms that involve the absence or reduction of normal thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Negative symptoms can include reduced emotional expression, social withdrawal or isolation, reduced motivation and drive, difficulty in initiating or sustaining activities, and diminished speech or communication. 3. Cognitive impairments: Schizophrenia often leads to difficulties with cognitive functioning. These impairments can affect memory, attention, problem-solving, executive functioning, and the ability to plan and organize tasks. These cognitive deficits can significantly impact a person\'s daily life and functioning. 4. Emotional disturbances: People with schizophrenia may experience disruptions in their emotional states. They may have difficulties in regulating emotions and may exhibit inappropriate emotional responses or limited emotional range. Mood swings and feelings of depression or anxiety are also commonly reported. 5. Social and occupational impairments: Schizophrenia can have a profound impact on a person\'s ability to maintain relationships, hold a job, or engage in social activities. Difficulties with communication, social cues, and social interaction can make it challenging to form and maintain meaningful connections with others. 6. Duration and chronicity: Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that requires ongoing treatment and management. Symptoms of schizophrenia typically last for at least six months and can significantly impact a person\'s life throughout their lifetime if left unmanaged. It is important to note that symptoms and features of schizophrenia can vary widely among individuals, and not all of the characteristics mentioned above may be present in every case. Additionally, each person\'s experience with schizophrenia is unique, and treatment plans should be tailored to individual needs."},{"prompt":"Causes of schizophrenia","completion":"The exact causes of schizophrenia are not yet fully understood, but research suggests that a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurochemical factors play a role in its development. Here are some potential factors associated with the development of schizophrenia: 1. Genetic factors: There is a strong genetic component to schizophrenia. Having a family member with the disorder increases the risk of developing it. However, it is important to note that schizophrenia does not have a simple genetic pattern and is not solely determined by genetics. Multiple genes are believed to contribute to the risk, and interactions with other factors are likely involved. 2. Neurochemical imbalances: Certain neurochemical imbalances in the brain, specifically involving dopamine and glutamate, have been linked to schizophrenia. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, is thought to play a role in the brain\'s reward and pleasure system, as well as in regulating mood and motivation. Imbalances in dopamine functioning may contribute to symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. 3. Brain structure and function: Research has found that individuals with schizophrenia often have differences in brain structure and function compared to those without the disorder. These differences may involve abnormalities in key brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which are involved in cognition, memory, and emotion regulation. 4. Environmental factors: Environmental factors can also contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Prenatal exposure to certain viral infections, complications during pregnancy or childbirth, and early childhood stress or trauma have been associated with an increased risk. Other factors such as drug abuse, social adversity, and living in urban areas have also been identified as potential environmental risk factors. It\'s important to note that no single cause has been identified, and schizophrenia is likely influenced by a combination of multiple factors. The interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental influences is thought to be complex and may differ from person to person. Further research is needed to fully understand the causes of schizophrenia and enhance prevention and treatment strategies."},{"prompt":"Historical background of schizophrenia","completion":"The recognition and understanding of schizophrenia have evolved significantly over time. Here is a brief historical background of schizophrenia: 1. Early observations: The symptoms associated with schizophrenia have been described in various ancient texts and historical records. However, the disorder was not specifically recognized or differentiated from other mental illnesses until more recent times. 2. Emergence of the concept: The term \\"schizophrenia\\" was coined in the early 20th century by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler. He used this term to characterize a group of symptoms that included disruptions in thinking, emotions, and social functioning. Bleuler\'s work highlighted the disintegration of mental functions as a core component of the disorder. 3. Diagnostic criteria and classification: In the mid-20th century, the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were further refined and standardized. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) established criteria to help professionals diagnose and classify psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. 4. Early treatment approaches: Early treatment interventions for schizophrenia primarily focused on institutionalization and custodial care, often lacking effective therapeutic approaches. The introduction of neuroleptic medications (such as chlorpromazine) in the 1950s brought about a major breakthrough in managing the symptoms of the disorder. 5. Psychosocial approaches: As understanding grew, psychosocial approaches gained recognition as an important addition to medication-based treatment. Psychosocial interventions, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, family therapy, and supported employment, were developed to address the functional impairments and improve the overall quality of life for individuals with schizophrenia. 6. Evolving understanding: Advances in neuroimaging techniques and genetic research have provided insights into the biological underpinnings of schizophrenia. Researchers now recognize that schizophrenia is a complex interplay between genetic, neurochemical, and environmental factors. In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis on early detection, intervention, and recovery-oriented models of care for individuals with schizophrenia. Ongoing research and therapeutic advancements continue to refine our understanding of the disorder, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy, treatment options, and support services for those affected by schizophrenia."},{"prompt":"قم بعمل سيرة ذاتيه احترافيه تضمن اسمي : عبدالرحمن مجدي عبدالرحمن علي وعنواني : 55 شارع الفرن عين شمس الغربية القاهرة مصر والمهارات التي اقوم بها : اعمل على جميع برامج التصميم 3d والجرافيك بمهارة عالية وخبرة بها ثلاث سنوات والشهادة الحاصل عليها : ليسانس الاداب في اللغة العربية جامعة عين شمس وهوايتي المفضلة: القراءة والكتابة والبحث","completion":"السيرة الذاتية الاسم: عبدالرحمن مجدي عبدالرحمن علي العنوان: 55 شارع الفرن، عين شمس الغربية، القاهرة، مصر المهارات: - خبرة عالية في جميع برامج التصميم ثلاثية الأبعاد والجرافيك، حيث عملت بها لمدة ثلاث سنوات. - امتلك مهارات فنية متقدمة في تصميم الجرافيك والتلاعب بالصور والإبداع في الرسومات ثلاثية الأبعاد. - قادر على إنشاء تصاميم فريدة وجذابة للرسومات والشعارات والمنتجات والإعلانات باستخدام أحدث تقنيات التصميم. - القدرة على العمل بشكل مستقل وفريق وتنفيذ المشاريع في المواعيد المحددة. الشهادات: - ليسانس الآداب في اللغة العربية من جامعة عين شمس. الهوايات: - القراءة والكتابة والبحث. الخبرات السابقة: - عملت كمصمم ثلاثي الأبعاد ومصمم جرافيك في شركة تصميم مرموقة لمدة ثلاث سنوات، حيث قمت بتنفيذ العديد من المشاريع المرئية والتصميمات ثلاثية الأبعاد. اللغات: - العربية: اللغة الأم - الإنجليزية: طلاقة في القراءة والكتابة والمحادثة. للتواصل: الهاتف: 0123456789 البريد الإلكتروني: abdulrahman@example.com"},{"prompt":"قم بالترجمة الاحترافية الى اللغة الكندية","completion":"السيرة الذاتية الاسم: عبدالرحمن مجدي عبدالرحمن علي العنوان: 55 شارع الفرن، عين شمس الغربية، القاهرة، مصر المهارات: - خبرة عالية في جميع برامج التصميم ثلاثية الأبعاد والجرافيك، حيث عملت بها لمدة ثلاث سنوات. - امتلك مهارات فنية متقدمة في تصميم الجرافيك والتلاعب بالصور والإبداع في الرسومات ثلاثية الأبعاد. - قادر على إنشاء تصاميم فريدة وجذابة للرسومات والشعارات والمنتجات والإعلانات باستخدام أحدث تقنيات التصميم. - القدرة على العمل بشكل مستقل وفريق وتنفيذ المشاريع في المواعيد المحددة. الشهادات: - بكالوريوس الآداب في اللغة العربية من جامعة عين شمس. الهوايات: - القراءة والكتابة والبحث. الخبرات السابقة: - عملت كمصمم ثلاثي الأبعاد ومصمم جرافيك في شركة تصميم مرموقة لمدة ثلاث سنوات، حيث قمت بتنفيذ العديد من المشاريع المرئية والتصميمات ثلاثية الأبعاد. اللغات: - العربية: اللغة الأم - الإنجليزية: طلاقة في القراءة والكتابة والمحادثة. للتواصل: الهاتف: 0123456789 البريد الإلكتروني: abdulrahman@example.com"},{"prompt":"قم بالترجمة الى اللغة الانجليزية الاحترافية","completion":"Curriculum Vitae Name: Abdurrahman Majdi Abdurrahman Ali Address: 55 Al-Furn Street, Ain Shams Al-Gharbia, Cairo, Egypt Skills: - Highly skilled in all 3D design and graphic design software, with three years of experience. - Possess advanced artistic skills in graphic design, image manipulation, and 3D rendering. - Able to create unique and appealing designs for graphics, logos, products, and advertisements, utilizing the latest design techniques. - Capable of working independently and as part of a team, delivering projects on schedule.

Here\'s how you can do it: 1. Create a list: ```python my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ``` 2. Get an item from the list using its index: ```python item = my_list[index] ``` Replace `index` with the desired index of the item you want to retrieve. Remember, the index starts from 0 for the first item in the list. Here\'s an example to get the second item from the list: ```python my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] second_item = my_list[1] print(second_item) # Output: 2 ``` You can also use negative indexing to get items from the end of the list. For example, -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item, and so on."},{"prompt":"smartcard.Card.Card","completion":"In the `smartcard` library, the `Card` class represents a smart card in Python. It is used to establish a connection with a smart card reader and communicate with the smart card. Here\'s an example of how to use the `Card` class: ```python from smartcard.CardType import AnyCardType from smartcard.CardRequest import CardRequest # Create a card request card_type = AnyCardType() card_request = CardRequest(cardType=card_type) # Wait for the card to be inserted card_service = card_request.waitforcard() # Connect to the card card_connection = card_service.connection card_connection.connect() # Send commands to the card and receive responses command = [0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00] response, sw1, sw2 = card_connection.transmit(command) print(\\"Response:\\", response) ``` In the example above, we first create a `CardRequest` to wait and detect when a card is inserted into a smart card reader. `card_request.waitforcard()` waits until a card is detected and returns a `CardService` object. We can then obtain a reference to the `CardConnection` from the `CardService` (`card_service.connection`). Once we have a connection to the card, we can use `card_connection.transmit()` to send commands to the card. It takes a list of bytes as the command and returns a tuple containing the response data as a list of bytes, as well as the status words (`sw1` and `sw2`). Remember to handle exceptions, perform error checking, and handle responses appropriately based on your specific smart card and use case."},{"prompt":"how to pring log in python","completion":"To print logs in Python, you can use the built-in `logging` module. The `logging` module provides a flexible framework for emitting log statements from your Python applications. Here\'s an example of how to use the `logging` module to print logs: ```python import logging # Set logging configuration logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format=\'%(asctime)s %(levelname)s - %(message)s\') # Print log statements logging.debug(\\"This is a debug message\\") logging.info(\\"This is an info message\\") logging.warning(\\"This is a warning message\\") logging.error(\\"This is an error message\\") logging.critical(\\"This is a critical message\\") ``` In the code above, we set the logging configuration using `basicConfig()`. The `level` parameter specifies the minimum severity level for the logs to be displayed. In this case, we set it to `logging.DEBUG`, which means all log levels will be displayed. The `format` parameter specifies the format of the log message. In the example, we include the timestamp, log level, and message. You can use the following logging levels: - `DEBUG`: Detailed information, typically useful only for diagnosing problems. - `INFO`: Confirmation that things are working as expected. - `WARNING`: An indication that something unexpected happened or an issue might arise soon. - `ERROR`: An error occurred, which caused a function or operation to fail. - `CRITICAL`: A very serious error occurred, which may prevent the program from continuing. By default, the log statements are printed to the console. However, you can configure the `logging` module to write logs to files or other destinations as well. Note: It\'s best practice to configure the logging in a central place, such as the main entry point of your application, and use loggers in different modules of your codebase to log messages with appropriate log levels."},{"prompt":"how to print in terminal in ubuntu python","completion":"To print output to the terminal in Ubuntu using Python, you can use the `print()` function.

You can execute the script using the following command in the terminal: ```shell python your_script.py ``` Replace `your_script.py` with the name of your Python script file. You can also print variables, formatted strings, or multiple values separated by commas: ```python name = \\"John\\" age = 25 print(\\"My name is\\", name, \\"and I am\\", age, \\"years old.\\") ``` This will print: \\"My name is John and I am 25 years old.\\" Additionally, you can use placeholders or formatted strings for more complex printing requirements. Here\'s an example using formatted strings: ```python name = \\"Alice\\" age = 30 print(f\\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\\") ``` This will also print: \\"My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\\" Remember to run your Python script in the Ubuntu terminal using the `python` command to see the output on the terminal."},{"prompt":"how c# check duplicate unity event Action listeners","completion":"In C#, you can check whether an Action listener is already registered using the `Delegate.Equals()` method. Here\'s an example: ```csharp using UnityEngine; using System; public class EventManager : MonoBehaviour { // Define the event using Action delegate public event Action MyEvent; // Subscribe a listener to the event public void SubscribeListener(Action listener) { if (!IsListenerRegistered(listener)) // Check if listener is already registered { MyEvent += listener; } } // Unsubscribe a listener from the event public void UnsubscribeListener(Action listener) { if (IsListenerRegistered(listener)) // Check if listener is registered { MyEvent -= listener; } } // Check if a listener is already registered private bool IsListenerRegistered(Action listener) { if (MyEvent == null) { return false; } // Get the invocation list of the event Delegate[] invocationList = MyEvent.GetInvocationList(); // Check each delegate in the invocation list foreach (Delegate del in invocationList) { // Check if the current delegate is equal to the given listener if (del.Equals(listener)) { return true; } } return false; } // Usage example private void Start() { Action listener1 = () => Debug.Log(\\"Listener 1 invoked\\"); Action listener2 = () => Debug.Log(\\"Listener 2 invoked\\"); SubscribeListener(listener1); SubscribeListener(listener2); SubscribeListener(listener1); // This will not add the duplicate listener MyEvent?.Invoke(); UnsubscribeListener(listener2); MyEvent?.Invoke(); } } ``` In this example, the `SubscribeListener` method checks whether the provided listener is already registered using the `IsListenerRegistered` method. The `IsListenerRegistered` method compares each delegate in the event\'s invocation list with the given listener using the `Delegate.Equals()` method. Please note that this approach assumes that the event is a simple event using the Action delegate. If you are using a custom delegate or multi-cast delegate, you may need to adjust the code accordingly."},{"prompt":"blazer web assembly is a single page app *,*framework for building interactive *,*client-side web apps with net it uses *,*open web standards without plug-ins or *,*recompiling code into other languages *,*this course will teach you how to use *,*blazer web assembly and web api on.net *,*6. you will learn step by step how to *,*build a shopping cart application this *,*course also provides a guide on how to *,*integrate a payment gateway into your *,*blazer webassembly component so that a *,*user is able to pay for products through *,*your application using a debit or credit *,*card or even a paypal account *,*gavin lawn teaches this course *,*gavin is a senior software engineer with *,*over 20 years of experience i encourage *,*you to leave a comment with the most *,*interesting thing you learn for the *,*benefit of other campers who are *,*watching this course *,*please join me as we build a very basic *,*shopping cart application using blazer *,*webassembly *,*a few of the significant technologies *,*we\'ll use for building our application *,*are as follows *,*the latest version of visual studio *,*which is visual studio 2022 *,*and we\'ll use the community edition for *,*windows *,*dot net 6 which is at the time of *,*creating this video the latest version *,*of dot net it was released in november *,*of 2021 *,*sql server 2019 *,*laser web assembly we\'ll use bootstrap *,*version 5 for layout and styling *,*purposes we\'ll build a restful mvc web *,*api project for handling database *,*related functionality and returning *,*relevant data from the server to our *,*client side blazer application *,*all technologies used for the *,*development of this application can be *,*downloaded free of charge please see *,*below in the description the locations *,*of where you are able to download the *,*relevant technologies for free we are *,*going to integrate a payment gateway *,*powered by paypal into our application *,*so that a user can use their paypal *,*account or a valid debit or credit card *,*to pay for the items that are purchased *,*through our online shopping cart *,*application *,*blazer is a relatively new feature of *,*asp.net *,*it offers two hosting models a *,*server-side hosting model and a *,*client-side hosting model *,*we are going to use the client-side *,*hosting model for the development of our *,*shopping cart application the *,*significance of this hosting model is *,*that the c-sharp code runs directly *,*within our browsers *,*what makes this possible is a technology *,*named webassembly *,*in recent years the creation of spa *,*applications or single page applications *,*have become very popular as web *,*solutions *,*up until fairly recently javascript *,*frameworks like angular or react have *,*been the available choices for the *,*creation of spa applications *,*with blazer we are now able to create *,*our single page applications using *,*c-sharp çevir","completion":"Blazer Web Assembly, tek sayfalı bir uygulama framework\'üdür.

The function of a ship\'s structure includes providing a watertight envelope, supporting payload, and ensuring stability. Answer: True 2. The efficiency of a ship\'s structure is only measured by its initial cost. Answer: False 3. Efficiency of ship structure is often measured only by its structural weight. Answer: False 4. Reliability of a ship\'s structure can be improved through quality assurance inspections and feedback of structural damage during service. Answer: True 5. In ship structural design, the Factor of Safety (FOS) is typically calculated by dividing Strength by Stress. Answer: True 6. The minimum Factor of Safety (FOS) recommended by most design codes for various failure modes is usually less than one. Answer: False 7. Strength-driven designs primarily consider stiffness constants like the modulus of elasticity. Answer: False 8. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) prescribes a fixed Factor of Safety (FOS) value of 2 for all applications. Answer: False 9. Tensile stress, compressive stress, shear stress, and bending stress are common strengthdriven failure modes in the marine environment. Answer: True 10. Corrosion is not considered a significant failure mode in ship structures. Answer: False 11. A Factor of Safety (FOS) greater than 1 indicates that a structure is guaranteed to never fail. Answer: False 12. Buckling stress is a common strength-driven failure mode in ship structures. Answer: True 13. Fatigue damage is not a significant concern in ship structural design. Answer: False 14. In ship structural analysis, a structure that deforms beyond allowable limits is considered a failure. Answer: True 15. Shear stress is not considered a relevant failure mode in ship structures. Answer: False 16. The ship structural design process concludes with selecting the materials, form, layout, and scantlings. Answer: True 17. Reliability of a ship\'s structure can be improved by having material tests during construction. Answer: True 18. Corrosion is a common strength-driven failure mode in marine environments. Answer: True 19. The keel is a longitudinal component that runs along the sides of the ship to provide longitudinal strength. Answer: False 20. Deck girders are transverse members of the deck frame that resist hydrostatic pressure and waves. Answer: False 21. The primary role of longitudinal members is to resist the hydrostatic loads acting on the ship\'s structure. Answer: False 22. A ship longer than 100 meters is more likely to experience significant longitudinal bending stress. Answer: True 23. The longitudinal framing system involves closely spaced transverse frames and widely spaced longitudinal members. Answer: True 24. In a longitudinal framing system, girders are responsible for carrying longitudinal loads. Answer: True 25. The transverse framing system is characterized by closely spaced longitudinal members and widely spaced transverse frames. Answer: False 26. The combination framing system combines the best of both longitudinal and transverse framing systems for optimal strength. Answer: True 27. Transverse framing systems are more suitable for smaller vessels, while longitudinal framing systems are better for larger ships. Answer: True 28. The combination framing system is less expensive to construct compared to either the longitudinal or transverse systems. Answer: False 29. In the longitudinal framing system, frames are spaced closely and longitudinals are spaced widely. Answer: True 30. The combination framing system is not as strong in the longitudinal direction as a fully longitudinally framed ship. Answer: True 31. The transverse framing system is more suitable for submersible vessels and ships shorter than 100 meters. Answer: True 32. One of the disadvantages of the Longitudinal framing system is the difficulty in stowing bulk cargoes due to the large frames. Answer: True 33. Single Bottom Construction is usually found on container ships and provides more longitudinal strength compared to Double Bottom Construction. Answer: False 34. Double Bottom Construction provides more longitudinal material, resistance to damage, and space for storing liquids compared to Single Bottom Construction. Answer: True 35. Shell plating referred to as \\"sheer strake\\" is the uppermost strake of side shell plating. Answer: True 36. There are many forces acting on a ship. How they act is largely determined by the purpose the ship was built for. Answer: True 37. The types of forces that occur in waves are the same for every ship but the magnitudes and points of action depend on the shape of the ship below the waterline. Answer: True 38. Excessive midships buoyancy can lead to the hull hogging. Answer: True 39. Excessive midships weight can lead to the hull sagging. Answer: True 40. The area under the weight distribution curve is equal to the area under the buoyancy distribution curve. Answer: True 41. The loading distribution, which results from differences in weight and buoyancy along the hull, can create stresses in the ship\'s structure. Answer: True 42. Shear force is the force attempting to push different hull sections up or down according to whether the buoyancy or the weight is in excess. Answer: True 43. The bending moment at a point along the hull is the sum of all the shear force values multiplied by their distances from that point. Answer: True 44. The distribution of buoyancy remains unchanged as the ship moves amongst waves. Answer: False 45. The total shearing force on a ship is the sum of the still water shearing force and the shearing force due to waves. Answer: True 46. In hogging, the hull\'s deck is in tension and the bottom is in compression. Answer: True 47. The difference in the distribution of weight and buoyancy along the length of the hull is known as the Loading Distribution. Answer: True 48. The upward pressure from waves changes due to variations in the wave pattern. Answer: True 49. The hydrodynamic forces on a ship are mainly influenced by the ship\'s weight and buoyancy. Answer: False 50. The distribution of buoyancy along a ship is altered when the ship moves amongst waves. Answer: True 51. Hydrostatic pressure acts perpendicular to the outside surface of the ship. Answer: True 52. The forces causing the ship to be deflected will lead to permanent deformation if they exceed a certain limit. Answer: True 53. The curve of buoyancy per unit length has ordinates proportional to the immersed area of the sections of the ship. Answer: True 54. The still water bending moment and wave bending moment can be summed up to get the total bending moment on a ship.

It uses a web worker (`cupWorkerRef.current`) to handle the logic and calculations for drawing the chart. The chart is rendered on a canvas element (`canvasRef.current`).

There are also several helper functions used in this component: - `cupSubscribe`: Function that subscribes to cup data for a given symbol and zoom level. - `cupUnsubscribe`: Function that unsubscribes from cup data for a given symbol. - `sendSettings`: Function that sends the cup chart settings to the web worker. - `wheelHandler`: Event handler for zooming the chart using the mouse wheel. - `zoomAdd`: Function that increases the zoom level. - `zoomSub`: Function that decreases the zoom level. The component has several `useEffect` hooks that handle the initialization and cleanup of the web worker, as well as the rendering of the cup chart on the canvas. The settings and symbol are listened for changes, and the cup chart is subscribed to and unsubscribed from based on these changes. When `settings.dollarsVolume` is `true`, the quantity is multiplied by the price when rendering the cup chart rows. The maximum volume is also determined by multiplying the price by the quantity in the web worker. Overall, this component is responsible for rendering and updating the cup chart based on the selected symbol and settings."},{"prompt":"ترجم إلى العربية باحتراف They waited and waited for the explosion. But there was no explosion. They looked back, and realized the company car was gone. The police officer was gone. Had he moved the car to safety? Confused, they called the Nihon Trust bank to find out what was going on. To their relief, the bank manager answered; he was alive and well. In fact, everything was fine there; the bank manager\'s home was never blown up. As the adrenaline wore off, it finally dawned on them what had happened. This was the moment the perpetrator had been setting up the past few months. Disguised as a police officer, he had now gotten away with what was to be the bonus payments of 523 Toshiba employees; the stolen amount totaled to 300 million yen or six million dollars, the exact amount he had asked for. On the ground they found various items left behind including a warning flare that the officer must have ignited while under the car, to mimic dynamite. A reported 120 pieces of evidence was left behind at the crime scene, which is a lot and would normally be beneficial, but this was purposely done to mislead the investigation. This worked. Half a century later, the case remains unsolved. Some say this was the greatest heist in Japanese history; there was no loss of life, no blood spilt; the plan meticulously carried out by a single person; and in the end the money taken; but there are many ways a bank heist can be great, there are many ways it can be notable. Take the case on May 15th, 2016. At around 5:00 a.m. in the early hours, cash was physically withdrawn from an ATM from a Tokyo 7-Eleven. The amount was a 100,000 yen, about 880, which was the cash limit. Now, this doesn\'t seem too bad; but try repeating this 14,000 times across Japan in the span of just two hours. Because that is exactly what happened. In total, 1.4 billion yen, about 13 million dollars, was taken from ATMs alone; and this wasn\'t done electronically. It was done in person. Sure, it had to have been some sort of a large coordinated group, but the staggering number of transactions in a two hour frame made even this seem questionable. Compared to other notable cases, the largest known recorded number of participants to have been involved in a single heist, wouldn\'t have been able to pull this off either; unless they had super powers. Involving an even larger team would presumably be unwise, as there\'d be too many chefs in the kitchen. Now after police completed their painstaking process of checking security footage from each 7-Eleven store and yeah it was only 7-Elevens hit, they found their answer. In this particular case, the more chefs the better. It wasn\'t a team of 50, or 100, or even 200. It was 600 people. 600 people pulling off a sophisticated, highly-coordinated heist using fake credit cards. Quite the contrast from the single perpetrator of our first heist. Not surprisingly, people have surmised with this many active participants, there must have been links to a large crime organization. But as of today, despite the numbers, no one of note has been caught. Now here\'s a quick one. Kobe. August 7th, 1994. 540 million yen was stolen from Fukutoku Bank; which is a sizeable amount, but what makes this story so unique is that 10 days after the heist,","completion":"انتظروا وانتظروا الانفجار. ولكن لم يحدث انفجار. نظروا إلى الخلف، وأدركوا أن سيارة الشركة قد اختفت. اختفى ضابط الشرطة. هل نقل السيارة إلى مكان آمن؟ في حالة الارتباك، اتصلوا بمصرف نيهون تراست لمعرفة ما يحدث. لسعادتهم، رد مدير البنك؛ كان على قيد الحياة وبخير. في الواقع، كان كل شيء على ما يرام هناك؛ لم يتم تفجير منزل مدير البنك. مع انحسار الأدرينالين، أدركوا أخيرًا ما حدث. كانت هذه هي اللحظة التي كان يعدوا لها الجاني على مدى الأشهر القليلة الماضية. متنكرًا في زي ضابط شرطة، قد انفصل الآن بما يشكل المكافآت التي كان ينبغي دفعها لـ523 موظفًا في توشيبا؛ قدر المبلغ المسروق بمبلغ 300 مليون ين ياباني أو 6 ملايين دولار، المبلغ الدقيق الذي طلبه. وجدوا على الأرض مختلف الأشياء المتركة بما في ذلك إشعال صاروخ تحذيري يجب أن يكون الضابط قد اشعله أثناء وجوده تحت السيارة، لتشبيهه بالديناميت. ترك المتهم 120 قطعة من الأدلة في مسرح الجريمة، وهو الكثير وسيكون عادةً ذلك مفيدًا، ولكن هذا تم بقصد لتضليل التحقيق. وقد نجح هذا الأمر. بعد نصف قرن، لا يزال القضية بدون حل. يقول البعض أن هذه كانت أعظم عملية سرقة في التاريخ الياباني؛ لم يكن هناك خسارة في الأرواح، ولم يسفك الدم؛ تم تنفيذ الخطة بدقة من قبل شخص واحد، وفي النهاية تم سرقة المال؛ ولكن هناك العديد من الطرق التي يمكن أن تكون فيها عملية سرقة مصرف عظيمة، هناك العديد من الطرق التي يمكن ان تكون بها لافتة للنظر. خذ قضية 15 مايو 2016 كمثال. في حوالي الساعة 5:00 صباحًا في ساعات الفجر الأولى، تم سحب النقدية بشكل فعلي من جهاز صراف آلي في أحد فروع السبعة عشر 7-Eleven في طوكيو. كان المبلغ هو 100,000 ين، حوالي 880 دولارًا، وهو الحد النقدي المسموح به. الآن، هذا لا يبدو سيئًا جدًا؛ ولكن حاول تكرار هذا 14,000 مرة في جميع أنحاء اليابان خلال فترة زمنية قدرها ساعتين فقط. لأن هذا هو بالضبط ما حدث. في المجموع، تم سرقة 1.4 مليار ين ياباني، حوالي 13 مليون دولار، فقط من أجهزة صراف آلي؛ ولم يتم ذلك بشكل إلكتروني. لقد تم ذلك شخصيًا. بالتأكيد، كان يجب أن تكون هناك مجموعة متنسقة كبيرة من أي نوع، ولكن العدد الهائل من العمليات في إطار زمني قدره ساعتان جعل ذلك يبدو غريبًا حتى. بالمقارنة مع قضايا بارزة أخرى، فإن أكبر عدد معروف من المشتركين في عملية سرقة واحدة من المعروف لم يكن قادرًا على القيام بذلك؛ إلا إذا كان لديهم قدرات خارقة. سيكون من غير الحكمة أن يكون في الفريق فريق أكبر أيضًا، لأنه سيكون هناك الكثير من الطهاة في المطبخ. والآن بعد أن أنهت الشرطة عملية فحص كاميرات المراقبة الأمنية في كل متجر 7-Eleven ونعم، تم ضربهم فقط في فروع السبعة عشر 7-Eleven، وجدوا إجابتهم. في هذه الحالة الخاصة، كلما كان هناك المزيد من الطهاة، كلما كان الأمر أفضل. لم يكن هناك فريق من 50 شخصًا، أو 100 شخص، أو حتى 200 شخص. كان هناك 600 شخص. 600 شخص ينفذون عملية سطو معقدة ومتنسقة باستخدام بطاقات ائتمان مزيفة. يشكل هذا تناقضًا كبيرًا مع الجاني الواحد من أول عملية سرقة. لا يستغرب أن الناس قد استنتجوا في حالة مشاركة هذا العدد الكبير من الأشخاص، يجب أن يكون هناك ارتباطات بمنظمة جريمة كبيرة. ولكن حتى اليوم، وعلى الرغم من الأعداد، لم يتم القبض على أي شخص بارز. الآن هاهي قصه سريعة. كوبي. 7 أغسطس 1994. تم سرقة 540 مليون ين ياباني من بنك فوكتوكو. وهو مبلغ قدره، ولكن ما يجعل هذه القصة فريدة من نوعها هو أن 10 أيام بعد السرقة،"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The bank manager of the Nihon Trust bank was on edge. Someone had threatened his life and those around him over the past few months. Just four days prior, a letter, one of recent many, was sent to his personal residence demanding 300 million yen or his house would be blown up with dynamite. The letter was made up of characters cut out and pasted from movie magazines. Police were notified; and indeed they kept a close eye on the bank and his home; though, this did not ease the mind of the bank manager who shared his concerns with his branch employees. Now of course, this is Japan, and work is work; the show must go on. With this in mind, the bank manager went on with his duties, sending four of his employees to the nearby Toshiba factory to make a scheduled drop. So off they went, taking the company car, but not long after leaving the bank, the four heard police sirens approaching. At that very moment they happened to be next to a prison of all places. A police officer screeched to a halt in front of the car, and frantically got off his motorcycle to warn them. The branch manager\'s home had just been blown up, people were injured; and some presumably worse. Despite police monitoring the locations, the perpetrator was still able to carry out his threat. But it wasn\'t over, additional threats were made. The bank in particular was now a target and branch employees were at risk, especially those who had left the bank earlier to carry out bank duties in clearly-marked company cars. Their car needed to be searched. The officer got down underneath to check the car, but before he could do a proper search, an employee started noticing smoke and flames emerging from the vehicle. Fearing the car was about to explode, the officer desperately tried to roll out of the way. Everyone ran as fast as they could to safety, retreating behind the prison walls. They waited and waited for the explosion. But there was no explosion. They looked back, and realized the company car was gone. The police officer was gone. Had he moved the car to safety? Confused, they called the Nihon Trust bank to find out what was going on. To their relief, the bank manager answered; he was alive and well. In fact, everything was fine there; the bank manager\'s home was never blown up. As the adrenaline wore off, it finally dawned on them what had happened. This was the moment the perpetrator had been setting up the past few months. Disguised as a police officer, he had now gotten away with what was to be the bonus payments of 523 Toshiba employees; the stolen amount totaled to 300 million yen or six million dollars, the exact amount he had asked for. On the ground they found various items left behind including a warning flare that the officer must have ignited while under the car, to mimic dynamite. A reported 120 pieces of evidence was left behind at the crime scene, which is a lot and would normally be beneficial, but this was purposely done to mislead the investigation. This worked. Half a century later, the case remains unsolved. Some say this was the greatest heist in Japanese history; there was no loss of life, no blood spilt; the plan meticulously carried out by a single person; and in the end the money taken; but there are many ways a bank heist can be great, there are many ways it can be notable. Take the case on May 15th, 2016.

The amount was a 100,000 yen, about 880, which was the cash limit. Now, this doesn\'t seem too bad; but try repeating this 14,000 times across Japan in the span of just two hours. Because that is exactly what happened. In total, 1.4 billion yen, about 13 million dollars, was taken from ATMs alone; and this wasn\'t done electronically. It was done in person. Sure, it had to have been some sort of a large coordinated group, but the staggering number of transactions in a two hour frame made even this seem questionable. Compared to other notable cases, the largest known recorded number of participants to have been involved in a single heist, wouldn\'t have been able to pull this off either; unless they had super powers. Involving an even larger team would presumably be unwise, as there\'d be too many chefs in the kitchen. Now after police completed their painstaking process of checking security footage from each 7-Eleven store and yeah it was only 7-Elevens hit, they found their answer. In this particular case, the more chefs the better. It wasn\'t a team of 50, or 100, or even 200. It was 600 people. 600 people pulling off a sophisticated, highly-coordinated heist using fake credit cards. Quite the contrast from the single perpetrator of our first heist. Not surprisingly, people have surmised with this many active participants, there must have been links to a large crime organization. But as of today, despite the numbers, no one of note has been caught. Now here\'s a quick one. Kobe. August 7th, 1994. 540 million yen was stolen from Fukutoku Bank; which is a sizeable amount, but what makes this story so unique is that 10 days after the heist, the bank, still reeling from the events, received a note from the robbers. The note read Thank you very much for the bonus. We can now live on this loot for the rest of our lives. It was a sincere message of gratitude. Yeah we all know the reputation Japanese people have for being polite but this took it to another level. So, the last three cases involved plans being executed perfectly with no loss of life, but not the case with the next one. We\'re going way back. January 26th, 1948. Again in Tokyo; a man in his forties walked into a branch of the Imperial Bank, just before closing time. 16 people were inside including customers and bank workers. He got everyone\'s attention and explained he was a government health inspector sent by the US occupation authorities. Remember, this was postwar Tokyo, still under US occupation. The man stated there was a sudden outbreak of dysentery in the area, and he was to carry out inoculations. In postwar Tokyo, the disease was a legitimate threat so no one really doubted him, add to the fact the man wearing an official government armband. He gave all 16 people a pill, and a few drops of liquid, which they quickly drank. Now, it wasn\'t long, until they fell, one by one; in agony. With everyone incapacitated, the so-called health inspector grabbed all the money he could find, and calmly left. 12 of the 16 people would later be confirmed dead, including a young child. The solution they drank was a cyanide solution. This was a ruthless way to go about a heist; but what made this even more strange was that the man left behind a business card; he left it at the scene. The card was marked with the name Shigeru Matsui, apparently from the Department of Disease Prevention; which does make sense since he was","completion":"تم سحب النقود نقدًا من ماكينة صراف آلي في متجر سفن إيلفن في طوكيو. كانت المبلغ 100,000 ين، أي حوالي 880 دولار، وهو الحد النقدي. الآن، هذا لا يبدو سيئًا جدًا. ولكن حاول تكرار ذلك 14,000 مرة في جميع أنحاء اليابان خلال ساعتين فقط. لأن هذا هو بالضبط ما حدث. في المجموع، تم سرقة 1.4 مليار ين، أي حوالي 13 مليون دولار، من صرافات آلية فقط، ولم يحدث هذا بصورة إلكترونية. حدث ذلك شخصيًا. بالطبع، كان يجب عليهم أن يكونوا جماعة متنسقة بشكل ما، ولكن العدد المذهل للمعاملات في إطار ساعتين جعلت هذا حتى يبدو مشكوكًا فيه. مقارنة بالحالات المشهورة الأخرى، فإن أكبر عدد مسجل معروف من المشاركين الذين شاركوا في عملية واحدة، لم يكن بإمكانهم القيام بذلك؛ ما لم يكن لديهم قوى خارقة. سيكون من غير الحكمة إشراك فريق أكبر حجمًا ، حيث سيكون هناك الكثير من الطهاة في المطبخ. الآن بعد أن أكملت الشرطة عملية مرهقة من فحص لقطات الفيديو الأمنية من كل متجر سفن إيلفن، ونعم هذه الضربة كانت فقط في محلات سفن إيلفن، وجدوا إجابتهم. في هذه الحالة المحددة، كلما زاد عدد الطهاة زاد الأمر. لم يكن فريقًا مكونًا من 50 شخصًا، أو 100، أو حتى 200 شخص. إنه 600 شخص. 600 شخص ينفذون عملية سطو متطورة ومنسقة باستخدام بطاقات ائتمان مزيفة. إنها مقابلة مثيرة جدًا لعملية السرقة الفردية في الحالة الأولى. كما ليس من المستغرب أن يخمن الناس مع وجود هذا العدد الكبير من المشاركين النشطين، يجب أن يكون هناك ارتباط بمنظمة إجرامية كبيرة. ولكن حتى اليوم، على الرغم من الأرقام، لم يتم القبض على أي شخص مهم. الآن هنا مثال سريع. كوبي. 7 أغسطس 1994. تمت سرقة 540 مليون ين من بنك Fukutoku؛ وهو مبلغ كبير، ولكن ما يجعل هذه القصة فريدة من نوعها هو أنه بعد 10 أيام من السرقة، تلقى البنك، الذي لا يزال يعاني من تداعيات هذه الأحداث، رسالة من اللصوص. كانت الرسالة تقول \\"شكراً جزيلاً على العلاوة. يمكننا الآن أن نعيش على هذه الغنيمة لبقية حياتنا\\". كانت رسالة صادقة للامتنان. نعم، نحن جميعًا نعرف سمعة اليابانيين باللباقة ولكن هذا انتقل إلى مستوى آخر. لذا، كانت الحالات الثلاث الأخيرة تنطوي على خطط تم تنفيذها بشكل مثالي دون فقدان أرواح، ولكن ليس هذا هو الحال مع الحالة التالية. سنعود بالزمن إلى الوراء. 26 يناير 1948. مرة أخرى في طوكيو؛ دخل رجل في أواخر الأربعينيات من العمر إلى فرع للبنك الإمبراطوري قبل وقت الإغلاق. كان هناك 16 شخص داخل، بما في ذلك الزبائن وموظفو البنك. لفت انتباه الجميع وشرح أنه كان مفتش صحي حكومي تم إرساله بواسطة السلطات الامتدادية الأمريكية. تذكر، كانت طوكيو ما بعد الحرب، لا تزال تحت الاحتلال الأمريكي. قال الرجل إن هناك تفشيًا مفاجئًا للديدان الشريطية في المنطقة، وكان عليه تنفيذ التطعيمات. في طوكيو ما بعد الحرب، كان المرض تهديدًا شرعيًا لذا لم يشك أحد حقًا فيه، بالإضافة إلى حقيقة أن الرجل كان يرتدي سوار رسمي للعمل الحكومي. أعطى الرجل الـ16 شخصًا حبة، وقطرات قليلة من السائل التي شربوها بسرعة. لم يمر وقت طويل حتى سقطوا جميعًا، واحدًا تلو الآخر، في ألم. مع عجز الجميع، أخذ المفتش الصحي المزعوم المال الذي تمكن من العثور عليه، وغادر بهدوء. لاحقًا، تم تأكيد وفاة 12 من الـ16 شخصًا، بما في ذلك طفل صغير. سائل الحل الذي شربوه كان محلول سيانيد. كانت هذه طريقة بلا رحمة للقيام بعملية سرقة؛ لكن ما جعل هذا الموقف أكثر غرابةً هو أن الرجل ترك بطاقة عمل خلفه؛ تركها في المشهد. حملت البطاقة اسم شيغيرو ماتسوي، على ما يبدو من قسم الوقاية من الأمراض؛ والأمر منطقي نظرًا لأنه كان..."},{"prompt":"Sie Kensou (The King of Fighters)(athletic shorts) and Athena Asamiya (The King of Fighters)(athletic shorts) fuse with potara earrings; complete in-depth description of name, attire, personality, fighting techniques, and fusion process; extremely detailed overview of combined body parts and androgynous physique from head to toe","completion":"Fusion Name: Asei Kensomiya Attire: Asei Kensomiya adorns a unique combination of Sie Kensou and Athena Asamiya\'s traditional outfits.

But Shigeru Matsui turned out to be a real person, who actually worked for the Department of Disease Prevention. Not surprisingly, upon investigation Matsui was cleared, he was not the robber, he had several alibis. But he told police he had exchanged business cards with 593 individuals. Japanese people have the habit of exchanging business cards with personal details; so this was helpful, as police now had 593 suspects. Over time, they were able to whittle down this number to just eight cards, eight suspects, one of which was a man named Sadamichi Hirasawa, a Japanese painter. When Hirasawa was questioned and asked to produce the card of Shigeru Matsui\'s which he should have had; he could not. He claimed it must have been in his wallet which was stolen the other day. He was a victim of pickpocketing. Of course, police had a feeling they knew exactly where the card was. When asked to produce an alibi, he could not. When police looked into his history, they found four previous cases of bank fraud. When they searched his possession, they found a similar amount of money to that stolen from the bank, Hirasawa suspiciously refused to divulge how he got the money. Finally, when his face was shown to eye witnesses, they immediately identified him as the poisoner. Upon further interrogation, Hirasawa confessed. He was arrested for the robbery and the murders; and in 1950, he was given the death penalty, he was sent to death row to await execution by hanging. Case closed. Or is it? Because after the trial, some had doubts whether Sadamichi Hirasawa was indeed the perpetrator. Everything mentioned was circumstantial. In fact, it was revealed his confession was viciously beaten out of him; allegedly tortured; and it was only two of the eyewitnesses who identified him as the criminal. Perhaps he was telling the truth. Perhaps he was really a victim of pickpocketing as he claimed. The unexplained origin of the money in his possession was also thought by some to be from his side business of drawing pornographic pictures, revealing this truth to police, and to the public, would have been detrimental to his reputation as an artist. There was also no way Hirasawa could have realistically obtained the ingredients for what turned out to be a military grade cyanide solution used in the robbery. Interestingly, some have claimed that the true culprit was actually a former member of the notorious Unit 731; a covert biological and chemical warfare research and development unit of the Imperial Japanese Army; that undertook lethal human experimentation during wartime. If so, this would explain the accessibility to the poison. The Minister of Justice himself doubted Hirasawa\'s guilt and so never signed the death warrant. This opinion was shared by successive Ministers of Justice, so the death sentence was never actually carried out. And so Hirasawa sat in prison, on death row, for the next 32 years of his life, one of the longest tenures ever on death row. And on May 10th, 1987, he caught pneumonia and died in a prison hospital. Despite the verdict, the case was never truly put to rest, and many people felt that the true culprit, all those years ago, would have been within grasp if only the focus was on the right person. This brutality happened in 1948, but 70 years on, there would emerge a new type of heist. January 25th, 2018. Land of the rising cyber-crime. The Tokyo-based exchange, Coincheck, one of the most prominent virtual currency exchanges in Asia was to fall victim to the biggest cryptocurrency heist in history. At 2:57 a.m., using overseas servers, hackers disguising themselves as authorized users, were able to enter the system. They remained undetected for the next eight and a half hours, stealing 58 billion yen worth of the cryptocurrency NEM, which is about 530 million dollars. Then they were gone. This incident became an embarrassment to the Japanese government who had been trying to make Tokyo the global center for cryptocurrency. Coincheck revealed they failed to implement the required extra layer of security, but even worse the stolen currency had been kept online in a hot wallet rather than in a much more secure offline storage facility known as a cold wallet. This is similar to if a convenience store kept significantly large amounts in a cash register as opposed to an off-premise bank vault. Now one of the stranger aspects of the heist is that the stolen virtual funds were able to be traced online, because transactions for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are all public. And so the 530 million worth was eventually traced back to 11 specific addresses; but the identities of those sending and receiving the money unfortunately remained anonymous. Indeed no one yet has been caught, but the developers of NEM were able to label the 11 addresses with specific warning tags for all to see, they also set up a tracking tool to automatically reject exchanges involving the stolen funds. Of course the most frustrating part of this is that it all easily could have been avoided if Coincheck just added that extra layer of security. And really it\'s not just big companies; most people today are too laxed when it comes to online security using the same password for every account they have. Now if this is you, congratulations, you have bad habits just like me, but that\'s okay because Dashlane makes keeping track of all your passwords ridiculously easy. It stores all your passwords in one super-secure place then auto-fills them on websites you go to. If you have the same password everywhere but are too lazy to go to each individual website to change your password, that\'s me, well all good because you can just click one button in the Dashlane app, and it does it for you. Dashlane also has a password generator so you don\'t have to spend time thinking up super strong passwords","completion":"يتظاهر بأنه مسؤول صحي. لكن تبين أن شيغيرو ماتسوي هو شخص حقيقي، الذي عمل فعلاً في قسم الوقاية من الأمراض. وبالطبع، وبعد التحقيق، تم تبرئة ماتسوي، فهو لم يكن السارق، ولديه عدة أواصر توجيه. ولكنه قال للشرطة إنه قد قام بتبادل بطاقات العمل مع 593 شخصاً. اليابانيون لديهم عادة تبادل بطاقات الأعمال مع تفاصيل شخصية؛ لذا كان ذلك مفيدًا، فقد كان لدى الشرطة الآن 593 مشتبهاً. مع مرور الوقت، تمكنوا من تقليص هذا العدد إلى ثماني بطاقات فقط، ثمانية مشتبه فيهم، أحدهم كان يدعى ساداميتشي هيراساوا، رسام ياباني. عندما سئل هيراساوا وطُلب منه إبراز بطاقة شيغيرو ماتسوي التي يجب أن يكون لديه، فشَخَّص الأمر. ادعى أنه قد كان في محفظته التي تم سرقتها مؤخرًا. كان ضحية للسارق المحترف. بالطبع، كان لدى الشرطة شعور بأنهم يعرفون بالضبط أين توجد البطاقة. عندما طُلِبَ منه تقديم أليبي، لم يستطع ذلك. عندما نظرت الشرطة في تاريخه، وجدت أربع حالات سابقة للغش المصرفي. عندما فتشوا ممتلكاته، وجدوا كمية مال مماثلة للمبلغ المسروق من البنك، كما رفض هيراساوا بشكل مشبوه الكشف عن كيفية الحصول على المال. وأخيرًا، عندما تم عرض وجهه على الشهود العيان، قاموا فورًا بتحديد هويته كمغير للسموم. بعد التحقيق الأكثر عمقًا، اعترف هيراساوا. تم اعتقاله بتهمة السرقة والقتل؛ وفي عام 1950، حكم عليه بالإعدام شنقًا، تم إرساله لسجن الإعدام. القضية انتهت. أو هل هذا هو الواقع؟ لأنه بعد المحاكمة، كان هناك شكوك حول ما إذا كان ساداميتشي هيراساوا هو المذنب بالفعل. كل ما ذكره كان ظرفيًا. في الواقع، تبين أن اعترافه تم الاعتداء عليه بوحشية؛ على ما يبدو تعرض للتعذيب؛ وكان شاهدين فقط هما اللذان حددا هويته كالجاني. ربما كان يقول الحقيقة. ربما كان حقًا ضحية للسارق المحترف كما ادعى. واعتقد بعضهم أيضًا أن الأموال التي لم يتم تفسير مصدرها في حوزته كانت من أعماله الجانبية لرسم الصور الإباحية، وكشف هذا الحقيقة للشرطة والجمهور كان سيكون ضارًا بسمعته كفنان. ولا يوجد أي وسيلة للحصول على مكونات المحلول السام من السمسم ذات الصفات العسكرية التي تم استخدامها في السرقة بشكل واقعي. من اللافت للنظر أن بعض الأشخاص ادعوا أن الجاني الحقيقي كان في الواقع عضو سابق في الوحدة 731 المشؤومة، وهي وحدة قامت بأبحاث وتطوير للحروب البيولوجية والكيميائية تحت إمبراطورية الجيش الياباني، التي أجرت تجارب بشرية مميتة في فترة الحرب. إذا صح التصريح، فإن ذلك سيفسر إمكانية الوصول إلى السم. شكك وزير العدل نفسه في براءة هيراساوا، وبالتالي لم يوقع أمر الإعدام. كان هذا الرأي مشتركاً بين وزراء العدل اللاحقين، لذلك لم يتم تنفيذ حكم الإعدام فعليًا. وهكذا جلس هيراساوا في السجن، في سجن الإعدام، لمدة 32 عامًا من حياته، مما يعد من أطول فترات وجود في سجن الإعدام على الإطلاق. وفي 10 مايو 1987، أصيب بالتهاب رئوي وتوفي في مستشفى السجن. على الرغم من الحكم، لم تُحسَم القضية حقًا، وشعر العديد من الناس بأن الجاني الحقيقي قبل سنوات كان في متناول اليد إذا ما تم التركيز على الشخص المناسب. حدثت هذه التدنيس في عام 1948، ولكن بعد 70 سنة، ظهر نوع جديد من عملية السطو. في 25 يناير 2018. أرض الجريمة السيبرانية المتصاعدة. تعرضت بورصة كوينشيك في طوكيو، واحدة من أبرز بورصات العملات الرقمية في آسيا، لأكبر سرقة للعملة المشفرة في التاريخ. في الساعة 2:57 صباحًا، باستخدام خوادم خارجية، نجح القراصنة في التنكر في صورة مستخدمين مُرَخَّصَين، وتمكنوا من دخول النظام. ظلوا غير مكتشفين لمدة ثماني ساعات ونصف، واستولوا على 58 مليار ين ياباني من العملة المشفرة NEM، وهي حوالي 530 مليون دولار. ثم اختفوا. أصبح هذا الحادث مصدر إحراج للحكومة اليابانية التي كانت تحاول جعل طوكيو مركزًا عالميًا للعملات المشفرة. كشفت كوينشيك أنهم فشلوا في تنفيذ الطبقة الإضافية المطلوبة من الأمان، ولكن الأسوأ من ذلك أن العملة المسروقة كانت محفوظة على الإنترنت في محفظة ساخنة بدلاً من أن تكون في مستودع تخزين أكثر أمانًا معروف بالمحفظة الباردة. ويمكن تشبيه هذا بمتجر سهولة الوصول يحتفظ بمبالغ كبيرة في الخزينة بدلاً من خزنة بنك موجودة في مكان آخر. ومن الجوانب الغريبة في عملية السرقة أنه تم تتبع الأموال الافتراضية المسروقة عبر الإنترنت، لأن المعاملات المتعلقة ببيتكوين وغيرها من العملات المشفرة هي عامة جميعًا. وهكذا تم تتبع المبلغ البالغ 530 مليون دولار في النهاية إلى 11 عنوانًا محددًا؛ لكن هويات الأشخاص الذين أرسلوا واستلموا المال للأسف ظلت مجهولة. فعلاً، لم تتم مُلاحَقة أحد حتى الآن، ولكن مُطوري NEM تمكنوا من تسمية العناوين الـ 11 ب"},{"prompt":"A comida parecia não ter gosto para Samanun naquela noite.

A princípio, ela sentia uma atração inexplicável por ele, mas sabia que qualquer envolvimento seria inapropriado. Apesar de todos os seus esforços para manter a distância e agir profissionalmente, viu-se enlaçada por seus olhos intensos e palavras sedutoras. O príncipe era habilidoso em despertar seus desejos, fazendo-a questionar constantemente as barreiras impostas pela sociedade. No entanto, Samanun era uma mulher de princípios e honra. Sabia que não podia ceder às tentações, principalmente considerando a posição privilegiada do príncipe e a reputação que ambos tinham que preservar. Afinal, um relacionamento secreto poderia colocar em risco não só suas carreiras, mas também a estabilidade do reino.

Préparation à la consultation prénatale : Avant la consultation prénatale, il est important de recueillir toutes les informations médicales pertinentes sur la future mère, y compris son historique médical, les antécédents familiaux, les résultats des tests de laboratoire et d\'imagerie, etc. Une fois ces informations rassemblées, le personnel médical peut se préparer à donner les meilleurs conseils et soins possibles. 2. Consultation prénatale : La consultation prénatale consiste en une série de rendez-vous réguliers entre la future mère et son médecin ou sa sage-femme. Ces consultations visent à surveiller le développement du fœtus, à évaluer la santé générale de la mère et à fournir des conseils et des conseils sur la grossesse, l\'accouchement et les soins prénatals. 3. Suivi médical : Pendant la grossesse, la future mère peut avoir besoin de consulter différents spécialistes médicaux en fonction de ses besoins spécifiques. Cela peut inclure des consultations avec des spécialistes en génétique, en nutrition, en cardiologie, etc. Le suivi médical vise à s\'assurer que la mère et le fœtus reçoivent les soins appropriés tout au long de la grossesse. 4. Préparation à l\'accouchement : À mesure que la date d\'accouchement approche, la future mère sera préparée à l\'accouchement, à la fois sur le plan physique et émotionnel. Cela peut inclure des cours de préparation à l\'accouchement, des séances d\'information sur le processus d\'accouchement, des discussions sur les choix de gestion de la douleur, etc. 5. Accouchement des nouveaux-nés : Lorsque la femme entre en travail, elle est admise à l\'hôpital pour l\'accouchement. Le personnel médical surveillera les signes vitaux de la mère et du bébé, surveillera les contractions, fournira un soutien émotionnel et physique à la mère et supervisera le processus d\'accouchement. En cas de complications, une équipe médicale spécialisée peut être appelée en renfort. 6. Soins post-accouchement : Une fois le bébé né, la mère recevra des soins post-accouchement pour s\'assurer qu\'elle récupère correctement. Cela peut inclure des soins de plaie, des conseils sur l\'allaitement maternel, des visites de suivi, etc. Le bébé sera également pris en charge par le personnel médical, qui effectuera des examens physiques initiaux, des tests de dépistage et fournira des conseils sur les soins du nouveau-né. 7. Sortie de l\'hôpital et suivi à long terme : Une fois que la mère et le bébé sont jugés en bonne santé, ils sont autorisés à quitter l\'hôpital. Des rendez-vous de suivi seront planifiés pour surveiller la santé de la mère et du bébé à long terme, et pour fournir des conseils et des soins supplémentaires si nécessaire. Il est important de noter que chaque système hospitalier peut avoir ses propres variantes et particularités dans le processus de consultation prénatal à l\'accouchement des nouveaux-nés.

Peço que se baseie nesse trecho para continuar a historia: Ela estava subindo pelas paredes de tanta saudade e desejo contido, mas Samanun não estava ajudando. Parecia que algo a impedia de seguir com as intenções da alteza, sempre se esquivando no momento certo. Tipo agora. Elas estavam em um jantar no palácio, com algumas figuras da corte ali presentes. No momento, Samanun tentava se manter concentrada na refeição da sua frente para fugir dos olhares lascivos que a alteza lhe lançava do outro lado da mesa.","completion":"O jantar real estava ocorrendo em meio a uma decoração suntuosa e uma atmosfera de elegância. As figuras da corte conversavam animadamente, enquanto a comida era servida em pratos de porcelana finamente decorados. No entanto, o clima entre Samanun, a segurança do palácio, e a alteza Kornkamon era bem diferente do restante dos convidados. Samanun, uma mulher de personalidade forte e postura impecável, estava determinada a não ceder às investidas da alteza durante o jantar. Ela sabia que qualquer brecha poderia ser perigosa para sua reputação e, principalmente, para sua posição como segurança real. Portanto, mesmo sentindo-se cada vez mais desejosa, mantinha seu olhar fixo na comida, evitando qualquer contato visual com a alteza. Kornkamon, por sua vez, era uma figura respeitada e admirada por seu reinado justo e benevolente. No entanto, ela escondia um desejo intenso por Samanun, uma atração que a deixava inquieta toda vez que se aproximavam. Portanto, durante o jantar, lá estava ela, lançando discretos olhares cheios de segundas intenções para a segurança, tentando incendiar a paixão que queimava em seu coração. Enquanto isso, os convidados permaneciam alheios a esse jogo de sedução que acontecia à mesa. Os risos e as conversas preenchiam o ambiente, mascarando os suspiros e as trocas de olhares intensos entre as duas mulheres. Cada gesto de Samanun era cuidadosamente calculado para evitar qualquer ambiguidade, mas o desejo contido era quase palpável, transformando o jantar em um verdadeiro desafio para ambas. Porém, em dado momento, Kornkamon, não resistindo mais ao magnetismo que emanava de Samanun, decidiu arriscar-se. Tomando coragem, a alteza desviou sua atenção para a sobremesa e lançou um olhar penetrante para a segurança. Samanun sentiu o coração acelerar e o sangue pulsar em suas veias quando percebeu que a alteza proporia um encontro depois do jantar, um encontro além das obrigações reais. Antes que a segurança pudesse responder, um comandante da guarda real se aproximou da mesa, interrompendo o momento de tensão. Ele trazia uma notícia urgente sobre uma ameaça iminente ao reino. Samanun e Kornkamon foram puxadas de volta à realidade, deixando suas palavras inacabadas e suas segundas intenções congeladas no ar. Enquanto o comandante explicava a situação, Samanun ignorou o olhar inquisitivo da alteza e focou em seu dever como segurança. O jantar real, que poderia ter sido o palco para o início de um momento íntimo entre as duas, se transformou em um episódio frustrante em meio às responsabilidades do palácio. No final, o encontro nunca aconteceu. Samanun continuou a proteger o reino com dedicação, e Kornkamon manteve sua posição como uma líder justa e respeitada. No entanto, o desejo entre elas permaneceu, ecoando nas noites solitárias e nos olhares carregados de promessas não cumpridas. Talvez, um dia, as segundas intenções se transformassem em primeiras e a paixão que ardia entre elas pudesse ser finalmente vivida sem restrições."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Buckley Jr. was a prominent conservative intellectual and founder of the conservative magazine National Review. His political philosophy can be described as traditional conservatism or fusionism. Buckley believed in limited government intervention, free-market capitalism, and individual liberty. He advocated for a strong national defense and was a staunch anti-communist during the Cold War. He supported traditional moral values and was opposed to cultural liberalism, advocating for strong moral and religious foundations in society. Buckley emphasized the importance of preserving and conserving traditional institutions, such as family, religion, and private property. He opposed excessive government regulations and believed in the power of free markets to drive economic growth and innovation. Additionally, Buckley was known for his eloquent and intellectual approach to conservatism, advocating for open and substantive debates. He valued intellectual conservatism and arguing ideas based on reason and logic. It is worth noting that political philosophies are complex, and individuals may hold a wide range of views within a certain framework. Buckley\'s views evolved over time and he engaged in nuanced discussions, making it difficult to fully encapsulate his philosophy in a brief explanation."},{"prompt":"more detail","completion":"In order to provide a more detailed understanding of William F. Buckley Jr.\'s political philosophy, it is important to delve into several key aspects: Limited Government: Buckley strongly believed in limited government intervention in the economy and society. He advocated for reducing the size and scope of government, as he believed it would lead to individual freedoms, economic prosperity, and innovation. He opposed excessive government regulations, high tax rates, and what he perceived as governmental overreach into private lives. Free Market Capitalism: Buckley was a staunch advocate of free-market principles. He believed that the free market, driven by competition and individuals pursuing their own self-interest, was the most efficient and fair system for economic growth. He argued against government intervention in markets, such as price controls, tariffs, and strong labor unions, as he believed they hindered economic progress and individual freedom. Traditional Values and Social Conservatism: Buckley was a strong supporter of traditional moral values and social conservatism. He often criticized what he saw as the erosion of traditional institutions, including family, religion, and cultural norms. He opposed the countercultural movements of the 1960s and the resulting cultural changes, including the rise of drug use, free love, and liberal social policies. Buckley advocated for a return to strong moral and religious foundations in society. National Defense and Anti-Communism: Buckley was a fervent anti-communist. During the Cold War, he believed in the necessity of a strong national defense to combat the spread of communism and promote American values abroad. He supported a robust military, strong intelligence agencies, and interventions to prevent the spread of communism, such as the Vietnam War. Intellectual Conservatism and Debate: One of Buckley\'s significant contributions to conservatism was his emphasis on intellectual rigor and substantive debate. He believed that conservative ideas should be argued based on reason, logic, and evidence, rather than relying solely on emotional or ideological appeals. He founded the magazine National Review as a platform for conservative writers and thinkers to engage in thoughtful debates and articulate conservative principles. While these are some of the core aspects of William F. Buckley Jr.\'s political philosophy, it is important to understand that his views evolved, and he engaged in nuanced discussions with various intellectuals and public figures throughout his career. His philosophy was not static, and he expressed a willingness to adapt his views based on new information and intellectual exchange."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

According to the theory, rather than relying solely on general-purpose reasoning or complex computations, individuals employ a set of heuristics, rules of thumb, or simplified strategies that serve as cognitive shortcuts to make quick and effective judgments. These heuristics are seen as adaptive because they are shaped by evolutionary pressures and are well-suited to the specific challenges encountered in particular environments. The Adaptive Toolbox Theory emphasizes the idea that humans do not possess a single, universal method of reasoning, but instead, have evolved to utilize diverse cognitive mechanisms to tackle different types of problems."},{"prompt":"What is bounded rationality? How does adaptive toolbox relate to the concept of bounded rationality?","completion":"Bounded rationality refers to the limited cognitive capabilities of humans to process and analyze information when making decisions. It suggests that individuals, due to their cognitive limitations, are not always able to gather and evaluate all available information or consider every possible alternative when making decisions. In other words, individuals often make decisions that are \\"good enough\\" rather than optimal. The concept of bounded rationality is closely related to Gerd Gigerenzer\'s Adaptive Toolbox Theory. According to the theory, humans use a set of simplified decision-making strategies, or heuristics, that allow them to navigate complex environments and make reasonably good decisions with limited information. These heuristics are considered adaptive because they help individuals arrive at adequate decisions within the constraints of their cognitive abilities, time limitations, and resource limitations. In both bounded rationality and the Adaptive Toolbox Theory, the focus is on acknowledging and understanding the cognitive limitations of decision-makers and providing insights into how individuals effectively make decisions in the face of those limitations. The Adaptive Toolbox Theory provides a framework for understanding the diverse set of heuristics that individuals employ, while bounded rationality highlights the idea that decisions are often made under conditions of limited information and cognitive resources."},{"prompt":"Re-phrase and improve: \\"The concept of bounded rationality refers to the limited cognitive capabilities of humans to process and analyse information when making decisions (Simon, 1974).

Mayor capacidad de carga: El sistema trifásico permite transportar y distribuir más potencia que el sistema monofásico. Esto se debe a que la potencia total en un sistema trifásico es la suma de las potencias en cada una de las fases, mientras que en un sistema monofásico la potencia total es la potencia en una sola fase. 2. Menor corriente: Debido a la forma en que se distribuye la carga en un sistema trifásico, la corriente que circula por cada fase es menor que la corriente en un sistema monofásico para la misma potencia. Esto reduce las pérdidas eléctricas y la sección de los conductores necesarios, lo que a su vez reduce los costos de instalación y mantenimiento. 3. Mayor eficiencia: El uso de un sistema trifásico permite una mejor utilización de los transformadores y motores eléctricos, ya que éstos pueden ser diseñados de manera más eficiente para operar en la frecuencia y voltaje trifásico. Esto resulta en un menor consumo de energía y una mayor vida útil de los equipos. 4. Mayor estabilidad de voltaje: En un sistema trifásico, las fases están desfasadas entre sí en 120 grados, lo que significa que en cada momento siempre hay una fase proporcionando voltaje. Esto resulta en un voltaje más constante y estable en comparación con un sistema monofásico, donde solo hay una fase que proporciona voltaje. En resumen, el uso de un sistema trifásico en los sistemas eléctricos proporciona una mayor capacidad de carga, una menor corriente, una mayor eficiencia y una mayor estabilidad de voltaje. Estas ventajas hacen que el sistema trifásico sea ampliamente utilizado en la mayoría de las aplicaciones industriales y comerciales."},{"prompt":"Tipos de conexiones trifasicas","completion":"Existen diferentes tipos de conexiones trifásicas utilizadas en sistemas eléctricos. A continuación se mencionan los tres tipos más comunes: 1. Conexión en estrella (Y): En esta configuración, los extremos de las tres bobinas o fases se conectan en un punto común llamado neutro y las otras extremidades van conectadas a la fuente de energía o carga. Es representada por la letra Y. Esta conexión se utiliza comúnmente en sistemas de distribución de energía eléctrica. 2. Conexión en triángulo (Δ): En esta configuración, el extremo de cada fase se conecta con el inicio de la siguiente fase y así sucesivamente hasta formar un lazo cerrado en forma de triángulo. Esta conexión no tiene punto neutro y se utiliza en sistemas de alimentación y control de motores, donde se requiere un alto torque inicial. 3. Conexión mixta (Y-Δ): Esta configuración combina las conexiones en estrella y en triángulo. Se utiliza cuando se necesita utilizar tanto voltajes bajos como altos, manteniendo una flexibilidad en la distribución de la energía. Una de las bobinas se conecta en estrella y las otras dos se conectan en triángulo. Estos son los tipos básicos de conexiones trifásicas, aunque existen otras variantes como la conexión en puente, la conexión delta cerrada y la conexión doble estrella, que se utilizan en aplicaciones específicas. La selección del tipo de conexión trifásica depende de las necesidades de la aplicación y las características del sistema eléctrico en el que se va a utilizar."},{"prompt":"Sakura Kasugano (athletic shorts) and Karin Kanzuki (athletic shorts) fuse with potara earrings; complete in-depth description of name, attire, personality, fighting techniques, and fusion process; extremely detailed overview of combined body parts and physique from head to toe","completion":"Fusion Name: Sakarin Kasauguki Attire: Sakarin Kasauguki\'s attire combines elements from both Sakura Kasugano and Karin Kanzuki\'s original outfits.

Here\'s an explanation of compound interest: Compound interest is interest that is calculated on the initial principal amount as well as any accumulated interest from previous periods. In other words, it\'s interest on interest. Over time, this can lead to significant growth in the value of an investment. For example, let\'s say you have 1000 in a savings account earning 5% interest per year. After one year, your account balance would be 1050. But if you leave that 50 in the account and continue to earn 5% interest on it each year, your account balance would grow even more. After two years, your account balance would be 1102.50. After three years, it would be 1157.63. This is because the interest earned each year is added to the principal, which then earns more interest the following year. Compound interest is beneficial for investors because it allows their money to grow faster than simple interest, which is calculated only on the initial principal amount. It\'s also a powerful tool for saving and investing for long-term goals, such as retirement."},{"prompt":"Create a JavaScript program that prompts the user to input the values of the three sides of a triangle, and then calculates and outputs the area of the triangle using the following formula:","completion":"// Prompt user for input of triangle sides let sideA = parseFloat(prompt(\\"Enter the value of side A:\\")); let sideB = parseFloat(prompt(\\"Enter the value of side B:\\")); let sideC = parseFloat(prompt(\\"Enter the value of side C:\\")); // Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle let semiPerimeter = (sideA + sideB + sideC) / 2; // Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron\'s formula let area = Math.sqrt(semiPerimeter * (semiPerimeter - sideA) * (semiPerimeter - sideB) * (semiPerimeter - sideC)); // Output the area of the triangle console.log(`The area of the triangle with sides {sideA}, {sideB}, {sideC} is {area}.`);"},{"prompt":"This is great! could you please add a brief explanation of what Heron\'s formula is?","completion":"Certainly!

She spent her nights lost in her thoughts, imagining faraway lands and distant cultures. She would wake up each morning with a strong urge to explore the world, but the reality was always too far from her grasp. In her early twenties, however, she decided to take a leap of faith and make her dreams a reality. She saved up for months, quit her routine job, and finally set out to explore the world. Her first stop was the magical country of Japan. As Alice stepped off the plane in Tokyo, she was hit by a wave of foreign smells, sounds, and sights. The bright neon lights, the bustling crowds, and the hum of a language she didn\'t understand left her feeling overwhelmed. Nevertheless, excitement bubbled within her as she took her first steps into the city. Navigating the streets proved difficult, with every signpost reading in Japanese characters, and every person she asked for help seemed to speak little, if any, English. Alice tried to stay positive, she had anticipated this would happen, and had been preparing with a translation app on her phone. However, the tourist-packed streets made it difficult for her to find an opportunity to use her phone, and her attempts to communicate with the locals were often met with puzzled looks and a polite shake of the head. She was entirely alone in a foreign country, and the weight of that reality left her feeling isolated and drained. Alice decided to retreat to her hotel in hopes of finding some peace of mind. As she walked through the bustling streets, she noticed small cultural differences such as groups of people bowing to one another, street food vendors serving dishes with ingredients she\'d never heard of, and the sound of a traditional instrument being played on the street corner. Despite feeling anxious at times, Alice couldn\'t help but feel charmed by the culture and how different everything was. The hotel room, too, presented a whole new world of cultural differences. The toilet seat, for example, was heated and played music, and the shower had about a dozen different dials and settings that left her feeling confused. But as she rinsed away her worries, she noticed how the ordinary things she took for granted back home, like a hot shower, could feel so exotic and different in an unfamiliar place. The following day, Alice planned to take a train to Kyoto, known for its ancient temples and remarkable landscapes. However, navigating the train station provided its own new set of challenges. With nobody to guide her and no announcements in English, Alice had to rely on her wits, which led to a few wrong turns and a lot of confusion. Nevertheless, the train ride itself was another experience to add to Alice’s bucket list - the scenery outside the window moved like a painting coming to life, and the Japanese people around her seemed to be content and unaffected by the language barrier. In Kyoto, Alice found herself in a quaint neighborhood reminiscent of a 17th-century Japan. The smell of incense filled the air and the quaint main street was crowded with people wearing traditional kimonos. Alice couldn\'t help but feel like she had time-traveled to a different era. The red temples and Zen gardens alongside the walls of the riverbank were breathtaking. For the first time since she arrived, Alice felt a sense of calm wash over her. It was as if the vibe of the city allowed her to take a break from her worries. As she wandered the narrow pedestrian streets, she stumbled upon a tea house that looked taken straight from a fairytale. The owner spoke limited English but welcomed her inside and served her what seemed to be the thickest matcha tea she had ever tasted. Along with it she was given a mysterious sweet treat, which was supposed to balance the bitterness of the tea. She had seen it before in online videos on Japan; this was a traditional tea ceremony. Alice was a bit confused at first, not understanding the customs of the ceremony, but she soon realized that the significance was in who she was sharing the moment with. Sitting beside the owner, enjoying a cup of tea in near silence, created an intimacy and connection with the person that seemed to transcend the language barrier. Leaving the tea house that afternoon, Alice realized that she no longer felt alone. She had experienced so much, spoken to so many strangers without fully understanding what was being said, yet still felt connected to the culture she was experiencing. Reflecting on the journey, Alice realized how she had come to appreciate her own company more than ever, building the confidence that came with the celebrated journey to a new place by herself. She had immersed herself so entirely in unfamiliar territory, with only her own company for guidance, finding that magic and excitement and a sense of self discovery was waiting for her if she only dared to take the plunge. In the end, the language barrier had become a barrier that taught her to listen carefully, watch attentively, and connect with other human beings on a level that transcended spoken words. And that, in and of itself, was an experience that she would never"},{"prompt":"Hey, that was a great short story! I really enjoyed it. Can you add more sensory details to the story to help me picture the Japanese culture better?","completion":"Sure, I would love to. Here are some additional sensory details that can help you imagine the Japanese culture better: - In Tokyo, Alice noticed that the air was filled with the delicious smell of street food being cooked in small stalls. The aroma of ramen soup, fried dumplings, and grilled chicken skewers beckoned her. - As she walked through the quiet Kyoto streets, Alice could hear the sound of water flowing gently in the small streams that ran through the center of the city. The sound of ancient wind chimes hanging from temples combined with the sound of rushing water filled her with a sense of serenity. - The tea house that Alice visited in Kyoto had tatami floors, made out of woven grass, that felt soft and spongy under her feet. She could hear the sound of wooden chopsticks clicked together as the owner of the tea house prepared the matcha tea. - The streets of Kyoto were decorated with colorful paper lanterns that bore calligraphy in Japanese characters. Alice noticed that the lanterns cast a warm and welcoming light over the streets at night. - Japanese traditional kimonos were everywhere, and Alice found herself admiring the delicate embroidery and rich colors, that decorated them. She couldn\'t help but notice how elegant the traditional dress looked as the women moved through the crowds. - In the tea ceremony room, Alice could smell the sweet aroma of freshly brewed matcha tea. The room was scented with incense, which helped to create an atmosphere of tranquility and peacefulness."},{"prompt":"These sensory details are great! Can you tell me more about the traditional kimonos? I\'d love to know about the different colors and patterns they come in.","completion":"Sure, I\'d be happy to share more about traditional kimonos! Traditional Japanese kimonos are timeless and come in a variety of colors and patterns. They are made of silk or other fine materials, and they are usually very expensive. A kimono is often passed down through generations as it is seen as a valuable family heirloom. Kimonos are typically long and feature wide sleeves, and they are wrapped around the body with a wide belt known as an obi. The sleeves, known as \\"furisode,\\" are especially long and are considered the most formal type of kimono. They are often worn by unmarried women for special occasions like weddings, and they come in a wide array of bright and vibrant colors. Another type of kimono is the \\"tomesode,\\" which is worn by married women. They are more conservative than furisode, and they usually feature subtle patterns with black or dark blue as the primary color.

It was a perfect day for young boys and girls to explore the outdoors, and for the inhabitants of the village to go about their daily lives. But for one young boy, the day would hold a great surprise, one that would change his life forever. As he walked through the grassy meadows, kicking up dust and daydreaming about the possibilities of adventure, the boy noticed something strange. A faint whisper in the wind, a rustle in the bushes. He followed the sound and found himself standing before an old tree, its branches twisted and knotted like an ancient hand reaching up from the earth. There was something peculiar about this tree that drew him closer, as if he could sense a palpable energy pulsating from it. As he got closer, he saw something that made his heart skip a beat. A small rune had been inscribed into the bark, ancient symbols carved into the aged wood. With a sense of curiosity, he traced his fingers over the symbol, feeling a rush of energy coursing through him. In that moment, the boy realized that he was not just any ordinary boy. He was a warlock. He now had the power to wield magic, to manipulate the very elements themselves. With newfound excitement coursing through his veins, the boy set out on a journey of discovery, seeking out the knowledge and skills needed to master his abilities. As he wandered through the land, he encountered many dangers and obstacles, but nothing could dim his newfound sense of excitement and wonder at the possibilities of magic. The first obstacle he faced was the challenge of finding a mentor. He knew that he could not master his abilities alone, and so he began searching for someone with knowledge of magic. He wandered from town to town, seeking out the wise individuals who may have the knowledge he needed. But after months of searching, he found nothing but false leads, charlatans who claimed to be warlocks but refused to teach him the secrets of the trade. But just as he resolved to give up hope, he stumbled upon a wizard of great renown, a man who claimed to be able to teach him everything he needed to know about magic. The wizard\'s name was Arin, and he was a wise and powerful wizard with many years of experience. He agreed to take the boy under his wing, and teach him the ways of the warlock. Despite his enthusiasm, the boy found the lessons to be rigorous and difficult. The study of magic was not something that could be easily grasped, and he spent many hours laboring over the spells and incantations that Arin taught him. But just as he felt himself growing more and more frustrated, he began to see the power of his abilities manifesting. The energy he could channel through his body was incredible, and he felt that he was on the cusp of mastering his newfound control over the elements. With his newly acquired powers, the boy set out once again into the world of adventure, seeking out new challenges and obstacles to overcome. One day, as he wandered through a dense forest, he encountered a group of dangerous beasts. They were unlike anything he had ever seen before, with skin as hard as steel and fangs as long as his arm. With his magic at his fingertips, the boy fought valiantly against the creatures, utilizing spells and incantations to conjure powerful attacks and hurl them at his foes. Though the beasts were fearsome, the boy was empowered by his newfound abilities, and he decimated them one by one. As he emerged victorious over his adversaries, the boy felt a sense of pride and accomplishment that he had never before experienced. He realized that the power of magic was both great and terrible, and that he would have to learn to wield it wisely if he was to survive in this world of danger and mystery. But the boy knew that he had only just begun to tap into the depth of his abilities. With the knowledge he had gained from Arin, he felt that he could take on anything that the world could throw his way. And so he set out once again, ready to face whatever challenges lay before him, his heart filled with the wonder and excitement of a young warlock, eager to explore the mysteries of the magical world."},{"prompt":"Wow, that\'s an amazing story! I love how the young boy discovers his powers and overcomes obstacles. Can you add more details about the magical creatures he encounters on his journey?","completion":"As the young warlock continued his journey, he encountered an array of magical creatures that he had never seen before. Some were friendly and eager to greet him, while others were dangerous and posed a threat to his life. One day, as he wandered through a dense forest, he stumbled upon a group of fairies. They were small, delicate creatures, with wings that glittered in the sunlight. Their voices were like music to the warlock\'s ears, and he felt himself drawn to their beauty and grace. As he approached the fairies, they welcomed him with open arms, eager to show him the wonders of their world. They led him through the forest, showing him the sparkling pools and hidden groves that were the dwelling places of their kind. But not all creatures the young warlock encountered were as friendly as the fairies. On another occasion, he found himself face to face with a dragon. This was no ordinary dragon, but a fierce creature with scales as black as night and eyes that glowed with an inner fire. It was one of the most powerful creatures he had ever encountered, and even with his magic, he knew that he would have to fight with all his might to defeat it. The fight was long and brutal, with the dragon hurling fireballs and fangs at the young warlock. But with his magic at his fingertips, the boy was able to combat the dragon and force it to yield to his will. Despite the danger that these creatures posed, the young warlock relished in the excitement of discovering new magical beings. Each encounter provided him with greater insight into the world of magic and further inspired him to hone his abilities. As he grew in strength and knowledge, the young warlock began to realize that he could use his powers not just to combat these creatures but to help those in need. He started using his power to assist the weak and defend the innocent. He became almost a legend in the area where he lived, a defender of those who could not defend themselves, and a powerful warlock who could harness the power of magic to do good. But despite all his accomplishments, the young warlock knew that his journey was far from over. Many obstacles awaited him, many creatures yet to be discovered. But with his magic at his fingertips, he felt confident that he could face any challenge that came his way. As he continued on his journey, he felt a sense of wonder and excitement that he had never felt before. The world of magic was full of infinite possibilities, and he knew that he was only just beginning to scratch the surface."},{"prompt":"Please provide a thorough explanation of what reactive systems are and the advantages they offer in terms of ensuring a software system can scale effectively over time. Your response should include detailed examples and use specific terminology where applicable. Additionally, it would be helpful to explain how reactive systems differ from other approaches to building software systems and why they are increasingly popular among developers today.","completion":"Reactive systems are a type of system architecture that is designed to be highly responsive and resilient in the face of changing or uncertain conditions. These systems are typically composed of a set of independent, parallel components that communicate via message passing, rather than the more traditional approach of a single, monolithic program running on a single processor. One of the key advantages of reactive systems is that they are highly scalable, making it possible to add additional processing power or resources on the fly as needed. This is because reactive systems are designed to be highly modular and distributed, with each component handling only a small, well-defined portion of the overall functionality. For example, consider a typical e-commerce platform that needs to process a large number of transactions in real-time. A reactive system might divide the processing workload into smaller, more granular components, each of which is responsible for handling a specific piece of functionality (e.g. Payment processing, inventory management, shipping logistics, etc.). These components could then be deployed across a distributed system, with each component running on its own processor or server. This would make it possible to add additional capacity by simply adding more servers or processors to the system, without having to worry about re-writing or re-architecting the entire system. In addition to scalability, reactive systems offer a number of other advantages over more traditional approaches to building software systems. For one, they are highly fault-tolerant, with each component designed to handle errors and failures gracefully, either by retrying the operation or failing over to a backup component. This makes it possible to build systems that are highly available and reliable, even in the face of hardware or software failures. Another advantage of reactive systems is that they are highly adaptable, making it easy to add new functionality or change the underlying architecture without disrupting the existing system. This is because each component is designed to be independent and self-contained, with well-defined interfaces that make it easy to add new functionality or replace existing components without affecting the rest of the system. Overall, reactive systems are becoming increasingly popular among developers today because they offer a powerful combination of scalability, fault-tolerance, and adaptability, making it possible to build highly responsive and reliable systems that can handle a wide range of workloads and operating conditions."},{"prompt":"Can you provide more detailed examples of how reactive systems handle errors and failures gracefully?","completion":"Sure! One way that reactive systems handle errors and failures is through the use of so-called \\"circuit breaker\\" patterns. The idea here is to detect when a component is failing or experiencing performance issues and to route traffic away from that component until it recovers or is replaced. For example, suppose we have a reactive system that consists of four components, each responsible for handling a specific type of request. If one of these components experiences a failure or starts responding slowly, the system can detect this and start routing traffic away from that component to the other three components that are still functioning correctly. This helps to reduce the load on the failing component and prevent it from becoming overloaded or crashing altogether. Another way that reactive systems handle errors is through the use of \\"backpressure\\" mechanisms. These mechanisms essentially allow components to tell upstream components to slow down or reduce the rate at which they are sending requests or data. For example, suppose we have a reactive system that is processing a large number of incoming requests. If one of the downstream components is taking longer than expected to process these requests, it can send a backpressure signal to the upstream components, telling them to slow down and reduce the rate at which they are sending requests. This helps to prevent the downstream component from becoming overloaded and ensures that the system as a whole remains highly responsive. These are just a few examples of the many ways that reactive systems can handle errors and failures gracefully. The key idea is to build highly fault-tolerant systems that can withstand a wide range of adverse conditions and continue to function reliably even in the face of frequent failures or disruptions."},{"prompt":"This is great! Could you please provide some real-life examples of companies or industries that have successfully implemented reactive systems to improve their scalability and reliability?","completion":"Certainly! There are many companies and industries that have successfully implemented reactive systems to improve their scalability and reliability. Here are a few examples: 1. Netflix: Netflix is widely regarded as a pioneer in the use of reactive systems. Their streaming platform is built on top of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) that uses microservices and message-passing to achieve high scalability and resilience. This approach has allowed Netflix to handle massive amounts of traffic and provide a seamless user experience, even during peak loads. 2. Uber: Uber is another company that has successfully implemented reactive systems to improve their platform\'s resilience and reliability. Their platform uses a combination of microservices, distributed systems, and real-time data processing to handle millions of rides and transactions every day. The reactive approach allows Uber to add new features and services quickly and efficiently, without impacting the overall platform\'s performance or reliability. 3. Capital One: Capital One, a U.S.-based financial services company, implemented a reactive approach to improve their credit card transaction processing system. By using microservices, message-passing, and other reactive techniques, they were able to significantly improve their system\'s scalability and performance, while also reducing downtime and improving customer satisfaction. 4. Healthcare: The healthcare industry is also embracing reactive systems to improve patient care and outcomes. For example, systems that use wearable devices to monitor patient health in real-time can use reactive techniques to respond quickly to changes in patient conditions and provide timely interventions. This can lead to improved outcomes and better patient experiences. These are just a few examples of the many industries and companies that have successfully implemented reactive systems to improve their scalability and reliability. The reactive approach has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ability to handle complex and dynamic workloads, its resilience in the face of failures and disruptions, and its ability to support fast-moving, agile development processes."},{"prompt":"Write a narrative about a character who gets lost in an endless cornfield.","completion":"Emily was driving home from her friend\'s birthday party when she noticed she was running low on gas.

Include vivid descriptions of the surroundings, the people of the society and their way of life, and the protagonist\'s reactions to the discovery. Make sure to add an element of suspense and mystery to the story to keep the reader engaged until the very end.","completion":"As he trudged through the thick foliage of the remote jungle, the sun blazing down upon his skin, the male traveler felt the weight of the backpack on his shoulders. He\'d been hiking for days, trying to lose his troubles in the beauty of nature. But things were about to take a turn. One misstep, and he stumbled upon a hidden society unlike anything he had ever seen. The closest he could describe the place was a cross between a shire from The Lord of the Rings, and a secret society from a Dan Brown novel. It had all the secrecy and hidden beauty, minus the religious overtones. The people of the society were all small in stature with pointed ears, a feature the traveler thought only existed in fiction. They had bright eyes that sparkled like jewels and serene expressions. All of them appeared to be deep in concentration, like they were meditating or practicing some kind of mystic ritual. At first, the man thought he had stumbled upon a lost civilization, but as he took a closer look, he realized that the society had access to modern technology. They had Wi-Fi, smartphones, and electricity, yet they lived in isolation in their secret haven. The male traveler\'s mind reeled with questions, and his heart pounded in his chest with excitement. He wanted to learn more about this place, but he also feared what would happen if he was caught sneaking around their territory. The man decided to leave and return to his natural hiking trail, but in doing so, he felt a pull towards the society. What was its purpose? What dark secrets did it have hidden? He wanted to find out more. Days turned to weeks, and the male traveler kept thinking about the secret society he found, until it consumed his thoughts. He wanted to go back and explore, to learn more about the people and their way of life. Finally, his curiosity got the better of him, and he returned to the hidden society. There, he was welcomed by the residents who were eager to show him around their land. They taught him about their culture, their traditions, and the mystical energy that permeated their home. As he explored the secrets behind every corner, he realized that he had stumbled upon one of the most beautiful, complex, and awe-inspiring societies on Earth, and was grateful that he followed his gut to find it."},{"prompt":"That was an interesting narrative! Can you add some more details about the mystical energy that permeated the society and the protagonist\'s reaction to it?","completion":"Certainly! As the male traveler explored the hidden society further, he began to notice something unusual. Everywhere he went, he felt a mystical energy in the air, a feeling of tranquility and harmony with the environment that he had never experienced before. He could sense the energy emanating from the trees, the waterfalls, and even the air itself. It was as if the very fabric of reality was alive and pulsating with a sublime energy. The society\'s inhabitants told him that they believed their land was blessed by the ancient spirits of nature, and that by living in harmony with their environment, they could tap into an energy source that was both healing and transformative. They showed him how to meditate and channel the energy through his body. As the male traveler sat among the trees, he felt a sense of inner peace and tranquility that he had never felt before. The energy coursed through his veins, washing away all his worries and fears. He felt a strong connection to the world around him, as if he was part of a greater whole, one that was vast, eternal and powerful. The traveler was amazed by what he saw and felt in the hidden society. It was a place that was both magical and mysterious, full of secrets and wonders that he had never imagined. He felt honored to have discovered it and grateful for the opportunity to learn from its inhabitants. In the end, the male traveler left the society, but he took with him the memory of the mystical energy that had touched his soul. He felt transformed by what he had experienced and knew that he would always carry the secrets he had learned in his heart."},{"prompt":"The narrative you wrote is intriguing. Can you tell me more about the society\'s rituals and traditions?","completion":"Certainly! As the male traveler explored the hidden society more deeply, he became fascinated by the rituals and traditions of its inhabitants. He saw them perform a variety of unique practices, all of which seemed intimately tied to the natural world around them. One of the most striking rituals he observed involved the society\'s waterfalls. Every day, just before dawn, a group of inhabitants would gather near the falls and perform an intricate dance, accompanied by the soothing sounds of the rushing water. The travelers saw that this ritual was central to the society\'s spiritual practices and was believed to keep the waterfalls\' rejuvenating energies flowing. Another ritual that fascinated the traveler involved the society\'s trees. He witnessed inhabitants performing a ritual that involved singing to the trees and carefully massaging their roots. The society believed that this practice kept the trees alive and healthy and allowed them to communicate with the spirits of the forests. The traveler also saw that the society had a deep reverence for animals. They believed that all living things were connected and that by respecting and honoring other creatures, they were respecting and honoring themselves. The society observed this belief by not harming animals, and by performing a ritual every new moon to honor the spirits of the animals. The traveler was deeply moved by the society\'s rituals and traditions, all of which seemed to celebrate the beauty and interconnectedness of the natural world. He realized that these practices were deeply spiritual, and that they revealed a society that was complex and deeply in tune with the environment around them."},{"prompt":"Mystery continues to surround the publication of Morrissey\'s autobiography as the unpredictable former frontman of The Smiths used his True-To-You fansite to put out a statement claiming that Penguin UK \\"remain determined to publish within the next few weeks\\". It followed the claim last week that his publishing deal had collapsed due to \\"a last-minute content disagreement\\". The website, which is run from the US but has close links with the singer, said: \\"The publication of Morrissey\'s Autobiography remains with Penguin Books. This is a deal for the UK and Europe, but Morrissey has no contract with a publisher for the US or any other territory. \\"As of 13 September, Morrissey and Penguin (UK) remain determined to publish within the next few weeks.\\" The story was picked up by the New Musical Express, which said Penguin itself had said it was about to publish. However, the claim has caused bemusement in book trade circles. The brouhaha that would usually accompany such a hotly-anticipated autobiography has been noticeable by its absence; there has been no pre-publication publicity material, no review copies, and as yet, no distribution of printed copies to bookshops. Staff at Waterstones, the UK\'s largest high street chain, have heard nothing about the book. More baffling still, there is no record of a book deal between Moz and Penguin UK ever having been signed. Morrissey first began hawking his autobiography in 2011, when he told BBC Radio 4\'s Front Row that he had written a 660-page book, saying: \\"I\'m really not that interesting, so I don\'t know why I\'ve written so much.\\" He said he hoped to publish it as a Penguin Classic. Penguin\'s Modern Classics was started in 1961 by an editor who believed that contemporary works could measure up to more time-honoured tomes. As Morrissey may have noted, the imprint is reserved for books that have \\"caused scandal and political change, inspired great films, and broken down barriers, whether social, sexual, or in the case of Ulysses, the boundaries of language itself\\". It counts among its output F Scott Fitzgerald\'s The Great Gatsby, Jack Kerouac\'s On the Road, Orwell\'s Nineteen Eighty-Four and Steinbeck\'s The Grapes of Wrath. Penguin is remaining tight-lipped, confirming only that it has released no statements one way or the other. Based on the information provided, what is the significance of Penguin Classics and how does Morrissey fit into their publishing history?","completion":"Penguin Classics is a prestigious imprint that is reserved for books that have \\"caused scandal and political change, inspired great films, and broken down barriers.\\" Morrissey hoped to publish his autobiography as a Penguin Classic, indicating that he saw his story as having cultural and historical significance. However, there is currently no record of a book deal between Morrissey and Penguin UK, and the publication of the book has been shrouded in mystery and controversy."},{"prompt":"Can you provide any insight into why there has been no pre-publication publicity or distribution of Morrissey\'s autobiography to bookshops? It seems unusual for such a high-profile musician and writer.","completion":"There is no clear explanation as to why there has been no pre-publication publicity or distribution of Morrissey\'s autobiography to bookshops. The lack of information has caused confusion and speculation in the book trade, with some suggesting that the book may not be ready for publication, or that there may be legal or contractual issues surrounding its release. Others have speculated that Morrissey may be deliberately avoiding publicity in order to maintain control over the narrative of his life story."},{"prompt":"Write a short story about a person who faces adversity and comes out on top, like overcoming an illness or recovering from a heartbreak.","completion":"Emily had always been a vibrant and active person. She loved to hike, swim, and run. So, when she suddenly fell ill one day, no one was quite sure what was going on. It started with a mild fever and headache, which quickly progressed into nausea and extreme fatigue. Emily couldn\'t even get out of bed some days. Her worried family took her to the doctor, who ran some tests and discovered that Emily had contracted a rare virus. The next few weeks were brutal for Emily. She was confined to her bed, barely able to move or eat, while her body fought off the virus. The days felt long and lonely, and Emily often felt like giving up. But something inside her refused to let the sickness defeat her. As the weeks turned into months, Emily slowly began to improve. She started to regain her strength and appetite, and her body began to heal itself. Though she still had to take it slow, Emily was determined to get back to the active life she loved. She pushed herself to start small: taking short walks, swimming laps at the pool, and doing gentle yoga stretches. Bit by bit, she grew stronger. It wasn\'t an easy journey. There were setbacks and moments of self-doubt. But Emily kept going, buoyed by the love and support of her family and friends. And eventually, she reached a point where she felt like herself again. She went on long hikes in the mountains, ran along the beach, and laughed with joy. Looking back on that trying time, Emily knew that she had grown stronger and wiser because of it. She had faced adversity head-on and had come out on top. She knew that whatever challenges lay ahead, she had the strength and determination to overcome them."},{"prompt":"That\'s a really inspiring story! Can you add more details about the kind of support Emily received from her family and friends?","completion":"Of course! Emily\'s family and friends were a constant source of love and encouragement during her illness. They would sit with her for hours, chatting, reading books and watching movies, keeping her company when she was feeling isolated and lonely. One of Emily\'s best friends, Sarah, would bring over homemade meals that were tailored to her dietary restrictions, ensuring that her nutrition needs were met. Another friend, Mike, would visit her with his guitar and sing her favorite songs, bringing some much-needed joy and vitality into her life. Emily\'s family members were equally supportive. Her mother would sit with her when she couldn\'t sleep, rubbing her back and reciting calming stories until she dozed off. Her younger brother would draw her funny cartoons to lift her spirits, while her older sister would share her own stories of resilience and survival, giving Emily hope that she could overcome this illness. Everyone in Emily\'s life showed her unwavering support and endless love, which gave her the strength to push through the difficult times. The support she received from her loved ones was an integral part of her journey to recovery, and Emily knew that she couldn\'t have done it without them."},{"prompt":"Hey, this is great! It really shows how important love and support are in overcoming adversity. Can you add some details about how Emily\'s illness affected her mentally, and how she was able to overcome those challenges as well?","completion":"Certainly! Emily\'s illness took a toll on her mental health, as well as her physical health. Being stuck in bed for long periods of time made her feel isolated and lonely, and she often struggled with feelings of helplessness and despair. As someone who was used to being active and independent, Emily found it challenging to adjust to her new reality. She had to depend on others for help with basic needs, like bathing and preparing meals, which was hard for her to accept. But Emily was determined not to let her illness define her. She focused on the little victories each day, like managing to sit up in bed for a little longer or eating a few more bites of food. She also found solace in hobbies like painting and reading, which gave her a sense of purpose and joy. Emily also sought professional help to manage her mental health. She worked with a therapist who helped her process the emotional stress of dealing with her illness and find healthy coping mechanisms. She also joined support groups for people going through similar experiences, which gave her a sense of community and understanding. Over time, Emily\'s mental state began to improve. She learned to focus on what she could control and appreciate the little things in life. Even on the hard days, Emily kept pushing forward, staying committed to her recovery journey. In the end, Emily emerged from her illness a stronger, wiser person, having overcome both physical and mental challenges."},{"prompt":"This is amazing! Can you give some more details about the therapy sessions that Emily attended? Did the therapist use any specific techniques or exercises that helped her with her mental health?","completion":"Of course! Emily\'s therapist used a variety of techniques and exercises to help her cope with the emotional stress of her illness. One of the techniques that was particularly helpful for Emily was cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of therapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. Emily and her therapist worked together to identify the negative thoughts and beliefs that were contributing to her feelings of helplessness and despair, and then worked to reframe those thoughts in a more positive way. Emily\'s therapist also used mindfulness techniques to help her become more present and grounded in the moment. Emily would practice deep breathing exercises and meditation to calm her mind and alleviate physical symptoms like anxiety and tension. In addition to these techniques, Emily\'s therapist also encouraged her to engage in positive behaviors that would help improve her mental state. This included things like exercise, self-care, and socializing with friends and family. By incorporating these positive behaviors into her daily routine, Emily was better able to manage her stress and improve her overall mood and outlook. Throughout her therapy sessions, Emily felt heard and supported, and valued the insights and guidance her therapist provided. She felt empowered by the tools and techniques she had learned and knew that she would be able to use them in her daily life after her therapy was done."},{"prompt":"Given the text: Earlier in the week, we took NHL and JSL out bowling. NHL tends to get very competitive while bowling and can get upset because I bowl better than he does. Then again, I DO have a few more years of practice. When, after the first few frames, he was in the lead, he began to exclaim about how he was beating me. I told him that it wasn’t nice to gloat about doing better than someone else because you never know when you will start doing worse. I was only a few pins behind him and I figured that he’d blow a frame or two or my bowling would pick back up to my usual levels and I’d go ahead of him again soon. I was so confident that I tweeted a lesson to be learned. Then, in the eighth frame, with NHL only ahead by 3, all the pins went tumbling down on the first roll. Yes, there was a strike. Only I didn’t get it. NHL did. Suddenly, the pressure was on. My lesson about not gloating was at stake. I focused and got a strike as well. But then NHL did something amazing. Something I never expected him to be able to do. He got another strike on his next throw. That’s right, he got a double! I couldn’t replicate it and fell hopelessly behind. I wound up with 101 to NHL’s 119. I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later. NHL surpassed me in bowling. I told him how proud I was of him. Not for beating me, mind you, but for getting such a great score, his personal best. The next game, NHL began by knocking 8 pins down. He was feeling good and looked primed for another gloating session until I got a strike on my first throw. And then a spare. And then a nine and a spare and a strike. He wound up with 88 to my 124. So I guess the lesson pulled through in the end. Don’t gloat because you never know when your luck will run out and someone will do better than you. I just didn’t expect it to apply to both NHL and myself. Can you summarize the story about NHL and JSL going bowling?","completion":"The author took NHL and JSL bowling and NHL was getting competitive, but the author reminded him not to gloat. After a few frames, NHL was in the lead but the author wasn\'t far behind. However, NHL got a strike and then a double, putting him significantly ahead.

I hope these suggestions help you add some variety to your spaghetti recipe!"},{"prompt":"Can you summarize the message of the first reading from Zephaniah and how it can be used as a personal message from God during meditation?: Today we have heard a couple of delightfully uplifting readings. The first reading from Zephaniah can be used in meditation as a personal message from the Lord. It\'s positive and encouraging and reassuring, not only because it promises victory over our troubles, but also because it says that God himself sings joyfully about each of us! How does God sing joyfully? He sings joyfully when we persist through our difficulties, when we rely on his help to reach the kind of victory that only his Son provides through his resurrection. He finds joy when we find solutions through him and not through our reliance and focus on ourselves, a focus that separates us from him and others. When we pray, in our mind’s eye, do we see Jesus as full of joy? Or do we picture him as somber or stern? Do we see him as affirming our goodness or denouncing our shortcomings? Joy is central to our faith and one of God\'s main attributes. It\'s one of the fruits of living in the will of God, a blessing from the Holy Spirit. It allows us to sing with Isaiah in today\'s responsorial: \\"My strength and my courage is the Lord”, a similar sentiment to the more widely known verse in Psalms 28, “The joy of the Lord is our strength.” We draw strength from the victory Jesus won for us through his resurrection. So often, when God invites us to be closer to him, when he invites us to share in the joy of his resurrection, we miss the signal. We can easily let the weight of the world, our sin, or the rejections we have experienced in the past, get to us. We can get angry or upset and find ourselves obsessing over the real or imagined problems that we face. Taking joy in the resurrection means we turn our eyes away from those things and look intently at the realities God wants us to focus on. It does us no good to get bogged down with fear over the problems that come our way. Instead, our Lord is calling us to address our problems through the lens of faith. He is calling us to look to His victory! With the Blessed Mother, whose Feast of the Visitation we celebrate today, we can sing her song from the Gospel: \\"My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord; my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant...the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.\\" No matter how bad things seem, no matter how bleak or disastrous our trials appear to be, God does look with favor upon us, simply because he knows our desire to handle our challenges the Christian way, even though we may turn our back on him at times. \\"He has mercy on those who fear him” as Mary said, “He has shown the strength of his arm\\" Looking at his victory is liberating and produces an incredible faith in our lives. And that faith in the Risen Lord will generate the wonderful joy that God wants us to have. Let us reflect today upon our own reactions to the reality of the Resurrection. Let’s spend some time today gazing (in our mind’s eye) upon his wonderful face. Jesus invites us to a deeper relationship with him today. With our eyes fixed on Him, all else that tempts us to feel discouragement will likely fade from focus. And so we pray, Lord, we do want to place our gaze upon you. We want to see your glory manifested in our lives. Help us to trust you in our most painful and frightening moments, knowing that your grace will sustain us through them all, and deliver to us the victory and the joy that you want for each of us!","completion":"The message from the first reading of Zephaniah can be used as a personal message from God during meditation.

One of the most prominent examples is the relationship between Romeo and Juliet, who fall deeply in love despite their families\' feud. Both Romeo and Juliet make significant sacrifices for their love, including risking their lives to be together and ultimately dying for each other. Juliet is willing to give up her family and social status to be with Romeo, and Romeo sacrifices his reputation and family ties to marry Juliet. Similarly, Romeo\'s friend Mercutio sacrifices himself to defend Romeo\'s honor in a fight with Tybalt, and Romeo avenges Mercutio\'s death by killing Tybalt, leading to his own banishment. In contrast, the relationship between Romeo and Rosaline highlights a shallow, self-centered love that involves no sacrifice. Romeo is initially infatuated with Rosaline, but his love for her quickly fades once he meets Juliet and experiences a deeper, more meaningful connection. Overall, the play portrays love and sacrifice as intertwined concepts, with true love requiring significant sacrifices and selflessness."},{"prompt":"I also noticed that the relationship between Lord and Lady Capulet seems to lack love and sacrifice. They care more about status and reputation than their daughter\'s happiness.","completion":"Yes, that is another example of how the theme of love and sacrifice is portrayed in the play. Lord and Lady Capulet\'s relationship with Juliet is based on duty and status rather than affection and sacrifice. They are more concerned with arranging a suitable marriage for Juliet that will benefit the family\'s social standing than with her happiness or well-being. When Juliet defies their wishes and refuses to marry Paris, they disown her and threaten to disinherit her, which shows that their love is conditional and self-serving. In contrast, Romeo and Juliet\'s love is characterized by selflessness and sacrifice, as they are willing to risk everything for each other\'s happiness. Overall, Shakespeare uses the relationships between characters to highlight the importance of genuine love and sacrifice in relationships, rather than superficial and self-centered motivations."},{"prompt":"It\'s interesting how Shakespeare portrays the different types of love in this play. I also noticed that the Nurse\'s love for Juliet is a unique kind of love that involves sacrifice, but not in the way that Romeo and Juliet\'s love does. What do you think about that?","completion":"Yes, I agree that the Nurse\'s love for Juliet is a unique kind of love that involves sacrifice, but not in the way Romeo and Juliet\'s love does. The Nurse has been a mother figure to Juliet in the absence of her own mother, and she deeply cares for her. She is willing to help Juliet in her love affair with Romeo, even though it goes against her sense of duty and loyalty to the Capulet family. She delivers messages between Romeo and Juliet and helps Juliet to make arrangements for her secret marriage. However, when Juliet is faced with the prospect of marrying Paris, the Nurse advises her to give up her relationship with Romeo and marry Paris instead. This shows that even the Nurse\'s love has limits, as she values social stability and security over Juliet\'s happiness. Overall, the Nurse\'s love for Juliet is a complex mixture of loyalty and sacrifice, in which she is willing to make sacrifices to help Juliet, but also has her own limitations and priorities. This highlights the different kinds of love that exist in the play beyond the romantic love between Romeo and Juliet."},{"prompt":"Can you give examples of samurai warlords who played a significant role during the Sengoku period, and what were their defining characteristics?","completion":"1.

Additionally, they often exploited their opponents\' weaknesses and vulnerabilities to gain the upper hand in battle. Their tactical and strategic prowess allowed them to become some of the most powerful and influential figures during the Sengoku period."},{"prompt":"Explain how to make a delicious egg salad sandwich","completion":"Making a delicious egg salad sandwich is quite easy and requires only a few simple steps.

From the death of a loved one to a serious accident which left me paralyzed, it seemed like the universe had conspired against me. However, it is through these trials that I have found my strength and resilience. The first time I experienced a trauma was when I lost my father to cancer. He was my rock, my confidant, and my best friend. When he passed away, I felt like a part of me had died too. I was in a dark place and thought I would never be able to move on. But slowly, I found that talking to people about my emotions helped. I also turned to writing, which allowed me to channel my feelings into something productive. Through this, I found the strength to pick myself up and move forward. The second time I faced trauma was when I was involved in a serious accident. I was driving home from work when a drunk driver hit my car. The impact left me paralyzed from the waist down. It was a difficult time, but I knew I could not let this tragedy define me. I refused to let my disability hold me back and instead turned towards therapy to help me get through the emotional and physical pain. Through rehabilitation and a positive attitude, I learned how to navigate through life as a person with a disability. Through these difficult times, I realized that resilience is not something that can be easily achieved. It is a conscious decision to not let life\'s hardships define you. Finding strength and resilience after trauma is not something that happens overnight. It is a process that requires self-reflection, mental toughness, and a deep sense of purpose. In conclusion, I believe that finding resilience and strength after trauma is truly possible. It just requires the right mindset and a willingness to face challenges head-on. It is through these challenges that we grow, learn, and become stronger versions of ourselves. I am grateful for the traumas I have experienced in life, as they have helped me become a person who is much stronger and capable of facing anything that comes my way."},{"prompt":"Thank you for sharing that memoir with me, it was truly inspiring. Can you add some more details to your experience with therapy and rehabilitation? I think it would be helpful for readers who may be going through something similar.","completion":"Certainly. When I was involved in the accident that left me paralyzed, I was overcome with physical and emotional pain. However, I knew that I needed to seek professional help to cope with my situation. I started with physical therapy, which was aimed at helping me regain as much movement as possible. Although there were days where I felt like giving up, my therapist would always push me to keep going. Her encouragement helped me regain function in my upper body, which gave me more independence in my daily tasks. I also began participating in occupational therapy, which helped me learn how to adapt to my new life circumstances. My therapist helped me find ways to perform daily tasks, such as dressing and cooking, with new techniques that worked around my paralysis. This was extremely helpful in boosting my confidence and making me feel more self-sufficient. In addition to physical and occupational therapy, I also sought psychological counseling. My therapist encouraged me to verbalize my feelings and the emotional pain that came with losing my mobility. Through our conversations, she helped me develop healthy coping mechanisms and recognize signs of depression or anxiety. Her support was invaluable in helping me not only cope with my disability, but also in building my resilience to face future challenges. Overall, my experience with therapy and rehabilitation was both challenging and rewarding. It required a lot of hard work and dedication, but it was worth it. Therapy helped me regain my sense of agency and control, which gave me hope for the future. It\'s important for anyone going through a traumatic experience to consider seeking professional help as a vital part of the healing process."},{"prompt":"\\"Write a Perl program that prompts the user to enter a series of integers, creates an array from the input, and then applies the selection sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order. The program should display the sorted array as output. Ensure that your code is well-documented, includes clear variable names and adheres to best practices for programming style.\\"","completion":"Here is a Perl program that prompts the user to enter a series of integers, creates an array from the input, and then applies the selection sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order: ``` #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; # Prompt the user to enter a series of integers print \\"Enter a series of integers, separated by spaces: \\"; # Read the input from the user my input = <STDIN>; chomp input; # Split the input into an array of integers my @unsorted = split /s+/, input; # Apply the selection sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order for my i (0 .. #unsorted) { my min = i; for my j (i+1 .. #unsorted) { min = j if unsorted[j] < unsorted[min]; } @unsorted[i, min] = @unsorted[min, i] if i != min; } # Display the sorted array as output print \\"Sorted array: @unsortedn\\"; ``` This program first prompts the user to enter a series of integers. It then reads the input from the user and splits it into an array of integers using the `split` function. The program then applies the selection sort algorithm to this array in ascending order. The selection sort algorithm works by finding the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first element in the unsorted part of the array. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted. Finally, the sorted array is displayed as output using the `print` function. The `@unsorted` array is interpolated into a string using the `@` sigil and the `join` function is not needed because Perl automatically separates the elements of an array with a space."},{"prompt":"Could you possibly explain how the selection sort algorithm works in a bit more detail? I\'m still new to sorting algorithms.\\"","completion":"Sure, I\'d be happy to explain the selection sort algorithm in more detail! The selection sort algorithm is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the input array into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire array. The algorithm then repeatedly finds the smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first (or last) element in the unsorted part of the array. This effectively \\"selects\\" the smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted part and adds it to the sorted part of the array. As the algorithm iterates over the unsorted part of the array, the sorted part grows until it encompasses the entire array, at which point the array is fully sorted. Because the algorithm works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and adding it to the sorted part, it is called \\"selection sort\\". Here\'s the step-by-step process for applying the selection sort algorithm to an example array of integers, [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]: 1. Set the first element (64) as the minimum value in the unsorted part of the array. 2. Compare the minimum value with the next element (25) in the unsorted part of the array. Since 25 < 64, set 25 as the new minimum value. 3. Compare the minimum value (25) with the next element (12) in the unsorted part of the array. Since 12 < 25, set 12 as the new minimum value. 4. Compare the minimum value (12) with the next element (22) in the unsorted part of the array. Since 12 < 22, no change is necessary. 5. Compare the minimum value (12) with the last element (11) in the unsorted part of the array. Since 11 < 12, set 11 as the new minimum value. 6. Swap the minimum value (11) with the first element (64) in the unsorted part of the array, resulting in [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]. 7. Repeat steps 2-6 for the remaining unsorted part of the array (starting at index 1), resulting in [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]. 8. The entire array is now sorted. I hope that helps!

Bathroom: Bathrooms should be cleaned at least once a week to prevent the buildup of mold and mildew. This includes scrubbing the toilet, sink, and shower, as well as mopping the floor. 3. Floors: Floors should be swept or vacuumed daily to remove dirt and debris. Hard floors should be mopped at least once a week. 4. Carpets: Carpets should be vacuumed once a week to remove dirt, dust, and pet dander. Deep cleaning may be required every 6-12 months depending on the level of foot traffic and soilage. 5. Bedding: Bedding should be washed once a week to remove dirt, sweat, and dead skin cells. How to Adjust the Routine Based on Changes in Household Needs or Schedule: 1. If you have guests staying over, adjust the cleaning routine to include preparing the guest room and cleaning the guest bathroom. 2. If you have a busy week and can\'t complete all of the tasks on schedule, move some tasks to another day or a different week. 3. If you have a new pet in the house or someone with allergies, add extra cleaning tasks to keep the environment clean and healthy. 4.

Create a cleaning playlist that includes your favorite songs, and encourage your family members to dance and sing along while they clean. 2. Make it a Competition: If you have kids, you can turn cleaning into a game by making it a competition. Assign different tasks to each family member and see who can complete them the fastest or most efficiently. You can also offer rewards or incentives for the winner, such as a movie night or a special treat. 3. Create a Cleaning Chart: Create a cleaning chart that outlines the tasks that need to be completed each week, and assign each task to a different family member. Have each person mark off completed tasks, and offer rewards for completing all of the tasks for the week. 4. Break it Down into Smaller Tasks: Cleaning can feel overwhelming if you try to tackle it all at once. To make it more manageable, break it down into smaller tasks and focus on one area of the house at a time. Encourage family members to help with specific tasks, such as sweeping the floors or cleaning the bathroom sink. 5. Use Pleasant Scents: Using pleasant scents, such as essential oils or candles, can make cleaning more enjoyable. Use scent diffusers to infuse the room with a calming aroma, and choose scents that make you feel happy and relaxed. 6. Take Breaks Together: Take breaks together and have a snack or drink while enjoying each other\'s company. Use this time to bond as a family, and encourage your family members to share stories or jokes while they take a break from cleaning. 7. Show Appreciation: Show appreciation for your family members\' efforts by thanking them for helping with the cleaning and giving them positive feedback. A little recognition can go a long way in making cleaning more enjoyable and encouraging family members to continue helping."},{"prompt":"Could you please provide me with some creative ideas on how to involve children in the cleaning routine? They tend to lose interest quickly and I want to make it a fun activity for them. Maybe some age-appropriate tasks for young children as well?","completion":"Sure, here are some creative ideas on how to involve children in the cleaning routine: 1. Make it a Game: Make cleaning a game by using a timer or giving incentives. For example, you could use a timer and challenge your children to clean up a room in a certain amount of time. Or, you could offer rewards like stickers or points for completing cleaning tasks. 2. Use Kid-friendly Cleaning Tools: Give your children their own age-appropriate cleaning tools, such as a mini broom and dustpan, to make cleaning more fun. They\'ll feel like they\'re helping and it will give them a sense of independence. 3. Turn Chores into a Scavenger Hunt: Create a scavenger hunt by creating a list of items that need to be found or cleaned. Give your children a reward for finding all the items or completing all the tasks. You could also make it more exciting by hiding some of the items. 4. Play Music or a Story: Play upbeat music or a storybook on audio while cleaning, making it a more enjoyable experience. Children love stories and listening to a storybook while they clean can help make the task more enjoyable. 5. Make it a Painting Activity: If cleaning toys is the chore, make it a painting activity. Give your children some non-toxic paint and have them \\"paint\\" their toys or wipe them down with a damp cloth to clean them. 6. Try Sorting: Young children love to sort things, so encourage them to sort laundry or toys. You could give them a bin for each category (e.g. Lights and darks for laundry, or puzzles and blocks for toys) and help them sort the items into the correct bin. 7. Be Positive: Avoid using negative language when talking about cleaning. Instead of saying \\"We have to clean up this mess,\\" try to frame it in a more positive way, like \\"We get to make this room clean and tidy.\\" Age-Appropriate Tasks for Children: - For toddlers (1-2 years old): Have them help you pick up toys or hand you clothes to put in the laundry basket. - For preschoolers (3-5 years old): Encourage them to wipe down surfaces with a damp cloth, put away toys, or sort laundry. - For elementary schoolers (6-10 years old): Teach them how to make their beds, sweep floors, dust surfaces or help with meal prep. - For teenagers (11+ years old): Give them more responsibility like cleaning the bathroom, doing the laundry or cooking dinner."},{"prompt":"Could you provide me with some additional ideas on how to make cleaning with children more interactive? Maybe some craft ideas to repurpose old cleaning supplies?","completion":"Sure, here are some additional ideas on how to make cleaning with children more interactive and fun by repurposing old cleaning supplies into craft projects: 1. Create a Mini Garden: Repurpose spray bottles or old cleaning supply caddies into a mini garden. You can use the spray bottles to water plants, or create containers for growing herbs. This is a great way to teach children about the importance of taking care of plants and the environment. 2. Make Musical Instruments: Kids love to make music! You can create musical instruments out of old cleaning supplies. For example, you can make a drum out of an old bucket and some rubber bands, a shaker out of an old spice container filled with rice, or a guitar out of an old tissue box and rubber bands. 3. Create a Cleaning Kit: Transform an old cleaning caddy into a fun and functional cleaning kit for kids. Add in child-sized cleaning tools, gloves, and fun towels. Encourage your kids to use their cleaning kit to help with cleaning tasks. 4. Make a Cleaning Supplies Organizer: Repurpose an old shoe organizer or hanging organizer into a cleaning supplies organizer. Use it to hold all of your cleaning supplies in one place, and assign your kids specific tasks to grab their supplies from the organizer. 5. Use Cleaning Supplies for Art Projects: Use cleaning supplies like paint rollers, sponges, or spray bottles to create unique art projects. Dip the sponges in paint to create impressive stamp art or use spray bottles filled with food coloring to create unique tie-dye effects on paper. 6. Create a Chore Chart: Make a chore chart using an old clipboard, clothespins, and paper. Write each cleaning task on a clothespin and clip it to the board. When your child completes a task, they can move the clothespin to the \\"done\\" section of the chart. 7. Create a Cleaning-Inspired Craft: Use cleaning materials to create fun crafts that represent cleaning tasks, like a trashcan bowling alley or a broomstick kite. These ideas will help children stay engaged and have a fun and interactive experience while helping with cleaning and repurposing old supplies."},{"prompt":"Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a number and then calculates its factorial using recursion. The program should include error handling for non-integer inputs and negative inputs. The output should be displayed in a clear and readable format. The program should also include comments explaining the logic behind the recursive function.","completion":"```java import java.util.Scanner; public class Factorial { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(\\"Enter a positive integer: \\"); int num = 0; try { num = input.nextInt(); } catch(Exception e) { System.out.println(\\"Error: Please enter a positive integer!\\"); return; } if(num < 0) { System.out.println(\\"Error: Please enter a positive integer!\\"); return; } System.out.println(num + \\"! = \\" + factorial(num)); } public static int factorial(int num) { if(num == 0 || num == 1) { // base case: if num is 0 or 1, return 1 return 1; } else { return num * factorial(num-1); // recursive call: multiply num by the factorial of num-1 } } } ``` Explanation: The program first prompts the user to enter a positive integer using the `Scanner` class. It then checks if the input is an integer and if it is positive. If the input is invalid, it prints an error message and terminates the program. Otherwise, it calls the `factorial` method to calculate the factorial of the input number and displays the result. The `factorial` method uses recursion to calculate the factorial of the input number. It first checks if the number is either 0 or 1, which are the base cases, and returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial by multiplying the number by the factorial of the number minus 1, which is obtained by making a recursive call to the `factorial` method with the number minus 1 as the argument. This process is repeated until the base case is reached."},{"prompt":"This Java program looks good, but can you please add more comments to explain the error handling part of the code? I want to understand it thoroughly.","completion":"Certainly! Here\'s the revised code with more comments to explain the error handling logic: ```java import java.util.Scanner; public class Factorial { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(\\"Enter a positive integer: \\"); int num = 0; // initialize a variable for the input number try { num = input.nextInt(); // tries to read an integer from the input } catch(Exception e) { // if an exception is caught (e.g. Non-integer input) System.out.println(\\"Error: Please enter a positive integer!\\"); // prints an error message return; // terminates the program } if(num < 0) { // if the input is negative System.out.println(\\"Error: Please enter a positive integer!\\"); // prints an error message return; // terminates the program } // if the input is valid System.out.println(num + \\"! = \\" + factorial(num)); // calls the factorial method and displays the result } // method for calculating the factorial of a number using recursion public static int factorial(int num) { if(num == 0 || num == 1) { // base case: if num is 0 or 1, return 1 return 1; } else { return num * factorial(num-1); // recursive call: multiply num by the factorial of num-1 } } } ``` I added comments to explain the `try-catch` block that handles non-integer inputs and the `if` statement that checks for negative inputs. The `try-catch` block attempts to read an integer from the user input using `input.nextInt()`. If a non-integer input is entered, an exception will be thrown and caught by the `catch` block, which prints an error message and exits the program. The `if` statement checks if the input is negative. If it is, it prints an error message and terminates the program. I hope this helps clarify the error handling part of the code!"},{"prompt":"Write a science fiction story that is at least 500 words long about a person who has to travel through multiple dimensions to save their loved ones.

After months of work, she stood at the threshold of a new frontier in technology: the ability to travel through dimensions. Maya was on the brink of something incredible, but she knew that with great power came great responsibility. Maya\'s thoughts turned to her family, who she had lost in a dimensional rift two years ago. She would never forget the look on her daughter\'s face as she disappeared into the void. If her invention could move her across the multiverse, maybe she could rescue her loved ones and bring them back home. Taking a deep breath, Maya activated the device. The room began to spin and warp, twisting her perception of space and time. When the machine hummed to a stop, Maya found herself in a world unlike any she had ever seen before. Dimension one was a place of vibrant colors and shimmering light. The air tasted like candy, and the ground was soft and bouncy as if made of marshmallows. But Maya had no time to savor this sweet paradise; she had to find her family. As she walked through the pastel landscape, she glimpsed a shadow lurking behind a rainbow bridge. An ominous voice boomed, \\"You cannot pass without solving my riddle!\\" Maya took a deep breath and steadied herself. She had to face this challenge head-on if she wanted to find her loved ones. The riddle was complex, but her scientific mind pieced together the solution, and the shadow slunk away, defeated. In dimension two, Maya found herself in an icy wasteland. The air stung her lungs, and each step sank her into the snow up to her knees. She found herself battling massive yetis and a horde of penguins wearing tuxedos with the demeanor of immortal intellectuals. Maya was all alone in the fierce cold, and she had no time to waste. With a burst of determination, she summoned up the courage to outrun the Yetis and outsmart the Penguins while battling off hypothermia all at once. The final dimension was the worst one of all. It was a realm where up was down, and left was right. A world where gravity was like a toy in the hands of the realm. The inversion was so extreme that it made Maya dizzy and nauseous at times. Still, she pressed on, focusing on her goal of finding her family. It wasn\'t long before Maya stumbled upon a towering palace constructed entirely out of clouds. Within its walls, her estranged family was held captive by the twisted ruler of Dimension three. In a showdown that shook the world, Maya battled the tyrant and emerged victorious. In the depths of the palace, she reunited with her long-lost family, and they embraced as if they\'d never been apart. As they hurtled toward home in a flash of light, Maya knew they\'d crossed the line between worlds and emerged victorious. Maya\'s love for her family had been the fuel that powered her through the dimensions. And now, she knew they\'d never be apart again."},{"prompt":"That\'s an impressive story! Can you add more about the characters and their emotions, maybe their backstory?","completion":"Certainly! Here\'s an updated version of the story with more character development: Dr. Maya Johnson was a brilliant scientist, but it was her family that had always been the center of her world. Maya was married to her high school sweetheart, Alex, and they had a daughter, Lily. They were happy together until the day they lost everything in a sudden dimensional rift. Maya\'s work had always been about pushing the boundaries of what she knew to be possible. She had spent months perfecting her invention to travel through dimensions, partly motivated by her desire to reunite with her family. When the extraordinary opportunity presented itself, Maya seized it with both hands. In dimension one, Maya felt her heart swell as she breathed in the sweet air and took in the beautiful surroundings. She wished Alex and Lily were there, too, so they could experience the wonder of it all. But her moment of elation was interrupted by the shadowy figure blocking her way. Maya could sense it was malevolent, but there was no time to stop and consider. She had to solve the riddle and continue on her mission, no matter how great the danger. In dimension two, the ice and snow were treacherous, but Maya pushed through it with fierce determination. Her love for her family gave her the strength and drive to keep moving forward despite her exhaustion. She thought of the way Lily used to giggle as they jumped in the snow, and the memory spurred her on. When Maya finally got to dimension three, she was relieved, but also worried. She knew the ruler of this realm was cruel and had imprisoned innocent families before. As she fought her way past the palace guards and into the throne room, Maya\'s mind was consumed by thoughts of her loved ones. She felt like they were so close yet so far away, and she couldn\'t bear the thought of losing them once again. Finally, in the depths of the palace, Maya found her family. The rush of relief and joy that flooded through her when she saw them safe and sound was indescribable. She could tell by the way Alex hugged her tightly that he was feeling the same way. And when Lily\'s arms wrapped around her waist, Maya felt as though her world was finally back in order. As they made their way home, Maya reflected that her love for her family had powered her through the dimensional rifts. She had faced down incredible danger and solved impossible riddles, all because of the strength of her love. It gave her a newfound appreciation for the bond that ties a family together, no matter what trials they may face."},{"prompt":"I really enjoyed the story, but can you add more details about the ruler of dimension three? What made them so cruel and how did Maya manage to defeat them?","completion":"Certainly! Here\'s an updated version of the story with more details about the ruler of Dimension Three and Maya\'s path towards victory: As Maya and her family hurtled through the dimensions, the one they entered next was shrouded in darkness. The air was thick with the stench of sulfur, and a red light flickered in the distance. Maya knew they had to be close to the twisted ruler of Dimension Three, the one who was holding her family captive. As they crept closer to the palace, they noticed everything was coated in a layer of slime. The walls of the palace oozed with a green, sticky substance, making it difficult to see where one room ended and the next began. Suddenly, a booming voice filled the room, \\"Who dares to defy me and enter my palace?\\" Maya stood her ground, refusing to be intimidated by the ruler\'s grandiose claims. She knew that the person behind the voice was the one responsible for stealing her family from her. \\"I have come to rescue my loved ones,\\" Maya declared, her voice steady and unafraid. With a thunderous roar, the ruler appeared before them. It was a grotesque creature that towered over everyone, with scales that gleamed with a malevolent energy. Its eyes were like glowing coals, and its teeth were razor-sharp. It grinned, revealing its evil intentions. Maya had studied this ruler extensively, and she knew just how to defeat them. She had created a disruptive waveform generator specifically to combat it, which emitted a frequency that disrupted the ruler\'s energy force. As they battled, Maya pulled out the generator and activated it, blasting the ruler with waves of disruption. Gradually, they grew weaker and weaker, until finally, it collapsed in a heap on the ground. The palace shook with the force of their combined energy, but Maya didn\'t stop there. She fought her way through hordes of creatures and traps and finally arrived in a chamber where her family was being kept. They were relieved to see Maya and overjoyed to be rescued from their captor. Holding each other tightly, they knew that they could never be separated again. Maya emerged from the dimensional rifts changed. She had overcome impossible odds, fought incredible creatures, and saved the ones she loved. Maya realized that family bonds were the strongest of all, and she would never take those she loved for granted again. The power of love had defeated even the greatest darkness of the multiverse."},{"prompt":"This is a really exciting story! Can you add more details about the creatures Maya encountered in each dimension? I\'d love to get a better sense of what they were like.","completion":"Of course! Here\'s an updated version of the story with more details about the creatures Maya encountered in each dimension: As Maya activated her device and entered dimension one, she felt her senses come alive. Her surroundings were like nothing she had ever seen before - a colorful wonderland filled with pastel flowers, cotton candy tufts, and candy-coated trees. At first, it seemed like there was nothing sinister to this world, but as Maya walked on, strange creatures began to emerge. The first creature Maya encountered was a giant gumdrop that bared its teeth at her threateningly. It stood several feet tall and had a dense, chewy texture. Another creature was a sinister-looking lollipop that had a prickly, candy shell covered in razor-sharp sugar crystals. Maya tried her best to avoid the creatures, but their unpredictable behavior added an element of danger to her journey. In dimension two, the ground was slippery with ice and the air was thick with snow. Maya was greeted with a group of Yetis that snarled at her and charged with sharp teeth and claws. They were formidable opponents, but Maya used her ingenuity, relying on the traction of her boots to stay nimble while throwing bits of snow in their eyes. In some places, the ground crunched under Maya\'s feet and caused chills down her spine as peculiar, bipedal penguins marched with haughty enthusiasm. They wore bespoke tuxedos and carried with them remarkably interesting books in their flippers. As they circled Maya, they launched high-browed riddles, but Maya\'s quick thinking allowed her to get past them. In dimension three, Maya encountered a world unlike any other known to her. It was a realm where gravity was distorted, where up was down and left was right. Maya felt disoriented as she navigated this confusing landscape. When she finally arrived at the palace, it was guarded by a nightmarish array of grotesque creatures. They had razor-sharp teeth, tendrils like tentacles, and eyes that glowed like hot coals. The ruler of this world was a massive dragon, with red scales that reflected the eerie red glow of the palace. Every step Maya took seemed to reverberate through the halls, giving away her position. Maya relied on her wits and training to take down these formidable creatures. She used her basic scientific knowledge to improvise ways to take on each of these creatures one by one, whether it was by launching snowballs, solving riddles or using a disruptive waveform generator. Through grit, determination and the power of her intellect, Maya persevered and reached her family. The power of the multiverse had been conquered, all thanks to the courage Maya found within herself."},{"prompt":"Othman, Radziah and Shamsuddin, Zulkifli and Matior, M. R.

Include tips for achieving a soft, pillowy texture and a crispy crust, and explain any common mistakes to avoid. Additionally, offer variations or add-ins that readers can try, such as adding herbs or cheese to the dough.","completion":"Ingredients: - 3 cups of all-purpose flour - 1 tablespoon of active dry yeast - 1 cup of warm water - 1 teaspoon of salt - 1 tablespoon of sugar - 1 tablespoon of olive oil Instructions: 1. In a small bowl, mix the yeast, sugar, and warm water until the yeast is dissolved. Set aside for 5 minutes to activate the yeast. 2. In a large mixing bowl, add the flour and salt, and mix together. 3. Add the activated yeast mixture into the flour mixture and stir until the dough comes together. 4. Add the olive oil and knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth, elastic, and not sticky. You can use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to speed up the process. 5. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl, cover with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it doubles in size. 6. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). 7. Punch down the dough and form it into a loaf shape. Place it into a greased loaf pan, or onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 8. Place the dough back into a warm place to rise for another 15-20 minutes. 9. Cut shallow slits into the surface of the loaf with a serrated knife to allow steam to escape. 10. Bake the bread for 25-30 minutes or until the crust turns golden brown, and the bread sounds hollow when tapped. 11. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Tips for Achieving a Soft, Pillowy Texture and a Crispy Crust: - Always use warm water when activating the yeast. Cold water will hinder the yeast\'s growth, and hot water will kill the yeast. - Use high-gluten flours like bread flour or mix all-purpose flour with vital wheat gluten for a chewier texture. - Knead the dough well. This creates gluten strands that trap air, giving the bread a fluffy texture. - Let the dough rise twice. This allows the yeast to release more carbon dioxide, resulting in a softer crumb. - Close the oven door gently to keep the steam inside. The steam helps to create a crisp crust. Common mistakes to Avoid: - Using too much flour will lead to a dense loaf. Add flour on a tablespoon at a time to prevent adding too much. - Not kneading long enough will produce a soggy and dense bread. - Skipping the second rise will also lead to a less fluffy texture. - Over-baking the bread will dry it out and cause a hard, burnt crust. Variations/Add-ins: - Garlic Bread: Add 2 teaspoons of garlic powder to the dough. - Cheese Bread: Fold grated cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or gouda) into the dough before shaping. - Herb Bread: Add 1 tablespoon of dried herbs (thyme, rosemary, or oregano) to the dough. - Whole Wheat Bread: Replace half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour to add fiber to the bread."},{"prompt":"This recipe seems pretty straightforward, but I\'m still a beginner when it comes to baking bread. Can you share some more tips on how to knead the dough properly to get the best results?","completion":"Of course! Here are some tips on how to knead the dough properly: - Use flour sparingly when kneading. You only need enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to your hands and the work surface. Adding too much flour can result in a dry and dense loaf. - Use the heel of your hand to push the dough away from you, then fold it back over itself with your fingers. Turn the dough a quarter turn and repeat the process. Knead for about 10-15 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic. You\'ll know the dough is ready when you can stretch a piece of it between your fingers without it tearing. - Avoid tearing the dough. Try to keep the dough in one piece while kneading. - Don\'t rush the process. Kneading takes time and patience. Take breaks if you need to rest your arms. - The dough will be sticky and difficult to work with at first, but keep kneading until it becomes smooth and elastic. - If the dough feels too dry, add a tablespoon of water at a time. If it feels too wet, add a tablespoon of flour at a time. By following these tips, you should be able to knead the dough properly and achieve a soft, fluffy loaf of bread.

Answer according to: \\"Citric Acid Based Pre-SEI for Improvement of Silicon Electrodes in Lit\\" by K. W. D. Kaveendi Chandrasiri, Cao Cuong Nguyen et al. Silicon electrodes are of interest to the lithium ion battery industry due to high gravimetric capacity (∼3580 mAh/g), natural abundance, and low toxicity. However, the process of alloying and dealloying during cell cycling, causes the silicon particles to undergo a dramatic volume change of approximately 280% which leads to electrolyte consumption, pulverization of the electrode, and poor cycling. In this study, the formation of an ex-situ artificial SEI on the silicon nanoparticles with citric acid has been investigated. Citric acid (CA) which was previously used as a binder for silicon electrodes was used to modify the surface of the nanoparticles to generate an artificial SEI, which could inhibit electrolyte decomposition on the surface of the silicon nanoparticles. The results suggest improved capacity retention of ∼60% after 50 cycles for the surface modified silicon electrodes compared to 45% with the surface unmodified electrode. Similar improvements in capacity retention are observed upon citric acid surface modification for silicon graphite composite/ LiCoO2 cells.","completion":"According to the study mentioned, there is potential for using citric acid-based artificial SEI in lithium ion batteries beyond silicon graphite composite/LiCoO2 cells. The study focused on improving the performance of silicon electrodes, but the methodology of using citric acid to modify the surface of particles to generate an artificial SEI could potentially be applied to other types of electrodes as well. However, further research would be needed to determine the effectiveness of this approach for other materials."},{"prompt":"Can you provide more details on how the citric acid-based artificial SEI inhibits electrolyte decomposition on the surface of silicon nanoparticles?","completion":"Sure! The citric acid-based artificial SEI inhibits electrolyte decomposition on the surface of silicon nanoparticles by forming a protective layer on the surface. When the artificial SEI is formed, the citric acid molecules chemically react with the surface of the silicon nanoparticles, forming a uniform and stable layer that prevents direct contact between the silicon surface and the electrolyte. This, in turn, reduces the chances of electrolyte decomposition on the surface of the nanoparticles during cell cycling. The artificial SEI layer also helps to maintain the structural integrity of the silicon particles, preventing cracking and pulverization, which are other common problems associated with silicon electrodes."},{"prompt":"Craft a thriller about a man who is being hunted by a team of highly-trained assassins who are determined to take him out.","completion":"John had always been a man of routine. He went to work, came home, had dinner and then watched the news before bed. But one night, everything changed. As John sat in his living room watching the news, he noticed something strange. The same black SUV had driven past his house three times in the last hour. He shrugged it off, thinking it was just a coincidence. But he was wrong. The next morning, as he left for work, he noticed something else. He saw four men in black suits standing on the corner, staring at him. They looked like a team of highly-trained assassins. John tried to ignore them and continued walking, but as he turned the corner, he heard footsteps behind him. He turned to see one of the men running at him with a knife. John quickly turned and ran in the opposite direction, but the assassin was fast and caught up to him quickly. John managed to dodge the assassin\'s attacks and ran into a nearby alley. He knew that he needed to find a place to hide and quickly. As he hid behind a trash can, he heard the sound of footsteps approaching. He knew that the assassins had found him. He looked around frantically for an escape route but it was too late. Three of the men had already surrounded him, and the fourth was approaching from the other side. John quickly grabbed the closest object he could find, a broken bottle, and prepared for a fight. The assassins attacked him all at once, but John was quick and managed to take them down one by one. But just as he thought he had won, he heard the sound of more footsteps approaching. He was outnumbered and outgunned. John knew that he had to keep running if he wanted to stay alive. He took off down the alleyway, dodging bullets and avoiding the assassins that were hot on his tail. As he ran, he couldn\'t help but wonder what he had done to deserve this. He was just an ordinary man, with an ordinary life. Or so he thought. After what felt like hours of running, John finally found himself at a dead end. He could hear the assassins closing in on him. He knew that this was it. This was the end. But just as he was about to give up, he heard the sound of police sirens in the distance. The assassins scattered, disappearing into the shadows. John collapsed on the ground, breathing heavily. He knew that he had narrowly escaped death. From that moment on, John swore to never take his safety for granted again. He would always be cautious, always have an exit plan, and always be prepared for whatever came his way. Because he never knew when the assassins might return."},{"prompt":"从广东的角度提","completion":"针对广东的角度，我提出以下三点建议： 1. 加强养老服务能力建设：面对香港人口老龄化和养老服务需求增加的挑战，广东可以加大投入，建设更多高质量的养老院和康养设施，提高养老服务能力。这包括扩大已有院舍的规模，引进国内外养老服务机构和专业人才，提供全方位的养老服务，满足香港居民的需求。 2. 优化康养环境和服务质量：广东可以进一步优化康养环境，提供更好的生活和居住条件。这包括改善养老院的硬件设施、绿化和景观设计，提供充足的活动和休闲设施，提升居住环境的舒适度和宜居性。同时，广东还应注重提高养老服务的质量，加强培训和管理，提供温馨关怀和个性化的服务，让香港居民在广东能够获得更好的养老体验。 3. 加强合作和推广工作：广东可以积极与香港政府、社福团体等合作，共享资源和经验，共同推动养老服务的发展。可以加强信息交流和合作机制，建立跨区域的养老服务网络，促进资源共享和互补。同时，广东还应加强对香港居民的养老服务的宣传和推广工作，通过多种渠道宣传广东的养老服务优势，吸引更多香港居民来广东养老，推动广东的康养产业发展。"},{"prompt":"补充：加强“广东院舍计划”宣传力度。鼓励更多香港居民申请“广东院舍计划”及“综援长者广东省养老计划”，并适度放宽申请条件限制，让香港老年人免受长达36个月的等候时间。","completion":"补充： 4. 加强“广东院舍计划”的宣传力度：为了让更多的香港居民了解和申请“广东院舍计划”及“综援长者广东省养老计划”，广东可以加大宣传力度。通过广告、媒体报道、社交媒体等渠道，向香港居民介绍这些计划的详细信息、申请流程和优势，引起他们的关注和兴趣。同时，可以在香港举办宣传活动，邀请专家和受益者分享他们的经验和见解，让更多人了解到“广东院舍计划”的好处和可行性。 5. 放宽申请条件限制：为了让香港老年人免受长时间等候的困扰，广东可以适度放宽“广东院舍计划”和“综援长者广东省养老计划”的申请条件限制。可以考虑根据老年人的实际需求和状况，调整收入要求、身体条件等限制性条件，以提高申请的灵活性和容易程度。这样可以更好地满足香港居民的养老需求，减少等候时间，让他们尽早享受到高质量的养老服务。 6. 加强政策扶持和协调机制：为了更好地支持和推动“广东院舍计划”的实施，广东可以加强政策扶持和协调机制。可以完善资金支持政策，提供更多资金补贴和贷款支持，鼓励更多机构参与养老服务的提供。同时，可以建立跨部门的协调机制，加强政府间的合作与沟通，推动相关政策的衔接和落地。这样可以为“广东院舍计划”提供更加有力的支持，进一步提高香港居民的申请和受益的便利程度。"},{"prompt":"I have already added layer in AWS Lambda but still get error \\"Unable to import module \'lambda_function\': No module named \'AWSIoTPythonSDK\'\\", what should I do next","completion":"If you are encountering the error \\"No module named \'AWSIoTPythonSDK\'\\" in AWS Lambda, it means that the Lambda execution environment is unable to find the necessary AWS IoT SDK library.

Scope Three emissions are indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur as a result of an organization\'s activities but are not directly owned or controlled by the organization. They encompass emissions occurring in the value chain, including activities such as transportation and distribution of products, use of sold products, waste generated from products, employee commuting, and business travel. Driving a gasoline-fueled vehicle falls under the category of indirect emissions because it involves the use of a product (fuel) that emits carbon dioxide when burned, but it is not directly within the control of the organization using the vehicle."},{"prompt":"A major healthcare company has reduced its data center carbon footprint by more than 80%. What action has likely contributed to this the most? shifting from on-site data centers to the public cloud adding electric-powered cars and trucks to its fleet building individual data centers at each client site offering incentives for employees to bike or walk to work I don\'t know this yet.","completion":"The action that likely contributed the most to reducing the healthcare company\'s data center carbon footprint by more than 80% is shifting from on-site data centers to the public cloud. By migrating their data storage and computing resources to the public cloud, the healthcare company would be able to leverage the infrastructure of cloud service providers, which typically have more energy-efficient data centers. Public cloud providers often optimize their infrastructure for high energy efficiency and have measures in place to reduce carbon emissions. This transition would reduce the company\'s need to maintain and operate its own energy-consuming on-site data centers, resulting in significant carbon footprint reduction."},{"prompt":"create pdfviewer with pdf.js by javascript and add in flutter","completion":"To create a PDF viewer using pdf.js in JavaScript and integrate it into a Flutter app, you can follow these steps: 1.

These structures, along with their associated functions and macros, are vital for managing processes, scheduling, and handling waiting tasks efficiently in the Linux kernel."},{"prompt":"how to init_waitqueue_entry()","completion":"The `init_waitqueue_entry()` function is used to initialize a `wait_queue_entry`. Here is the general syntax and usage of `init_waitqueue_entry()` in the Linux kernel: ```c void init_waitqueue_entry(struct wait_queue_entry *entry, struct task_struct *task); ``` - `entry`: Pointer to the `wait_queue_entry` structure that you want to initialize. - `task`: Pointer to the `task_struct` representing the task that wants to be added to the wait queue. Usage: 1. Declare and initialize a `wait_queue_entry` structure: ```c wait_queue_entry_t my_entry; init_waitqueue_entry(&my_entry, current); ``` - `my_entry` is a `wait_queue_entry` structure that will be initialized. - `current` is a macro that represents the current task (`task_struct`) in the Linux kernel. 2. Example usage with a wait queue head: ```c wait_queue_head_t my_queue; init_waitqueue_head(&my_queue); add_wait_queue(&my_queue, &my_entry); ``` - `my_queue` is a `wait_queue_head_t` structure representing the wait queue. - `init_waitqueue_head()` initializes the wait queue head using `init_waitqueue_head()` function (not shown here). - `add_wait_queue()` is a function that adds the wait queue entry (`&my_entry`) to the specified wait queue (`&my_queue`).

FreeRTOS follows a different paradigm for task and synchronization management. However, there are similar counterparts that can be used in FreeRTOS. Here\'s how you can implement similar functionality in FreeRTOS: 1. Wait Queue Equivalent: In FreeRTOS, you can use various synchronization objects, such as semaphores, mutexes, or event groups, to achieve similar functionality as a wait queue. These objects allow tasks to wait until a certain condition is met or an event occurs. 2. Task Equivalent: In FreeRTOS, the equivalent of `task_struct` is a task control block (TCB). A TCB contains information about a task, such as its state, priority, stack, and other relevant data. Each task in FreeRTOS has a unique TCB associated with it. 3. Wait Queue Entry Equivalent: Since FreeRTOS does not have a direct equivalent to `wait_queue_entry`, you can use a data structure or a variable to store additional information about a task that is waiting. For example, you can create a structure that holds a reference to the TCB and any additional data that you need. Alternatively, you can use a simple variable or a flag to track the waiting state. It\'s important to note that FreeRTOS provides different synchronization mechanisms and design patterns compared to the Linux kernel. Therefore, the specific implementation details may vary based on the scenario and synchronization method you choose to use in FreeRTOS."},{"prompt":"use event groups, i need detailed implementation of these structs","completion":"To implement a similar functionality using event groups in FreeRTOS: 1. Event Group Equivalent (wait_queue_head_t): In FreeRTOS, you can use event groups to represent the wait queue. Event groups allow tasks to wait for specific combinations of events to occur. ```c EventGroupHandle_t myEventGroup; myEventGroup = xEventGroupCreate(); ``` - `EventGroupHandle_t` is a handle to an event group. - `xEventGroupCreate()` creates an event group and returns the handle to the event group. 2. Task Equivalent (task_struct): In FreeRTOS, each task is represented by a task handle. You can create tasks using the `xTaskCreate()` function and obtain the task handle. ```c TaskHandle_t myTaskHandle; xTaskCreate(taskFunction, \\"TaskName\\", stackSize, NULL, priority, &myTaskHandle); ``` - `TaskHandle_t` is a handle to a task. - `taskFunction` is the function to be executed by the task. - `\\"TaskName\\"` is a character string that represents the name of the task. - `stackSize` is the size of the task\'s stack. - `priority` is the priority of the task. - `&myTaskHandle` is a pointer to the variable that will store the task handle. 3. Wait Queue Entry Equivalent: In FreeRTOS, there is not a direct equivalent to `wait_queue_entry`. Instead, you can use a structure or a variable to store additional information about the waiting task, if required. ```c struct WaitQueueEntry { TaskHandle_t taskHandle; // Additional fields if needed }; struct WaitQueueEntry myEntry; myEntry.taskHandle = myTaskHandle; // Or a simple variable TaskHandle_t myHandle = myTaskHandle; ``` - `WaitQueueEntry` is a structure that holds additional information regarding the waiting task. You can add any relevant fields as needed. - `myEntry.taskHandle` or `myHandle` is set to the task handle of the waiting task. By using event groups, task handles, and associated data structures, you can implement a similar functionality to wait queues in FreeRTOS.

I found your letter and wanted to read it before I sleep so I could find you and your thoughts come to me in my dream tonight. I need to think how to answer your tans I need more time to do it right for you. However. In order for me to formulate some of the answers I need you to tell me more details of your goals so I can build a commitment Solution. For example can you tell me about your financial goals. Any goals you plan to support for family or your daughter. Your desires on how you see you want to support them in the future will impact how we find a way to do that too. There are many ways we could start a business and that depends of us. Our talents and how we plan to spend time to achieve them. For example. I could help you build a social media channel that might show people say gym exercises that you can demonstrate. We then Publish a ton of videos and let YouTube or some other channel pay us for the ads that benefit from the content we create. Another idea is we might work together to promote a traditional business like a cabinets shop. Marketing function could be sale and ads we create that feature you as a model or sale agent to promote the business. I could find many ideas that integrate you into the solution. I have camera and video skills that could focus on you to create content in many venues. But that’s not the only angle we can collaborate together on. Yes you’re very beautiful and we can find many ways to incorporate this strength of yours to success. But I am sure you have a brain and I could also teach you things that you may find a hidden talent. For example women make very good day traders for investments. In such example a journey to learn such skills is also something. I can complement you with too. Alen there are many things we can do. It’s something. We can collaborate together on and find something that works. In all cases it takes a lot of time to try anything end stay with it and this takes away from other time opportunities. What will be the best results? It’s impossible to know but in all cases I want us to be together and that commitment to each other and a team together is a constant for all paths and eventually we can find success in business. But what matters more then that is we spend time together and grow together. Doing this is sinking together as we grow closer and our relationship just getters better and deeper.

I\'m intrigued by your ideas for starting a business together. Building a social media channel and creating content that showcases fitness exercises is an interesting concept. I\'m open to exploring different avenues and using our skills to create something successful. I appreciate your belief in my beauty, but I also recognize the importance of other strengths and skills that I can bring to the table.

It serves as the main access point to the vault, and its primary function is to seal off the inhabitants from the outside world during times of disaster or threat. The vault door is typically made of heavy-duty reinforced steel, several inches thick, which is capable of withstanding intense external pressures, such as nuclear explosions or natural disasters. It is constructed with advanced engineering methods and materials to ensure maximum durability and structural integrity. The door is equipped with a complex locking mechanism, consisting of multiple large bolts and locking pins, which engage when the vault is being sealed shut. These bolts are designed to securely fasten the door, preventing any unauthorized entry or breach. One notable feature of the Vault-Tec vault door is the iconic circular design. The door is circular in shape, and it rotates horizontally to open and close, similar to a massive bank vault. The circular shape aids in distributing the force of impacts evenly, enhancing the door\'s ability to withstand external pressure. For added security, the vault door is often equipped with airtight seals and advanced filtration systems to maintain a livable atmosphere inside the vault even when the outside environment is contaminated. It can also have a small viewport or a communication device to allow communication with individuals outside the vault without compromising its integrity. Overall, the Vault-Tec vault door is a formidable barrier, built to withstand catastrophic events and ensure the safety and survival of its inhabitants. Its exceptional strength, secure locking mechanisms, and advanced features make it a symbol of protection and security in the post-apocalyptic world."},{"prompt":"where is the vault number located","completion":"The vault number is typically located on the exterior surface of the Vault-Tec vault door.

Here\'s a visual description of a Vault-Tec vault numbered 420: The vault door of Vault 420 appears just like any other standard Vault-Tec vault door. It is a massive circular door, made of reinforced steel, that stands tall and imposing. The surface of the door is a matte gray or silver color, with a smooth and slightly textured finish. In the center of the door, there is a circular plaque, approximately two feet in diameter, showcasing the distinct number \\"420.\\" The number is engraved deeply into the plaque, creating a stark contrast against the surrounding metal. The numerical characters are likely bold and robust, perhaps with a futuristic yet elegant font style. The area around the plaque may have additional symbolic or decorative elements, such as the Vault-Tec logo or other insignias related to the vault\'s purpose. These embellishments could be etched or embossed onto the door, highlighting the unique identity and significance of Vault 420.

Here\'s an implementation of the requested functions using FreeRTOS event groups and tasks: First, we will define the necessary data structures and variables: ```c #include \\"FreeRTOS.h\\" #include \\"task.h\\" typedef struct wait_queue_entry { TaskHandle_t task; struct wait_queue_entry* next; } WaitQueueEntry_t; typedef struct wait_queue_head { WaitQueueEntry_t* head; WaitQueueEntry_t* tail; EventGroupHandle_t eventGroup; } WaitQueueHead_t; ``` Now, let\'s define the functions: 1. `init_waitqueue_head()` initializes a wait queue head: ```c void init_waitqueue_head(WaitQueueHead_t* waitqueue) { waitqueue->head = NULL; waitqueue->tail = NULL; waitqueue->eventGroup = xEventGroupCreate(); } ``` 2. `init_waitqueue_entry()` initializes a wait queue entry: ```c void init_waitqueue_entry(WaitQueueEntry_t* waitqueue_entry, TaskHandle_t task) { waitqueue_entry->task = task; waitqueue_entry->next = NULL; } ``` 3. `add_wait_queue()` adds a task to the wait queue: ```c void add_wait_queue(WaitQueueHead_t* waitqueue, WaitQueueEntry_t* waitqueue_entry) { if (waitqueue->head == NULL) { waitqueue->head = waitqueue_entry; waitqueue->tail = waitqueue_entry; } else { waitqueue->tail->next = waitqueue_entry; waitqueue->tail = waitqueue_entry; } } ``` 4. `wake_up()` wakes up the first task in the wait queue: ```c void wake_up(WaitQueueHead_t* waitqueue) { WaitQueueEntry_t* first_entry = waitqueue->head; if (first_entry != NULL) { waitqueue->head = first_entry->next; if (first_entry == waitqueue->tail) { waitqueue->head = NULL; waitqueue->tail = NULL; } xEventGroupSetBits(waitqueue->eventGroup, 1); // Signal task to wake up } } ``` 5. `wake_up_all()` wakes up all tasks in the wait queue: ```c void wake_up_all(WaitQueueHead_t* waitqueue) { while (waitqueue->head != NULL) { wake_up(waitqueue); } } ``` That\'s it! You can now use these functions to implement wait queues using FreeRTOS event groups and tasks in your application.

In `add_wait_queue()`, we set the `next` pointer of the added entry to `NULL` to ensure the integrity of the linked list structure. 2. In `wake_up()`, we directly set the `next` pointer of the first entry to `NULL` after removing it from the list. This ensures that if the same entry is added back to the wait queue, its `next` pointer doesn\'t mistakenly point to another entry. 3. In `wake_up_all()`, we iterate through the wait queue, removing and notifying each entry individually. This method ensures that no lingering references to the wait queue entries are left when waking up all tasks.

Вместо использования битов (0 и 1), как в классических вычислениях, квантовые вычисления используют квантовые биты или кубиты, которые могут быть в состоянии 0 и 1 одновременно благодаря эффекту квантовой суперпозиции. Это дает возможность совершать необычные операции. Например, в классических вычислениях для проверки всех возможных комбинаций из 100 битов потребуется огромное количество операций. В квантовых вычислениях же, используя 100 кубитов, можно проверить все возможные комбинации в одной операции. Квантовые вычисления обладают еще одним важным свойством - квантовая запутанность. Это означает, что состояние одного кубита может зависеть от состояния другого кубита, даже если они находятся на большом расстоянии друг от друга. Это позволяет совершать операции над множеством кубитов одновременно, что способствует более быстрым вычислениям.

It quantifies the extent to which a distribution deviates from a normal distribution in terms of its tail behavior. Skewness can be positive, negative, or zero, indicating different types of asymmetry: 1. Positive Skewness (Right Skewness): When the tail of the distribution extends more towards the right side, it is said to be positively skewed. In a positively skewed distribution, the majority of the values are concentrated on the left side with a few extreme values on the right side. 2. Negative Skewness (Left Skewness): When the tail of the distribution extends more towards the left side, it is considered negatively skewed. In a negatively skewed distribution, the majority of the values are concentrated on the right side with a few extreme values on the left side. 3. Zero Skewness: A distribution with zero skewness is perfectly symmetrical. It means that the distribution is balanced, and the values are equally likely to occur on both sides of the mean. Skewness can be useful for understanding the shape and characteristics of a dataset. Positive or negative skewness may indicate potential outliers or data distribution patterns that are important to consider in statistical analysis.

The resulting skewness values for each column are printed, with NaN representing the columns that had NaN values and couldn\'t be calculated for skewness."},{"prompt":"skew_df[\'Skew\'] = skew_df.skew(axis = 1, skipna = True) return NaN","completion":"If the `skew()` function returns NaN when calculating the skewness on a DataFrame with NaN values, you can consider filling or imputing those missing values before calculating the skewness.

We choose to fill the NaN values with 0, but you can choose other appropriate methods for filling missing values, such as using the mean or median. Next, we calculate the skewness on the filled DataFrame using the `skew()` method, specifying `axis=1` to compute the skewness for each row. The resulting skewness values will now be available. Finally, we add the calculated skewness values to the original DataFrame `df` using `df[\'Skew\'] = skewness` and display the updated DataFrame. Note that filled NaN values may affect the skewness, so it\'s essential to consider appropriate filling strategies based on your data and research question."},{"prompt":"difference between padas.skew and scipy.stats.skew","completion":"The main difference between `pandas.skew` and `scipy.stats.skew` lies in their functionality and the types of input they accept: 1. pandas.skew: - `pandas.skew` is a function provided by the pandas library that calculates the skewness of a DataFrame or a Series. - It supports handling missing values (NaN) by excluding them from the skewness calculation. - The `axis` parameter can be used to calculate skewness across rows (`axis=0`) or columns (`axis=1`). - It provides a convenient way to calculate skewness for multiple columns or across the entire DataFrame. 2. scipy.stats.skew: - `scipy.stats.skew` is a function from the stats module of the SciPy library that calculates the skewness of an array-like object. - It is primarily designed for calculating the skewness of a 1-dimensional array or a single variable, such as a list or NumPy array. - Unlike `pandas.skew`, `scipy.stats.skew` does not handle missing values (NaN) directly. Missing values need to be handled or excluded manually before passing the data to this function. - It returns a single skewness value for the provided data. In summary, `pandas.skew` is specifically designed for calculating skewness in pandas DataFrames or Series, with built-in handling of missing values. On the other hand, `scipy.stats.skew` is more general-purpose, accepting a 1-dimensional array-like object as input but requiring additional handling of missing values before the skewness calculation."},{"prompt":"#include “FreeRTOS.h” #include “task.h” #include “event_groups.h” typedef struct wait_queue_entry { TaskHandle_t task; struct wait_queue_entry* next; } WaitQueueEntry_t; typedef struct wait_queue_head { WaitQueueEntry_t* head; WaitQueueEntry_t* tail; EventGroupHandle_t eventGroup; } WaitQueueHead_t; void init_waitqueue_head(WaitQueueHead_t* waitqueue) { waitqueue->head = NULL; waitqueue->tail = NULL; waitqueue->eventGroup = xEventGroupCreate(); } void init_waitqueue_entry(WaitQueueEntry_t* waitqueue_entry, TaskHandle_t task) { waitqueue_entry->task = task; waitqueue_entry->next = NULL; } void add_wait_queue(WaitQueueHead_t* waitqueue, WaitQueueEntry_t* waitqueue_entry) { waitqueue_entry->next = NULL; if (waitqueue->head == NULL) { waitqueue->head = waitqueue_entry; waitqueue->tail = waitqueue_entry; } else { waitqueue->tail->next = waitqueue_entry; waitqueue->tail = waitqueue_entry; } } void wake_up(WaitQueueHead_t* waitqueue) { if (waitqueue->head != NULL) { WaitQueueEntry_t* first_entry = waitqueue->head; waitqueue->head = first_entry->next; if (waitqueue->head == NULL) { waitqueue->tail = NULL; } xEventGroupSetBits(waitqueue->eventGroup, (1 << 0)); } } void wake_up_all(WaitQueueHead_t* waitqueue) { WaitQueueEntry_t* current_entry = waitqueue->head; waitqueue->head = NULL; waitqueue->tail = NULL; while (current_entry != NULL) { WaitQueueEntry_t* next_entry = current_entry->next; xEventGroupSetBits(waitqueue->eventGroup, (1 << 0)); current_entry = next_entry; } }","completion":"This code implements a wait queue data structure using FreeRTOS and event groups. The wait queue is used to manage tasks that are waiting for a certain event to occur. The wait queue is implemented using a linked list of wait queue entries. Each entry contains a reference to a task and a pointer to the next entry in the list. The wait queue head structure contains a pointer to the head and tail of the wait queue, as well as an event group handle. The event group is used to synchronize access to the wait queue. The `init_waitqueue_head` function initializes a wait queue head by setting the head and tail pointers to null and creating an event group. The `init_waitqueue_entry` function initializes a wait queue entry by setting the task reference and next pointer to null. The `add_wait_queue` function adds a wait queue entry to the end of the wait queue. If the wait queue is empty, the entry becomes both the head and tail of the list. Otherwise, it is appended to the end of the list. The `wake_up` function wakes up the first task in the wait queue by setting the event group bit. The head of the wait queue is then updated to remove the awakened task. If the wait queue becomes empty as a result, the tail pointer is also set to null. The `wake_up_all` function wakes up all tasks in the wait queue by setting the event group bit for each task. The entire wait queue is then cleared by setting the head and tail pointers to null. Note that the `xEventGroupSetBits` function is used to set a bit in the event group associated with the wait queue. This allows tasks to wait on the event group and be awakened when the corresponding bit is set. Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of a wait queue data structure using FreeRTOS and event groups."},{"prompt":"do you see any flaws in the code?","completion":"Yes, there are a few potential flaws in the code: 1. Memory Management: The current implementation does not handle memory management for the wait queue entries. The entries are assumed to be allocated externally and must be managed separately. If the entries are dynamically allocated, there should be corresponding functions for memory allocation and deallocation. 2. Event Group Usage: The code assumes that the event group is always created and managed externally. It does not include any error handling or checks to ensure that the event group is successfully created or exists. 3. Synchronization: While the event group is used to synchronize access to the wait queue, the code does not include any synchronization mechanisms to ensure atomicity while modifying the wait queue structure itself. This could lead to race conditions or inconsistent state if multiple tasks try to access or modify the wait queue concurrently. 4. Documentation: The code lacks comments and documentation, making it harder to understand the purpose and usage of each function and data structure. Adding proper comments and documentation can improve the readability and maintainability of the code. It\'s important to consider these potential flaws and address them based on the specific requirements and use cases of the wait queue implementation."},{"prompt":"improve this code","completion":"To improve the code, you can consider implementing the following changes: 1. Memory Management: Add functions for memory allocation and deallocation of wait queue entries. For example, you can create functions like `create_waitqueue_entry` and `destroy_waitqueue_entry` to handle the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. 2. Error Handling: Include error handling for event group creation. Check if the event group handle returned by `xEventGroupCreate` is not `NULL`. If it is `NULL`, handle the error appropriately (e.g., log an error message, return an error code, etc.). 3. Synchronization: To ensure atomicity while modifying the wait queue structure, you can use a mutex or semaphore to protect the critical sections of the code. For example, you can create a mutex using `xSemaphoreCreateMutex` and use functions like `xSemaphoreTake` and `xSemaphoreGive` to protect access to the wait queue data structure. 4. Documentation: Add comments to each function and data structure to describe their purpose, inputs, outputs, and any assumptions. Additionally, consider adding a README or documentation file to provide an overview of the wait queue implementation, usage examples, and any specific considerations or limitations.

Remember to adapt the code according to your specific requirements and coding standards."},{"prompt":"prove the correctness of this implementation, why it can achieve wait queue","completion":"To prove the correctness of the implementation, we can analyze its functionality and ensure that it fulfills the properties and requirements of a wait queue. A wait queue is a data structure used to manage tasks or threads that are waiting for a specific event to occur. The key operations of a wait queue include adding tasks to the queue, waking up tasks when the event occurs, and removing tasks from the queue when they are awakened. 1. Adding Tasks to the Queue (`add_wait_queue`): - The `add_wait_queue` function adds a wait queue entry to the end of the wait queue, maintaining a linked list structure. - Each entry contains a reference to a task and a pointer to the next entry. - If the wait queue is empty, the added entry becomes both the head and tail of the list. - Otherwise, the entry is appended to the end of the list. - This operation ensures that tasks waiting for an event are properly added to the wait queue until the event occurs. 2. Waking Up Tasks (`wake_up`): - The `wake_up` function wakes up the first task in the wait queue. - It sets the event group bit associated with the wait queue to indicate that the event occurred. - The head of the wait queue is then updated to remove the awakened task. - If the wait queue becomes empty as a result, the tail pointer is also set to null. - This operation ensures that the first task waiting in the queue is awakened when the associated event occurs, and the queue state is correctly updated. 3. Waking Up All Tasks (`wake_up_all`): - The `wake_up_all` function wakes up all tasks in the wait queue. - It iterates through each task in the queue and sets the event group bit to indicate that the event occurred for each task. - The wait queue is then cleared by destroying each wait queue entry and updating the head and tail pointers. - This operation ensures that all tasks waiting in the queue are awakened when the associated event occurs, and the queue state is correctly updated. Additionally, the implementation includes the following improvements: 1. Memory Management: The implementation introduces functions for creating and destroying wait queue entries, allowing for proper memory allocation and deallocation. This helps prevent memory leaks and ensures correct memory usage. 2. Synchronization: The inclusion of a mutex using a semaphore helps protect critical sections of the code, ensuring atomicity and avoiding race conditions when accessing or modifying the wait queue data structure. These improvements help to enhance the reliability and robustness of the wait queue implementation. In conclusion, the implementation achieves the functionality and properties of a wait queue, properly handling the addition of tasks, waking up tasks when the event occurs, and removing tasks from the queue. The improvements in memory management and synchronization further enhance the implementation\'s correctness and reliability."},{"prompt":"further improve this code to be more robust","completion":"To further improve the code and make it more robust, you can consider the following enhancements: 1. Error Handling: Implement error handling in critical parts of the code. For example, check if memory allocation (`pvPortMalloc`) is successful before proceeding, and handle any errors appropriately (e.g., log an error message, return an error code, etc.). Additionally, you can add error checking for semaphore and event group operations to handle any failures that may occur. 2. Boundary Checks: Add boundary checks to prevent accessing memory out of bounds. For instance, when removing the head entry in `wake_up`, check if the head pointer is `NULL` before updating it, to avoid any potential issues. 3. Safety Measures: Consider adding safety measures to handle edge cases. For instance, in `wake_up_all`, skip waking up tasks if the wait queue is already empty, to avoid unnecessary operations and prevent potential issues. 4. Memory Leak Prevention: Implement proper memory deallocation. Ensure that all dynamically allocated memory, such as wait queue entries, is correctly freed when it is no longer needed. This prevents memory leaks and improves the overall robustness of the code. 5. Documentation and Comments: Improve documentation and comments throughout the code to make it more understandable and maintainable.

It contains a `TaskHandle_t` member to store the handle of the task that is waiting, and a `next` member to link the entries together. The `WaitQueueHead_t` structure represents the wait queue itself. It contains pointers to the head and tail of the queue, an `EventGroupHandle_t` to signal the waiting tasks when they are woken up, and a `SemaphoreHandle_t` to protect the queue operations. The `init_waitqueue_head` function initializes a wait queue by creating an event group and a mutex semaphore. The `create_waitqueue_entry` function creates a wait queue entry for a specific task. It allocates memory for the entry, sets the task handle, and initializes the next pointer. The `destroy_waitqueue_entry` function frees the memory of a wait queue entry. The `add_wait_queue` function adds a wait queue entry to the end of the wait queue. It takes the wait queue and entry as parameters, and uses the mutex semaphore to protect the queue operations. It first sets the next pointer of the entry to NULL, then checks if the queue is empty. If it is, the entry becomes the head and tail of the queue. Otherwise, the entry is appended to the tail of the queue. The `wake_up` function wakes up the first task in the wait queue. It takes the wait queue as a parameter, and uses the mutex semaphore to protect the queue operations. It checks if the queue is not empty. If it is not, it removes the first entry from the queue, updates the head and tail if necessary, and sets the event group to wake up the waiting task. The `wake_up_all` function wakes up all tasks in the wait queue. It takes the wait queue as a parameter, and uses the mutex semaphore to protect the queue operations. It iterates through all entries in the queue, sets the event group to wake up each task, frees the memory of each entry, and updates the head and tail of the queue."},{"prompt":"improve this code","completion":"Here are some improvements you can make to the code: 1. Use `uxTaskPriorityGet` and `vTaskPrioritySet` functions to save and restore the priority of the task when it enters and exits the wait queue. This ensures that the task\'s priority is not permanently changed while waiting. 2. Avoid unnecessary context switches by checking if the task is already in the wait queue before adding it. This can be done by comparing task handles instead of searching the entire queue. 3. Instead of using an event group and setting a single bit to wake up tasks, you can use a task notification mechanism such as `xTaskNotifyGive` and `xTaskNotifyWait`. This allows you to wake up specific tasks or all tasks in the wait queue without relying on a single bit. 4. Handle error scenarios such as when memory allocation fails or when acquiring and releasing the mutex semaphore fails.

Таким образом, мы сможем общаться чаще и, возможно, договориться о встрече... Каков будет твой ответ? Я молюсь, чтобы это было \\"да\\"... И да, я хотела бы задать тебе несколько вопросов. Каким образом ты реагируешь на фильмы про Индиану Джонса? Какая твоя любимая часть из всех фильмов о нем? Ты уже был во Франции или это будет твое первое посещение? Как долго планируешь пробыть в Ницце? Возможно, можешь порекомендовать мне какие-то интересные места для посещения там? Алекса, позволь мне попросить тебя остаться на сайте, где мы познакомились. Ведь мне сложно понимать твои письма без помощи переводчика. К тому же, переводчик помогает мне учить английский. Бывает, что у меня возникают проблемы с интернетом, и в таких случаях я могу просто написать письмо и диктовать его переводчику по телефону, а затем отправить его тебе. Это сделает наше общение более стабильным и позволит мне быстрее отвечать на твои письма. Возможно, ты можешь рассказать мне больше о себе? Я очень хочу узнать о твоих интересах, мечтах и целях в жизни. Также, если у тебя есть какие-то вопросы ко мне, с удовольствием на них отвечу. Жду твоего ответа и надеюсь на положительный результат. Уважительно, Алекса (Добавлено эмодзи - 🌹) P.S.

The `wait_queue_entry` struct represents an entry in the wait queue. It contains a `task` field which stores the handle of the task to be executed when the task is woken up, and a `next` field which stores the pointer to the next entry in the wait queue. The `wait_queue_head` struct represents the head of the wait queue.

If any pointer is `NULL`, the function returns immediately and no further actions are performed. This helps prevent crashes or unexpected behavior due to invalid memory access. Additionally, in the `init_waitqueue_head` function, we added error handling to check if the event group creation was successful.

For example: ```json { \\"extends\\": [\\"eslint:recommended\\", \\"plugin:prettier/recommended\\"] } ``` This configuration will extend the recommended ESLint rules and also add the Prettier rules as plugins. 2. If you are not using Prettier and don\'t want to integrate it with ESLint, you can disable the ESLint configuration that relates to Prettier. - Look for a specific ESLint rule that is causing the error, such as `prettier/...`, in your ESLint configuration file. - Comment out or remove the rule so that ESLint will not attempt to analyze or enforce Prettier-related formatting. For example, change: ```json { \\"rules\\": { \\"prettier/prettier\\": \\"error\\" } } ``` to: ```json { \\"rules\\": { // \\"prettier/prettier\\": \\"error\\" } } ``` This will disable the specific rule causing the error.

В Three.js есть несколько типов материалов, которые предоставляют эту функциональность, например MeshPhongMaterial или MeshStandardMaterial. Однако, по умолчанию они не будут работать с объектами типа LineSegments. Один из способов реализации отражения света для каждого сегмента - использовать ShaderMaterial и реализовать соответствующие освещенные шейдеры самостоятельно. Вот пример кода, показывающий, как применить отражение света для каждого сегмента с помощью ShaderMaterial: Vertex Shader: ```glsl attribute vec3 color; varying vec3 vColor; varying vec3 vPosition; void main() { vColor = color; vPosition = position; // Прочие операции трансформации вершин gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0); } ``` Fragment Shader: ```glsl varying vec3 vColor; varying vec3 vPosition; uniform vec3 directionalLightColor; uniform vec3 directionalLightPosition; uniform vec3 ambientLightColor; void main() { vec3 normal = normalize(cross(dFdx(vPosition), dFdy(vPosition))); vec3 lightDirection = normalize(directionalLightPosition - vPosition); vec3 lightReflection = reflect(-lightDirection, normal); float intensity = max(dot(normal, lightDirection), 0.0); vec3 totalLight = ambientLightColor + (directionalLightColor * intensity); gl_FragColor = vec4(vColor * totalLight, 1.0); } ``` JavaScript код: ```javascript const geometry = new THREE.Geometry(); const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({ vertexShader: document.getElementById(\'vertexShader\').textContent, fragmentShader: document.getElementById(\'fragmentShader\').textContent, uniforms: { directionalLightColor: { value: new THREE.Color(0xffffff) }, directionalLightPosition: { value: new THREE.Vector3(1, 1, 1) }, ambientLightColor: { value: new THREE.Color(0x222222) }, }, }); // Создание вершин и добавление их в геометрию const line = new THREE.LineSegments(geometry, material); ``` В этом примере мы используем ShaderMaterial с определенными вручную вершинными и фрагментными шейдерами. В фрагментном шейдере мы рассчитываем освещение для каждого сегмента, используя стандартные модели освещения, такие как фоновое освещение и направленное освещение. Важно учесть, что в данном примере нам пришлось вручную рассчитать нормаль по позиции сегмента. Это может быть сложнее, чем использование геометрии с полигонами, поскольку у сегментов нет плоской поверхности для рассчета нормали. В зависимости от ваших потребностей, вам может потребоваться более сложная логика для расчета нормалей или использование других типов геометрии, которые поддерживают освещение в Three.js."},{"prompt":"how split string in postgresql?","completion":"In PostgreSQL, you can split a string using the SPLIT_PART function or the string_to_array function. 1.

Here\'s the syntax for using SPLIT_PART function: ``` SPLIT_PART(string, delimiter, position) ``` - `string`: The input string that you want to split. - `delimiter`: The character or substring at which you want to split the string. - `position`: The index (starting from 1) of the substring you want to return. Example: ``` SELECT SPLIT_PART(\'Hello,World,John,Doe\', \',\', 2); ``` This query will split the string \'Hello,World,John,Doe\' by comma `,` and return the second substring \'World\'. 2.

Это означает, что код, содержащийся внутри useEffect, будет выполнен каждый раз, когда одна из этих зависимостей изменится. Внутри useEffect определена асинхронная функция `searchPromo`, которая выполняет отправку запроса на основе значений `promo_id`, `search` и `categ`. Если значения необходимых полей соответствуют условиям (не равны пустой строке), то выполняется запрос к API и результаты сохраняются в Redux store через диспетчер `dispatch`.

Рассмотрим более подробно каждый из подходов, использующих хук `useEffect`, чтобы отправить запрос при изменении `promo_id`. 1. Использование `setPromo_id` с колбэком: ```jsx const searchPromoC = () => { const regex = /ID(d+)/; const match = search.value.match(regex); if (match) { setPromo_id(match[1], () => { const dataS = { promoID: promo_id, searchText: search.value, promoCategoryId: categ, }; dispatch(searchPromosp(dataS)); }); } }; ``` В этом подходе мы вызываем `setPromo_id` с новым значением `promo_id` и передаем ему колбэк функцию, которая будет выполнена после обновления состояния. В колбэке мы формируем объект `dataS` с использованием нового значения `promo_id`, `search` и `categ`, и отправляем запрос с помощью `dispatch` и `searchPromosp`. Этот подход гарантирует, что запрос будет выполнен с использованием актуального значения `promo_id`, после его обновления. 2. Использование `useEffect`: ```jsx useEffect(() => { const dataS = { promoID: promo_id, searchText: search.value, promoCategoryId: categ, }; dispatch(searchPromosp(dataS)); }, [promo_id]); ``` Здесь мы используем хук `useEffect`, передавая ему колбэк функцию и массив зависимостей `[promo_id]`. Внутри колбэк функции формируется объект `dataS` с использованием текущего значения `promo_id`, `search` и `categ`, и отправляется запрос с помощью `dispatch` и `searchPromosp`. Как только значение `promo_id` изменяется, эффект будет срабатывать и отправлять запрос с использованием нового значения `promo_id`. Оба подхода являются правильными, и выбор между ними зависит от ваших предпочтений и требований приложения. Если вам нужно выполнить дополнительные действия после обновления состояния `promo_id`, то первый подход может быть полезным. Если вам просто нужно отправить запрос с использованием нового значения `promo_id`, то второй подход более простой и прямолинейный."},{"prompt":"в первом варианте, что произойдет если match не удовлетворяет условию","completion":"Если условие `match` не удовлетворяется, то `setPromo_id` не будет вызываться, и значением `promo_id` останется его предыдущее значение. Следовательно, в коде с использованием `setPromo_id` с колбэком, если `match` не удовлетворяет условию, то колбэк функция внутри `setPromo_id` не будет выполнена и запрос не будет отправлен. В этом случае, значение `promo_id` останется неизменным и запрос будет отправлен с использованием предыдущего значения `promo_id`, если оно было установлено ранее. Если вам нужно предусмотреть обработку случая, когда `match` не удовлетворяет условию, вы можете добавить соответствующую логику. Например, вы можете проверить, удовлетворяет ли `match` условию, и если нет, то выполнить соответствующее действие (например, вывести сообщение об ошибке или очистить значение `promo_id`). Вот пример, как это может быть реализовано: ```jsx const searchPromoC = () => { const regex = /ID(d+)/; const match = search.value.match(regex); if (match) { setPromo_id(match[1], () => { const dataS = { promoID: promo_id, searchText: search.value, promoCategoryId: categ, }; dispatch(searchPromosp(dataS)); }); } else { console.log(\\"Invalid promo ID\\"); setPromo_id(\\"\\"); } }; ``` В этом примере, если `match` не удовлетворяет условию, будет напечатано сообщение об ошибке через `console.log`, и значение `promo_id` будет сброшено на пустую строку. Вы можете адаптировать эту логику в соответствии с вашими потребностями."},{"prompt":"а где во втором случае проверка на id","completion":"Второй вариант кода, использующий хук `useEffect`, не содержит проверки на `promo_id`. Вместо этого, он решает проблему автоматического вызова запроса каждый раз, когда `promo_id` изменяется, путем включения `promo_id` в массив зависимостей внутри `useEffect`. ```jsx useEffect(() => { const dataS = { promoID: promo_id, searchText: search.value, promoCategoryId: categ, }; dispatch(searchPromosp(dataS)); }, [promo_id]); ``` В этом примере, когда `promo_id` изменяется (посредством вызова `setPromo_id` в другой части кода), хук `useEffect` срабатывает автоматически. Он формирует объект `dataS` с актуальным значением `promo_id`, `search` и `categ`, и отправляет запрос с помощью `dispatch` и `searchPromosp`. Если вам нужно добавить дополнительную проверку на `promo_id` перед отправкой запроса, вы можете включить эту проверку внутри `useEffect`. Например: ```jsx useEffect(() => { if (promo_id.length > 0) { const dataS = { promoID: promo_id, searchText: search.value, promoCategoryId: categ, }; dispatch(searchPromosp(dataS)); } }, [promo_id]); ``` В этом примере, перед выполнением запроса, добавлена проверка `if (promo_id.length > 0)`. Таким образом, запрос будет отправлен только в том случае, если значение `promo_id` имеет длину больше 0 (т.е. не является пустым или `undefined`). Вы можете изменить эту проверку на основе своих требований."},{"prompt":"а как тогда мне вызвать функцию searchPromoC","completion":"Чтобы вызвать функцию `searchPromoC` из другого места в вашем коде, например, при нажатии кнопки или в ответ на другое событие, вам нужно обеспечить доступ к этой функции извне компонента `Promo`. Вариант 1: Передача функции через пропсы Если компонент `Promo` отображается внутри родительского компонента и вы хотите вызвать функцию `searchPromoC` из родительского компонента, вы можете передать эту функцию через пропсы: ```jsx const ParentComponent = () => { const handleSearchButtonClick = () => { // Вызываем функцию searchPromoC из родительского компонента promoRef.current.searchPromoC(); }; const promoRef = useRef(); return ( <div> <Promo ref={promoRef} /> <button onClick={handleSearchButtonClick}>Search</button> </div> ); }; const Promo = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => { const [promo_id, setPromo_id] = useState(\\"\\"); const [search, setSearch] = useState(\\"\\"); const [categ, setCateg] = useState(\\"\\"); const dispatch = useDispatch(); const searchPromoC = () => { // Код поиска промо и отправки запроса }; useEffect(() => { // Код с использованием useEffect }, [promo_id]); // Передаем функцию searchPromoC через ref useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({ searchPromoC })); return ( // Остальная разметка компонента ); }); ``` Здесь мы передаем `promoRef` в `Promo` компонент с использованием `ref`. В `Promo` компоненте мы используем `useRef` для получения этой ссылки и используем `useImperativeHandle` для экспорта функции `searchPromoC` через `ref`. Затем мы используем эту ссылку `promoRef` в родительском компоненте, чтобы вызвать функцию `searchPromoC` при нажатии кнопки.

However, here are some common criteria that can be considered: 1. Employee Satisfaction: Measure and monitor employee satisfaction with work-life balance initiatives through surveys and feedback mechanisms. This can include asking employees about their level of stress, available support, flexibility, and overall satisfaction with work-life balance. 2. Absenteeism and Turnover Rates: Monitor the absenteeism and turnover rates within the organization. High rates of absenteeism and turnover may indicate that work-life balance initiatives are not effectively meeting employee needs. 3. Work Hours and Overtime: Evaluate and monitor the average work hours and overtime hours required by employees. Excessive overtime or consistently long work hours can indicate a lack of work-life balance. 4. Productivity and Performance: Assess employee productivity and performance metrics to determine if work-life balance initiatives positively impact employee performance. This can include analyzing indicators such as task completion, quality of work, and meeting deadlines. 5. Utilization of Flexible Work Arrangements: Track the utilization of flexible work arrangements, such as remote work, compressed workweeks, or flexible scheduling. Monitoring the uptake and effectiveness of these options can provide insights into their impact on work-life balance. 6. Employee Well-being: Evaluate the overall well-being of employees by monitoring factors such as stress levels, mental health, physical health, and work-related injuries or illnesses. Regularly survey employees to assess their perception of work-life balance and well-being. 7. Work-Life Balance Policy Compliance: Monitor the adherence and compliance with work-life balance policies within the organization. This can include tracking employee utilization of vacation days, time-off requests, and adherence to guidelines for work-life balance. 8. Employee Engagement and Retention: Assess employee engagement levels and retention rates to understand if work-life balance initiatives contribute to a positive work environment and higher employee loyalty. 9. Cost-Benefit Analysis: Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the financial impact of work-life balance initiatives.

Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are a diverse group of aggressive lymphoid malignancies originating from mature T-cells. They are generally associated with a poorer prognosis compared to B-cell lymphomas. Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, are commonly used in the treatment of PTCL as part of combination chemotherapy regimens. Peripheral blood and bone marrow infiltration are commonly observed in patients with PTCL, and their presence has been shown to be associated with worse prognosis. The extent of infiltration in these compartments can indicate the disease burden and reflect an increased risk of relapse or treatment resistance. Several studies have investigated the prognostic significance of peripheral blood and bone marrow involvement in PTCL patients receiving alkylating-rich chemotherapy. These studies have shown that the presence of peripheral blood and bone marrow infiltration is associated with a significantly shorter overall survival and progression-free survival. This suggests that these patients may require more aggressive treatment strategies or alternative therapeutic approaches. Additionally, the persistence of peripheral blood and bone marrow infiltration after completion of chemotherapy has also been shown to be a negative prognostic factor. These patients are more likely to experience disease relapse or progression. To improve the outcome of PTCL patients with peripheral blood and bone marrow infiltration, novel therapeutic approaches are being explored. These include the use of targeted therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted agents that specifically inhibit the molecular pathways driving the growth and survival of PTCL cells.

Bu kod, basit bir seri iletişim senaryosunu simüle eder ve gönderilen veriye örneğin bir başlık, veri ve checksum ekler: ```csharp using System; public class SerialCommunication { // Gönderilen paketi hazırlar ve geri döner private byte[] PreparePacket(byte[] data) { int packetLength = data.Length + 4; // Başlık(2 byte) + Veri + Checksum(2 byte) byte[] packet = new byte[packetLength]; // Başlık packet[0] = (byte)(packetLength >> 8); // Üst byte packet[1] = (byte)(packetLength & 0xFF); // Alt byte // Veri Buffer.BlockCopy(data, 0, packet, 2, data.Length); // Checksum ushort checksum = CalculateChecksum(packet, packetLength - 2); // Checksum, başlık ve veri kısmından hesaplanır packet[packetLength - 2] = (byte)(checksum >> 8); // Checksum üst byte packet[packetLength - 1] = (byte)(checksum & 0xFF); // Checksum alt byte return packet; } // Paketin checksum değerini hesaplayıp geri döner private ushort CalculateChecksum(byte[] data, int length) { ushort checksum = 0; for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) { checksum += data[i]; } return checksum; } // Örnek kullanım public static void Main() { SerialCommunication serialCommunication = new SerialCommunication(); byte[] data = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; // Gönderilecek veri byte[] packet = serialCommunication.PreparePacket(data); // Paketi hazırla // Paketi seri cihaza gönderme işlemi burada gerçekleştirilir // ... Console.WriteLine(\\"Paket gönderildi: \\" + BitConverter.ToString(packet)); } } ``` Bu örnekte, `PreparePacket` metodu bir veri paketi oluşturmak için kullanılır. Başlık, veri ve checksum, `packet` byte dizisine eklenir ve sonuç olarak oluşturulan paket geri döndürülür. `CalculateChecksum` metodu ise veri paketinin checksum değerini hesaplar. Ana fonksiyonda, örnek bir veri `data` oluşturulur ve bu veri `PreparePacket` metoduna gönderilir. Dönen paket seri cihaza gönderildikten sonra sonuç ekrana yazdırılır. Bu kod bir temel örnek sunmaktadır ve gerçek bir senaryo ile değiştirilmesi ve uyarlanması gerekebilir."},{"prompt":"seri kanaldan mcu\'ya veri gönderilirken kaç byte kullanılır?","completion":"Seri kanaldan MCU\'ya veri gönderirken kullanılan byte sayısı, verinin kendisiyle birlikte başlık, checksum ve paket uzunluğunu içeren tüm veri bölümlerine bağlıdır. Genellikle, başlık bölümü paket uzunluğunu belirlemek için en az 2 byte, checksum bölümü en az 2 byte ve veri bölümü ise verinin boyutuna bağlı olarak değişir. Başka ilave bilgiler varsa, bu da ek byte\'lar gerektirebilir. Örneğin, bir başlık bölümü 2 byte, checksum bölümü 2 byte ve 10 byte veriden oluşan bir paket için, toplamda 14 byte kullanılacaktır. Bu, yalnızca temel örnek bir paket yapısıdır ve gerçek bir senaryoda kullanılacak paket yapısına ve protokol gereksinimlerine bağlı olarak değişkenlik gösterecektir."},{"prompt":"请扮演专业的新闻资讯编辑，改写下面的新闻内容，禁止输出任何AI写作提示 ：沙漠里有湖吗、能否长出水草呢?当然可以，不过是海市蜃楼。据央视网报道，连日来，新疆吐鲁番市鄯善县持续高温天气，库木塔格沙漠东南部出现了“海市蜃楼”景象，只见沙漠上隐约出现了一片波光粼粼的湖面，并且有水草在湖面漂荡，走近之后却发现还是一片沙漠。有游客表示，自己来到库木塔格沙漠第一次见到了海市蜃楼，之前只是课本里面见过，站远处时没有任何东西，但是明显看过去就是树，还有房子什么的，现场看感觉很神奇很壮观!海市蜃楼当然看得见摸不着，因为本质上，它就是光的折射现象，其实看到的湖泊水草都是真实存在的，但在很远很远的地方，这种景观在沙漠海上比较常见，在一定范围之内的空间空气湿度、厚度比较大，能形成一个巨大的透镜系统，进而将远处景观投射过来。近期全国多地高温频发，在沙漠、沿海等地区，由于近地气温和高空差距较大，因此给海市蜃楼提供了良好的出现环境，也得以让很多人亲眼看到了只能在书本和屏幕里才能看到的奇景。","completion":"新疆吐鲁番市鄯善县的库木塔格沙漠东南部最近出现了一幅壮观的景象，被称为“海市蜃楼”。据央视网报道，连日来，该地区持续高温，由于近地气温和高空温差较大，在一定范围内的空气湿度和厚度增加，造成了一个巨大的透镜系统，结果使得远处的湖泊和水草影像被投射出来。游客纷纷表示首次亲眼见到海市蜃楼，观赏时既神奇又壮观。 尽管海市蜃楼在本质上是光的折射现象，但观测到的湖泊和水草影像确实存在于远方。这种现象在沙漠和沿海等地相对较为常见，因为这些地方的空气湿度和厚度使其成为适合形成透镜系统的环境。近期全国多地高温天气进一步为海市蜃楼的出现提供了机会，让许多人亲眼目睹了平时只能在书本和屏幕上看到的奇景。"},{"prompt":"constexpr int *p 类似于 int *p const？我是说语义","completion":"是的，两者的语义是相似的。都是将指针声明为常量，即不能通过指针来修改所指向的内容。区别在于语法上的差别，`constexpr int *p`将指针本身声明为常量，而`int *p const`将所指向的内容声明为常量。在两者中，都不能通过指针来修改所指向的内容。"},{"prompt":"这很容易误解 因为和C的写法不一致","completion":"是的，C++中的`constexpr int *p`和C中的`int *p const`在语法上确实是不一致的，可能会引起误解。 在C++中，`constexpr`是用来声明常量表达式的，而`constexpr int *p`表示将p声明为一个指向整数的常量指针。这意味着指针的值不能被改变，但可以通过指针来修改所指向的内容。 在C中，`int *p const`表示将p声明为一个常量指针，也就是说指针的值不能被改变，但可以通过指针来修改所指向的内容。 因此，在C++中，`constexpr int *p`和C中的`int *p const`在语义上是相似的，但在语法上是不一致的，可能会引起误解。"},{"prompt":"我的意思是 它出现在 *号 左边，却修饰的是指针","completion":"抱歉我之前理解有误。实际上，在C++中，`constexpr int *p`和`int *p const`在语义上是不同的。 `constexpr int *p`将指针p声明为一个指向整数的常量指针，并且这个指针是一个常量表达式，即在编译时就能确定其值，且不能被修改。 而`int *p const`将指针p声明为一个常量指针，指针的值不能被修改，但可以通过指针来修改所指向的内容。 因此，虽然在C++中两者的语法可能会有些混淆，但是它们的语义还是有区别的。"},{"prompt":"总结下就是constexpr 不太适合修饰指针，很容易误解","completion":"是的，`constexpr`不太适合用来修饰指针，因为它的语法容易引起误解。在C++中，`constexpr`主要用于修饰常量表达式，而不是指针类型。 当我们使用`constexpr`修饰指针时，可能会让人误解指针本身是一个常量，而实际上`constexpr int *p`表示的是将指针p声明为一个常量表达式，而不是将指针本身声明为常量。 为了避免误解，推荐使用其他关键字来修饰指针，例如`const int *p`表示将p声明为一个指向常量的指针，或者`int *const p`表示将p声明为一个常量指针。这样更符合C的习惯，并且更容易理解。"},{"prompt":"如果我要让一个数组的长度是常量，那么这个常量用什么类型比较好, 比如 char foo[MAX_LEN]","completion":"如果你想让一个数组的长度是一个常量，可以使用`constexpr`来声明一个常量变量，并将其作为数组的长度。 对于数组长度，可以选择使用`std::size_t`类型来表示数组的大小。`std::size_t`是无符号整数类型，它的大小足够大以容纳任何对象的大小。 下面是一个示例： ```cpp #include <iostream> constexpr std::size_t MAX_LEN = 100; int main() { char foo[MAX_LEN]; std::cout << \\"Size of \'foo\' array: \\" << sizeof(foo) << std::endl; return 0; } ``` 在上述示例中，`MAX_LEN`被声明为一个`constexpr`常量，它的值为100。然后，将`MAX_LEN`作为数组`foo`的长度。这样，`foo`的长度在编译时就确定为100。 使用`std::size_t`来表示数组的长度可以保证在各个平台上具有良好的移植性，并且能够适应非常大的数组。"},{"prompt":"size_t 比较适合当数组的长度吗","completion":"`std::size_t`是一种无符号整数类型，通常用于表示对象的大小或容器的大小。在C++中，它也常用于表示数组的长度。 `std::size_t`在表示非负整数非常有效，并且足够大以容纳任何对象的大小。它的大小在不同平台上可能会有所变化，但它通常被设计为能够容纳系统中最大可能的对象的大小。 因此，通常情况下，`std::size_t`是一个适合用于表示数组的长度的类型。 当然，根据具体的需求和情况，你也可以选择其他类型来表示数组的长度，比如`int`、`unsigned int`等。但使用`std::size_t`类型具有良好的习惯并且更符合C++标准库的惯例。同时，使用此类型可以确保你的代码在各个平台上具有良好的移植性。"},{"prompt":"如果是C的话 #define MAX_LEN 32 这直接就是字面值了吧","completion":"是的，如果你在C中使用`#define MAX_LEN 32`，那么`MAX_LEN`会被视为一个字面值常量。这意味着编译器在编译时会直接将`MAX_LEN`替换为32。 在C中，使用预处理指令`#define`来定义宏，可以将标识符替换为一个常量值。因此，`#define MAX_LEN 32`会将所有的`MAX_LEN`替换为32。这种方式在C中广泛使用，可以用来定义常量值，包括数组的长度。 ```c #include <stdio.h> #define MAX_LEN 32 int main() { char foo[MAX_LEN]; printf(\\"Size of \'foo\' array: %lun\\", sizeof(foo)); return 0; } ``` 在上述示例中，`MAX_LEN`被定义为32，然后它在代码中被直接替换为32。这样，数组`foo`的长度在编译时就确定为32。"},{"prompt":"那么字面值MAX_LEN 一般会被解释为什么类型","completion":"在C中，字面值不是一个具体的类型，而是根据上下文来确定其类型。对于整数类型的字面值，会根据其大小和有无符号来选择合适的整数类型。 根据C语言标准，整数常量的类型可能是`int`、`long int`、`unsigned int`、`unsigned long int`等，具体取决于字面值的大小和符号。 以下是一些常见情况下的类型推断： - 对于没有后缀的十进制整数常量，默认情况下会被解释为`int`类型。 - 对于超出`int`范围的十进制整数常量，会按照`long int`来解释。例如，2147483648会被解释为`long int`。 - 对于没有后缀的八进制或十六进制整数常量，默认情况下会被解释为`int`类型。 - 对于超出`int`范围的八进制或十六进制整数常量，会按照`unsigned int`、`long int`、`unsigned long int`来解释，具体取决于大小和后缀。 - 对于带有`U`后缀的整数常量，将被解释为`unsigned int`类型。 - 对于带有`L`后缀的整数常量，将被解释为`long int`类型。 - 对于带有`UL`或`LU`后缀的整数常量，将被解释为`unsigned long int`类型。 因此，如果你在C中使用`#define MAX_LEN 32`，那么`MAX_LEN`会被解释为`int`类型的字面值常量。"},{"prompt":"比如我要定义一个树的最大深度，MAX_LEVEL 还是MAX_LEVELS 好","completion":"在这种情况下，选择`MAX_LEVEL`和`MAX_LEVELS`之间的最佳选项可以取决于个人喜好或具体上下文。 一般来说，`MAX_LEVEL`更适合表示单个树的最大深度，而`MAX_LEVELS`更适合表示多个树的最大深度。 如果你只考虑一个树的最大深度，使用`MAX_LEVEL`会更符合语义。例如： ```c #define MAX_LEVEL 10 ``` 然而，如果你要考虑多个树的最大深度，使用`MAX_LEVELS`会更好一些。例如： ```c #define MAX_LEVELS 5 ``` 综上所述，选择`MAX_LEVEL`还是`MAX_LEVELS`应该根据你的需求和代码的上下文来决定。无论如何，选择一个有意义且符合逻辑的名称对于代码的可读性和可维护性都非常重要。"},{"prompt":"那如果是一个游戏的最大关卡数量， 用MAX_LEVEL 还是MAX_LEVELS更合适呢","completion":"对于游戏的最大关卡数量，可以根据具体的语境和个人偏好来选择变量名。 一般来说，如果你只考虑一个游戏的最大关卡数量，使用`MAX_LEVEL`会更适合。这是因为`MAX_LEVEL`更强调单个关卡的最大数量。例如： ```c #define MAX_LEVEL 20 ``` 然而，如果你要考虑多个游戏的最大关卡数量，或者你的代码中存在多个关卡相关的变量，那么使用`MAX_LEVELS`可能更合适。这可以更清晰地表示有多个关卡集合，每个集合都有自己的最大关卡数量。例如： ```c #define MAX_LEVELS 5 ``` 总之，选择`MAX_LEVEL`还是`MAX_LEVELS`应该根据具体的需求和代码的上下文来决定。重要的是使用有意义且能清晰表达变量含义的名称，以提高代码的可读性和维护性。"},{"prompt":"只是一个游戏，里面比如有10个关卡","completion":"如果游戏中只有固定的10个关卡，那么使用`MAX_LEVEL`会更适合。因为在这种情况下，关卡数量是单个确定的值，不需要使用复数形式。 ```c #define MAX_LEVEL 10 ``` 通过使用`MAX_LEVEL`，你可以在代码中使用这个常量来表示游戏的最大关卡数量，例如循环遍历关卡或者进行关卡的索引。 使用单数形式的`MAX_LEVEL`可以更准确地传达其语义，让代码更容易理解和维护。所以在你的情况下，选择`MAX_LEVEL`会是更合适的选择。"},{"prompt":"请给出国家统计局统计报表制度的组织与实施细则，并给出网址","completion":"国家统计局统计报表制度的组织与实施细则可以参考《国家统计局统计报表制度实施细则》。具体内容包括报表的编制、填报、审核、发布和使用等方面的规定。 目前，官方网站上并未公布全文，可能需要通过其他途径获取详细信息。 您可以尝试在国家统计局的官方网站（http://www.stats.gov.cn/）上搜索相关资源，或者咨询相关部门以获取更详细的信息。"},{"prompt":"给出统计报表制度的组织与实施相关文件及下载链接","completion":"很抱歉，我无法直接为您提供关于统计报表制度的相关文件及下载链接。由于法规和政策有可能随时被更新，我无法提供最新版本的文件。 您可以尝试在国家统计局的官方网站（http://www.stats.gov.cn/）上搜索相关资源，或直接联系国家统计局以获取最新的文件或相关信息。 请注意，国家统计局的官方网站可能提供相关法规、政策和报表制度的文件下载，但您需要浏览官方网站并搜索相关资源以获取具体的文件和下载链接。"},{"prompt":"For the hydogen neptune project, was there an exemption to the grid connection rule?","completion":"As of my knowledge, there is no specific information available about an exemption to the grid connection rule for the hydrogen Neptune project.
