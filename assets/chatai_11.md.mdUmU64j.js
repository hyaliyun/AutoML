Next, let's calculate how many glass jars Jenny can carry without exceeding the weight limit. Since each glass jar weighs 8 ounces, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one glass jar: 60 ounces / 8 ounces/glass jar = 7.5 glass jars Since Jenny can't carry half a glass jar, she can carry 7 glass jars. The weight of these glass jars is: 7 glass jars * 8 ounces/glass jar = 56 ounces Now, let's subtract the weight of the glass jars from the remaining weight to find out how much weight is left for bottles: 60 ounces - 56 ounces = 4 ounces Since each bottle weighs 6 ounces and Jenny only has 4 ounces of carrying capacity left, she can't carry any more bottles.

This means that the selling price that would have given him a 14% profit is: SP (for 14% profit) = CP + (14% of CP) SP (for 14% profit) = Rs. 7450 + (0.14 × Rs. 7450) SP (for 14% profit) = Rs. 7450 + Rs. 1043 SP (for 14% profit) = Rs. 8493 Now, we know that the actual selling price (SP) was Rs. 2086 less than this amount.

We introduce an important concept: an excellent line ( e ) with respect to vertex ( A ) of the triangle is one that divides the angle ( angle BAC ) into two parts such that the triangle cut off by ( e ) from the area of ( ABC ) is exactly half of the total area, i.e., ( frac{t}{2} ). Note that every median is an excellent line for two vertices, but not necessarily for the third vertex as it might not pass through internal points of the sides opposite to ( A ) (see Figure 1). [ text{Figure 1: Illustration showing (Delta ABC) and the medians.} ] For a given median ( f ), let ( d(f) ) denote the segment of ( f ) inside the triangle. If ( e ) is an excellent line, then let ( d^{*}(e) ) be the length of the segment of ( e ) within the appropriate angle segment. If ( f ) is a median, then by definition, ( d^{*}(f) = d(f) ). Let us expand the problem to finding the minimum length ( d^{*}(e) ) over all excellent lines ( e ). This expanded set should make it easier to find the minimum because if ( e_0 ) is the line where ( d^{*}(e_0) ) is minimized, then ( d^{*}(e_0) leq d(f) ) for any median ( f ). If we can show that ( e_0 ) is also a median, then ( e_0 ) is the solution we're looking for. To determine the minimum ( d^{*}(e) ), we start by showing that among lines cutting off a triangle of a given area from a convex angle, the line giving the smallest segment between the arms of the angle is the one that cuts off an isosceles triangle. Consider the angle ( alpha ) at vertex ( A ) of a convex angle, and let ( Delta ABC ) be a triangle with area ( t ) cut off from this angle (see Figure 2). Assume ( AB < AC ). Let ( A'BC ) be an isosceles triangle with sides ( A'B = A'C = h ), and denote its area by ( t' ). 1. The area of triangle ( A'BC ) is larger than the area of ( Delta ABC ) because they share the common base ( BC ), but the height from ( A' ) is larger than the height from ( A ). 2. Hence, one can cut off a triangle ( A'B'C' ) from ( A'BC ) such that ( A'B'C' ) has the same area as ( Delta ABC ), but with a smaller base ( B'C' ), which confirms our previous assertion. [ text{Figure 2: Illustration showing (Delta A'BC), a larger isosceles triangle.} ] Next, we show that for two different convex angles cutting off two isosceles triangles of the same area, the angle with the larger measure will have the longer segment between the arms. As shown in Figure 3, for equal-length segments, the area cut off from the larger angle is smaller. [ text{Figure 3: Illustration comparing lengths of segments from different angles.} ] From these observations, it follows that ( d^{*}(e) ) is minimized when ( e ) is perpendicular to the bisector of the smallest angle of the triangle (i.e., ( angle BAC )). Now, we need to show that this line ( e_0 ) also bisects the area of the triangle ( Delta ABC ). Since ( alpha ) is the smallest angle, the side opposite ( alpha ) is the shortest side, ( a leq b ) and ( a leq c ). Given an isosceles triangle cut off by line ( e_0 ) with area ( frac{t}{2} ), we need to prove that the length ( h ) of the equal sides satisfies ( h leq b ) and ( h leq c ). 3. Using the area relation, for isosceles triangle with height ( h ), [ frac{h^{2} sin alpha}{2} = frac{t}{2} = frac{bc sin alpha}{4} Rightarrow h = sqrt{frac{bc}{2}}. ] 4. By the triangle inequality, since ( a leq b leq c ), we have ( c < a + b leq 2b ) and thus, [ bc < 2b^{2} Rightarrow sqrt{frac{b c}{2}} < b. ] Similarly, [ sqrt{frac{bc}{2}} < c. ] Hence, ( h ) is less than or equal to both ( b ) and ( c ), indicating that the cuts made through internal points of sides ( AC ) and ( AB ) indeed bisect the area.

Lemma: Consider a set of n pairs of individuals, where each person in a pair is from a different country. If each country has exactly two representatives in the set, it is possible to group these individuals into two sets such that each set contains one representative from each country and there are no familiar pairs within each group. Proof of Lemma: 1. **Initial Assignment**: Place the first representative of the first country (let's call them Person A) in Group 1, and the second representative (Person B) in Group 2. 2. **Iterate Through Connections**: For each familiar person of Person B (assume this is Person C from the i-th country), place Person C in Group 1. Subsequently, place the other representative of the i-th country (Person D) in Group 2. 3. **Continue Process**: Repeat this process iteratively: - If the familiar person of the new addition has already been placed in Group 1, continue placing their pairs accordingly. - If at any point a familiar person already exists in the group, it must be the initial person placed (Person A). 4. **Conclusion**: By this method, we ensure each group contains representatives from every country without repeats. Hence the lemma is proven. Application to the Problem: Now let's apply this lemma to the main problem. 1. **Divide Each Country's Representatives**: Each country has 4 representatives. Consider these 4 people as two pairs, say (X, X') and (Y, Y'). Here X and X' represent members of one pair, and Y and Y' represent the members of another pair. 2. **Creating Neighbor Pairs**: Form \\"neighbor pairs\\" by placing the representatives next to each other around the round table. Since there are 100 representatives, we will have 50 neighbors pairs. In these pairs, each pair is fundamentally familiar. 3. **Apply Lemma**: Group these 50 pairs into two sets of 50 people each: - According to the lemma, each group will have one representative from each country. - There will be no familiar pairs within each group. 4. **Resulting Groups**: Each group we obtain will have no neighboring (around the table) familiar pairs. This ensures that representatives from different countries are well distributed. Final Distribution: Using the lemma, we repeat the division similarly for each small group. Ultimately, this technique will provide the desired four groups where: - Each group has one representative from each country. - No two representatives in any group are neighbors (adjacent at the round table).

Thus, n must be even. 2. **Modulo 125**: We find n such that n^3 equiv 576 pmod{125}. Since the cube of n must also end with 6 (last digit of 576), n equiv 6 pmod{10}. Let n = 10a + 6.

(a) Finding 13 real coins: **Method 1** 1. **Initial Setup**: Place 16 coins from the edge of the board on the balance scale—8 black coins on one side and 8 white coins on the other. 2. **Observation and Analysis**: - If the scale is balanced, all 16 coins are real because the fake coins are only on one side of the balance, and their absence of heavier coins ensures the weight equality. - If the black side is heavier, one fake coin must be on the white side. This ensures all 13 black coins are real. - If the white side is heavier, one fake coin must be on the black side. This means the central coin and 12 white coins are real. In all cases, at least 13 real coins are identified. **Generalization**: 3. Place one black coin ( A ) and all its diagonal neighbors aside. 4. From the remaining black coins, place at least 7 on one side of the scale, and an equal number of white coins on the other. - If balanced, all coins on the scale are real (at least 14). - If black side is heavier, those black coins are real, and if white side is heavier, those white coins and ( A ) are real. This guarantees finding at least 13 real coins. **Method 2**: 5. Place 4 black coins, neighbors with the central coin, on the balance (left and right sides). - If balanced, all black coins are real, thus finding 13 black coins and the assured central coin. - If imbalanced, the side lifting indicates those two black coins on that side are real, along with all white coins on the scale. In both situations, at least 13 coins can be identified. (b) Finding 15 real coins: **Method 1**: 6.

This confirms 25 - 5 (marked) - 5 (outside ones), thus identifying 15 real coins. The steps are similar if the balance tilts. Each case guarantees 15 real coins. **Method 2**: 7. Repeat the weighing process as elaborated above, with the arrangement of black and white coins selectively. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_6741038a32a996d2ce33g-59.jpg?height=408&width=1356&top_left_y=1734&top_left_x=16) - Equilibrium = 16 coins are real. - If black side heavier, fake coin can be in two marked squares on the central image. Each time different aspects ensure identifying at least 15 real coins. **Method 3**: 8. Weigh configurations maintaining at least two white and black coins in various calculations, excluding one coin, rearranging the rest as per balanced weights. All configurations reasonably yield 15 real coins as indicated. (c) Finding 17 real coins: 9. **Theoretical Analysis**: Assessing potential configurations where one imbalance implies at least 9 coins suspected. Because there are 3 outcomes (equilibrium, tilt one side, tilt another side), at least non-identifiable coins occur in each method where 25 - 9 = 16, max finding is limited to 16 real coins.

Specifically: [ frac{A_i B_i}{A_i D_i} = frac{h_i}{h_{i-1}}, ] where ( h_{i-1} ) is the distance from ( O ) to ( A_{i-1} A_i ). 5. **Multiplying the Ratios:** We can write this ratio for each side ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ): [ frac{A_1 B_1}{A_1 D_1} = frac{h_1}{h_n}, ] [ frac{A_2 B_2}{A_2 D_2} = frac{h_2}{h_1}, ] [ frac{A_3 B_3}{A_3 D_3} = frac{h_3}{h_2}, ] and so on, up to: [ frac{A_n B_n}{A_n D_n} = frac{h_n}{h_{n-1}}. ] 6. **Product of the Ratios:** We take the product of all these ratios: [ left( frac{A_1 B_1}{A_1 D_1} right) cdot left( frac{A_2 B_2}{A_2 D_2} right) cdot ldots cdot left( frac{A_n B_n}{A_n D_n} right) = frac{h_1}{h_n} cdot frac{h_2}{h_1} cdot ldots cdot frac{h_n}{h_{n-1}}. ] 7. **Simplifying the Product:** When we multiply these ratios, all intermediate terms ( h_1, h_2, ldots, h_{n-1} ) cancel out, leaving: [ frac{A_1 B_1 cdot A_2 B_2 cdot ldots cdot A_n B_n}{A_1 D_1 cdot A_2 D_2 cdot ldots cdot A_n D_n} = frac{h_1}{h_n} cdot frac{h_2}{h_1} cdot ldots cdot frac{h_n}{h_{n-1}} = 1. ] 8. **Conclusion:** Thus, we have: [ A_1 B_1 cdot A_2 B_2 cdot ldots cdot A_n B_n = A_1 D_1 cdot A_2 D_2 cdot ldots cdot A_n D_n. ] [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"A list of 5 positive integers has a mean of 5, a mode of 5, a median of 5, and a range of 5.

We start by noting that there are 25 ants, with 5 ants initially positioned at each of the coordinates (1, 2, 3, 4,) and (5). 2. The goal is to move the ants such that no two ants occupy the same coordinate. This means we need to distribute the ants to 25 unique positions on the number line. 3. To achieve this, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required for the ants to reach unique positions. Let's consider the following steps: 1. **Initial Setup**: - We have 5 ants at each of the positions (1, 2, 3, 4,) and (5). 2. **Target Positions**: - We need to move the ants to 25 unique positions. Let's denote these positions as (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{25}). 3. **Movement Strategy**: - Each ant can move to an adjacent position in one minute. Therefore, the number of moves required for an ant to reach a target position is the absolute difference between its initial position and the target position. 4. **Optimal Distribution**: - To minimize the total number of moves, we should distribute the ants as evenly as possible around their initial positions. This means we should aim to place the ants in positions that are close to their starting points. 5. **Calculating Moves**: - Let's consider the positions (1, 2, 3, 4,) and (5) and distribute the ants to the nearest available positions. - For the ants at position 1: - Move one ant to position 1 (0 moves). - Move one ant to position 6 (5 moves). - Move one ant to position 11 (10 moves). - Move one ant to position 16 (15 moves). - Move one ant to position 21 (20 moves). - For the ants at position 2: - Move one ant to position 2 (0 moves). - Move one ant to position 7 (5 moves). - Move one ant to position 12 (10 moves). - Move one ant to position 17 (15 moves). - Move one ant to position 22 (20 moves). - For the ants at position 3: - Move one ant to position 3 (0 moves). - Move one ant to position 8 (5 moves). - Move one ant to position 13 (10 moves). - Move one ant to position 18 (15 moves). - Move one ant to position 23 (20 moves). - For the ants at position 4: - Move one ant to position 4 (0 moves). - Move one ant to position 9 (5 moves). - Move one ant to position 14 (10 moves). - Move one ant to position 19 (15 moves). - Move one ant to position 24 (20 moves). - For the ants at position 5: - Move one ant to position 5 (0 moves). - Move one ant to position 10 (5 moves). - Move one ant to position 15 (10 moves). - Move one ant to position 20 (15 moves). - Move one ant to position 25 (20 moves). 6. **Summing the Moves**: - The total number of moves required is the sum of all the individual moves: [ begin{align*} text{Total moves} &= (0 + 5 + 10 + 15 + 20) times 5 &= (0 + 5 + 10 + 15 + 20) times 5 &= 50 times 5 &= 250 end{align*} ] Therefore, the minimum number of minutes that must pass before it is possible for no two ants to be on the same coordinate is (boxed{250})."},{"prompt":"ver 5 m deep and 19 m wide is flowing at the rate of 4 kmph the amount of water that runs into the sea per minute is ?","completion":"To calculate the amount of water that runs into the sea per minute, we need to find the volume of water flowing per minute.

This property arises from symmetries and can be derived or assumed in a mathematical geometric setting. 6. **Derivation Using Coordinates:** - We need to identify how to project each vertex perpendicularly to the assumed line through \`O\`. - However, due to invariance, even assuming (AP^2 + BQ^2 + CR^2 + DS^2) (sum of distances squared projected from each vertex to the line) simplifies based on symmetries. 7. **Calculation for Particular Line:** - Assume the simplest scenario where the line is along one perpendicular axis passing through the center. - Let’s choose the line to be vertical through (O): - Distance from (A(0,0)) to vertical line (frac{1}{2}) (along x-axis direction) [ d_O (0,0) = left( frac{1}{2} right)^2. ] - By similar symmetry from internal distance-squared properties: [ d^2 summation until filled uniformly. ] Using diagonal assumption, rotational, the computed distances as [ A^2 + B^2 = frac{1}{2}, directly. ] # Conclusion: Thus, adding four symmetrical quadrant sections this equivalence by analytic derivation thus sum: [ d_summation = 1/2 + 1/2 aligned coordinated (double of added 2 aligned 2-dim) Boxed = boxed{2}. conclusively outlined. \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"For any vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}, the relationship that always holds is ( ) A: (overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b})cdot(overrightarrow{a}overrightarrow{b})={overrightarrow{a}}^{2}{overrightarrow{b}}^{2} B: {(overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b})}^{2}=|overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}{|}^{2} C: |overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b}|≤|overrightarrow{a}| cdot |overrightarrow{b}| D: |overrightarrow{a}overrightarrow{b}|≤||overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{b}||","completion":"To analyze each option step-by-step: **Option A:** Given: (overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b})cdot(overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}) Expanding the dot product, we get: [ begin{align*} (overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b})cdot(overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}) &= overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b} + overrightarrow{b}cdotoverrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}cdotoverrightarrow{b} &= overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}cdotoverrightarrow{b} &= {overrightarrow{a}}^{2}-{overrightarrow{b}}^{2} end{align*} ] Thus, option A is correct. **Option B:** Given: {(overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b})}^{2}=|overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}{|}^{2} This is a property of vectors where the square of a vector sum equals the square of the magnitude of the vector sum.

Given the equation: [ frac{x}{21} times frac{y}{189} + z = 1 ] First, let's simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 21 and 189. The GCD of 21 and 189 is 21, so we can simplify the fraction as follows: [ frac{x}{21} times frac{y}{9 times 21} ] Now, let's rewrite the equation: [ frac{x times y}{21 times 9 times 21} + z = 1 ] Simplify the denominator: [ frac{x times y}{3969} + z = 1 ] Now, let's isolate the fraction: [ frac{x times y}{3969} = 1 - z ] Since x, y, and z are positive integers, and z must be less than 1 for the fraction to be positive, the only possible value for z is 0. This is because if z were any positive integer, the left side of the equation would be less than 1, which is not possible since x and y are positive integers and their product divided by 3969 must also be an integer.

Let's denote the side lengths of these equilateral triangles by ( s ). 2. **Identify the midpoints**: - Point ( M ) is the midpoint of segment ( AA_1 ). - Point ( N ) is the midpoint of segment ( CC_1 ). 3. **Rotation operation**: - Consider a rotation of ( 60^circ ) counterclockwise around point ( B ). - This rotation will transform the original figures. 4. **Transformation of segments**: - Under this rotation, the segment ( CC_1 ) will rotate to coincide with segment ( A_1A ). - Since both ( CC_1 ) and ( A_1A ) are constructed with point ( B ) as one of the vertices of the respective equilateral triangles ( BCA_1 ) and ( BCC_1 ), they are congruent by construction. 5. **Points ( M ) and ( N ) relationship**: - Due to the rotational symmetry and the properties of the equilateral triangles, point ( N ) (midpoint of ( CC_1 )) will rotate to point ( M ) (midpoint of ( AA_1 )). - This implies that the distance ( BN ) is equal to the distance ( BM ). 6. **Triangle ( BMN ) properties**: - Since both ( M ) and ( N ) are midpoints of their respective segments and transform into each other under a ( 60^circ ) rotation around ( B ), we conclude that ( BN = BM ). - The rotation transformation also ensures that ( angle MBN = 60^circ ). 7. **Proof of equilateral triangle**: - Since ( BN = BM ) and ( angle MBN = 60^circ ), it follows that triangle ( BMN ) has all sides equal and all internal angles equal to ( 60^circ ).

The pattern repeats every three vertices, and given the 10 vertices, the sequence completes more than three full cycles (10/3 cycles precisely, considering only unique vertices). - Triangles like A_1A_4A_7 and A_4A_7A_{10} are counted multiple times because of their cyclical nature. Consider the vertices A_1, A_4, A_7, and every third vertex thereafter: they form a repeating group. - Groups are A_1A_4A_7, A_2A_5A_8, A_3A_6A_9, and A_{10} rebinds with A_3 and A_6 which are already included in the third set. Hence, overcounting occurs in these triads, and each of these groups is counted three times. 4. **Removing Overcounted Triangles**: Each group is overcounted by two (counted three times instead of once).

This can be broken down as follows: - If x is a multiple of 4, then x=4k for some integer k. - If x is an even number but not a multiple of 4, then x must be of the form 4k+2 or 4k-2 (since adding or subtracting 2 from a multiple of 4 gives an even number that is not itself a multiple of 4). Given that U only contains even numbers and we are excluding multiples of 4, the correct form for elements in complement_U M is x=4k-2 for some integer k. This is because 4k-2 represents all even numbers that are not divisible by 4, fitting the criteria for complement_U M.

The smaller pyramid and the original pyramid are similar, and the similarity ratio is 8/13. 5. **Dimensions of Smaller Pyramid**: The edge length of the base of the smaller pyramid is frac{8}{13} times 12 = frac{96}{13} units. 6. **New Base Area and Volume**: Area of the smaller pyramid's base = left(frac{96}{13}right)^2 = frac{9216}{169} square units.

We will demonstrate the equivalence in both directions. **1. First direction:** Assume (9) divides (2n + 5m). This means there exists an integer (k) such that: [2n + 5m = 9k.] We need to show that (9) also divides (5n + 8m). Consider the expression: [ 7 times (2n + 5m) = 7 times 9k = 63k. ] This shows that (7 times (2n + 5m)) is clearly divisible by (9).

This is because, for a hyperbola, the difference in distances from any point on it to the two foci is constant, which matches our condition. The general equation of a hyperbola with its major axis along the x-axis is given by: [frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,] where a and b are constants, and c is the distance from the center to either focus. Here, we have c = 2 because the distance from the midpoint of MN to either M or N is 2. Given |PM| - |PN| = 2, we can deduce that 2a = 2, leading to a = 1. To find b, we use the relationship c^2 = a^2 + b^2, which yields: [b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 4 - 1 = 3.] Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola becomes: [frac{x^2}{1^2} - frac{y^2}{3} = 1.] Given the condition |PM| - |PN| = 2, we are looking for the left branch of the hyperbola, which corresponds to x values less than or equal to -1.

The minimum of the two gradients of these lines gives us a constant ( c ). *Note: if there are not two lines with opposite gradients, eventually all ellipses will lie on one side of the y-axis and we may use the y-axis as ( ell_j ).* 4. **Arrive at a contradiction by showing that there does not exist a constant ( C ) such that ( x_j le Cj ) for all ( j in mathbb{N} ).** Consider the set ( S_j ) of lines that pass through ((0, 0)) (through ( E_0 )) and intersect the ellipse ( E_j ) for each ( j in mathbb{N} ).

Parmi tous ces entiers, soit ( n ) le plus petit qui vérifie cette propriété. 3. Étant donné que ( n ) ne peut pas s'écrire comme produit de nombres premiers, cela signifie que ( n ) n'est pas un nombre premier. 4. Ainsi, ( n ) peut s'écrire sous la forme ( n = k cdot l ) où ( k ) et ( l ) sont des entiers strictement inférieurs à ( n ). 5. Par la minimalité de ( n ), les entiers ( k ) et ( l ) peuvent s'écrire comme produits de nombres premiers (car ( k < n ) et ( l < n )). 6. Par conséquent, ( n ) peut s'écrire comme produit de nombres premiers. 7. Cette conclusion contredit notre hypothèse initiale. 8. Donc, tout entier ( n geq 2 ) peut s'écrire comme produit de nombres premiers. Seconde méthode : Récurrence forte 1. On démontre le résultat par récurrence forte sur ( n ). 2. **Initialisation** : Pour ( n = 2 ), c'est vrai car 2 est un nombre premier. 3. **Hérédité** : Supposons que pour tout ( k ) tel que ( 2 leq k leq n ), ( k ) peut s'écrire comme produit de nombres premiers. 4. Pour prouver ( P(n+1) ), considérons ( n+1 ) : - Si ( n+1 ) est un nombre premier, alors ( n+1 ) est déjà un produit de nombres premiers (lui-même). - Si ( n+1 ) n'est pas un nombre premier, alors ( n+1 = k cdot l ) avec ( k ) et ( l ) strictement inférieurs ou égaux à ( n ). Par hypothèse de récurrence, ( k ) et ( l ) peuvent s'écrire comme produits de nombres premiers. 5. Donc, ( n+1 ) peut également s'écrire comme produit de nombres premiers. 6. Par récurrence forte, cela prouve que tout entier ( n ) supérieur ou égal à 2 peut s'écrire comme produit de nombres premiers. Troisième méthode : Descente infinie 1. Supposons par l'absurde qu'il existe un entier ( n_0 ) ne pouvant pas s'écrire comme produit de nombres premiers. 2. On va montrer qu'on peut en construire un autre entier strictement plus petit ( n_1 ) vérifiant la même propriété. 3. Puisque ( n_0 ) ne s'écrit pas comme produit de nombres premiers, ( n_0 ) n'est pas un nombre premier. Ainsi, ( n_0 = k cdot l ) avec ( k ) et ( l ) strictement plus petits que ( n_0 ). 4. Choisissons ( k ) (ou ( l )) qui, par hypothèse, ne peut pas s'écrire comme produit de nombres premiers. 5. En réitérant ce procédé, on peut construire une suite ( (n_i) ) d'entiers naturels strictement décroissante telle que chaque ( n_i ) ne peut pas s'écrire comme produit de nombres premiers. 6. Une telle suite strictement décroissante d'entiers naturels est impossible. 7. Cela contredit notre hypothèse initiale. 8.

Prove that the common chord of any circle k_{1} passing through points A and C, and any circle k_{2} passing through points B and D, passes through the midpoint of the segment AC.","completion":"To prove that the common chord of any circle passing through points (A, C) and any circle passing through points (B, D) intersects at the midpoint of segment (AC), we propose the following detailed steps: First Method Solution 1. Consider two circles (k_1) passing through points (A) and (C) and (k_2) passing through points (B) and (D). According to the problem, (AB = 1), (BC = 2), and (CD = 3). 2. The two circles intersect at two points, which we label as (M) and (N). The common chord of these two circles will intersect segment (BC) at an internal point, say (F). 3. Using the known theorem for intersecting chords of a circle, the following equations hold: [ FA cdot FC = FM cdot FN = FB cdot FD ] Since: [ FA = F cdot A, quad FC = AC - FA = 3 - FA, quad FB = FA - AB = FA - 1, quad FD = AD - FA = 6 - FA ] 4. Plugging these expressions into the equation yields: [ FA cdot (3 - FA) = (FA - 1) cdot (6 - FA) ] 5. Expand and simplify both sides: [ FA cdot 3 - FA^2 = (FA cdot 6 - FA^2) - (FA - 1) ] 6. Simplify further: [ 3FA - FA^2 = 6FA - FA^2 - (FA - 1) ] [ 3FA = 6FA - FA^2 - FA + 1 ] 7. Combine like terms and solve: [ 3FA = 5FA - FA^2 + 1 ] [ 0 = 2FA - FA^2 + 1 ] 8. Solving this quadratic equation: [ FA^2 - 2FA + 1 = 0 ] [ (FA - 1.5)^2 = 0 ] [ FA = 1.5 ] 9. Thus, ( FA = 1.5 ). This means that point (F) is exactly at the midpoint of segment (AC). Therefore, the intersection at the midpoint is confirmed for the selected circles, independent of the choice of circles (k_1) and (k_2). # Second Method Solution 1. Place the coordinate system such that point (A) is at the origin ((0, 0)) and point (B) on the positive x-axis at ((1, 0)). 2. Since ( C ) is 2 units away from ( B), it is placed at ((3, 0)); point ( D ), being 3 units from ( C), is at ((6, 0)). 3. Consider a circle ( k_1 ) passing through (A) and (C) with a center on the perpendicular bisector of (AC). The equation of this circle can be written as: [ (x - 1.5)^2 + (y - c)^2 = 1.5^2 + c^2 ] where ( (1.5, c) ) is the center of the circle. 4. Similarly, the equation of a circle (k_2) passing through (B) and (D), centered on the perpendicular bisector of (BD), is: [ (x - 3.5)^2 + (y - b)^2 = 2.5^2 + b^2 ] where ( (3.5, b) ) is the center of circle (k_2). 5. The points where the circles intersect are common points, satisfying both circle equations. Subtract the two equations: [ (x - 1.5)^2 + (y - c)^2 - ((x - 3.5)^2 + (y - b)^2) = 0 ] Simplify the equation: [ (x^2 - 3x + 2.25 + y^2 - 2yc + c^2) - (x^2 - 7x + 12.25 + y^2 - 2yb + b^2) = 0 ] [ -3x + 2.25 - 2yc + c^2 + 7x - 12.25 + 2yb - b^2 = 0 ] [ 4x - 10 + 2y(b - c) + c^2 - b^2 = 0 ] [ 4x + 2y(b - c) = 10 + b^2 - c^2 ] 6. This simplifies to the equation of the common chord, which is linear in (x) and (y). Since the midpoint of (AC) has coordinates ((1.5, 0)), substituting (x = 1.5) and (y = 0) into the line equation confirms the line passes through this midpoint. Thus, we have shown that the common chord of the circles passes through the midpoint of (AC).

On the days he plays video games, he plays for half as long as he watches TV, so he plays for T/2 hours. He plays video games 3 days a week, so the total time spent playing video games in a week is 3 * (T/2) = 3T/2 hours. Since he watches TV every day, the total time spent watching TV in a week is 7 * T = 7T hours. The total time spent on both activities in a week is the sum of the time spent watching TV and playing video games, which is given as 34 hours. So we have: 7T + 3T/2 = 34 To solve for T, we first need to get a common denominator for the terms on the left side of the equation.

Given: A = Rs. 6615 P = Rs. 6000 r = 10% per annum = 0.10 per annum n = 2 (since the interest is compounded half-yearly) We need to find t. First, let's convert the annual interest rate to the rate per half-year by dividing it by the number of compounding periods per year: r/n = 0.10/2 = 0.05 (or 5% per half-year) Now, we can plug the values into the formula and solve for t: 6615 = 6000 (1 + 0.05)^(2t) Divide both sides by 6000 to isolate the compound interest factor: 6615 / 6000 = (1 + 0.05)^(2t) 1.1025 = (1.05)^(2t) Now, we need to solve for 2t. We can do this by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides: ln(1.1025) = ln((1.05)^(2t)) Using the property of logarithms that ln(a^b) = b * ln(a), we get: ln(1.1025) = 2t * ln(1.05) Now, divide both sides by ln(1.05) to solve for 2t: 2t = ln(1.1025) / ln(1.05) Now, we can calculate the value of 2t: 2t = ln(1.1025) / ln(1.05) Using a calculator, we find: 2t ≈ ln(1.1025) / ln(1.05) 2t ≈ 0.0976 / 0.04879 2t ≈ 2 Now, we divide by 2 to find t: t = 2 / 2 t = 1 So, Sam invested the money for boxed{1} year."},{"prompt":"The function g , with domain and real numbers, fulfills the following: bullet g (x) le x , for all real x bullet g (x + y) le g (x) + g (y) for all real x,y Find g (1990) .","completion":"1. **Given Conditions:** - ( g(x) le x ) for all real ( x ). - ( g(x + y) le g(x) + g(y) ) for all real ( x, y ). 2. **Setting ( x = 0 ):** - From the first condition, ( g(0) le 0 ). - From the second condition, ( g(0 + 0) le g(0) + g(0) ), which simplifies to ( g(0) le 2g(0) ).

Find all polynomials with complex coefficient and degree more than one such that (p(x)x)^2 divides p^n(x)x . ( p^0(x)=x , p^i(x)=p(p^{i1}(x)) ) *Proposed by Navid Safaie*","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Definitions:** We are given a polynomial ( p(x) ) with complex coefficients and degree greater than one. We need to find all such polynomials such that ((p(x) - x)^2) divides (p^n(x) - x) for all ( n > 1 ). Here, ( p^i(x) ) denotes the (i)-th iterate of ( p(x) ), defined recursively by ( p^0(x) = x ) and ( p^i(x) = p(p^{i-1}(x)) ). 2. **Derivative Condition:** Note that if ((p(x) - x)^2) divides (p^n(x) - x), then the derivative ((p^n(x) - x)') must be divisible by (p(x) - x). This follows from the fact that if a polynomial ( f(x) ) is divisible by ( g(x)^2 ), then ( f'(x) ) is divisible by ( g(x) ). 3. **Chain Rule Application:** Using the chain rule, we have: [ (p^n(x) - x)' = p'(p^{n-1}(x)) cdot p'(p^{n-2}(x)) cdot ldots cdot p'(x) - 1 ] Since ( p(x) - x ) divides ( p^n(x) - x ), it must also divide the above derivative. 4. **Divisibility Condition:** Working modulo ( p(x) - x ), we know that ( q(r(x)) - q(s(x)) ) is divisible by ( r(x) - s(x) ) for all polynomials ( q, r, s in mathbb{C}[x] ). Therefore, we have: [ p(x) - x mid p'(x)^n - 1 ] This implies that ( p'(x)^n - 1 ) is divisible by ( p(x) - x ). 5. **Multiplicity of Roots:** Suppose ( (x - r)^c ) divides ( p(x) - x ) for some ( r in mathbb{C} ) and ( c > 1 ). Then, ( (x - r)^{c+1} ) does not divide ( p(x) - x ). From the chain rule, we have: [ (p(x) - x)' = p'(x) - 1 ] Since ( p(x) - x ) divides ( p'(x)^n - 1 ), we must have ( x - r mid p'(x) - 1 ). 6. **Contradiction:** If ( (x - r)^c mid p(x) - x ), then ( (x - r)^c mid p'(x) - 1 ). Writing ( p(x) - x = (x - r)^c q(x) ) for some ( q(x) in mathbb{C}[x] ) with ( x - r nmid q(x) ), we get: [ p'(x) - 1 = c (x - r)^{c-1} q(x) + (x - r)^c q'(x) ] This must be divisible by ( (x - r)^c ), but ( c q(x) ) is not divisible by ( x - r ), leading to a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, ( p(x) - x ) has no roots of multiplicity greater than 1. We can write: [ p(x) - x = c (x - r_1)(x - r_2) cdots (x - r_k) ] for distinct complex numbers ( r_1, r_2, ldots, r_k ) and some complex number ( c ). 8. **Final Condition:** Since ( p'(x)^n - 1 ) is divisible by ( p(x) - x ), for each ( r_i ), there exists an integer ( j ) such that ( p'(r_i) = omega^j ), where ( omega = e^{frac{2 pi i}{n}} ). We have: [ p'(r_i) = 1 + c prod_{j neq i} (r_i - r_j) ] for each ( 1 le i le k ).

In this case, any non-zero constant function ( f ) will satisfy the equation.

The maximum value here is f(-1) = 1. 3. **Comparing the maximum values**: - For f(x) to have a global maximum at some x_0, the maximum value of both pieces of the function must not exceed this value.

If he needs 75 sheets for the 6 faces of the cube (each face of a cube is a square), then each face would require: 75 sheets / 6 faces = 12.5 sheets per face Since each sheet is 4 x 2 meters, the area of one sheet is 8 square meters.

By rearranging, we get frac{ln x-x+1}{x} < m < frac{ln x}{x}. Let g(x)=frac{ln x-x+1}{x}, then g'(x)=frac{-ln x}{x^{2}} < 0, so g(x) is decreasing on [sqrt{e},e^{2}].

When sqrt{e} < x < e, h'(x) > 0, so h(x) is increasing; When e < x < e^{2}, h'(x) < 0, so h(x) is decreasing.

Similarly, ln x_{2} < frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{x_{2}}ln(x_{1}+x_{2}). Adding these two inequalities, we obtain ln x_{1}+ln x_{2} < (2+frac{x_{1}}{x_{2}}+frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}})ln(x_{1}+x_{2}).

We claim that ( x_j + y_j le 2n ) for all ( 1 le j le m ). 6. **Proof of Claim**: - If ( min(x_j, y_j) < 1 ), the claim is trivially true because ( max(text{deg}(X_j), text{deg}(Y_j)) le 2n ). - If ( min(x_j, y_j) ge 1 ), by the maximality of ( M ), for any vertices ( U, V ) outside ( M ), both ( UX_j ) and ( VY_j ) cannot be edges of ( G ). Thus, ( x_j + y_j ) counts the degree of a common neighbor of ( X_j ) and ( Y_j ), so ( x_j + y_j le 2n ). 7. **Counting Edges**: Each edge in ( G ) has a vertex in common with ( M ) due to the maximality of ( M ). Therefore, the total number of edges ( E ) can be counted by summing the degrees of vertices in ( M ): [ E = sum_{j=1}^m left( x_j + frac{1}{2}(2n - x_j) right) + sum_{j=1}^m left( y_j + frac{1}{2}(2n - y_j) right) = sum_{j=1}^m left( frac{1}{2}(x_j + y_j) right) + 2nm ] Since ( x_j + y_j le 2n ), we have: [ E le sum_{j=1}^m left( frac{1}{2}(2n) right) + 2nm = 3nm le 3nk ] 8. **Conclusion**: The maximum number of kids is ( 3nk ).

Similarly, since (b) is odd, (b^2) is odd, and since (a) is even, (2^a) is even. Thus, (b^2 + 2^a) is odd. An even number and an odd number are always relatively prime. 5. **General case for (a) even and (b) odd:** For any natural number (n), if (a) is even and (b) is odd, (a^n) is even and (n^b) is even if (n) is even, and odd if (n) is odd. Similarly, (b^n) is odd and (n^a) is even if (n) is even, and odd if (n) is odd. Therefore, (a^n + n^b) and (b^n + n^a) will always be one even and one odd, making them relatively prime. Conclusion: There exist positive integers (a) and (b) such that (a^n + n^b) and (b^n + n^a) are relatively prime for all natural (n) if and only if (a) is even and (b) is odd.

To find the molecular weight of 4 moles of barium bromide, we simply multiply this value by 4: 4 moles of BaBr2 = 4 * 297.13 g/mol 4 moles of BaBr2 = 1188.52 g/mol Therefore, the molecular weight of 4 moles of barium bromide is boxed{1188.52} grams."},{"prompt":"What is the smallest positive solution of the equation (x^4 58x^2 + 841 = 0)?","completion":"First, we attempt to factor the left-hand side as a product of two quadratic equations: [ (x^2 - A)(x^2 - B) = 0 ] We need (A + B = 58) and (AB = 841).

From the information given, we can set up the following equation to represent the total points the student earned over the two years: ( (6 times 100) + (x times 60) = (6 + x) times 81 ) This equation comes from the fact that the student earned an average of 100 points in 6 courses last year and an average of 60 points in ( x ) courses the year before. The total number of points earned over the two years is equal to the average points (81) times the total number of courses taken over the two years (6 + ( x )). Now we can solve for ( x ): ( 600 + 60x = 81(6 + x) ) ( 600 + 60x = 486 + 81x ) Subtract 60x from both sides: ( 600 = 486 + 21x ) Subtract 486 from both sides: ( 114 = 21x ) Divide both sides by 21: ( x = frac{114}{21} ) ( x = 5.42857142857 ) Since the number of courses must be a whole number, we round ( x ) to the nearest whole number, which is 5.

For instance, start with ( r = 0 ), which simplifies the analysis. 6. **Suppose ( a_j in {a_n} ) satisfies ( a_j equiv r mod a_i )**: Let ( j > i ) and ( a_j equiv r mod a_i ), indicating ( a_j = ka_i + r ) for some integer ( k ). 7. **Form a candidate ( a_n )**: Consider any larger term ( a_n ) in the sequence where ( a_n > a_j ). Write ( a_n = a_j + m a_i ) for some integer ( m geq 1 ). 8. **Express ( a_n ) in the desired form**: ( a_n = a_j + m a_i = (k a_i + r) + m a_i = (k + m)a_i + r ), where both ( k + m ) and ( r ) are positive integers since ( k, m geq 1 ) and ( r geq 0 ). 9. **Generalize and conclude**: Since ( r ) can be any number in the set ( {0, 1, 2, ldots, a_i - 1} ) and there are infinitely many samples of ( a_n ), we conclude that there are indeed infinitely many ( a_n ) that can be written in the form ( a_n = r a_i + s a_j ) with ( j > i ) and both ( r ) and ( s ) positive integers.

Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-infty, +infty). - When m < 0, the inequality f'(x) > 0 translates to x > ln(-m), and f'(x) < 0 means x < ln(-m). Therefore, the function f(x) increases on the interval (ln(-m), +infty) and decreases on (-infty, ln(-m)). (II) For the existence of a positive root x_0 such that f(x_0) = x_0ln{x_0}, we can equate this expression to get an equation in m: m = frac{1 - e^x}{x} + ln{x}, quad x > 0.

Considering phi'(x), we see that phi'(x) > 0 when 0 < x < 1 and phi'(x) < 0 when x > 1. Thus, phi(x) is increasing in the interval (0,1) and decreasing in (1, +infty). The maximum value of phi(x) occurs at phi(1), which is phi_{text{max}}(x) = phi(1) = 1 - e. Since we have a positive root, the maximum value of m is boxed{1 - e}. (III) Let us consider the function F(x) = xe^x - e^x + 1 and find its derivative with respect to x for x > 0: F'(x) = xe^x.

Hence, for x in (0, +infty), we have e^x > frac{e^x - 1}{x}, or equivalently x > lnleft(frac{e^x-1}{x}right) = g(x). From part (I), when m = -1, f(x) = e^x - x - 1 has its minimum value at f(0) = 0, implying that e^x - 1 > x for x in (0, +infty). Thus, g(x) = ln(e^x - 1) - ln{x} > 0 for x in (0, +infty). Combining all these observations, we can conclude that for x in (0, +infty), we have x > g(x) > 0.

The only surviving elements are at the boundaries. 4. **Cancellations:** When combining these (2 times 2) matrix equations into a sum over the entire matrix, intermediate terms that are shared between sub-matrices cancel: [ sum (a_{i,j} + a_{i+1,j+1}) = sum (a_{i,j+1} + a_{i+1,j}) ] Due to the nature of the summation, every element not on the boundary is counted multiple times (once positively and once negatively), thus effectively cancelling itself out. This leaves us with only the boundary elements, specifically the four corners. 5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the sum of the numbers in the top-left and bottom-right corners of the (2000 times 2000) matrix is equal to the sum of the numbers in the bottom-left and top-right corners: [ a_{1,1} + a_{2000,2000} = a_{2000,1} + a_{1,2000} ] This completes the proof that the two sums of the diagonals are equal, which proves the statement as required.

We are given an isosceles triangle ABC with angle B = 108^circ. 2. The perpendicular to the angle bisector AD of this triangle passes through point D and intersects AC at point E. 3. We need to prove that DE = BD. Let's proceed step-by-step: - **Perpendicular Intersection**: - Let the perpendicular passing through D intersect AB at point F. - Consider triangles AFE and BDF. 4. **Triangle AFE**: - AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC. - Because ABC is an isosceles triangle (with AB = AC), angle BAC = 180^circ - 108^circ = 72^circ (angle sum property of a triangle). - Each of angle BAD and angle CAD is therefore 36^circ. - The height from A to FE in AFE is AD and also the bisector, hence FD = DE. 5. **Triangle BDF specifics**: - Given angle B = 108^circ in triangle ABC, we need interior angle of triangle BDF. - angle FBD = 180^circ - 108^circ = 72^circ. - angle ADF = 90^circ (as DF is a perpendicular). - Hence, angle ADF = angle BAD = 36^circ, since it bisects. - Therefore, angle AFD = 180^circ - angle ADF - angle ADF = 180^circ - 36^circ - 36^circ = 144^circ. 6. **Proving Isosceles Triangles**: - In triangle AFE, AD is angle bisector and height, hence triangle AFE is isosceles with AF = FE. - In triangle BDF: - Since angle FBD = angle BDF = 72^circ, which means triangle BDF is also isosceles, i.e., BD = DF. 7. **Conclusion**: - Since DF = DE and BD = DF in our isosceles setups, we solidify BD = DE.

We need to determine all integer triples ((a, m, n)) such that (a > 1), (m < n), and the sets of prime factors of (a^m - 1) and (a^n - 1) are the same. Let's prove an auxiliary lemma first. Lemma: If ( b > 1 ) is an integer and ( p ) is a prime number such that ( S(b^p - 1) = S(b - 1) ), then ( p = 2 ) and ( b + 1 ) is a power of 2. **Proof of Lemma:** Let's assume that ( p ) is an odd prime. Since, [ b^p - 1 = (b-1)(b^{p-1} + b^{p-2} + cdots + b + 1) ] and [ b^{p-1} + b^{p-2} + cdots + b + 1 = frac{b^p - 1}{b - 1}, ] we see that if ( p ) does not divide ( b-1 ), then: [ gcd(b^{p-1} + b^{p-2} + cdots + b + 1, b-1) = 1. ] Hence, [ S(b^{p-1} + b^{p-2} + cdots + b + 1) nsubseteq S(b-1), ] which contradicts the assumption ( S(b^p - 1) = S(b - 1) ). Therefore, ( p ) must divide ( b - 1 ). Let ( b - 1 = p^s cdot t ), where ( s, t in mathbb{Z}^+ ) and ( gcd(t, p) = 1 ). Then, [ b = 1 + p^s t ] and [ b^p - 1 = (1 + p^s t)^p - 1 = p p^s t + binom{p}{2} (p^s t)^2 + cdots = p^{s+1} t (1 + p^s t cdot X) ] for some integer ( X ). Since ( gcd(1 + p^s t cdot X, b - 1) = 1 ), this implies that: [ S(b^p - 1) nsubseteq S(b - 1), ] resulting in a contradiction. Thus, ( p ) must be 2, and therefore, [ b^2 - 1 = (b-1)(b+1). ] Assuming ( b ) is odd, we get: [ gcd(b-1, b+1) = 1, ] which means: [ S(b+1) nsubseteq S(b-1). ] This reveals a contradiction, indicating that ( b ) must be odd and consequently, ( b+1 ) is a power of 2. Returning to the original problem: let ( (m, n) = d ). We can denote ( n = kd ) where ( k > 1 ) since ( m < n ).

Thus, [ r = 1 Rightarrow k = 2. ] Then, [ a^d + 1 = 2^l quad l in mathbb{Z}^+, l geq 2. ] Hence, ( a ) must be an odd integer and ( d ) must be odd. If ( d > 1 ), then: [ frac{a^d + 1}{a + 1} = a^{d-1} - a^{d-2} + cdots + 1, ] which is an odd integer greater than 1, contradicting ( a^d + 1 = 2^t ).

Step 1: Prove the closed-form expression by induction - **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), [ a_1 = 3 ] The closed-form we assume is ( a_n = 2 cdot n! + 1 ). Indeed, [ a_1 = 2 cdot 1! + 1 = 2 cdot 1 + 1 = 3 ] which is true. - **Inductive Step:** Assume the formula holds for ( n ), i.e., [ a_n = 2 cdot n! + 1 ] We need to show that it holds for ( n+1 ), [ a_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n - n ] Substituting the assumed form for ( a_n ), [ a_{n+1} = (n+1)(2 cdot n! + 1) - n ] Simplifying, [ a_{n+1} = 2(n+1) cdot n! + (n+1) - n ] [ a_{n+1} = 2(n+1)! + 1 ] This confirms that our induction hypothesis holds for ( n+1 ).

We need to prove that ( AC = BD ) and that ( CD ) is also a diameter of the circle. Step-by-Step Solution: **Step 1. Establish the basic properties of the circle:** Let ( O ) be the center of the circle. Since ( AB ) is the diameter, ( O ) is the midpoint of ( AB ). Therefore, ( AO = BO = R ) where ( R ) is the radius of the circle. **Step 2. Consider the triangles formed by the chords and the center:** Since ( AC ) and ( BD ) are chords parallel to each other, we can consider the triangles ( AOC ) and ( BOD ). Notice that both ( triangle AOC ) and ( triangle BOD ) are isosceles triangles with ( AO = OC = R ) and ( BO = OD = R ). **Step 3. Prove the equality of these isosceles triangles:** The triangles ( triangle AOC ) and ( triangle BOD ) each have two sides equal to the radius of the circle and share equal corresponding angles at ( O ). That is: [ angle AOC = angle BOD ] Because ( AC parallel BD ), the alternate interior angles theorem for parallel lines cut by a transversal implies: [ angle AOC = angle BOD ] Therefore, ( triangle AOC cong triangle BOD ) by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion. **Step 4. Conclude that the lengths of the chords are equal:** Since ( triangle AOC cong triangle BOD ), the corresponding sides of the triangles are equal: [ AC = BD ] **Step 5. Determine if ( CD ) is the diameter:** Because ( A ) and ( B ) lie on the circle and ( AC parallel BD ), we know that segments ( AC ) and ( BD ) will cut across the circle symmetrically. Moreover, since ( AB ) is the diameter, both chords ( AC ) and ( BD ) need to be symmetric about ( O ). We can now observe the angles at ( A ) and ( B ): [ angle ACB text{ and } angle ADB ] These are both right angles as they subtend a diameter ( AB ) in a semicircle as per the Inscribed Angle Theorem. Therefore, the angles: [ angle CAD = angle CAB + angle BAD = 90^circ ] Since angle ( CAD ) at point ( A ) and crossing over towards ( D ), which lies on a circle’s boundary, passes through ( O ), it indicates ( CD ) as the diameter, because in a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is ( 90^circ ).

The 12th powers sum reaches its maximum when as many ( x_i )'s as possible are at the extremes of their bounds. We consider: - ( x_i = -frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ) - ( x_j = sqrt{3} ) Assuming there are ( u ) variables taking ( -frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ), ( v ) variables taking ( sqrt{3} ), and ( w ) variables taking values in ( left(-frac{1}{sqrt{3}}, sqrt{3}right) ), we seek to satisfy: [ u left(-frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right) + v (sqrt{3}) + w t = -318 sqrt{3} ] Given ( u + v + w = 1997 ).

Since team A processed 3/7 of the total calls, we can write: CA * A = (3/7) * C And since team B processed 4/7 of the total calls, we can write: CB * B = (4/7) * C We want to find the ratio CA/CB. To do this, we can divide the equation for team A by the equation for team B: (CA * A) / (CB * B) = ((3/7) * C) / ((4/7) * C) The C's cancel out, and we are left with: (CA * A) / (CB * B) = (3/7) / (4/7) Now, we can simplify the right side of the equation by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 7: (CA * A) / (CB * B) = 3/4 We know that A = (5/8)B, so we can substitute A in the equation: (CA * (5/8)B) / (CB * B) = 3/4 The B's cancel out, and we are left with: (5/8) * (CA / CB) = 3/4 Now, we can solve for CA/CB by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of (5/8), which is (8/5): CA / CB = (3/4) * (8/5) CA / CB = 24/20 CA / CB = 6/5 So, the ratio of the number of calls processed by each member of team A to the number of calls processed by each member of team B is boxed{6/5} or 1.2."},{"prompt":"w many distinct fourdigit numbers are divisible by 5 and have 47 as their last two digits?","completion":"A number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is 0 or 5.

This is because for any x_1 > x_2, f(x_1) < f(x_2), fulfilling the given inequality. Step 2: Understanding the Symmetry of f(x+2) Given f(x+2) is an even function, we know that f(x+2) = f(-(x+2)). By shifting our perspective, we realize this means the function f(x) is symmetric about the line x = 2. Step 3: Evaluating the Values of a, b, and c - For a = f(1), due to the symmetry about x=2, we can infer f(1) = f(3) because 1 and 3 are equidistant from 2. - For c = f(-frac{1}{2}), using the symmetry, f(-frac{1}{2}) = f(frac{9}{2}) because -frac{1}{2} and frac{9}{2} are equidistant from 2. Step 4: Comparing the Values Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing on [2, +infty), and given the symmetry and the specific values of x we're comparing, we get: 1. f(2) > f(frac{5}{2}) because f(x) is decreasing. 2. f(frac{5}{2}) > f(3) because f(x) is decreasing, and we know f(3) = f(1) = a. 3. f(3) > f(frac{9}{2}) because f(x) is decreasing, and we know f(frac{9}{2}) = f(-frac{1}{2}) = c. From these comparisons, we deduce f(frac{5}{2}) > f(1) > f(-frac{1}{2}), which translates to b > a > c.

It represents the central tendency of the dataset, indicating a general trend rather than the variability or stability of the data. Therefore, while useful for understanding the overall performance, it does not directly assess stability. - **Option B: The Standard Deviation of x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}** - The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. This directly assesses the stability of the yield, as it quantifies how much the yields vary from the average yield. - **Option C: The Maximum Value of x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}** - The maximum value simply identifies the highest yield among the plots.

By the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) congruence criterion, these right triangles ( S A_1 O, S A_2 O, ldots, S A_{n} O ) are congruent. 6.

This ryegrass comes from both mixtures X and Y. From mixture X, which is 40% ryegrass, we have: 66.67% * 40% = 26.668% of the final mixture is ryegrass from X. The remaining ryegrass in the final mixture must come from mixture Y.

Now, we need to find out what percentage this 8.332% is of the 33.33% that Y contributes to the final mixture. We set up the equation: (R% / 100%) * 33.33% = 8.332% To solve for R%, we divide both sides by 33.33%: R% = (8.332% / 33.33%) * 100% R% = 24.996% ≈ 25% Therefore, the percentage of ryegrass in seed mixture Y is approximately boxed{25%} ."},{"prompt":"Leo and Agrey went fishing.

These are: [ 1^2 = 1, ; 2^2 = 4, ; 3^2 = 9, ; 4^2 = 16, ; 5^2 = 25, ; 6^2 = 36, ; 7^2 = 49, ; 8^2 = 64, ; 9^2 = 81, ; 10^2 = 100, ; 11^2 = 121, ; 12^2 = 144, ; 13^2 = 169 ] 7. **Ensuring Inclusion of Perfect Squares**: We observe that the pairs ({25, 144}) include perfect squares (25 = 5^2) and (144 = 12^2). Since the union is constrained to contain exactly one element from each pair to form ( A ), ( A ) must contain at least one of these squares. 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, ( A ) must contain a perfect square as it includes one element from each restricted pair: [ boxed{25 text{ or } 144} ]"},{"prompt":"Let p: The real number x satisfies x^{2}+2ax3a^{2} < 0 (a > 0), q: The real number x satisfies x^{2}+2x8 < 0, and neg p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for neg q.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, their speeds will add up. First, let's convert the man's speed from km/h to m/s, because the length of the train is given in meters and the time in seconds. Speed of man in m/s = (Speed in km/h) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) Speed of man in m/s = 6 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of man in m/s = 6000 / 3600 Speed of man in m/s = 1.6667 m/s (approximately) Now, let's calculate the relative speed. The train passes the man in 6 seconds, and the length of the train is 150 meters. The relative speed is the distance covered divided by the time taken. Relative speed in m/s = Distance / Time Relative speed in m/s = 150 m / 6 s Relative speed in m/s = 25 m/s This relative speed is the sum of the train's speed and the man's speed because they are moving in opposite directions. Let's denote the speed of the train as V_train (in m/s). Then we have: V_train + Speed of man = Relative speed V_train + 1.6667 m/s = 25 m/s Now, we can solve for the train's speed: V_train = 25 m/s - 1.6667 m/s V_train = 23.3333 m/s (approximately) To convert the train's speed back to km/h: Speed of train in km/h = (Speed in m/s) * (3600 s / 1 h) * (1 km / 1000 m) Speed of train in km/h = 23.3333 * (3600 / 1000) Speed of train in km/h = 83.99988 km/h Rounding to a reasonable level of precision: Speed of train ≈ 84 km/h So, the speed of the train is approximately boxed{84} km/h."},{"prompt":"The number closest to sin 2023^{circ} is ( ) A: frac{1}{2} B: frac{sqrt{2}}{2} C: frac{1}{2} D: frac{sqrt{2}}{2}","completion":"To solve for the value of sin 2023^{circ} and find the number closest to it among the given options, we proceed as follows: 1.

We need to determine the conditions for real numbers a, b, and c such that for any natural number n, there exists a triangle with sides a^n, b^n, and c^n. 2. For a set of three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem which states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. 3. Firstly, note that all three numbers a, b, and c must be positive. Thus, a > 0, b > 0, and c > 0. 4. Without loss of generality, assume a leq b leq c. This ordering simplifies the application of the triangle inequality. 5. For any natural number n, the triangle inequality must hold: a^n + b^n > c^n 6. Consider the case where b < c. For sufficiently large n: [ left(frac{a}{c}right)^n leq left(frac{b}{c}right)^n < frac{1}{2} ] since 0 < a leq b < c Rightarrow left(frac{a}{c}right) < 1 and left(frac{b}{c}right) < 1. 7. Because ( left(frac{b}{c}right)^n < frac{1}{2} ): [ a^n + b^n < frac{c^n}{2} + frac{c^n}{2} = c^n ] 8. Thus, if ( b < c ), the inequality ( a^n + b^n > c^n ) would not hold for large n, which means a triangle cannot be formed. This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, ( b ) cannot be less than ( c ). 9. Consequently, we must have ( b geq c ). Given the assumption ( b leq c ), it follows that ( b = c ). 10. Now, examine the condition ( a leq b = c ). For any natural number n, this would result in ( a^n + b^n > c^n ): [ a^n + c^n = a^n + b^n > c^n = b^n ] which is trivially true since ( a ) is positive and thus ( a^n > 0 ). Conclusion: The necessary and sufficient condition for a, b, c to form a triangle for any n is that all three numbers are positive, and the two largest numbers must be equal.

Substituting this into the given equation, we have: [ fleft(f(x) + frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2}right) = fleft(x^2 - frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2}right) + 4f(x) cdot frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2}. ] Simplifying both sides of the equation, we obtain: [ fleft(frac{x^2 + f(x)}{2}right) = fleft(frac{x^2 + f(x)}{2}right) + 2f(x)(x^2 - f(x)). ] This simplification leads to the conclusion that f(x)(x^2 - f(x)) = 0. This implies that for any real number x, either f(x) = 0 or f(x) = x^2. It's important to note that this doesn't mean f(x) is globally one of these functions, but rather that for each x, f(x) must satisfy one of these conditions. Given this, we know that f(0) = 0 in either case. Now, let's verify that f(x) = x^2 is a solution. Suppose there exists a nonzero value a such that f(a) neq a^2. Then, it must be that f(a) = 0. Setting x = 0 in the original functional equation, we find that f(y) = f(-y), indicating that f is an even function. Further, setting x = a in the original equation, we get f(y) = f(a^2 - y). By replacing y with -y, we find f(-y) = f(a^2 + y), which implies f(y) = f(y + a^2) for all y. Setting y = a^2 in the original functional equation, we arrive at: [ f(f(x) + a^2) = f(x^2 - a^2) + 4a^2 f(x). ] Given that f(f(x) + a^2) = f(f(x)) and f(x^2 - a^2) = f(x^2), we can rewrite the equation as: [ f(f(x)) = f(x^2) + 4a^2 f(x). ] Setting y = 0 in the original equation gives us f(f(x)) = f(x^2). Comparing this with the previous equation, we conclude that 4a^2 f(x) = 0 for all x, which means f(x) = 0 for all x. This function also satisfies the given functional equation. Therefore, the two functions that satisfy the given functional equation are f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x^2.

Half of the points are colored red, and the other half are colored green. Prove that there exists a line passing through one red and one green point such that exactly n red points and exactly n green points lie on one side of the line.","completion":"1. We start by considering the set of ( 4n + 2 ) points on the plane. We know that no three of these points are collinear, and they are colored such that half of them are red and half are green. 2. Let ( ell ) be an arbitrary line that is not parallel to any line segment connecting two red points. Perform a parallel translation of ( ell ) until all points lie on one side. 3. As we continue to translate this line parallel to itself from one direction to another, the line will cross through various points. 4. Every time the line ( ell ) crosses a red point, the number of red points on one side of the line will decrease by one, and the number of red points on the other side will increase by one. The same holds for green points due to the setup symmetry. 5. At some instant during this parallel translation process, the line ( ell ) will divide the plane such that exactly ( n ) red points and ( n ) green points are on one side while ( n ) red points and ( n ) green points are on the other side. 6. Now, focus on such a specific line. To simplify, we will assume this line has a designated direction and rotates around a red point ( R_1 ). 7. If we rotate the line around ( R_1 ), we keep count of the points—it will eventually hit another red point, ( R_2 ). 8. Continue rotating the line around ( R_2 ) and later around successive red points, noting that the balance of red points ( n ) on each side of the line is maintained due to even division during the rotation. 9. Whenever the line intersects a new red point, the structure of points on either side keeps adjusting finely by just one unit causing an equitable transition in partitioning between red and green points. 10. Finally, at some moment during rotation about successive red points until half a complete rotation, the line will concurrently accommodate the ( n ) green points and ( n ) red points on each side given our assumptions and constraints. 11. Ultimately, our conclusion follows by the principle that every transition through points leads to a stable partition satisfying the requirements without loss or misbalance in point set distribution. Therefore, there exists such a line that passe through one red point and one green point with exactly ( n ) red points and ( n ) green points on either side of the line.

Moreover, we want to ensure that each domino does not touch more than two other dominos of its color. 1. **Labeling the Grid as a Checkerboard:** Consider the (3000 times 3000) square grid. We will label it as a checkerboard where every cell ((i, j)) can be referenced through its row (i) and column (j). 2. **Color Assignment Based on Parity:** We can assign colors to the cells based on the parity of row and column indices modulo 3. Specifically, we assign a color based on the value of ((i-j) mod 3): - Cells where ((i - j) equiv 0 pmod{3}) will be colored Yellow. - Cells where ((i - j) equiv 1 pmod{3}) will be colored Blue. - Cells where ((i - j) equiv 2 pmod{3}) will be colored Red. 3. **Coloring the Dominos:** Given each domino occupies two adjacent cells, consider the position of the cells within the domino. A (1 times 2) domino will cover either: - A cell at ((i, j)) and ((i, j+1)) - Or a cell at ((i, j)) and ((i+1, j)) 4. **Ensuring Color Balance:** We must show that the colors Yellow, Blue, and Red are equally represented in the tiling: - Since there are (3000 times 3000 = 9,000,000) cells and we are using three colors, each color should occupy exactly (frac{9,000,000}{3} = 3,000,000) cells. 5. **Verification of Color Touching Rule:** We need to check that each domino does not touch more than two other dominos of the same color. Due to the coloring scheme based on the diagonal modulo 3 rule, adjacent cells differing by one index in either direction will have different colors modulo 3. Thus: - Each domino contains two cells from different colors, ensuring no domino will belong entirely to a single color segment. - By arranging based on ((i-j) mod 3) rule, we ensure alternating patterns that splits adjacencies according to the predefined non-touching rule. 6. **Resulting Configuration:** Through this method, each domino occupies cells from different rows and columns, thus respecting the constraints given in the problem. The systematic coloration ensures that no touching condition exceeds two adjacent dominos of the same color, and color distribution is equal. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is possible to color the (3000 times 3000) square divided into (1 times 2) dominos such that each color is equally represented and no domino touches more than two others of the same color.

What is the maximum number of cities in this country? To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the airline network and how cities can be interconnected under the given constraints. 1. **Understanding the Constraints**: - Each city is connected to at most three other cities. - Any city can reach any other city with no more than one transfer, implying that the graph formed by the cities and air routes has a maximum diameter of 2. 2. **Graph Representation**: - Let the cities be represented as vertices and the air routes as edges in a graph (G). - The degree of each vertex (city) is at most 3. 3. **Using Graph Theory**: - We need to ensure that the distance between any two vertices is at most 2. This suggests that the graph is highly connected but with a constraint on the vertex degree. - The problem boils down to finding the maximum number of vertices in such a graph. 4. **Analyzing the Problem**: - Let's denote the number of cities (vertices) as (n). - Each city can connect to at most 3 other cities directly. Hence, each city is connected directly, or via another city, to all other cities within two steps. 5. **Counting Edges and Vertices**: - Consider the total number of edges (E) in the graph. If each vertex has a degree of at most 3, and there are (n) vertices, the maximum number of edges is ( frac{3n}{2} ) (since each edge is counted twice, once at each end). 6. **Ensuring All Pairs of Cities Are Within 2 Steps**: - If we consider an optimal structure, each city should be part of a triangle, simplifying the reachability condition. - A structure that fits the description is a K3,3 graph as the base. Extending this pattern to include maximum vertex complement conditions. 7. **-verification**: - To find the precise count, observe the connectivity pattern. We use combinatorial counting ensuring the 2 step connectivity. - On expansion adding one degree nodes allows reachability count verification ensuring patterns in interval sub-group counts. 8. **Conclusion**: - After mathematical verification using graph properties of interconnections, triangular properties and verification of max-reach count: Finally, combining the constraints and maximum reach concept, the conclusion is achieved.

Specifically, we need to prove there is a line that divides the vertices of mathscr{A} such that one part lies entirely within or on the boundary of mathscr{B}. 1. **Identify Possible Transformations**: Given two regular n-gons mathscr{A} and mathscr{B} with centers O_{A} and O_{B} respectively, let's assume a vertex C of mathscr{A} is aligned with a vertex A of mathscr{B}. Consider transformations - either translation or dilation such that vertices of mathscr{A} align with those of mathscr{B}. 2. **Establish Line Segments**: Suppose you have point C on the boundary of mathscr{B} and that after transforming C via rotation by theta = frac{2pi}{n}, that C maps into mathscr{B}. Focus on aligning C with one vertex of mathscr{B}, say A. Let overrightarrow{O_{B}C} = overrightarrow{O_{A}A}. 3. **Rotational Symmetry**: Utilize the rotational symmetry property of the n-gons. Rotating through multiples of 2pi/n centered at O_{B}, check if every rotation ktheta, k in mathbb{Z} keeps vertices within mathscr{B}'s boundaries. Since regular polygons are symmetric, these rotations should preserve these properties. 4. **Using Coordinate System**: Introduce a coordinate axis system centered at O_{B} with one axis through A and the opposite vertex of mathscr{B}. The x-axis establishes a baseline for easier tracking of transformations. 5. **Analyze Segments and Vertices**: Construct line segments between all vertices of mathscr{A} and mathscr{B}. Consider a point C_1, C_2, C_3 from mathscr{A} and lineup them in a coordinate system C_2 lies between C_1 and C_3. Check mappings of these points to A_i in mathscr{B} ensuring their connectivity. 6. **Use Linear Combinations**: By translating or scaling, ensure that respective vectors overrightarrow{C_1C_2} and overrightarrow{C_2C_3} align such that translations or proportional changes within O_{A} ensure resulting vertices lie within mathscr{B}’s boundaries. 7. **Verification**: By analyzing specific points’ transformations, show if vertex C_2 between C_1 and C_3 post rotation/transformation still preserves the vertex sequence within mathscr{B} using polygon connectivity properties. 8. **Conclusion**: Conclusively proving using both rotational operations and linear transformations, vertices of mathscr{A} within mathscr{B} maintain connectivity throughout, ensuring an unbroken set of vertices under the described operations.

We aim to maximize the number of coloured cells while meeting the criteria that every coloured cell must be adjacent to at least one uncoloured cell, and every uncoloured cell must be adjacent to at least one coloured cell. Step-by-Step Explanation: 1. **Identify Constraints**: - For each group of four cells, it is necessary to have at least one cell uncoloured, or else some cells would be isolated from uncoloured cells. This means that each 2 times 2 subgrid out of the four in our 4 times 4 grid, must contain at least one uncoloured cell. 2. **Divide the Grid**: - Consider dividing the 4 times 4 grid into four 2 times 2 subgrids: [ begin{matrix} A & A & B & B A & A & B & B C & C & D & D C & C & D & D end{matrix} ] - Each of the four subgrids labeled ( A ), ( B ), ( C ), and ( D ) must have at least one uncoloured cell. 3. **Minimum Uncoloured Cells**: - There are 4 subgrids and each requires at least one uncoloured cell. Hence, there must be at least 4 uncoloured cells in the entire grid. 4. **Maximum Coloured Cells Calculation**: - The total number of cells is 16, and with a minimum of 4 uncoloured cells, the maximum number of coloured cells is: [ 16 - 4 = 12 ] 5. **Verify Arrangement**: - We can arrange 12 coloured cells in various ways.

Its top face has 3 points (since it's visible). The adjacent face which is hidden and opposite must have 2 points (ensuring compliance with the symmetry of the cube arrangement). Therefore, this cube has: - Top face with 3 points. - Bottom face must have the hidden face opposite with 2 points. - The left face will have 1 point because adjacent faces must have different point arrangements. 4. **Placing the Middle Horizontal Cube and Determining its Facing Points:** The horizontal middle cube to the left in the upper row: - This cube is identical to the previous one. - Therefore, by analyzing the face facing left (B), it has 2 points. - The rear face also needs to follow the defined pattern and must have the other remaining required point distribution. 5. **Deduce with Constraints for the Remaining Position Arrangement:** Now for the last alignment: - Top cube in the bottom row has specifically already determined the topmost distribution.

This property is crucial for understanding the behavior of g(x) and its relationship with f(x). 2. **Relating f(x) and g(x) using given equations:** We are given f(x) + g(2-x) = 5. By substituting the symmetry property of g(x), we get f(x) + g(2+x) = 5. If we let x be replaced by -x, we obtain f(-x) + g(2-x) = 5. Since g(2-x) = g(2+x), it follows that f(-x) = f(x), indicating that f(x) is an even function. 3. **Determining f(0):** Given g(2) = 4 and from the equation f(0) + g(2) = 5, we can solve for f(0) as f(0) = 5 - g(2) = 5 - 4 = 1. 4. **Symmetry of f(x) about the point (-1, -1):** From the second given equation g(x) - f(x-4) = 7, we can express g(2-x) in terms of f(x) as g(2-x) = f(-x-2) + 7. Substituting this into the first given equation f(x) + g(2-x) = 5, we get f(x) + f(-x-2) = -2. This shows that f(x) is symmetric about the point (-1, -1). 5. **Periodicity of f(x):** Since f(x) + f(-x-2) = -2 and knowing that f(-x) = f(x) (even function), we can rewrite this as f(x) + f(x+2) = -2. This implies that f(x+2) + f(x+4) = -2, leading to the conclusion that f(x+4) = f(x). Therefore, f(x) has a period of 4. 6. **Calculating specific values of f(x):** - From f(0) + f(2) = -2 and knowing f(0) = 1, we find f(2) = -3. - Since f(x) is periodic with a period of 4, f(3) = f(-1) = f(1) = -1. 7. **Summation of f(k) for k = 1 to 22:** Given the periodicity and specific values, we can calculate sum _{k=1}^{22}f(k) as follows: [ sum _{k=1}^{22}f(k) = 6f(1) + 6f(2) + 5f(3) + 5f(4) = 11 times (-1) + 5 times 1 + 6 times (-3) = -24 ] Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}, which is -24."},{"prompt":"Determine the value of ( k ) such that the polynomial ( 2x^3 8x^2 + kx 10 ) is divisible by ( x2 ).

The task is to find the vertex angle 2 alpha of the first two cones. 1. Let 2 alpha be the desired angle, beta = frac{pi}{6}, and gamma = frac{5pi}{12}. 2. Consider spheres inscribed in each cone with centers O_1, O_2, and O_3, respectively. These spheres are externally tangent to each other. 3. The tangents drawn from point A to all the spheres are of equal length because every pair of spheres has a common tangent. 4. Let the fourth cone be tangent to these spheres at points B, C, and D.

Let H be the point of tangency of the spheres with centers at O_1 and O_2. Let varphi = angle HAD.

Then, move two cells to the right and one cell down, color that cell with the next color (e.g., the second color out of ( n ) colors initially used), and continue this for all ( n-1 ) cells. 4. Ensuring No Overlapping Sets: If ( n ) is odd: - You move right until you reach the end of the row. - Once you reach the right edge, move to the next column on the left and start from the top, continuing this pattern. - This way, you'll cover all cells while keeping your cells non-overlapping and no two cells in the same row or column. If ( n ) is even: - Move right until you reach the end, jump to the first column of the next row. - Continue the pattern while ensuring no two cells share a row or column. 5. Handling Boundary Cases: For both even and odd ( n ): When you reach the bottom-right corner, you will have covered ( n ) colors. Suppose you encounter more than ( n-1 ) cells of a single color; in this case, remove one to balance the set count to ( n-1 ). 6. Conclusion: Upon successfully applying the pattern of movements and coloring, you will have constructed ( n+1 ) non-overlapping original sets for any ( n ). Thus, the solution is valid for any ( n ).

When the thousandth house spirit entered the elevator, it stopped. On which floor did this happen? Explain your answer.","completion":"1. Let's begin by understanding the problem: The elevator makes stops at each floor of a seven-story building to let in one house spirit at each floor, but no one leaves. Since the elevator moves between the first and seventh floor, stopping at all floors, we will analyze how house spirits enter over multiple trips. 2. First, establish the number of house spirits that enter the elevator in a complete up-and-down trip. During an upward trip from the 1st to the 7th floor, one house spirit gets on at each of the 7 floors (since spirits enter the elevator on every floor). On the return trip from the 7th back to the 1st floor, house spirits again enter the elevator at every floor. However, recall that no spirits exit the elevator. Specifically: - On the 1st floor, only one house spirit enters. - From the 2nd to the 6th floors, two spirits enter: one during the upward trip and one during the downward trip. - On the 7th floor, only one house spirit enters. Therefore, the total number of house spirits entering the elevator in one complete cycle is calculated as: [ 1 + 2 times 5 + 1 = 1 + 10 + 1 = 12 text{ spirits} ] 3. Determine how many complete cycles the elevator makes to approach the total of 1000 house spirits. To calculate the number of complete cycles: [ leftlfloor frac{1000}{12} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 83.33ldots rightrfloor = 83 text{ complete cycles} ] 4. Calculate the total number of house spirits after 83 complete cycles: [ 83 times 12 = 996 text{ spirits} ] 5. Since the elevator must accommodate 1000 house spirits, the remaining spirits to reach 1000 is: [ 1000 - 996 = 4 text{ spirits} ] 6. Identify the floors where the next 4 house spirits will get on in the subsequent trip: - One spirit enters on the first floor. - One spirit enters on the second floor. - One spirit enters on the third floor. - One spirit enters on the fourth floor. The elevator then has its 1000th spirit when it reaches the fourth floor of its 84th ascent. Conclusion: The 1000th house spirit enters the elevator on the **fourth floor**.

Thus, for any point X on the circle, if X' is its reflection about l, then OX = O'X'. 4. **Relationships and Geometry**: - Note that segment KO intersects line l at some point Q', and segment MO' also intersects l at Q'. - Since triangle KQ'M and triangle KOP are symmetrical with respect to l, we know angle KMQ' = angle KPO. 5. **Parallel Line Argument**: - Since angle KMQ' = angle KPO, then MQ' parallel PO. - Because KP parallel OO' (due to the symmetry and the reflection point O'), we establish that quadrilateral PMO'O is a parallelogram. 6. **Conclusion**: - By the properties of parallelograms, opposite sides are equal: [ PM = OO' = 2QO ] - Hence the length PM is twice the length of the perpendicular from the center O of the circle to the angle bisector of angle ABC.

They can simply be orthogonal. - Therefore, statement A is incorrect because overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 0 does not imply overrightarrow{a} = 0 or overrightarrow{b} = 0 unless one of them is indeed the zero vector. **For Statement B:** - Given overrightarrow{a} = (3,4) and overrightarrow{b} = (0,1). - The projection of overrightarrow{a} onto overrightarrow{b} is calculated as text{proj}_{overrightarrow{b}} overrightarrow{a} = frac{overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{b}|^2} overrightarrow{b}. - Calculating the dot product, overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 3*0 + 4*1 = 4. - The magnitude of overrightarrow{b} is |overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{0^2 + 1^2} = 1. - Therefore, text{proj}_{overrightarrow{b}} overrightarrow{a} = frac{4}{1^2} cdot (0,1) = (0,4). - Hence, statement B is correct. **For Statement C:** - If overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} < 0, it indicates that the cosine of the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is negative, which means the angle is obtuse. - However, stating that they must be opposite vectors is not accurate in this context.

How many inches are there in a foot?","completion":"To find out how many inches there are in a foot, we can use the information given about the area of Blossom's room. We know that the room is 10 feet long in each direction, so it is a square with each side being 10 feet. The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one side. Therefore, the area in square feet is: Area = side length × side length Area = 10 feet × 10 feet Area = 100 square feet We are given that the area of the room in square inches is 14400. To convert the area from square feet to square inches, we need to know how many square inches there are in a square foot. Let's call the number of inches in a foot \\"x\\". Since a square foot is a square with each side being 1 foot, in square inches it would be: Area in square inches = x inches × x inches Area in square inches = x^2 square inches So, 1 square foot is equal to x^2 square inches. Since the room is 100 square feet, and we know that the area in square inches is 14400, we can set up the following equation: 100 square feet × x^2 square inches/square foot = 14400 square inches Now we can solve for x^2: 100x^2 = 14400 Divide both sides by 100 to solve for x^2: x^2 = 14400 / 100 x^2 = 144 Now, take the square root of both sides to solve for x: x = √144 x = 12 Therefore, there are boxed{12} inches in a foot."},{"prompt":"A cougar is sleeping for 4 hours at night, and a zebra for 2 hours more.

Since there are 250 employees in total and 90 are female, we can subtract the number of females from the total number of employees to find the number of males: Total number of male employees = Total employees - Female employees Total number of male employees = 250 - 90 Total number of male employees = 160 Now, we know that there are 160 male associates. Since all the male employees are either managers or associates, and we have the number of male associates, we can conclude that there are no male managers because the number of male associates is equal to the total number of male employees. We are also told that there are 40 female managers. Since we have no male managers, the total number of managers is just the number of female managers.
