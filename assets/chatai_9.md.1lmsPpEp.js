To approach this scientifically, let us construct a graph where the vertices represent the numbers from 1 to ( n ), and an edge connects vertices ( a ) and ( b ) if their sum ( a + b ) is a perfect square. 2. **Graph Coloring and Odd-Length Cycles**: For any partition of the numbers from 1 to ( n ) into two subsets, consider coloring the numbers in one subset white and the numbers in the other subset black. If the graph does not contain cycles of odd length, then by coloring the vertices of the graph alternately black and white, we ensure a partition where no two numbers with a sum equal to a perfect square lie in the same subset. If the graph contains odd-length cycles, then for any two-coloring of the vertices of such a cycle, there will be two adjacent vertices of the same color, corresponding to two numbers in the same subset whose sum is a perfect square. 3. **Minimum ( n ) with an Odd-Length Cycle**: For ( n = 15 ), it is not hard to find an odd-length cycle in the graph formed by numbers 1 to 15: [ 1 to 3 to 6 to 10 to 15 to 1, ] where each edge connects vertices whose sum is a perfect square: [ 1+3=4, quad 3+6=9, quad 6+10=16, quad 10+15=25, quad 15+1=16. ] Therefore, for ( n geq 15 ), a good partition where no subset contains a pair summing to a perfect square is impossible. 4. **Partitions for ( n = 14 )**: Now let’s verify if ( n = 14 ) or smaller still allows a proper partition.

Prove that all of these graphs have the same chromatic number.","completion":"To prove that the chromatic number of the triangulation graph of any convex (n)-gon is always 3, we will proceed using mathematical induction on (n). Base Case: 1. For (n = 3), we have a triangle. Clearly, the chromatic number of a triangle is 3 as we can use three different colors, one for each vertex. This establishes the base case. Inductive Step: 2. Assume that any triangulation of a convex (k)-gon has a chromatic number of 3 for some integer (kgeq 3). This forms our inductive hypothesis. 3. Now, consider a convex ((k+1))-gon. We need to prove that any triangulation of this ((k+1))-gon also has a chromatic number of 3. 4. In the triangulation of the ((k+1))-gon, there are ((k+1)-3 = k-2) diagonals, which along with the ((k+1)) sides, divide the polygon into ((k+1) - 2 = k-1) triangles. 5. By the Pigeonhole Principle, a ((k+1))-gon must contain at least one triangle formed by the sides of the original ((k+1))-gon (i.e., a triangle with two sides of the polygon and one diagonal or just the boundary of the polygon). 6. Remove one of these triangles from the ((k+1))-gon. This results in a (k)-gon (convex (k)-gon). 7. By our inductive hypothesis, any triangulation of a convex (k)-gon has a chromatic number of 3. Thus, the remaining (k)-gon after removing the triangle can be colored using three colors. 8. Adding back the removed triangle to restore the ((k+1))-gon, we note that this adds only one new vertex to be colored. This new vertex connects to exactly two existing vertices (since it forms a triangle). 9. Since the chromatic number of the original (k)-gon is 3, the two vertices to which the new vertex connects are already colored with two different colors (say colors 1 and 2). 10. We can color the new vertex with the third color (say color 3), which maintains that all adjacent vertices have different colors. 11. Therefore, the chromatic number of the triangulated ((k+1))-gon remains 3. Conclusion: By induction, we've established that any triangulation of a convex (n)-gon can be colored using 3 colors for any (n geq 3). Thus, we conclude that all triangulations of an (n)-gon have a chromatic number of 3.

Therefore, line DE is a diameter line passing through E, where E is another point on the circumcircle directly opposite D. - Applying **Thales' theorem**, line segment AE is the external angle bisector of angle BAC. 4. **Conclusion**: - The perpendicular bisector of side BC, which passes through point D, intersects the circumcircle of triangle ABC at the point E. - Hence, the external angle bisector passes through E. blacksquare Second Solution: 1. **Consider the external angle**: - The external angle angle BAC is given by (180^circ - alpha) where alpha = angle BAC. - This angle is equal to the inscribed angle that subtends arc BC. 2. **Locate points on the circumcircle**: - Given point E is such that angle BEC = 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2}, where E lies on the circumcircle. - This implies that E is the midpoint of arc BC of the circumcircle. 3. **Bisector and perpendicular relationship**: - The inscribed angle angle BEC creates two equal angles at point E on the circumcircle. - The line DE perpendicular to BC and passing through point D is actually the diameter, bisecting BC and extending through E. - Thus, DE and the external angle bisector intersect at the circle as E lies on both trajectories. 4. **Conclusion**: - The external angle bisector of angle BAC, being perpendicular to AD, intersects the circle at point E, where DE passes through. - Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of side BC intersects at E, emphasizing both the angle bisector and perpendicular bisection intersecting at E. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A rectangular box has integer side lengths in the ratio 1:2:5.

We need to prove that the number ( 2^n - 1 ) is divisible by ( left(2^m - 1 right)^2 ) if and only if ( n ) is divisible by ( m left(2^m - 1 right) ). 2. First, let's analyze the term ( 2^{km} - 1 ) for some integer ( k ). Notice that: [ 2^{km} - 1 text{ is divisible by } 2^m - 1 ] 3. Consider the general case of ( 2^{km + d} - 1 ) where ( d ) is some integer.

To determine the exact reflection point (X), we note that (X) must lie on the intersection of line (I) and an arc of a circle centered at an appropriate location so that it subtends (180^circ - varphi). 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we conclude that the reflection point (X) is found at the intersection of the line (I) with the arc of the circle defined by (A_{1} B) subtending the supplementary angle of (180^circ - varphi). Hence, the law of reflection determines the point (X) and confirms the travel path of the ray from (A) to (B). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The sequence lg 1000, lg left(1000 cos frac{pi}{3}right), lg left(1000 cos ^{2} frac{pi}{3}right), cdots, lg left(1000 cos ^{n1} frac{pi}{3}right), cdots, when the sum of the first n terms is maximized, the value of n is ( ).

Out of the total amount, she spent 34 percent on clothing, 19 percent on food, 20 percent on electronics, 12 percent on household items, 10 percent on cosmetics, and 5 percent on miscellaneous items. If Rose paid a 6 percent tax on clothing, a 4 percent tax on food, a 12 percent tax on electronics, a 7 percent tax on household items, a 5 percent tax on cosmetics, and an 8 percent tax on miscellaneous items, she also received an additional 3 percent discount on any taxes for being a loyal customer. What percent of the total amount she spent, excluding taxes, corresponds to the final total tax that she paid after applying the loyalty discount?","completion":"Let's calculate the tax Rose paid for each category before the loyalty discount: 1. Clothing tax: 34% of the total amount * 6% tax = 0.34 * 0.06 = 0.0204 or 2.04% of the total amount. 2. Food tax: 19% of the total amount * 4% tax = 0.19 * 0.04 = 0.0076 or 0.76% of the total amount. 3. Electronics tax: 20% of the total amount * 12% tax = 0.20 * 0.12 = 0.024 or 2.4% of the total amount. 4. Household items tax: 12% of the total amount * 7% tax = 0.12 * 0.07 = 0.0084 or 0.84% of the total amount. 5. Cosmetics tax: 10% of the total amount * 5% tax = 0.10 * 0.05 = 0.005 or 0.5% of the total amount. 6. Miscellaneous items tax: 5% of the total amount * 8% tax = 0.05 * 0.08 = 0.004 or 0.4% of the total amount. Now, let's sum up these taxes to find the total tax before the loyalty discount: Total tax before discount = 2.04% + 0.76% + 2.4% + 0.84% + 0.5% + 0.4% = 6.94% of the total amount. Now, let's apply the 3% loyalty discount to the total tax: Loyalty discount on tax = 6.94% * 3% = 0.0694 * 0.03 = 0.002082 or 0.2082% of the total amount. Finally, let's subtract the loyalty discount from the total tax before the discount to find the final total tax: Final total tax = Total tax before discount - Loyalty discount on tax Final total tax = 6.94% - 0.2082% = 6.7318% of the total amount. Therefore, the final total tax that Rose paid after applying the loyalty discount corresponds to approximately boxed{6.7318%} of the total amount she spent, excluding taxes."},{"prompt":"A train running at the speed of 70 km/hr crosses a pole in 36 seconds.

This means that for every interval of length 2pi, the sine function completes one full cycle, going from 0 to 1, back to 0, down to -1, and back to 0. 2. **Understanding the Exponential Decay Function**: The function y = left( frac{1}{2} right)^x is an exponential decay function. It starts from 1 at x = 0 and approaches 0 as x increases, but it never actually reaches 0. This function is always positive and continuously decreases. 3. **Comparing the Two Functions on Intervals of (2pi n, 2pi n + pi)**: On intervals of the form (2pi n, 2pi n + pi), where n is a nonnegative integer, the sine function goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0. During this interval, because the exponential function is always decreasing, it will intersect with the sine function twice - once as the sine function increases to 1, and once as it decreases back to 0. 4. **Comparing the Two Functions on Intervals of (2pi n + pi, 2pi n + 2pi)**: On intervals of the form (2pi n + pi, 2pi n + 2pi), the sine function goes from 0 to -1 and back to 0. Since the exponential function is always positive, it will not intersect with the sine function in these intervals. 5. **Counting the Number of Solutions**: Since there are 50 intervals of the form (2pi n, 2pi n + pi) in the interval (0, 100pi) (because 100pi / 2pi = 50), and in each of these intervals the two functions intersect twice, the total number of solutions to sin x = left( frac{1}{2} right)^x on the interval (0, 100pi) is 50 times 2 = 100.

Therefore, the same path exists in ( G ). - **Case 2:** For any vertex ( A ) in ( G ), ( deg(A) geq m+1 ). - We can construct a path as follows: - Start with a vertex ( A_0 ). - Choose a vertex ( A_1 ) connected to ( A_0 ). Since ( deg(A_0) geq m+1 ), such a vertex exists. - Choose a vertex ( A_2 ) connected to ( A_1 ) but not equal to ( A_0 ).

Because: [ a_{k} geq frac{a_{1} + a_{2} + ldots + a_{k}}{k} > frac{n+1}{4k} ] Thus: [ b_{k} < 1 - frac{n+1}{4k} ] 7. **Calculate the Bound for Bottom Row Sum:** - Hence, the sum of the remaining elements in the bottom row: [ (n+1-k) b_{k} < (n+1-k) left(1-frac{n+1}{4k}right) ] [ = (n+1-k) - (n+1-k) cdot frac{n+1}{4k} ] [ = (n+1-k) - frac{(n+1)(n+1-k)}{4k} ] By simplifying, we get: [ = frac{5(n+1-k)}{4} - frac{(n+1)^2}{4k} ] [ leq frac{5(n+1)}{4} - frac{(2(n+1) cdot 2k)}{4k} ] [ = frac{5(n+1)}{4} - frac{(n+1)(2)}{4} = frac{n+1}{4} ] This completes the proof, showing that it is possible to delete the elements as required such that the sums of the remaining elements in each row do not exceed ( frac{n+1}{4} ).

This transformation is useful because it allows us to consider the expression as a sum of a square and a constant. 3. **Modulo Analysis**: - We consider (2m-1)^2 equiv -43 pmod{p}. For p = 3, 5, 7, we check if -43 is a quadratic residue modulo p. We find that -43 is not a perfect square modulo p for these primes. Therefore, all prime factors of m^2 - m + 11 must be geq 11. 4. **Factorization into Primes**: - Let m^2 - m + 11 = pqrs for primes 11 leq p leq q leq r leq s. We need to find the smallest m for which this holds. 5. **Case Analysis**: - **Case 1**: Suppose p = 11. Then m^2 - m + 11 = 11qrs. Reducing modulo 11, we get m^2 - m equiv 0 pmod{11}, which implies m equiv 0, 1 pmod{11}. Let m = 11k or m = 11k + 1. Substituting these into the equation and simplifying leads to further cases, but they do not yield a valid solution for four distinct primes. - **Case 2**: If p = q = r = s = 11, then m^2 - m + 11 = 11^4. Solving (2m-1)^2 = 4 cdot 11^4 - 43, we find that this does not yield a perfect square between two consecutive squares, leading to a contradiction. 6. **Finding the Minimum m**: - We find that m = 132 satisfies m^2 - m + 11 = 11^3 cdot 13, which is a product of four primes (three 11's and one 13). Checking smaller values of m does not satisfy the condition of being a product of at least four primes. Thus, the least positive integer m such that m^2 - m + 11 is a product of at least four not necessarily distinct primes is boxed{132}."},{"prompt":"The point M (1, 2, 3) is symmetric with respect to the origin.

For which n does there exist a coloring such that for any 3 different colors among the n colors, one can always find a triangle with vertices at p's vertices and its three sides colored with these 3 different colors?","completion":"1. **Define Parameters:** - Consider an n-gon ( p ) where each edge and each diagonal can be colored using one of n colors. The goal is to find for which values of ( n ) there exists a coloring such that any selection of three different colors will always include a triangle where each side is a different color and whose vertices are vertices of ( p ). 2. **Combination Counts:** - For any ( 3 ) vertices, the number of triangles that can be formed is ( C_n^3 ). Similarly, for the colors there are ( C_n^3 ) different ways to choose three colors from ( n ) colors. 3. **Satisfying Conditions:** - The coloring should satisfy that each combination of three colors corresponds to a distinct triangle's edges being colored in the three different colors. This means each color combination is uniquely associated with a specific triangle within the ( n )-gon ( p ). 4. **Color Distribution:** - Let's denote (left(A_i A_jright)) as a line segment (either an edge or a diagonal of the ( n )-gon). For each color, the other ( n-2 ) colors can be combined in ( C_{n-2}^2 ) ways, therefore each color will appear on ( C_{n-2}^2 ) triangles. 5. **Equal Distribution Requirement:** - For the coloring to be valid under the problem conditions, each color's line segments should appear on ( frac{1}{n} C_n^2 ) triangles. Given that ( C_n^2 = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ), this simplifies to ( frac{1}{2}(n-1) ). 6. **Determining Feasibility:** - If ( n ) is even, ( frac{1}{2}(n-1) ) is not an integer, making it impossible to distribute colors equally. Thus, for ( n geq 4 ) and even, no such coloring scheme exists. - If ( n ) is odd, say ( n = 2m+1 ), then ( frac{1}{2}(n-1) = m ) is an integer. 7. **Explicit Coloring Proof for Odd ( n = 2m+1 ):** - Consider an ( (2m+1) )-gon and label the vertices as ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2m+1} ). - Indexing vertices ( A_i ) with modulo ( 2m+1 ) where ( i equiv j (text{mod } 2m+1) ). - For colors labeled as ( 1, 2, ldots, 2m+1 ), color edge ( A_i A_{i+1} ) with color ( i ). - For each ( i ), color segment ( A_{i-k} A_{i+1+k} ) with color ( i ), for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, m-1 ). - Thus, each color uniformly appears on ( m ) line segments. 8. **Uniqueness in Coloring:** - Any two segments of the same color result in the constraints: - If ( A_{i_1}A_{j_1} ) and ( A_{i_2}A_{j_2} ) are same color: i_1 + j_1 equiv i_2 + j_2 (text{mod } 2m+1) text{ and} i_1 - j_1 equiv i_2 - j_2 (text{mod } 2m+1), - Ensuring different color configurations for any two segments sharing a vertex. 9. **Conclusion:** - For ( n ) odd, there exists a coloring method that satisfies the given requirements.

Indeed, when ( t > frac{b - a}{1 - k} ), it will hold that: [ a + t > b + kt ] which simplifies to: [ t(1 - k) > b - a ] or: [ t > frac{b - a}{1 - k} ] 5. Therefore, after this moment, the ( x )-coordinate of bug ( A ) will be greater than that of any other bug. - This implies that, starting from a certain moment in time ( t = t_A ), if we draw a line through bug ( A ) perpendicular to its direction of motion, all other bugs will be located on one side of this line. 6. Apply similar reasoning for every other bug. You'll find that for each bug, there comes a moment in time when all other bugs lie on one side of a line perpendicular to its direction of motion. - This ensures that at some maximum moment ( t_A ) for all the bugs, all the bugs will be positioned such that the lines perpendicular to their direction of motion will divide the plane into regions where no bugs are left isolated from the rest. 7. Consider the convex hull of the bugs at this moment. - A convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing all the bugs. - The vertices of this convex hull will be some of the bugs. 8. Assume if possible that not all bugs are vertices of the convex hull ( M ). - Then for some bug which is not a vertex, any line through this bug will result in bugs on both sides of the line, contradicting the earlier finding. - However, as it has been established, for each bug, there is a line such that all other bugs lie on one side, contradicting our current assumption. 9.

After the inversion, the points (A', B', C', D') correspond to the midpoints of segments (ZW, WX, XY, YZ) respectively.

First, consider the given regular m-sided polygon C, which is inscribed within a circle.

The construction of S(n) involves the following: 1. **Select a Circle with Radius r_n:** Define S(n) as the set of points inside a circle with center O and radius r_n. The value of r_n should satisfy: [ r < r_n < R ] This ensures that the circle of radius r_n is not entirely covered by C since r_n > r means the circle is larger than the inscribed circle of C. 2. **Intersecting Points on Polygon Edges:** Consider the points Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_{2m} where the boundary of S(n) intersects with the edges of the polygon C.

The distance d between M and the circle's center (3, 0) is given by d^2 = (y^2 - 3)^2 + 2y^2 = y^4 - 4y^2 + 9 = (y^2 - 2)^2 + 5. The minimum distance d_text{min} = sqrt{5} occurs when y^2 = 2. At this point, the length of the tangent is sqrt{5 - 2} = sqrt{3}. Therefore, the minimum value of |ST| is 2 times frac{sqrt{3} times sqrt{2}}{sqrt{5}} = boxed{frac{2sqrt{30}}{5}}.

Once a minute, a dress can be taken out of it, which will be one of 10 colors and one of 9 styles. However, within one hour, it is impossible to take out two dresses from the chest that share both the same color and style. What is the minimum number of dresses the princesses need to take out from the chest to guarantee having 6 dresses of different colors but the same style?","completion":"To determine the minimum number of dresses the princesses need to extract from the magical chest in order to guarantee getting 6 dresses of different colors of the same style, we first examine the problem step by step. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** Each dress can be of one of 10 colors and one of 9 styles. Therefore, there are ( 10 times 9 = 90 ) different dresses in total. 2. **Formulate the Requirement:** Since we need 6 dresses of different colors but the same style, and since it's impossible to get two dresses of the same color and style within 46 minutes, we need to find the minimum number of extractions that ensure this requirement. 3. **Maximum Dresses Per Style Without Meeting Requirement:** Suppose the princesses extract dresses randomly. If they extract a maximum of 5 dresses per style, they might not get 6 dresses of any style. The worst-case scenario is they get exactly 5 dresses of each of the 9 styles. This makes a total of: [ 5 text{ dresses/style} times 9 text{ styles} = 45 text{ dresses} ] After extracting 45 dresses, they still might not have 6 dresses of any style. 4. **One More Extraction:** Therefore, extracting just one more dress (which would total 46 dresses) guarantees that there must be at least one style for which they have extracted 6 dresses. This is because, by the Pigeonhole Principle, with 46 extractions and only 9 styles: [ leftlceil frac{46}{9} rightrceil = 6 ] ensuring that at least one style must have at least 6 dresses. 5. **Ensuring Different Colors:** Since it’s impossible to extract two dresses of the same color and style within 46 minutes, having at least 6 dresses of the same style implies that these dresses must be of different colors. # Conclusion: Thus, the minimum number of dresses the princesses must extract to ensure they get 6 dresses of different colors of the same style is [ boxed{46} ]"},{"prompt":"Choose one digit from 0, 2 and two digits from 1, 3, 5 to form a threedigit number without repeating digits.

Consider the elements of set (A): - If ( b = 0 ), then ( a+b = a ), which must be either (-1) or (0). - If ( b = -1 ), then ( a+b = a-1 ), which must equal either (-1) or (0). 5. Check each possibility: - If ( b = 0 ): - ( a+b = a ), so ( a ) must equal (-1) or (0). However, if ( a = 0), then the three elements in ( A ) would be {1, 0, 0}, violating the distinct element condition. Thus, ( a = -1). - If ( b = -1 ): - ( a+b = a-1 ), so ( a-1 ) must be (-1) or (0). Hence, ( a = 0) or ( a = 1), respectively. However, if ( a = 0), the element (0) would again be repeated. Thus, ( a = 1 ) is impossible since ({1, -1, 0}) fits no possible combination in ( B ). 6.

Hence, M is equidistant from A, B, and I, so M is the center of k. 5. **Reflection in Line CI**: Consider a reflection about the line CI.

This indicates that all 10 coins in groups ( A ) and ( B ) are either all genuine or contain an even number of fake coins in both. Since we only care about finding a genuine coin, we focus on group ( C ), which was not weighed. - From group ( C ) (5 coins), select any 3 coins and place one in each pan and leave out 2 coins. Compare 3 against 3: - If weights are equal, then these 3 are genuine. We already had an uneven number in previous unaffected batch. We confirmed genuine in middle because no fake fit overall. - Case 2: One pan is heavier.

Therefore, option B is incorrect because it simplifies to a=b+2x or a-2x=b, not directly to a=b. **Option C**: For ax=ay, when a neq 0, dividing both sides by a indeed gives x=y. However, this transformation assumes a neq 0 because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, while option C is generally correct, it comes with the condition that a neq 0. This limitation means it does not universally meet the requirements without specifying that a neq 0. **Option D**: Starting with frac{x}{2}=frac{y}{2}, to eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by 2. This gives us 2 cdot frac{x}{2} = 2 cdot frac{y}{2}, which simplifies to x=y. This transformation is correct and does not come with conditions or limitations.

In our case, comparing it to the given asymptote sqrt{3}x+my=0, we can deduce that frac{1}{sqrt{m}}=frac{m}{sqrt{3}}. This is because the coefficient of y (which is m in the asymptote equation) should be compared to the coefficient of x (which is sqrt{3}) to find the relationship between m and the slope of the asymptote. 2. **Solve for m:** To find the value of m, we solve the equation frac{m}{sqrt{3}}=sqrt{m}. Squaring both sides gives m^2 = 3m, which simplifies to m^2 - 3m = 0. Factoring out m gives m(m - 3) = 0. Since m > 0, we discard the solution m = 0 and are left with m = 3. 3. **Substitute m into the hyperbola equation:** With m=3, the equation of the hyperbola becomes frac{{x}^{2}}{3}-y^{2}=1. 4. **Find the focal length (2c):** For a hyperbola of the form frac{{x}^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1, the focal length 2c is found using the relationship c^2 = a^2 + b^2.

The strategy involves dissecting the polygon M into smaller, more manageable shapes. 2. **Dissection into Convex Polygons:** Begin by cutting the polygon M along all possible lines on which its sides lie. This process will decompose the polygon M into several convex polygons. If M is already convex, this step is redundant. 3. **Decomposition into Triangles:** Next, each convex polygon can be divided into triangles by its diagonals. This step works because every convex polygon can be triangulated, meaning it can be divided into a set of triangles by drawing diagonals between its vertices. 4. **Transforming Triangles to Rectangles:** Each triangle can be transformed into a rectangle. A common method is to inscribe the triangle in a rectangle that circumscribes the triangle, with the base of the triangle along one side of the rectangle. By drawing an altitude of the triangle, the area is preserved, but the shape changes to a rectangle. 5. **Equal Area Rectangles:** Since each triangle from the original polygon M is now represented by a rectangle, and considering the property we've used from problem 96(b) that any triangle can be made equal in area to some rectangle, we ensure that these transformations do not change the total area of M. 6. **Combining Rectangles:** Now, we have a set of rectangles, each corresponding to a triangle that was part of the original polygon M. If these rectangles all have the same base a, we can stack them to form a larger rectangle. The sum of the areas of the original rectangles (and thus the triangles, and thus the original polygon M) is now represented by a single resultant rectangle. 7. **Final Proof of Equidecomposability:** Given that we can transform any polygon into a rectangle without changing its area, and knowing the fact from problem 96(a) that any two rectangles of equal area can be transformed into each other through rearrangement, we conclude that any two polygons of equal area can be similarly transformed or rearranged into each other. 8. **Conclusion:** By the preceding steps, we've shown that any two polygons with the same area can be rearranged into each other, satisfying the conditions of equidecomposability.

Moreover, g(-x) = frac{1 - 2^{-x}}{1 + 2^{-x}} = frac{2^{x} - 1}{2^{x} + 1} = -g(x). Hence, g(x) is an odd function. Since g(x) = -1 + frac{2}{2^{x} + 1} in (-1, 1), it follows that |g(x)| < 1. Thus, there exists an M geqslant 1 serving as the upper bound of g(x). (ii) We have g(x) = -1 + frac{2}{m cdot 2^{x} + 1}. Since m > 0 and x in [0, 1], g(x) is decreasing on [0, 1]. Hence, g(1) leqslant g(x) leqslant g(0), which implies frac{1 - 2m}{1 + 2m} leqslant g(x) leqslant frac{1 - m}{1 + m}. Given m in (0, frac{1}{2}), we have frac{1 - 2m}{1 + 2m} > 0.

The volume of the wall (in cubic meters) is: Volume_wall = length x width x height Volume_wall = 7 m x 8 m x 15.5 m Volume_wall = 868 m³ We need to convert this volume into cubic centimeters because the dimensions of the bricks are given in centimeters: 1 m³ = 100 cm x 100 cm x 100 cm = 1,000,000 cm³ Volume_wall_cm³ = 868 m³ x 1,000,000 cm³/m³ Volume_wall_cm³ = 868,000,000 cm³ Now, let's calculate the volume of a single brick without knowing its width. We have the length and the height in centimeters: Volume_brick = length x width x height Volume_brick = 20 cm x width cm x 8 cm Volume_brick = 160 cm² x width cm We know the total number of bricks needed is 4094.3396226415093, so the total volume of all the bricks combined should equal the volume of the wall: Total_volume_bricks = Volume_brick x number_of_bricks 868,000,000 cm³ = (160 cm² x width cm) x 4094.3396226415093 Now, let's solve for the width of a single brick: 868,000,000 cm³ = (160 cm² x width cm) x 4094.3396226415093 868,000,000 cm³ = 655,094.3396226415093 cm² x width cm width cm = 868,000,000 cm³ / 655,094.3396226415093 cm² width cm ≈ 1325.1572327044025 cm³/cm² width cm ≈ 13.251572327044025 cm Therefore, the width of each brick is approximately boxed{13.25} cm."},{"prompt":"A cyclic quadrilateral has one of its diagonals as the diameter of the circle.

We will consider the various possible polygons and their probabilities. Step 1: Identify possible polygons and conditions 1. **Hexagon**: This polygon forms if point (O) falls inside the orange flower-like region in the middle. 2. **Pentagon**: This polygon forms if point (O) falls anywhere else within the square, except the exact center or a vertex (which are assumed to happen with probability zero). Step 2: Calculate the probability of forming a Hexagon 1. Let the area of the square be normalized to 1. 2. We need to find the area of the orange flower region (formed by four semicircles). 3. Each semicircle adds half of (pi/4) to the total area inside the flower region. The complete area added by four semicircles is: [ S_o = 4 times left( frac{pi}{4} - frac{1}{4} right) = 4 times left( frac{pi}{4} - 0.25 right) = pi - 1 ] 4. Thus, the probability (P_{o}) that point (O) falls within the orange flower region is: [ P_{o} = pi - 1 ] Step 3: Calculate the probability of forming a Pentagon 1. The remaining area inside the square, outside the orange flower region, corresponds to forming a pentagon.

To demonstrate that there exists a line intersecting all polygons, start by considering an arbitrary line ( l ) on the plane. 2. **Projection onto the Line** Project all the given polygons onto the line ( l ). Every polygon, when projected onto ( l ), results in a line segment on ( l ). 3. **Properties of the Segments** By the problem statement, every pair of polygons intersects at least at one point. This implies that their projections, which are line segments on ( l ), must also overlap, i.e., each pair of line segments on ( l ) has at least one point in common. 4. **Selecting the Right-Most of the Left Endpoints** Consider the left endpoints of all the projected line segments on ( l ). Among these endpoints, select the one that is the farthest to the right. Denote this endpoint as ( P ). 5. **Intersection Point** The selected point ( P ) lies within the projection of each polygon, since any two segments are guaranteed to overlap. Thus, ( P ) is a common point of intersection for all the segments on ( l ). 6. **Perpendicular Line through Intersection Point** Construct a line perpendicular to ( l ) that passes through the point ( P ). Let's call this perpendicular line ( m ). 7. **Conclusion** The perpendicular line ( m ) intersects every polygon in the given set. This is because ( m ) passes through the common point ( P ), which, being part of the projection, lies on every polygon.

Similarly, the power of P with respect to Gamma_2 is PV^2 = PO_2^2 - R_2^2. 3. **Equating the Powers:** We take P to be such that its powers with respect to Gamma_1 and Gamma_2 are equal: [ PO_1^2 - R_1^2 = PO_2^2 - R_2^2 ] Rearranging, we get: [ PO_1^2 - PO_2^2 = R_1^2 - R_2^2 ] This equation describes the locus of points P such that the difference of the squares of their distances from O_1 and O_2 is a constant. 4. **Equation of the Radical Axis:** The equation PO_1^2 - PO_2^2 = R_1^2 - R_2^2 represents a straight line in the plane, known as the radical axis of the circles Gamma_1 and Gamma_2. 5. **Perpendicularity to the Line Joining the Centers:** To see that this line is perpendicular to the line joining O_1 and O_2, we note the following property: If we take any point P on the radical axis and draw perpendiculars from P to O_1O_2, denoting the foot of these perpendiculars as Q, we see that P lies on the radical axis if and only if: [ (O_1Q + QP)^2 - (O_2Q + QP)^2 = R_1^2 - R_2^2. ] Given the symmetry and the nature of the distance function, the line described by PO_1^2 - PO_2^2 = R_1^2 - R_2^2 is indeed perpendicular to O_1O_2. 6. **Special Cases:** - If Gamma_1 and Gamma_2 intersect at two points A and B, then the radical axis is the line through A and B. - If Gamma_1 and Gamma_2 are tangent at a point A, the radical axis is the common tangent at A. # Conclusion: The radical axis of the circles Gamma_1 and Gamma_2 is a straight line perpendicular to the line segment joining the centers O_1 and O_2. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"is known that O is the origin of the coordinate system, overrightarrow{OA} = (3, 1), overrightarrow{OB} = (0, 5), and overrightarrow{AC} parallel overrightarrow{OA}, overrightarrow{BC} perp overrightarrow{AB}.

First, let Gamma be the circumcircle of triangle DEF. This means D, E, and \`F are the points where the perpendiculars from O to the sides of triangle ABC meet these sides, and they also lie on Gamma. 2. Let's consider how the parallel relationships help us.

Because OD parallel O'A', it implies that triangles triangle ODA and triangle O'A'D' are similar by the AA criterion (Angle-Angle criterion). Similar arguments hold for the other pairs of sides. 4. Since triangle ODA and triangle O'A'D' are similar, we have: [ frac{OD}{O'A'} = frac{OE}{O'B'} = frac{OF}{O'C'} ] And given that OD cdot O'A' = OE cdot O'B' = OF cdot O'C', it follows that these products form equal constant proportions. 5.

Hence: - OD meets Gamma again at A'' - OE meets Gamma\` again at B''\` - OF meets Γ again at C''\` 6. These points A'', B''\`, and C''\` thus form a triangle analogous to A'B'C' since each original perpendicular has been reflected through Gamma. This implies that the angle conditions and lengths OD, OE, OF maintain a similar geometric configuration between triangle AOA'' and triangle ODA', and similarly for the other sides. 7. Therefore, because of the proportion and similarity arguments, the perpendiculars from O parallel to those from O' force: - O'D' is parallel to OA - O'E' is parallel to OB\` - O'F' is parallel to OC\` 8.

Since A is the point of tangency, we have the property that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal. Therefore: - A M and A N are equal tangents. 3. Consider the angles formed in triangles A M B and A N B. In triangle A B M: - angle B A M is the angle between the line segments A B and A M. 4. Because A M is tangent to the circle at M, angle M A B = angle B N A. 5. Similarly, in triangle A B N: - angle B A N is the angle between the line segments A B and A N. - Because A N is tangent to the circle at N, angle M A N = angle B A N. 6. Therefore, in the sum of angles around point A: - angle B A N + angle B A M = angle M A N 7. Since the sum of angles in triangle A B N is 180^circ, we get: - angle A B N + angle M A N = 180^circ Conclusion: boxed{angle A B N + angle M A N = 180^circ} Part (b) To prove: frac{B M}{B N} = left(frac{A M}{A N}right)^{2} 1. Note that angle B A M = angle B N A and angle B A N = angle B M A. 2. This implies that triangles A M B and N A B are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion. From the similarity of triangles A M B and N A B, it follows that: frac{A M}{A N} = frac{B M}{B A} And also: frac{A M}{A N} = frac{A B}{B N} 3. By multiplying these two equalities, we have: left(frac{A M}{A N}right) = frac{B M}{B A} cdot frac{A B}{B N} Simplifying the right-hand side, we see that: left(frac{A M}{A N}right) cdot left(frac{A M}{A N}right) = frac{B M}{B N} 4. Therefore, we finally obtain: frac{B M}{B N} = left(frac{A M}{A N}right)^{2} Conclusion: boxed{frac{B M}{B N} = left(frac{A M}{A N}right)^{2}}"},{"prompt":"the Cartesian coordinate system, the three vertices of triangle triangle ABC are A(1,2), B(2,1), and C(3,2).

The similarity ratio of 2 implies that every coordinate of triangle A'B'C' will be twice that of the corresponding coordinate in triangle ABC.

Each subsequent rebound decreases in height by an additional 10% from the preceding rebound. So, the third rebound would be 60% of the second rebound height, the fourth would be 50% of the third, and so on.

Denote these integers by a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100}, where a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_{100}, meaning the integers are arranged in ascending order. 2. Consider the differences between every tenth consecutive number in this ordered sequence. Specifically, look at the differences a_{10} - a_0, a_{20} - a_{10}, ..., a_{100} - a_{90}. 3. Summing these differences, we obtain: [ (a_{10} - a_0) + (a_{20} - a_{10}) + (a_{30} - a_{20}) + ldots + (a_{100} - a_{90}) = a_{100} - a_0 ] 4. Given that all the integers are from the set {0, 1, 2, ldots, 1000}, the maximum value of a_{100} can be 1000 and the minimum value of a_0 can be 0. Thus: [ a_{100} - a_0 leq 1000 ] 5.

From this starting square, begin traversing horizontally to the next piece in the same row. 2. **Traversing in Rows and Columns** Once you reach a square with a piece in the same row, change direction and move vertically until you reach another piece in the same column. Repeat this process: whenever you reach a piece in the same column, switch to a piece in the same row and vice versa. 3. **Completing the Loop** Continue this traversal until you return to a column of the original starting square. Since there are exactly 4 pieces in each row and column, this will eventually happen, forming a closed loop. 4. **Definition of a Complete Cycle (Loop)** This path we have described returns to the starting point and is called a \\"cycle\\". 5. **Disjoint Cycles** Two cycles are called disjoint if they do not share any pieces. We maximize the number of disjoint cycles. This means we form the largest possible collection of cycles such that no two cycles share any chess pieces. 6. **Covering All Pieces** If there remain some pieces not included in our collection of disjoint cycles, these pieces must form other disjoint cycles themselves (otherwise, our initial collection was not maximal). Hence, the maximal collection of disjoint cycles will cover all the pieces on the board. 7. **Coloring the Pieces** In each cycle, color every second piece blue and the remaining pieces red. Given our cycles, which only contain even numbers of pieces, we ensure that each row and each column has an equal number of blue and red pieces. 8. **Removing Pieces** Remove all red pieces from the board. Now, each row and each column will contain exactly 2 blue pieces. 9. **Forming New Cycles with Remaining Pieces** Similar to the initial setup, form cycles with the remaining blue pieces (these will also be disjoint). This can be done as before by alternating traversals between rows and columns. 10. **Final Structure** From each new cycle of blue pieces, keep every second piece. This guarantees that one piece remains in each row and column, thus ensuring unique row and column occupancy by 8 pieces, respectively. 11. **Conclusion** Hence, we can select 8 pieces such that no two of them are in the same row or column. Therefore, it is proven that it is always possible to select 8 pieces on the chessboard such that no two pieces share the same row or column.

The radius of the circle, OQ, is 13 units. Consider a chord QR passing through P and perpendicular to OP. Let PQ = PR = x (as P is on the chord and OP is perpendicular to QR, P bisects QR). By the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OPQ, we have: [ OQ^2 = OP^2 + PQ^2 implies 13^2 = 12^2 + x^2 implies 169 = 144 + x^2 implies x^2 = 25 implies x = 5. ] Therefore, PQ = PR = 5, and the length of chord QR is 2x = 10 units. 2. **Determine Possible Lengths of Chords**: The shortest possible chord through P is when P is the midpoint of the chord, which we calculated as 10 units. The longest possible chord through P is a diameter of the circle, which is 2 times 13 = 26 units. 3. **Count the Integer Lengths**: We need to count the integer lengths of chords from 10 to 26 inclusive.

Both methods involve geometric properties and symmetry. Method 1: 1. **Identify Key Points and Distances**: Let ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) be the centers of the given circles, and let ( A ) and ( B ) be the points where the circles intersect. 2. **Distance Argument using Radius Equality**: Observe that: [ O_1 A = O_1 B quad text{and} quad O_2 A = O_2 B ] These equalities hold because ( A ) and ( B ) lie on both circles. This implies that ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) are each equidistant from ( A ) and ( B ). 3. **Congruence of Triangles**: Next, consider the triangles ( triangle O_1 A O_2 ) and ( triangle O_1 B O_2 ). Since ( O_1 A = O_1 B ) and ( O_2 A = O_2 B ), these triangles are congruent by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) criterion. 4. **Symmetry about the Center Line**: Due to this congruence, the points ( A ) and ( B ) are symmetric with respect to the line ( O_1 O_2 ). 5. **Perpendicularity Conclusion**: Since ( A ) and ( B ) are symmetric about ( O_1 O_2 ), the segment ( AB ) (the common chord) is perpendicular to ( O_1 O_2 ).

Notice that the second sum can be rewritten as ( 2 left( frac{1}{150} + frac{1}{151} + ldots + frac{1}{250} right) ). 3. The task now is to compare ( frac{1}{50} + frac{1}{51} + ldots + frac{1}{150} ) with ( 2 left( frac{1}{150} + frac{1}{151} + ldots + frac{1}{250} right) ). 4.

Consider the number of terms in each sum: - ( S_1 ) has ( 150 - 50 + 1 = 101 ) terms. - ( S_2 ) has ( 250 - 150 + 1 = 101 ) terms. 6. The harmonic series sum property tells us that ( sum_{k=a}^{b} frac{1}{k} ) can be approximated and compared using averages of terms. Specifically, we consider the terms involved in ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ): - The terms of ( S_1 ) range from ( frac{1}{50} ) to ( frac{1}{150} ). The average term can be approximated by ( frac{1}{100} ). - The terms of ( S_2 ) range from ( frac{1}{150} ) to ( frac{1}{250} ). The average term can be approximated by ( frac{1}{200} ). 7. Since ( S_1 approx 101 times frac{1}{100} = 1.01 ) and ( S_2 approx 101 times frac{1}{200} = 0.505 ), we can now compare these values to determine the larger sum: - ( S_1 approx 1.01 ) - ( 2 cdot S_2 approx 2 times 0.505 = 1.01 ) 8. Despite both approximations appearing equal, the exact values when added reveal that: - For ( sum_{k=50}^{150} frac{1}{k} ), the individual terms are larger due to being reciprocals of smaller numbers. - Conversely, ( sum_{k=150}^{250} frac{1}{k} ) involves smaller reciprocals, as they are from larger numerator values. 9.

Since ( frac{200}{100^2 - k^2} > frac{200}{100^2 - frac{k^2}{4}} ) because ( frac{k^2}{4} < k^2 ), it is clear that the first pair ( frac{1}{100-k} + frac{1}{100+k} ) is larger.

The number of ways to distribute the 4 teachers is given by the sum of combinations: C_4^1 + C_4^2 + C_4^3 = 14. 2. If Class 1 has Xiao Li and one more teacher, we first choose 1 teacher from the remaining 4 to join Xiao Li in Class 1. The remaining 3 teachers can be assigned to Class 2 and Class 3. The number of ways for this scenario is given by: C_4^1(C_3^1 + C_3^2) = 24. 3. If Class 1 has Xiao Li and two more teachers, we first choose 2 teachers from the remaining 4 to join Xiao Li in Class 1. The remaining 2 teachers will be assigned to Class 2 and Class 3. The number of ways for this scenario is given by: C_4^2 A_2^2 = 12. By summing up the number of arrangements for all three cases, we get a total of 14 + 24 + 12 = 50 arrangements.

Here's the step-by-step construction: 1. **Power of a Point:** - **Definition:** For a given point ( P ) and a circle, if we draw any two secant lines from ( P ) that intersect the circle, the products of the segments of the secants are equal. Mathematically: [ PA cdot PA_1 = PB cdot PB_1 = text{const} ] - This constant is known as the power of point ( P ) with respect to the circle. - If ( P ) lies outside the circle, the power of ( P ) is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from ( P ) to the circle, i.e., ( overline{PT}^2 ). - If we consider a radius passing through the center ( O ) of the circle, the power equation can be written as: [ (PO + r)(PO - r) = overline{PO}^2 - r^2 ] - Here, ( overline{PO} ) is the distance from ( P ) to the center ( O ) of the circle, and ( r ) is the radius of the circle. 2. **Radical Axis:** - **Definition:** For any two circles, the locus of all points that have equal power with respect to these two circles is called the radical axis. - The radical axis is perpendicular to the line segment joining the centers of the two circles (central line). - For point ( P ) on the radical axis of circles centered at ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ): [ overline{PO_1}^2 - r_1^2 = overline{PO_2}^2 - r_2^2 ] - Substituting: [ overline{PO_1}^2 = overline{PC}^2 + overline{O_1C}^2 quad text{and} quad overline{PO_2}^2 = overline{PC}^2 + overline{O_2C}^2 ] - Thus: [ overline{O_1C}^2 - r_1^2 = overline{O_2C}^2 - r_2^2 ] - This confirms that point ( C ) lies on the radical axis. 3. **Special Cases:** - **Tangential Circles:** When two circles are tangent to each other, their radical axis is their common tangent line. Mathematically: [ overline{PO_1}^2 - r_1^2 = overline{PO_2}^2 - r_2^2 = overline{PC}^2 ] - **Intersecting Circles:** For two intersecting circles, their radical axis is their common chord. At the intersection point ( P ): [ overline{PO_1} = r_1 quad text{and} quad overline{PO_2} = r_2 ] 4. **Construction of Radical Axis:** - To find the radical axis of two non-tangent, non-intersecting circles, introduce a third circle that intersects the given two circles. The common chords of the third circle with each circle intersect at point ( P ), from which a perpendicular is dropped to the central line to obtain the radical axis. 5. **Finding the Required Circle:** - **Objective:** Find the point from which tangents of equal length can be drawn to all three given circles. - This point is the intersection of the radical axes (power lines) of the pairs of the three circles. - Draw the radical axes for each pair of the three circles. - The intersection point of these radical axes is the center of the required circle. - The radius is the length of the tangent drawn from this point to any of the given circles. # Conclusion: The procedure yields the center and radius of the circle that intersects the three given circles at right angles.

Given that the LCM of the two numbers is 192 and one of the numbers is 48, we can use the above formula to find the HCF. Let's denote the other number as x and the HCF as h. According to the formula: LCM(48, x) * HCF(48, x) = 48 * x We know the LCM is 192, so: 192 * h = 48 * x Now we need to find the value of x, which is the other number. We are told that the other number is 64.

Consider the simplest case: ( 3 odot 4 ): [ 3 odot 4 = frac{3 times 4 + 4}{3 + 4} = frac{12 + 4}{7} = frac{16}{7} ] 5. Expand to ( 3 odot 4 odot 5 ): [ (3 odot 4) odot 5 = left(frac{16}{7} right) odot 5 = frac{frac{16}{7} times 5 + 4}{frac{16}{7} + 5} = frac{frac{80}{7} + 4}{frac{16}{7} + 5} = frac{frac{80}{7} + frac{28}{7}}{frac{16}{7} + 5} = frac{frac{108}{7}}{frac{51}{7}} = frac{108}{51} = frac{36}{17} ] 6. Continuing this operation yields a pattern indicating the results may need generalizing for larger values of (n): Let's determine ( T ) in terms of ( n ). 7. Assume ( T ) can form a pattern such that ( T ) equates structurally for repeated operations of ( odot ). 8. Since ( x odot y = frac{xy + 4}{x + y} ), compute for ( n ): Since each operation keeps the value (4) conserved in the numerator and respective sums in the denominator, the combinatorial summations need reviewing here. 9. For simplification, we recognize ( x > 2 ): [ x + frac{5 - x}{x - 2} = x - 2 + frac{x + 1}{x - 2} geq 2 sqrt{x + 1} ] This transformation uses valid algebraic manipulation and inequalities applied. 10. We resolve ( x - 2 = frac{x + 1}{x - 2} ) by solving the quadratic equation: [ (x - 2)^2 = x + 1 implies x^2 - 4x + 4 = x + 1 implies x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0 ] Solving this using the quadratic formula: [ x = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 - 12}}{2} = frac{5 pm sqrt{13}}{2} ] So, [ x = frac{5 + sqrt{13}}{2}, quad text{valid for } x>2. ] 11. Hence, apply reasoning steps in the quadratic harmonic triplet simplification. Further, resolving through ( n ), ( T(n) ) ensures ( boxed() for correct positive (n = 4+).

Using the Law of Cosines in ( triangle PCQ ), we have: [ ell^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy cos angle C ] Since ( cos angle C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} ), we can substitute this into the equation: [ ell^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy cdot frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} ] Simplifying, we get: [ ell^2 = x^2 + y^2 - frac{xy(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}{ab} ] 4. The radius ( r ) of the inscribed circle of the triangle is given by: [ r = frac{A}{s} ] where ( A ) is the area of the triangle and ( s ) is the semi-perimeter. The area ( A ) can be expressed using Heron's formula: [ A = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} ] Therefore, [ r^2 = left( frac{A}{s} right)^2 = frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{s} ] 5. We want to prove that ( ell > rsqrt{2} ) or equivalently ( 2ell^2 > 4r^2 ). We start by expressing ( 2ell^2 - 4r^2 ): [ 2ell^2 - 4r^2 = 2(x^2 + y^2 - frac{xy(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}{ab}) - 4 cdot frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{s} ] 6. We need to show that: [ 2(x^2 + y^2 - frac{xy(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}{ab}) geq 4 cdot frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{s} ] Simplifying the left-hand side, we get: [ 2(x^2 + y^2 - frac{xy(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}{ab}) = 2x^2 + 2y^2 - frac{2xy(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}{ab} ] 7. Using the fact that ( xy = frac{ab}{2} ), we substitute ( xy ) into the equation: [ 2x^2 + 2y^2 - frac{2 cdot frac{ab}{2} (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}{ab} = 2x^2 + 2y^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) ] 8. We need to show that: [ 2x^2 + 2y^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) geq 4 cdot frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{s} ] 9. Since ( x ) and ( y ) are segments of the sides of the triangle, we can use the fact that ( x leq a ) and ( y leq b ). Therefore, we can bound ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ) by ( a^2 ) and ( b^2 ) respectively. 10. Finally, we conclude that: [ 2x^2 + 2y^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) geq 2ab - a^2 - b^2 + c^2 - frac{(a+b-c)(a-b+c)(-a+b+c)}{a+b+c} ] 11. This inequality holds true, thus proving that ( ell > rsqrt{2} ).

The tram passes a stationary observer (Misha) in 2 seconds and travels through a tunnel of length 96 meters in 10 seconds.

Since the speed of the tram is constant, let's denote the speed of the tram by ( v ) meters per second (m/s) and the length of the tram by ( L ) meters.

Let's start by finding the actual sales price before tax and discount. 1. Remove the sales tax from the sales price to find the price before tax: Let's denote the price before tax as P_bt. The sales price with tax is 81, and the tax rate is 7%. The equation to find the price before tax is: P_bt + (P_bt * 0.07) = 81 To find P_bt, we solve for it: P_bt * 1.07 = 81 P_bt = 81 / 1.07 P_bt ≈ 75.70 2. Now, we need to find the original price before the 15% discount was applied. Let's denote the original price as P_o. The price before tax after the discount is 75.70, and the discount rate is 15%. The equation to find the original price is: P_o - (P_o * 0.15) = 75.70 To find P_o, we solve for it: P_o * (1 - 0.15) = 75.70 P_o * 0.85 = 75.70 P_o = 75.70 / 0.85 P_o ≈ 89.06 3. Now, we can calculate the cost of the product using the gross profit margin. The gross profit margin is 170% of the cost, which means the gross profit is 170% more than the cost. Let's denote the cost as C. The relationship between the gross profit margin (GPM), sales price (SP), and cost (C) is: GPM = (SP - C) / C Given that GPM is 170%, or 1.7 in decimal form, and SP is the original price P_o, we have: 1.7 = (P_o - C) / C Now we can solve for C: 1.7C = P_o - C 1.7C + C = P_o 2.7C = P_o C = P_o / 2.7 C ≈ 89.06 / 2.7 C ≈ 32.99 4. Finally, we can calculate the gross profit by subtracting the cost from the original price before the discount: Gross Profit = P_o - C Gross Profit ≈ 89.06 - 32.99 Gross Profit ≈ 56.07 Therefore, the value of the gross profit, considering the constraints, is approximately boxed{56.07} ."},{"prompt":"As shown in the figure, squares (ABCD) and (EFGH) are divided into two smaller squares and two rectangles respectively by perpendicular lines.

Under this rotation, point B moves to a new point B', which lies on the extension of the side AC past A. 5. Let O be any point other than A in the plane of the triangle. Under the rotation about A by beta, point O moves to a new point O'. 6. The triangle OAO' is isosceles with angle OAO' = beta < 60^circ because angle OAO' = 180^circ - alpha and alpha > 120^circ. 7. Because beta < 60^circ, the side OO' < AO in any isosceles triangle with beta less than 60^circ. 8. Therefore, the sum of the distances from point O to A, B, and C, i.e., OA + OB + OC, can be rewritten considering the rotation. Notice that under rotation: [ OA + OB + OC = OO' + O'B' + O'C geq CB' = AC + AB ] where O'B' is strictly greater than OB due to rotation, and OO' represents the length changes under any rotation transformation. 9. Since AC + AB represents the distances from point A to vertices B and C directly, it is the minimal sum: [ OA + OB + OC > AO + AB + AC = AC + AB ] Conclusion: The point within triangle ABC from which the sum of distances to vertices A, B, C is minimal is indeed the vertex A itself based on the inequality demonstrated. boxed{A}"},{"prompt":"A train speeds past a pole in some seconds and a platform 120 m long in 22 seconds.

Therefore, the statement that ( m > 10 ) is a sufficient condition for the equation to represent a hyperbola is true, as in this range the denominators are positive. However, it is not a necessary condition, as a hyperbola can also be represented when ( m < 8 ). So, (m > 10) is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the equation ( frac{x^2}{m-10} - frac{y^2}{m-8} = 1 ) to represent a hyperbola.

Total volume of bricks = Volume of one brick x Number of bricks Total volume of bricks = 1687.5 cm³ x 6400 Total volume of bricks = 10,800,000 cm³ Now, we need to convert the volume of bricks into cubic meters because the dimensions of the wall are given in meters.

Specifically, each number in T can be written as: [ a_{10} cdot 3^{10} + a_{9} cdot 3^{9} + cdots + a_1 cdot 3 + a_0 ] where a_i in {0, 1} for each i, and not all a_i are zero. 2. **Count the Elements in T:** Each digit position can independently be either 0 or 1, so with 11 digits, there are (2^{11} = 2048) possible combinations. Since we exclude the number where all a_i are 0, we subtract 1: [ 2^{11} - 1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047. ] Thus, T contains 2047 different integers. 3. **Check the Size Constraint:** The maximum number in T occurs when all a_i are 1, i.e., it is represented as: [ 1 cdot 3^{10} + 1 cdot 3^9 + cdots + 1 cdot 3 + 1. ] This sum is a geometric series with the first term 1 and common ratio 3, having 11 terms. We can sum this series using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: [ S = frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} = frac{1 cdot (3^{11} - 1)}{3 - 1} = frac{3^{11} - 1}{2}. ] Calculating the sum: [ 3^{11} = 177147, ] [ frac{177147 - 1}{2} = frac{177146}{2} = 88573. ] Clearly, (88573 < 10^5 = 100000).

If x, y, z form an arithmetic progression, consider their base-3 representations and the equation 2y = x + z: [ 2y text{ (in base-3) } rightarrow text{can only contain digits } 0 text{ or } 2. ] This implies both x and z must have identical digits in every position, except for at most one position due to the addition nature.

This ensures maximal coverage and interaction. - When arranged properly, each projector will have its illuminated quadrant intersect another, thereby creating the required shadow effect for each. 5. **Mathematical Proof**: - If projector A illuminates projector B, there will be a shadow from B. - Since all projectors are symmetric, each of the 7 projectors will be in the illuminated quadrant of another, ensuring continuous shadow casting. - The condition of a 7 km shadow can be satisfied by setting the distance between the overlapping projectors such that the shadow exactly reaches 7 km.

A knight would state the true number of liars, thus it cannot be the case that more than one answer is true because the true number of liars cannot change. 2. **Identifying the Knight**: - If there were ( k ) knights, then ( 5 - k ) would be liars. - If a knight says there is one liar, then four knights must exist. However, if there were four knights, then the answer the knight gave would need to be true, which contradicts the other four giving different answers. - This logic applies similarly for each number until evaluating four liars. 3. **Validating Four Liars Scenario**: - Suppose there is exactly one knight among the inhabitants, thus logically four liars. - We check the responses: - The one knight would correctly identify that there are four liars. - The four liars would give false numbers.

The temperature conversions are therefore related by the linear equation: [ F = kC + b ] To find k and b, solve the system of equations given by the freezing and boiling points: [ begin{cases} 32 = k cdot 0 + b 212 = k cdot 100 + b end{cases} ] Solving the first equation directly: [ 32 = b ] Plugging b = 32 into the second equation: [ 212 = k cdot 100 + 32 implies 180 = 100k implies k = frac{180}{100} = frac{9}{5} ] Therefore, the exact formula is: [ F = frac{9}{5}C + 32 ] 2. **Calculate the deviation formula:** The approximation formula given is: [ F = 2C + 30 ] The deviation between the two formulas is: [ Delta F = (2C + 30) - left(frac{9}{5}C + 32right) = 2C + 30 - frac{9}{5}C - 32 ] Simplifying: [ Delta F = left(2 - frac{9}{5}right)C + 30 - 32 = frac{10}{5}C - frac{9}{5}C - 2 = frac{1}{5}C - 2 ] 3. **Express the deviation as a percentage:** The percentage deviation is given by: [ text{Percentage deviation} = left|frac{Delta F}{frac{9}{5}C + 32}right| ] Substitute (Delta F): [ left|frac{frac{1}{5}C - 2}{frac{9}{5}C + 32}right| ] 4. **Set up the inequality for the acceptable deviation:** The deviation must not exceed 5% = 0.05: [ left|frac{frac{1}{5}C - 2}{frac{9}{5}C + 32}right| leq 0.05 ] Which simplifies to: [ left|frac{C - 10}{9C + 160}right| leq 0.05 ] This absolute value inequality splits into two inequalities: [ -0.05 leq frac{C - 10}{9C + 160} leq 0.05 ] 5. **Solve the inequalities:** First solve: [ frac{C - 10}{9C + 160} geq -0.05 ] Multiply both sides by 9C + 160 (assuming 9C + 160 > 0): [ C - 10 geq -0.05 (9C + 160) implies C - 10 geq -0.45C - 8 implies 1.45C geq 2 implies C geq frac{2}{1.45} = frac{40}{29} ] Next solve: [ frac{C - 10}{9C + 160} leq 0.05 ] Multiply both sides by 9C + 160: [ C - 10 leq 0.05 (9C + 160) implies C - 10 leq 0.45C + 8 implies 0.55C leq 18 implies C leq frac{18}{0.55} = frac{360}{11} ] 6. **Combine the results:** Therefore, the range of temperatures where the deviation does not exceed 5% is: [ frac{40}{29} leq C leq frac{360}{11} ] Converting the fractions to mixed numbers: [ frac{40}{29} approx 1.38 text{ and } frac{360}{11} approx 32.73 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{1 frac{11}{29} leq C leq 32 frac{8}{11}} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the units digit of the decimal expansion of [left(12 + sqrt{36}right)^{17} + left(12 sqrt{36}right)^{17}.] textbf{(A)} 2qquad textbf{(B)} 4qquad textbf{(C)} 6qquad textbf{(D)} 8qquad textbf{(E)} 0","completion":"1. **Define the expressions**: Let a = 12 and b = sqrt{36} = 6.

Specifically, in the expression involving the terms (overrightarrow{A_i}), we take the following convention: - For odd-indexed terms (i.e., when ( i ) is odd), take the positive sign. - For even-indexed terms (i.e., when ( i ) is even), take the negative sign. This gives: [ sum_{i=1, text{ odd}}^n (+overrightarrow{MA_i}) + sum_{i=2, text{ even}}^n (-overrightarrow{MA_i}) ] Given that ( n ) is even, for a regular ( n )-gon, the sum of vectors (overrightarrow{OA_i}) (for all ( i )) is zero due to symmetry: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} overrightarrow{OA_i} = vec{0} ] Thus: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} pm overrightarrow{MA_i} = sum_{i=1}^{n} (pm overrightarrow{MO} + pm overrightarrow{OA_i}) = n cdot overrightarrow{MO} + sum_{i=1}^{n} pm overrightarrow{OA_i} ] Given our choice of signs and the symmetry of the regular ( n )-gon, the net sum will be a zero vector: [ overrightarrow{MA_1} + (-overrightarrow{MA_2}) + overrightarrow{MA_3} + (-overrightarrow{MA_4}) + ldots = vec{0} ] Therefore, our conclusion for even ( n ) is: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} pm overrightarrow{MA_i} = vec{0} ] (boxed{}) 2. **Part (2): When ( n ) is odd** Divide the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}) into two disjoint subsets ({i_1, i_2, ldots, i_k}) and ({j_1, j_2, ldots, j_{n-k}}).

Note that since p equiv 1 pmod{4}, we have: [ left( frac{-1}{p} right) = (-1)^{frac{p-1}{2}} = 1 ] By the properties of the Legendre symbol, this indicates that -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p. 2.

She spends half of this amount on jeans, which is 40 / 2 = 20. She spends twice the amount on coats, which is 40 x 2 = 80. Now let's look at Carly's spending: Carly spends a quarter as much as Lisa on t-shirts, which is 40 / 4 = 10. The problem states that Carly spends a multiple of the amount Lisa spent on jeans, but we don't know this multiple yet. Carly spends a quarter of the amount Lisa spent on coats, which is 80 / 4 = 20. The total amount spent by Lisa and Carly is 230. We can write this as an equation: Lisa's spending + Carly's spending = 230 (40 + 20 + 80) + (10 + Carly's spending on jeans + 20) = 230 140 + 10 + Carly's spending on jeans + 20 = 230 170 + Carly's spending on jeans = 230 Carly's spending on jeans = 230 - 170 Carly's spending on jeans = 60 Now we know Carly spent 60 on jeans, which is a multiple of the amount Lisa spent on jeans (20). To find the ratio of the amount Carly spent on jeans to the amount Lisa spent on jeans, we divide Carly's spending by Lisa's spending: Carly's spending on jeans / Lisa's spending on jeans = 60 / 20 = 3 So the ratio of the amount Carly spent on jeans to the amount Lisa spent on jeans is boxed{3:1} ."},{"prompt":"Rahul and Sham together can complete a task in some days, but Rahul alone can complete the same work in 60 days.

The time it takes for them to complete the work together (T) is the total work divided by their combined rate: T = W / (R + S) Substituting the rates we found earlier: T = W / (W/60 + W/84) To simplify, we can factor out W from the denominator: T = W / (W * (1/60 + 1/84)) Now we can cancel out W from the numerator and denominator: T = 1 / (1/60 + 1/84) To add the fractions in the denominator, we need a common denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 60 and 84. The LCM of 60 and 84 is 420.

Using the point-slope form of a line, the equation of PQ is: [ y - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}) ] 4. **Determine the Intersection of PQ with the x-axis:** Setting y=0 in the equation of PQ to find the x-coordinate where PQ intersects the x-axis, we solve: [ 0 - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}) implies x = frac{5p}{2} ] 5. **Calculate the Value of p Using |FQ|=6:** Given that |FQ|=6, and knowing F is at (frac{p}{2}, 0) and Q is at (frac{5p}{2}, 0), we calculate the distance |FQ| as: [ left|frac{5p}{2} - frac{p}{2}right| = 6 implies 2p = 12 implies p = 6 ] 6. **Find the Directrix Equation of C:** Since p=3, the directrix of the parabola, which is equidistant from the focus, is on the opposite side of the vertex from the focus. The directrix is therefore at x = -frac{p}{2} = -frac{3}{2}. Therefore, the directrix equation of the parabola C is boxed{x=-frac{3}{2}}."},{"prompt":"wo years older than b who is twice as old as c . if the total of the ages of a , b and c be 47 , then how old is b ?","completion":"Let's denote the age of C as x.

The total number of elements in this set is ( 2k + 1 ), calculated as follows: [ (2k^2 + 3k) - (2k^2 + k) + 1 = 2k + 1 ] 2. **Set Division**: We divide the set ( M_k ) into two subsets ( A ) and ( B ). - Subset ( A ) includes the first ( k + 1 ) elements from ( M_k ). - Subset ( B ) includes the remaining ( k ) elements from ( M_k ). 3. **Subset Elements**: - Elements in subset ( A ): [ {2k^2 + k, 2k^2 + k + 1, dots, 2k^2 + k + k} ] - Elements in subset ( B ): [ {2k^2 + 2k + 1, 2k^2 + 2k + 2, dots, 2k^2 + 3k} ] 4. **Sum of Squares for Subset ( A )**: The sum of the squares of the elements in ( A ) is: [ sum_{i=0}^{k} (2k^2 + k + i)^2 ] 5. **Sum of Squares for Subset ( B )**: The sum of the squares of the elements in ( B ) is: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} (2k^2 + 2k + i)^2 ] 6. **Difference of Sums**: We now calculate the difference between the sum of squares of the two subsets: [ begin{aligned} & left( sum_{i=1}^{k} (2k^2 + 2k + i)^2 right) - left( sum_{i=0}^{k} (2k^2 + k + i)^2 right) &= sum_{i=1}^{k} left( (2k^2 + 2k + i)^2 - (2k^2 + k + i)^2 right) - (2k^2 + k)^2 end{aligned} ] 7. **Simplification**: Simplify each term in the sum: [ begin{aligned} (2k^2 + 2k + i)^2 - (2k^2 + k + i)^2 &= 4k^2 + 4ki + 4k + i^2 - (4k^2 + 2ki + k^2 + 2ki + 2k + i^2) &= 4k^2 + 4k - k^2 &= 4k^2 + 3k + 2i end{aligned} ] 8. **Combining the Terms**: The difference sum becomes: [ begin{aligned} k sum_{i=1}^{k} (4k^2 + 3k + 2i) - (2k^2 + k)^2 &= k left( k(4k^2 + 3k) + k(k+1) right) - (4k^2 + 4k^3 + k^2) &= k left( 4k^3 + 3k^2 + k^2 + k right) - (4k^4 + 4k^3 + k^2) &= (4k^4 + 3k^3 + k^3 + k^2 + k) - 4k^4 - k^3 &= 0 end{aligned} ] 9. **Conclusion**: Thus, the sum of the squares of the elements in subsets ( A ) and ( B ) are indeed equal.

Zhang Hua, a college student who started his own business, borrowed a principal of 480,000 from the bank.

The total loan amount is 480,000, and it is to be repaid over 20 years with monthly payments, making a total of 20 times 12 = 240 payments. **Step 1: Calculate the monthly repayment of the principal.** The principal is evenly distributed over the repayment period, so each month, Zhang Hua will repay a portion of the principal calculated as: frac{text{Total Principal}}{text{Number of Payments}} = frac{480,000}{240} = 2000 text{ dollars} **Step 2: Calculate the interest for the nth month.** The interest for the nth month is calculated on the remaining principal. The remaining principal after (n-1) months is the initial principal minus the total principal repaid up to that point, which is (n-1) times 2000. Therefore, the remaining principal before the nth payment is 480,000 - (n-1) times 2000. The monthly interest rate is 0.4%, so the interest for the nth month is: left[480,000 - (n-1) times 2000right] times 0.4% **Step 3: Calculate the total repayment amount for the nth month.** The total repayment amount for the nth month, a_n, consists of the principal repayment (2000) plus the interest calculated in the previous step.

If the equation f(x) a|x 2| = 0 has exactly four distinct real roots, then the range of values for the real number a is.","completion":"First, let's address the function f(x) = |x^2 + x - 2|. The quadratic inside the absolute value can be factored as (x + 2)(x - 1). The roots of this equation are x = -2 and x = 1. So the quadratic changes sign at these points. This will be useful while considering the piecewise definition of f(x) without the absolute value. Now, let's consider the equation of interest: f(x) - a|x - 2| = 0. In a piecewise format, f(x) would be written as: f(x) = begin{cases} x^2 + x - 2, & text{for } x leq -2 text{ or } x geq 1 -(x^2 + x - 2), & text{for } -2 < x < 1 end{cases} We'll handle the problem piece by piece. **For x leq -2 or x geq 1:** The given equation becomes x^2 + x - 2 - a|x - 2| = 0. **For x < -2:** The term |x - 2| becomes -(x - 2), hence the equation will be: x^2 + x - 2 + a(x - 2) = 0. **For 1 leq x:** The term |x - 2| becomes (x - 2), so the equation is the same as for x < -2: x^2 + x - 2 + a(x - 2) = 0. **For -2 < x < 1:** The given equation becomes -(x^2 + x - 2) - a|x - 2| = 0. Taking care of |x - 2|, we have: **For -2 < x < 2:** The term |x - 2| becomes -(x - 2), hence the equation will be: -(x^2 + x - 2) - a(-(x - 2)) = 0. **For 2 leq x < 1:** This case is impossible since x cannot be both greater than or equal to 2 and less than 1. To ensure that we have exactly four distinct real roots, we need to analyze the intersection between the two cases. For the equation not to have a double root at x = -2 or x = 1, we need a to be such that the linear term a(x - 2) modifies the quadratic differently on both sides of these critical points. Hence, to have four distinct real roots, the quadratic graph must intersect the line y = a(x - 2) at two points in each of the intervals (-infty, -2) and (1, +infty). This is because the quadratic is already equal to zero at x = -2 and x = 1. For the intersection points to be at these intervals, the slope of y = a(x - 2) needs to be less steep than that of the quadratic's tangents at those points. The derivative of the quadratic is 2x + 1. Therefore, at x = -2, the slope is 2(-2) + 1 = -3, and at x = 1, the slope is 2(1) + 1 = 3. So for four distinct roots, |a| < 3. However, we should further restrict this range because a cannot be negative. With a negative a, the line would intersect the graph of the quadratic in the wrong intervals. So we conclude that a must be in the interval (0, 3). Finally, we need to check when the line intersects the quadratic exactly one time in each side of the intervals (-infty, -2) and (1, +infty). The slope of the graph of the quadratic increases with x, and the maximum slope in each interval is at the edges, i.e., x = -2 and x = 1. These slopes are -3 and 3. Since we want to avoid tangency (which would give fewer than four roots), we need to take a up to but not including 3, giving us a in (0, 3). However, when we examine the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 2 + a(x - 2) = 0 or ax^2+(1-a)x-2(1-a)=0 in the intervals (-infty, -2) and (1, +infty), we realize that the discriminant b^2-4ac of this quadratic equation must be positive to ensure two roots in each interval. Here, a is positive and the term -4ac would always be negative, which would imply there will always be two roots as long as the discriminant is non-zero. Therefore, based on our earlier restriction, the value of a must be in range (0, 3).

The slant height of the cone, denoted ( S ), is given by the distance from the vertex of the cone to a point on the base circle which is also a tangent to the sphere.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **First Weighing:** - **Divide the 1000 coins:** Split the 1000 coins into two equal groups of 500 coins each, denoted as groups ( A ) and ( B ). - **Weigh groups A and B:** Place group ( A ) on the left pan and group ( B ) on the right pan of the balance scale. 2. **Analyze first weighing results:** - **Case 1: ( A = B )** - If the scales balance, there are either no fake coins or exactly two fake coins existing in one coin each group weighing lighter or heavier. - Proceed by dividing each group into two equal parts of 250 coins: ( A = A_1 + A_2 ) and ( B = B_1 + B_2 ). - **Case 2: ( A neq B )** - Without loss of generality, assume ( A > B ), meaning heavy or light fake coins are present. - Divide both groups ( A ) and ( B ) each into two equal smaller groups of 250 coins: ( A = A_1 + A_2 ) and ( B = B_1 + B_2 ). 3. **Second Weighing:** - **Group rearrangement:** Weigh ( A_1 + B_1 ) against ( A_2 + B_2 ). 4. **Analyze second weighing results:** - **Case 1: ( A_1 + B_1 = A_2 + B_2 )** - If they balance, this means there are either no fake coins or there exist two fake coins, one in ( A_1 ), one in ( A_2 ), or similarly in ( B_1 ) and ( B_2 ). - Proceed by splitting again and weighing to identify those coins. - **Case 2: ( A_1 + B_1 neq A_2 + B_2 )** - Suppose ( A_1 + B_1 > A_2 + B_2 ). - If fake coins are heavier, they are within ( A_1 ). If lighter, they are in ( B_2 ). - The remaining groups contain real coins. 5. **Third Weighing:** - **Weigh the identified group:** - Weigh ( B_1 ) against ( B_2 ) if the fake coin group was identified in the second step. - If ( B_1 = B_2 ), coins in ( B_2 ) are real, and fake coins are heavier. - If not, fake lighter coins are in ( A_1 ). 6. **Conclusion:** - With the third weighing, either the real coins or fake coins are confirmed by repeated process isolation. - Based on the balance or imbalance, determine the nature of fake coins (lighter or heavier).

This directly implies that no person in the class could have (n-1) friends. 5.

Let this term be (a + kd) for some integer (k). So, [ a + kd = m^n ] for some integer (m). 3. **Looking for More (n)th Powers**: We need to show that there are infinitely many such (n)th powers in the sequence. Consider the next term in the sequence which is also (n)th power: [ a + (k + td) ] where (t) is some positive integer. We need to check when this term becomes an (n)th power again. 4. **Express as (k + td) in the Form of an (n)th Power**: Assume (a + kd = m^n) and find another value to satisfy: [ a + (k + t)d = (m + t')^n ] for some integer (t').

Therefore, we have: [ tan theta = frac{sqrt{3}}{-1} = -sqrt{3} ] Given that theta is the inclination angle of the line, it must lie in the interval left[0, piright) because inclination angles are measured from the positive x-axis towards the line in a counterclockwise direction. Knowing the specific values of tan theta in this interval, we can determine that: [ tan theta = -sqrt{3} implies theta = frac{2pi}{3} ] This is because the tangent function has a period of pi, and tan theta = -sqrt{3} corresponds to an angle of frac{2pi}{3} in the specified domain for theta.

Consider the points ( A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n} ) such that the pairwise distances between these points are greater than 2. Introduce the circles ( S_{1}, S_{2}, ldots, S_{n} ) with radius 1 centered at ( A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n} ), respectively. 2. **Show that the circles ( S_{i} ) are non-overlapping:** Since the pairwise distances between the points ( A_{i} ) are greater than 2, each circle of radius 1 around these points will be disjoint from one another. Mathematically, if any two of these circles ( S_{i} ) and ( S_{j} ) intersected, the minimum distance between the centers would be less than [1+1=2], which contradicts the given condition (pairwise distances > 2). Thus, the circles ( S_{1}, S_{2}, ldots, S_{n} ) are disjoint. 3. **Analyze the intersection areas (V_i = Phi cap S_i):** Denote ( V_{i} = Phi cap S_{i} ). Since circles ( S_i ) do not intersect each other, the regions ( V_{i} ) are also disjoint. Because ( V_{i} ) are disjoint regions contained within (Phi), the sum of their areas [ sum_{i=1}^n text{area}(V_i) ] will be less than or equal to the area of (Phi), which is less than ( pi ). 4. **Move each ( V_{i} ) to a common point ( O ):** Let ( O ) be an arbitrary point in the plane, and consider moving each region ( V_{i} ) to ( O ).

For purchasing 2 A type cars and 4 B type cars for a total of 140 million yuan: 2x + 4y = 140. Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows: - Multiply the first equation by 4 to eliminate y: 12x + 4y = 340. - Subtract the second equation from this result to eliminate y: (12x + 4y) - (2x + 4y) = 340 - 140. - Simplifying, we get 10x = 200, and thus x = 20. - Substitute x = 20 back into the first equation: 3(20) + y = 85. - Solving for y, we find y = 25.

Substituting m = 10 into the cost equation: [w = -5(10) + 375 = 325] At this point, the number of B type cars, (15 - m), is 5.

We desire: [ a^3 + b^3 = 2ab. ] By Vieta's formulas, ( a + b = -frac{6}{3} = -2 ) and ( ab = frac{m}{3} ). Apply the identity for the sum of cubes: [ a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2).] Using ( a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = 4 - 2ab ), [ a^3 + b^3 = (-2)(4 - 2ab - ab) = -8 + 6ab. ] Set the equation according to the problem statement: [ -8 + 6ab = 2ab, ] [ 4ab = 8, ] [ ab = 2. ] Substitute ( ab = frac{m}{3} = 2 ): [ m = 6. ] Verification and Conclusion: Hence, ( m = 6 ) is the required value.

This equation will help us understand the relationship between a and b. 2. **Consider the property of logarithms and b**: We know that for all b > 0, b < 10^b. This is a basic property of exponential functions. Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides, we get log_{10} b < b. 3. **Analyze the case b geq 1**: If b geq 1, then dividing log_{10} b < b by b^2, we get 0 < frac{log_{10} b}{b^2} < 1. Since a = frac{log_{10} b}{b^2}, this implies that a cannot be an integer if b geq 1 because a would be a fraction between 0 and 1. 4. **Conclude that 0 < b < 1**: Since a must be an integer, we conclude that b cannot be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, we must have 0 < b < 1. 5. **Determine the sign of a**: For 0 < b < 1, log_{10} b < 0 because the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is negative. Thus, a = frac{log_{10} b}{b^2} < 0 because we are dividing a negative number by the square of a positive number, which is positive. 6. **Order the elements of the set**: Knowing that a < 0, 0 < b < 1, and 1 < 1/b (since b < 1), we can order the elements of the set as a < 0 < b < 1 < 1/b. 7. **Find the median**: The median of the set {0, 1, a, b, 1/b}, when ordered, is the middle value, which is b. Therefore, the median of the set is boxed{b}. This solution is consistent with the given conditions, such as with b = 0.1 and a = -100, which satisfy ab^2 = log_{10} b."},{"prompt":"Find the sum of the roots of tan^2x9tan x+1=0 that are between x=0 and x=2pi radians.","completion":"To solve the equation tan^2x-9tan x+1=0, we can use the quadratic formula. The equation can be rewritten in the standard quadratic form as atan^2x + btan x + c = 0, where a=1, b=-9, and c=1. Applying the quadratic formula gives us: [ tan x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} = frac{9 pm sqrt{(-9)^2-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = frac{9 pm sqrt{81-4}}{2} = frac{9 pm sqrt{77}}{2} ] Let's denote r_1 = frac{9 + sqrt{77}}{2} and r_2 = frac{9 - sqrt{77}}{2}. It's given that r_1r_2=1, which is a property of the roots of the equation. Upon graphing y = tan x, we observe that tan x = r_1 corresponds to two angles in the interval [0,2pi], and similarly, tan x = r_2 corresponds to two angles in the interval [0,2pi]. Let alpha = arctan r_1 and beta = arctan r_2, which represent two of the solutions to the equation. We can find a relationship between alpha and beta by considering the tangent of the complementary angle: [ tan left( frac{pi}{2} - alpha right) = frac{sin (frac{pi}{2} - alpha)}{cos (frac{pi}{2} - alpha)} = frac{cos alpha}{sin alpha} = frac{1}{tan alpha} = frac{1}{r_1} = r_2 ] This implies that beta = frac{pi}{2} - alpha, and therefore, alpha + beta = frac{pi}{2}. Considering the periodic nature of the tangent function, the other two solutions can be expressed as alpha + pi and beta + pi. Thus, the sum of all four solutions is: [ alpha + beta + (alpha + pi) + (beta + pi) = 2alpha + 2beta + 2pi = 2(alpha + beta) + 2pi = 2left(frac{pi}{2}right) + 2pi = pi + 2pi = 3pi ] Therefore, the sum of the roots of the equation tan^2x-9tan x+1=0 that lie between x=0 and x=2pi is boxed{3pi}."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},O={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],I={key:0},E={key:1};function N(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",O,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
