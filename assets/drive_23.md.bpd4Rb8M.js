Consider how these broad developments relate to the specific events and personal stories depicted in the film.","completion":"When watching a film that delves into historical events such as the fall of communism and the transition to democracy in 1989, it is important to pay attention to both the larger political dynamics and their effects on individuals' lives. Here's a brief guide on how to relate these themes to the narratives you might encounter in a film set during this period: **The Fall of Communism:** Consider how the film portrays the decline of communist power structures. Does it focus on high-level political negotiations, or does it emphasize grassroots movements? Look for scenes depicting the crumbling of communist party authority, whether through public defiance, the spread of new ideas, or the inability of the state to maintain control. **Transition to Democracy:** Observe how the film represents the shift from authoritarian rule to democratic governance. Are there scenes depicting the first free elections, the formation of new political parties, or the drafting of democratic constitutions? Pay attention to characters who may be political activists or ordinary citizens experiencing their newfound political freedoms for the first time. **Role of Popular Protest:** Evaluate the portrayal of mass mobilizations and civil disobedience. Does the film show large crowds demanding change, or focus on smaller, more personal acts of resistance? Analyze how these protests are organized and what drives individuals to take part in them—look for the film's depiction of the desires for freedom, economic opportunity, and an end to oppression. **Impact of Gorbachev’s Policies of Perestroika and Glasnost:** Consider whether and how the film addresses Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms. Perestroika (economic restructuring) and Glasnost (political openness) contributed to the liberalization of the Soviet Union and its sphere of influence. Examine any dialogue or plot points that reference these policies and their effects on the everyday life of characters, such as increased access to information, more open political debate, or economic turbulence. Ultimately, the film should provide a narrative that intertwines the personal and the political, allowing you to gain a deeper understanding of how these historical events shaped individual experiences. By focusing on these themes, you'll be able to connect the film’s storyline to the broader context of the time and understand the complexities of this transformative period in history."},{"prompt":"Discuss. the fall of communism, the transition to democracy, the role of popular protest, and the impact of Gorbachev’s policies of Perestroika and Glasnost.","completion":"The year 1989 marked a pivotal moment in modern history, characterized by the fall of communism, the transition to democracy in many parts of the world, significant popular protest movements, and the impact of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of Perestroika and Glasnost. **The Fall of Communism:** Communism's fall in Eastern Europe can largely be attributed to political, economic, and social stagnation within the Soviet Union and its satellite states. The Soviet economic system had become unsustainable, struggling with inefficiency, a lack of innovation, and inability to compete with the capitalist West. Countries under Soviet influence were also facing similar issues, along with a growing discontent among their populations. This dissatisfaction was fueled by a lack of political freedoms, poor living conditions, and a suppressed civil society. 1989 was a year that saw a rapid, domino-like collapse of communist regimes across Eastern Europe, starting with Poland and Hungary, followed by East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. Each country experienced unique circumstances and challenges in shedding their communist rule, but they shared the common drives of popular uprisings and the opening for political reforms. **Transition to Democracy:** The transition to democracy in these former communist states was complex and varied in its success and methods. In Poland, the Solidarity movement, a broad anti-communist social movement led by Lech Wałęsa, transitioned from being an outlawed trade union to becoming a political force that ultimately played a key role in pushing for democratic elections. In East Germany, the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 became a potent symbol of the end of the division between East and West, leading to German reunification in 1990. Czechoslovakia experienced a peaceful \\"Velvet Revolution,\\" and its smooth transition was exemplified by the election of dissident playwright Václav Havel as president. Meanwhile, Romania's transition was violent, with the overthrow and execution of dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu. **Role of Popular Protest:** Popular protests played a critical role in the events of 1989. Massive demonstrations and civil resistance movements demonstrated the general public's dissatisfaction with communist rule and their desire for change. The protests often started due to specific incidents or reforms but quickly gathered momentum, drawing diverse groups of citizens together. The scale and peaceful nature of many of these protests forced the ruling regimes to negotiate and, in some cases, step down without significant violence. **Impact of Gorbachev’s Policies of Perestroika and Glasnost:** The policies of Perestroika (economic restructuring) and Glasnost (political openness) implemented by Gorbachev were essential catalysts for change within the Soviet Union and its sphere of influence. Perestroika aimed to revitalize the Soviet economy through market-like reforms and reducing the government's control over the economic system. Glasnost, on the other hand, allowed for more open discussion of political and social issues and a loosening of censorship, leading to more transparent government and the exposure of past state crimes. The reforms Gorbachev initiated, though not entirely successful in achieving their intended economic outcomes, introduced ideas of freedom and liberalization that spread across Eastern Europe and empowered citizens to demand change. The policies set the stage for the weakening of authoritarian communist regimes and the fracturing of the traditional power structures of the Eastern Bloc. In sum, the events of 1989 marked the end of the Cold War era and the beginning of a new chapter in world history, marked by a wave of democratization. The peaceful nature of the transition in most countries remains a testament to the power of nonviolent protest and the universal desire for freedom and self-determination."},{"prompt":"test","completion":"It looks like you're checking if the system is working.

She is otherwise healthy and has never complained to me about it. I know everyone is different but that that sound normal?","completion":"The consistency of bowel movements can vary for each individual and can be influenced by diet, hydration levels, activity levels, and overall health. While many people have soft bowel movements, it's important that your daughter's stool consistency is consistent with what is normal for her and not associated with any other troubling symptoms. A stool that is not solid but is also not diarrhea (loosely defined as watery and occurring three or more times per day) may be perfectly normal for some individuals, especially if it is a consistent pattern and there are no other signs of digestive distress. However, persistently soft stools can also be a sign of a dietary intolerance (such as lactose or gluten intolerance), a malabsorption issue, or a digestive disorder. If your daughter is otherwise healthy, growing appropriately, gaining weight, and not experiencing abdominal pain, discomfort, frequent loose stools, blood in her stool, or any other concerning symptoms, then her bowel habits may simply be normal for her. However, it's wise to discuss these patterns with her pediatrician to ensure they do not indicate any underlying issues. The healthcare provider may inquire about her diet, family history of gastrointestinal conditions, and whether there has been any change in her bowel habits. They may also ask about associated symptoms and may consider doing a physical examination or ordering tests if they suspect an underlying problem. Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and check in with a healthcare professional if you're concerned about any aspect of your child's health."},{"prompt":"Июль 2067 года.

As an AI, I don't watch programs, including CNN, and therefore I do not learn information in real-time or from week to week. However, I can provide you with information about the Cold War and the type of content that might have been discussed on a CNN program related to the Cold War. The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies, the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, after World War II. It lasted roughly from 1947, when the Truman Doctrine was issued, to 1991, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It was called \\"cold\\" because it did not result in direct armed conflict between the superpowers on a wide scale, though there were a number of proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Typically, content about the Cold War might include: 1. **Arms Race**: One of the key features of the Cold War was the nuclear arms race, where both superpowers developed vast arsenals of nuclear weapons with the capacity to destroy each other and the world several times over. 2. **Space Race**: Another aspect was the competition in space exploration, which was also a matter of national prestige. The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik in 1957 kicked off the space race, which eventually led to the United States landing the first men on the moon in 1969. 3. **Proxy Wars**: The superpowers engaged in indirect conflicts by supporting opposite sides in wars in third countries, such as the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Yom Kippur War, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and various conflicts in Africa and Latin America. 4. **Espionage**: The Cold War was also characterized by a significant amount of espionage, with both sides attempting to gather intelligence on each other through various means. 5. **Ideological Conflict**: There was a significant ideological divide between the capitalist, democratic West and the communist, authoritarian East, which colored international relations for decades. 6. **Diplomacy and Treaties**: The tension between the superpowers led to various treaties intended to reduce the risk of nuclear war, such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty). 7. **The Fall of the Berlin Wall and the End of the Cold War**: The decline of communist power in Eastern Europe, marked symbolically by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War. Relation to this week's content would depend on what exactly is being covered in your curriculum or on CNN. Broadly speaking, recent events might relate in terms of: - **International Relations**: Understanding the Cold War helps one comprehend the origins of the present-day geopolitical landscape, including NATO's role, the relationship between Russia and the United States, and issues related to nuclear proliferation. - **Current Conflicts**: Many of the conflicts and tensions existing in the world today have their roots in the Cold War era, including the current situation in Ukraine, relationship with China, and political dynamics in the Middle East. - **Cybersecurity and Espionage**: The modern equivalent of Cold War espionage may well be cyber warfare, where nations engage in hacking and information warfare. - **Nuclear Issues**: The lessons of the Cold War are particularly relevant to discussions about nuclear non-proliferation, such as the tensions surrounding North Korea's and Iran's nuclear programs. Please note, without specific information on \\"this week's content,\\" it is challenging to draw more precise connections. However, many current international issues have historical threads that lead back to the Cold War era.

Ruth and Aimee are barefoot on the sofa. Through a covert hypnosis script, Ruth hypnotizes David into a trance using casual conversation and fractionation techniques, with no awakening scene.","completion":"Title: The Subtle Sway INT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING The room is a typical college-house living area: a bit messy, with a second-hand sofa facing an older model TV. Posters of bands and a few makeshift bookshelves laden with textbooks adorn the walls. We find DAVID, a somewhat disheveled but affable 20-year-old university student, lounging on a bean bag, half-watching a TV show. His sister, RUTH, and her friend AIMEE are sitting on the sofa, cross-legged and barefoot, giggling over an inside joke. Both girls are dressed casually, clear remnants of an active day. The camera focuses on their relaxed posture and the intimate atmosphere of the room. DAVID (finishing a bag of chips) What's so funny over there? RUTH (looking over with a smirk) Oh, just talking about how easy it would be to hypnotize someone without them noticing. AIMEE Yeah, like in those old cartoons, with the swinging watch. David snorts, rolling his eyes, clearly skeptical. DAVID Real hypnosis isn't like that. You can't just say 'you're getting sleepy' and expect someone to start clucking like a chicken. RUTH (smirking, playful) Want to bet? David chuckles in response, not taking her seriously. DAVID Sure, give it your best shot, Houdini. Ruth exchanges a knowing glance with Aimee. She clears her throat and begins to speak in a gentle, rhythmic tone. The camera closes in on Ruth's face, highlighting her calming eyes. RUTH (conversationally) It’s not about a watch, you know. It's about words... and how they can be so... paced... so that every - word - just... falls... into the right place. David’s eyes flutter slightly. The TV show continues in the background, providing mundane white noise. DAVID (laughs, but slower) That's... really not how – RUTH (cutting him off, softly) Not about... how... but when. Like when we're lounging here, comfortable and relaxed... isn’t it? David begins to gaze distantly, eyes locked onto his sister's face as if no longer fully aware of his surroundings. Ruth's words layer over each other, seemingly benign but with a rhythmic cadence. Ruth and Aimee subtly make occasional small gestures with their hands and feet, which seem to weave into Ruth's verbal tapestry. RUTH (continuing) And as the evening stretches on... kind of like a big, deep breath... you could just ex...hale. Letting go... just a bit more with each... breath. David’s head nods faintly as his body slumps further into the beanbag. His eyelids grow heavy, but he doesn’t close them completely. AIMEE (supporting, voice a soft echo) Yeah, release... Almost like sinking into a really good... trance... of relaxation. The scene softens, the light dims and the camera angles switch to a more fluid, dreamlike motion, creating a trance-like viewing experience. We zoom in on David's face, illustrating his deepening trance-like state. RUTH (voice slightly deeper and more resonant) And you know, David, you could even forget to remember... or remember to forget what it feels like to not be so incredibly... relaxed... DAVID (fading, compliant) ...so... relaxed... The flow of the conversation continues seamlessly as they keep talking. Ruth and Aimee exchange subtle looks of accomplishment. The scene never breaks to an awakening; the screen fades to black while Ruth's voice echoes the last words of the hypnotic script, leaving David and the viewers in a state of open-ended suggestion.

The expected range of EV is 300 km. Based on the test data on NEDC, the peak and average power requirements are 94.88 kW and 3 kW respectively. Calculate the suitable battery size and compare with different cell chemistries.","completion":"To determine the battery capacity required for an electric vehicle (EV), one must estimate the energy consumption per unit of distance traveled. The calculation can be approached through several steps: 1. Estimate the energy consumption per 100 km based on the average power requirement. 2. Calculate the total energy required for the expected range. 3. Consider the efficiency of the powertrain and ancillary systems. 4. Account for the depth of discharge (DOD) and other safety factors. Let's go through these steps. **Step 1: Energy Consumption per 100 km** We have an average power requirement of 3 kW. Assuming this is an average for driving the vehicle based on the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle), we need to calculate energy consumption per unit distance. Battery energy consumption (kWh per 100 km) = Average power (kW) x driving time (h) to cover 100 km Now, the average speed for the NEDC is not given, but let's estimate this using typical NEDC averages, which can be around 33.6 km/h. It's important to note that the NEDC has been criticized for not accurately reflecting real-world driving conditions, and the WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure) is now the standard in Europe. However, we will proceed with the assumption that 33.6 km/h is a representative average for the required calculation. Time to drive 100 km at 33.6 km/h = 100 km / 33.6 km/h = 2.976 hours Energy needed per 100 km = 3 kW x 2.976 h = 8.928 kWh **Step 2: Total Energy Required for Expected Range** Total energy required = (Energy per 100 km) x (Total range / 100 km) Total energy required = 8.928 kWh x (300 km / 100 km) = 26.784 kWh **Step 3: Powertrain Efficiency and Ancillary Consumption** The powertrain doesn't convert all the electrical energy into mechanical energy; some is lost as heat. The efficiency can range from around 85% to 95% depending on various factors such as power electronics, motor type, and drivetrain design. Let's use an efficiency of 90% for this estimate. Total energy required accounting for efficiency = 26.784 kWh / 0.90 = 29.76 kWh **Step 4: Depth of Discharge and Safety Factor** Batteries are not typically discharged to 0% because it can damage the battery. Therefore, we need to account for the depth of discharge which can be typically around 80% to 90% for modern batteries. Let's use a DOD of 80%. This means the battery should have 20% charge remaining when it reaches the expected range limit. Furthermore, a safety factor (e.g., 10%) can be applied to compensate for other conditions such as temperature, battery degradation over time, and extra energy consumption that might have not been accounted for in the average power requirement. Final battery capacity required = 29.76 kWh / 0.80 x 1.10 = 41.066 kWh (rounded to 41 kWh) So a suitable battery size would be around 41 kWh for the EV to achieve a 300 km range. **Comparison with Different Cell Chemistries** Battery cell chemistries have different energy densities (Wh/kg) and cost implications. Common chemistries include: - Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LFP): Lower energy density, about 90-120 Wh/kg, but longer life cycle, cheaper and safer. - Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC): Higher energy density, about 150-220 Wh/kg, and good life cycle, but more expensive and less stable under high temperatures. - Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide (NCA): High energy density, often >220 Wh/kg, but expensive and can be less stable. If we calculate the required battery mass for each type using the energy density we get: LFP: 41,000 Wh / (105 Wh/kg on the average) = 390 kg NMC: 41,000 Wh / (185 Wh/kg on the average) = 222 kg NCA: 41,000 Wh / (220 Wh/kg on the average) = 186 kg The selection of cell chemistry will depend on the priorities of the project, considering factors such as weight, cost, safety, life cycle, and the environmental impact of different materials."},{"prompt":"Translate into English: Ex. 1.

The Cold War was a prolonged period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States along with their respective allies. It started shortly after World War II and lasted until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Cold War was characterized by political, ideological, and economic conflicts, with both sides seeking to expand their influence around the world. Key aspects of the Cold War included: 1. Ideological Differences: The U.S. advocated for capitalist democracy, while the Soviet Union promoted communism. This ideological struggle influenced policy-making and international relations. 2. Arms Race: Both superpowers engaged in a race to develop and accumulate weapons, especially nuclear weapons, leading to a state of mutually assured destruction (MAD). 3. Proxy Wars: The two powers clashed indirectly through proxy wars in various countries, such as Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, where they supported opposing sides. 4. Space Race: This was a race for space exploration dominance that peaked with the Apollo moon landing by the United States in 1969. 5. Espionage: Both sides conducted extensive spy operations against each other to gather intelligence. 6. Diplomatic Tensions and Treaties: Periods of high tension, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, were juxtaposed with attempts to reduce the risk of nuclear war through treaties like the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and the later Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Connections to current content or events may include: 1. International Relations: The Cold War shaped many current political boundaries and alliances. Understanding the Cold War can provide context for ongoing international relationships, particularly between the U.S., Russia, and China. 2. Current Conflicts: Some regional conflicts today can trace their roots back to Cold War interventions and policies. 3. Nuclear Proliferation: The Cold War legacy influences current discussions about nuclear weapons and non-proliferation efforts. 4. Cybersecurity and Espionage: Modern-day cybersecurity issues and espionage tactics can often be seen as an extension of Cold War spying, adapted to the digital age. 5. Geopolitical Strategy: The Cold War introduced concepts such as containment and deterrence that continue to impact current geopolitical strategies. 6. Propaganda and Influence Operations: The use of propaganda during the Cold War offers insights into the modern information wars and influence operations observed in social media and national media outlets. In summary, the Cold War era's complexities have left an indelible mark on contemporary global affairs. Understanding the background and outcomes of the Cold War provides important context for analyzing current political and military strategies, international relations, and security policies."},{"prompt":"My daughter said that the pizza at school made everyone \\"blow up the bathroom\\".

CHARACTERS: - DAVID: A 20-year-old university student, kind of the average Joe, not expecting anything unusual. - RUTH: His 16-year-old sister, she’s got this talent for hypnotism stuff, real sneaky about it. - AIMEE: Also 16, Ruth's pal, they're like two peas in a pod, doing that hypnotism thing too, not into shoes when lounging around. SCENE: The lounge room's all cozied up, David’s sat in the armchair tossed somewhere in front, their TV’s beaming some show. Ruth and Aimee are sprawled on this big old sofa, real casual like, feet up, toes all wriggly, no shoes—like a girls’ night slumber party kinda vibe, you know? DAVID: (glued to the telly, clueless) Flicks through channels not paying much mind to the ladies. RUTH: (grins, exchanges a look with Aimee) Hey David, ever just feel like your eyes are all heavy watching the screen? Like, they could just... (yawns) fall shut. AIMÉE: (nods, backs up Ruth) Yeah, like you're drifting... being lulled by the hum of the TV. DAVID: (kinda smirks, eyes dart between screen and Ruth) Sure, classic couch potato mode, right? RUTH: (flicks hair, casual talk, and she’s got this rhythm, you see, like slow, pulling David in) But it’s weirder, ya know? Like when you’re real tired, and you're fighting sleep, but it feels so good just to let go, and you're sinking... sinking... (hand gestures, smooth, like waves or something) DAVID: (he’s fighting yawns now, still trying to keep up with the show) Mmm, guess so. I’m pretty awake, though... RUTH: (still casual, but she’s rolling with this mind trickery) Imagine, just for fun, that with each channel you flip, you’re getting more and more relaxed... Isn’t it curious how the mind can just... flip off? AIMEE: (a silent ally, watching David, thinks the script is going great) Smiles, amused by the unfolding scene. David’s flipping channels more slow now, like he’s not all there. Still thinks he’s just watching TV. RUTH'S VOICE: (getting softer and melodic, like she’s not really there but she is) And it’s like you’re halfway between here and, like, a dream. Floating. No need to try and stay awake, just being... carried by the waves... David’s eyelids do that droopy thing, real heavy. DAVID: (barely above a whisper) That’s... nice... RUTH: (whispers all triumphant to Aimee, knowing they got him) Got him. And like that, David’s out, not slumped or nothing dramatic, just quiet, still sitting up, trance-like, TV glow on his face but he ain’t watching it no more. Ruth and Aimee do their hypnotism high-five or whatever, and the script doesn’t say so, but I reckon they spend the rest of the evening doing goofy stuff while David sits all zoned out. The End.

Here are key points to consider: 1. **Security:** Be mindful that you've included hard-coded credentials in your code. Always avoid sharing sensitive information such as database credentials openly. For production-level code, use environment variables or proper secret management services. 2. **Error Handling:** While you've included basic error handling, you might want to enhance it by handling specific exceptions and providing user-friendly messages. 3. **Database Connections:** You should ensure that your database connections are managed efficiently, particularly in the \`plot_pie_chart\` function, where the 'is_connected' method is not used in combination with a try-except-finally block like in the \`fetch_data\` function. 4. **Gradio Interface Updates:** When updating a Gradio interface element (\`details_output\` in your case) from within an event handler (e.g., a button click), you do not explicitly call a method like \`.html()\` on the interface element. Gradio will handle the update based on the returned value of the event handler. 5. **Clearer Labeling:** Enhance the user experience by adding clearer labels and instructions for the inputs and outputs of your Gradio app. 6. **Screen Refresh and Connections:** Be cautious with database connections when using Gr.Interval. Repeatedly opening and closing connections every few seconds for a live update might not be efficient. Consider using a persistent connection or a connection pool for regular updates. Here's an updated version of your code with the above points incorporated: \`\`\`python import gradio as gr import mysql.connector from mysql.connector import Error import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import os # It's a good practice to use environment variables for credentials. db_host = os.getenv('DB_HOST', 'localhost') db_name = os.getenv('DB_NAME', 'records') db_user = os.getenv('DB_USER', 'root') db_password = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD') # Should be set in your environment def fetch_data(pr_number, status): # Your fetch_data implementation with improved error handling def plot_pie_chart(): # Your plot_pie_chart implementation with improved error handling # Your existing Gradio Blocks definition here \`\`\` In this updated code, we are assuming you've properly set environment variables for your database credentials. For the \`plot_pie_chart\` method changes, mimic the try-finally structure from the \`fetch_data\` method. This will ensure that resources are always freed, even if an exception occurs. Furthermore, always test your code thoroughly, especially error handling paths, to make sure that it functions correctly, handles exceptions as expected, and cleans up resources properly."},{"prompt":"Name: gradio Version: 4.8.0 Name: matplotlib Version: 3.8.2","completion":"Thank you for providing the version information for Gradio and Matplotlib.

The \`live_update\` function is used by the \`gr.Interval\` element for updating the pie chart. It calls your \`plot_pie_chart\` function and updates the output element. 4. In Gradio 4.8.0, elements like \`gr.Textbox\`, \`gr.Radio\`, \`gr.HTML\`, \`gr.Button\`, \`gr.Plot\`, and \`gr.Block\` should be used as shown, instead of the capitalized versions. 5. The \`gr.Interval\` instance now correctly takes the \`fn\` parameter for the callback function and \`output\` to specify which interface element to update.

When I questioned her about it, she said that she was prairie dogging\\"\\"","completion":"\\"Prairie dogging\\" is a colloquial term, often humorously used to describe a situation where someone is trying to hold in a bowel movement, but the feces partially enter and retract in and out of the anus, akin to a prairie dog popping in and out of its hole. If your daughter mentioned she was \\"prairie dogging,\\" it suggests she was having an urgent need to defecate and was trying to hold it back, which unfortunately resulted in a soiling accident. It's important to understand that accidents can happen for a variety of reasons, and they're not necessarily a cause for serious concern, especially if they are infrequent. However, if this is a recurring issue, you may want to consider the following: 1. **Digestive Issues**: It could be a sign of digestive problems such as constipation or diarrhea. Ensure she's getting enough fiber in her diet, staying hydrated, and maintaining regular bathroom habits. 2. **Emotional Stress**: Sometimes, psychological factors or significant stress can lead to changes in bowel habits. Address any potential stressors that she may be experiencing. 3. **Medical Conditions**: On rare occasions, frequent accidents might indicate an underlying medical condition that affects bowel control. 4. **Age-appropriate Behavior**: Depending on your daughter's age, this might be a normal part of her development. Young children especially can have difficulty gauging their need to use the bathroom. 5. **Communication**: Foster an environment where she feels comfortable discussing her bodily functions and needs. Emphasize that it's okay to excuse herself from activities to go to the bathroom. 6. **Hygiene Education**: If your daughter is at an age where she can take responsibility for her hygiene, instruct her on proper cleaning and suggest she changes immediately if she feels soiling. If this issue becomes recurrent, or if there are other symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting, it would be a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider to rule out any potential health issues."},{"prompt":"اكتب لي قصيدة تنتهي كل آلياتها بالقافية \\" سا \\"اريدها تحكي عن الاعيب الحب في غرف الدردشة في الانترنت","completion":"في متاهة الشبكة قلوب تلتقي لعبة هوى فاشها الهمس بلا وسا شاشات وهمسات وغرف مزخرفة تهد العقول برقصة الإغراء سا يدق القلب بسرعة لكلمات جميلة خلف جدار الظلام يختبئ إحساسا يا لعجب! كيف تهوى النفس صورة؟ وحروفاً تختال في ثنايا الجمل فُسا الحب في عالم المحادثات غرابة أوهام تُنسج بين السطور رِسا من خلف الأقنعة أصواتٌ تهمس في لحظة تتويج الوعد موعدًا خُسا لكن حذارِ! فالقلوب أقوى بصدقها ثبت يا زائر الشبكات قلبك أسا تبحث عن الحب الأبدي، فتجده ربما أو تصطدم بخيبةٍ، كسر الأماني كسا تمضي قصائد العاشقين في فضاء لتلاقي في النهاية عزف الواقع سا"},{"prompt":"After I picked up my daughter from school, she wanted me to hurry home because she was \\"touching cloth.\\" What does that mean?","completion":"The phrase \\"touching cloth\\" is a somewhat crude slang expression used particularly in the UK and Australia to indicate that someone is extremely close to defecating themselves.

LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The glow from the TV casts a flickering light on DAVID (20), a weary uni student slumped on one corner of the couch, textbooks scattered like forgotten relics around him. He tilts his head back, eyes half-closed, exhausted. The juxtaposition of his stress and the carefree ambiance of the room creates a scene of stark contrast. RUTH (16), keen-eyed and curiosity personified, perches on the opposite end of the sofa. She’s the architect of hidden depths, her demeanor tranquil, yet her mind whirring with intent. Ruth’s friend AIMEE (16), a tapestry of silent confidence and thoughtful observance, sits cross-legged next to Ruth, subtly attentive to the nuance of the exchange. The TV babbles, its sound a backdrop to their dynamic. The dialogue is natural, unfiltered by tired convention. RUTH (to David) How's the cerebral marathon, marathon man? Latest sprint tripping you up? David offers a weary half-smile, rubbing his temples. Aimee watches with understated intrigue. DAVID It's like deciphering the Rosetta Stone without the stone... or the Rosetta. Ruth chuckles, a soft conspiratorial sound laced with an edge of her upcoming mischief. RUTH Brain frazzled? I read about this trick where if you juggle tasks, you can shake off the cobwebs. DAVID Juggle? I’d probably drop every ball before the first throw. RUTH (to Aimee) Watch and learn, Aimee. It’s a mental juggle. Aimee nods, a flicker of expectation in her gaze. Ruth initiates a lulling cadence of speech, slipping into the topic of relaxation while weaving in subtle markers and dissociative cues. RUTH (continuing, to David) Imagine closing one door and opening another. Flowing from one thought to the next, like the changing channels here. Aimee witnesses the shift in David's often skeptical manner to a mellowed curiosity as Ruth's soothing words envelop the space. David's eyes grow heavy, the flickering light catching the soft surrender in his expression, hinting at the profound yet imperceptible influence of Ruth's guidance. RUTH (continuing) Each switch of focus, like a deep breath. Relaxing deeper, effortlessly with every breath, with every blink. With every moment, heavier than the last. DAVID It’s... oddly calming. He intuitively matches his breathing to Ruth’s rhythm, surrendering to the ebb and flow of her spoken trance. There’s no fight, no resistance, only a seamless drift into a tranquil state, wrapped in a tranquil ambiance. The flicker of understanding passes between Ruth and Aimee, a silent acknowledgment of the hypnotic induction unfolding. Aimee’s expression is one of fascination, the kind that borders reverence for the unseen artistry at play. Ruth continues with her fractionation, layering her conversational hypnosis. She infuses each phrase with a deeper pull, her voice a gentle tide drawing David further into trance. RUTH Feel the room fade as focus sharpens to a single point... like tuning into one frequency among static... David's head tilts forward slightly, his breath even and deep. He is adrift in the nuanced sea Ruth has conjured with words alone. For a moment, they sit in collective silence, a tableau vivant of the symbiosis of influence and acceptance. RUTH (vague smile) We’re all channels of potential, aren't we? Changing states, adjusting frequencies... shifting awareness. As Ruth’s words taper off, David remains in his trance, surrounded by an air of peace. The TV’s light plays across them all, highlighting the absence of spectacle but the presence of something intangible and profound in the simplicity of the scene.

The original Python code utilizes libraries like NumPy, PyTorch, and Torch-Scatter, which do not have direct equivalents in C++. Below is a conceptual outline of how you could approach porting this code to C++. It won't be a line-by-line conversion; rather, I'll guide you on what tools and libraries you could use to achieve similar functionality. 1. **Replacing NumPy:** The C++ standard library and external libraries like Eigen or Armadillo can be used for numerical operations. 2. **Replacing PyTorch:** You can use the C++ API of PyTorch, libtorch, for tensor operations. Go to the official PyTorch website to download libtorch. 3. **Replacing Torch-Scatter:** You may need to implement the equivalent functionality from scratch in C++. There is no direct equivalent library. 4. **Replacing Matplotlib:** Visualization libraries like OpenCV or frameworks like Qt can be used to display images. For plotting graphs, consider libraries like matplotlib-cpp (a C++ wrapper around matplotlib) or libraries like QCustomPlot (for Qt). 5. **File Operations:** C++ itself has sufficient file operation support in the standard library, and you can use libraries like Boost or specialized libraries if you need to process specific file formats. 6. **Image Processing:** OpenCV is widely used for image processing in C++. 7. **Event Handling**: If the AedatFile is similar to a database or a structured file format, consider using existing libraries for file parsing or write a custom parser. 8. **Timing:** You can use \`<chrono>\` library in C++. Given the complexity of the task and the need to write platform-specific code in C++, I will only show an example of how to create a C++ class structure that might correlate to some of your Python functions. \`\`\`cpp #include <armadillo> #include <torch/torch.h> #include <vector> #include <chrono> #include <opencv2/opencv.hpp> // Constants similar to your N_CHANNELS. const int N_CHANNELS = 12; // Example of a class structure that might be similar to your create_window function. class EventWindow { public: EventWindow(/*...*/) { // Constructor implementation... } std::vector<torch::Tensor> create_window(const torch::Tensor& event, const std::string& stacking_type) { // Method implementation... } // Other methods as required... }; // run, get_processed_stack_event, and other functions would be implemented as methods. int main() { // Roughly equivalent of the '__main__' part in Python would go here... return 0; } \`\`\` Please note that the actual implementation of these methods and functions would be considerably more complex and require a good understanding of the C++ equivalents of the Python libraries being used. Furthermore, certain functionalities such as reading \`.aedat4\` files or processing events would have to be custom implemented or use third-party C++ libraries if available. This conversion is a significant project and would likely be much larger than the Python script provided. Depending on the required performance and integration with existing systems, it may be justified, but it definitely requires substantial C++ expertise and understanding of the problem domain."},{"prompt":"python torch_scatter 代码转换成c++代码","completion":"To convert Python's \`torch_scatter\` to C++ code, you would use PyTorch's C++ frontend, often referred to as LibTorch. The LibTorch library provides most of the functionality available in PyTorch, which allows for tensor creation, manipulation, and operations. However, \`torch_scatter\` is a separate PyTorch extension that doesn't have a direct LibTorch counterpart. You have to implement the scatter functionality manually in C++. The scatter operation accumulates values from a source tensor into an output tensor at specified indices based on a given reduction operation such as sum, mean, or max. Here is an example of how you might implement a simple scatter sum operation in C++ using LibTorch: \`\`\`cpp #include <torch/torch.h> // Scatter operation in C++ using LibTorch torch::Tensor scatter_sum(torch::Tensor src, torch::Tensor index, int64_t dim_size) { auto dim = src.dim() - 1; // Assuming the last dimension contains the indices auto output = torch::zeros({dim_size}, src.options()); for (int64_t i = 0; i < index.size(0); ++i) { auto idx = index[i].item<int64_t>(); output[idx] += src[i]; } return output; } int main() { // Example usage: auto src = torch::tensor({1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}); auto index = torch::tensor({0, 1, 2, 1, 2}, torch::dtype(torch::kInt64)); int64_t dim_size = 3; auto result = scatter_sum(src, index, dim_size); std::cout << result << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` To run this code, you need to have LibTorch installed and appropriately linked within your C++ build environment. This example is a simplified version of the scatter sum operation and does not cover all the functionality provided by Python's \`torch_scatter\`. A complete implementation must support multi-dimensional tensors, different data types, and different reduction operations like mean, max, and min. You'll also need to set up a C++ compiler (like \`g++\` or \`clang++\`), configure the build to include the LibTorch headers and libraries, and ensure you're using C++14 or newer as LibTorch requires C++14. Custom implementation of scatter operations can be non-trivial, particularly when considering parallelization, GPU acceleration, and tensor dimensionality. If performance is critical, you might need to look into CUDA programming and use the parallel reduction functions it offers."},{"prompt":"没有torch c++ 库","completion":"如果没有\`libtorch\`（PyTorch的C++分支）或其他类似的C++深度学习库，实现类似\`torch_scatter\`中的操作会更加复杂。你需要从头开始实现这些操作，并可能手动管理CPU或GPU的内存和并行性。在这种情况下，一种可行的方法是使用标准C++库来编写自己的散点（scatter）函数，并在必要时使用如OpenMP这样的库来增加并行性。 下面是一个示例，演示了如何用C++实现一种简单的散点求和（scatter sum）操作，它使用了标准C++库，并且为了简化起见没有并行化。这只是一个在CPU上运行的概念证明，而且仅处理一维向量。 \`\`\`cpp #include <vector> #include <iostream> // Scatter sum operation std::vector<float> scatter_sum(const std::vector<float>& src, const std::vector<int>& index, int dim_size) { std::vector<float> output(dim_size, 0.0f);

Here’s a rough outline for how you might approach converting your Python code to C++: 1. Use \`Eigen\` for vector and matrix operations, as a substitute for NumPy operations. 2. Use \`libtorch\`, the C++ API for PyTorch (you will have to manually translate the tensor operations from Python to C++). 3. Use \`opencv\` for image handling and visualization, as a substitute for \`matplotlib\`. 4. Use your own or third-party file I/O code to handle AEDAT files, as a substitute for the \`dv\` Python module. 5. Adapt the scatter operations accordingly using loops or find an equivalent in C++. The following is a starting point for C++ code that might achieve a similar functionality, though it will be significantly more verbose than the Python version. Please note that this is a conceptual example and not a complete program: \`\`\`cpp #include <torch/torch.h> #include <Eigen/Dense> #include <opencv2/opencv.hpp> #include <iostream> #include <vector> // In this example, windows is a vector of Eigen matrices (an alternative of NumPy arrays) std::vector<Eigen::MatrixXd> create_window(const Eigen::MatrixXd &event) { std::vector<Eigen::MatrixXd> windows; // Implementation of the windowing logic, adapting Python slicing to C++ Eigen operations // ... return windows; } // C++ equivalent of your \\"run\\" function, using libtorch torch::Tensor run(const torch::Tensor& src, const torch::Tensor& index, const std::string& aggregation, int64_t height, int64_t width) { // Implementation of run logic, possibly replacing Python's scatter with a loop or other approach // ... return torch::zeros({height, width}); // Placeholder return value } torch::Tensor get_processed_stack_event(const Eigen::MatrixXd& window, const std::string& func, const std::string& aggregation, int64_t height, int64_t width) { // Similar to run return torch::zeros({height, width}); // Placeholder return value } std::tuple<double, torch::Tensor> get_optimized_representation(const Eigen::MatrixXd& event, int64_t height, int64_t width, size_t num_bins) { // Start timing std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point start_time = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now(); // Logic to process the event and create the optimized representation // ... // End timing std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point end_time = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now(); std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> process_time = end_time - start_time; // Create a placeholder tensor for the representation torch::Tensor representation = torch::zeros({static_cast<int64_t>(num_bins), height, width}); // Return process time and representation return std::make_tuple(process_time.count(), representation); } int main() { // In C++, you would need to read the Aedat file and populate the Eigen::MatrixXd with the events data Eigen::MatrixXd event; // Placeholder for the event matrix from the AEDat file // Now call your functions as you would in Python // ... return 0; } \`\`\` Please consider the following for the conversion: - The logic of slicing arrays and operations are different in C++ and Eigen than in Python and NumPy. - Scatter operations have no direct C++ equivalent; you'd likely need to write custom code to match the functionality of Python’s \`torch_scatter.scatter\`. - C++ does not have direct equivalents to many Python libraries. You would need to find replacements or implement additional functionality by hand. - You may need to account for GPU acceleration if you use CUDA with LibTorch, which would require ensuring that the appropriate CUDA version is installed on your system. - Error handling in C++ is different from Python and may require more careful management, particularly with file I/O and memory management. Given the complexities involved, you may find that this conversion process requires iterative refinement to ensure functional equivalence and performance optimization."},{"prompt":"[ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/main.dir/main.cpp.o make[2]: *** No rule to make target '/data2/local_userdata/heyuting/Projects1/New_presentations/libtorch/lib/libc10.so”', needed by 'main'.

The error is coming from the CMake-generated build system. Here are a few things you should check to resolve this issue: 1. **Correct LibTorch Installation**: Ensure you have correctly installed LibTorch and that the \`libc10.so\` file exists in the specified directory. You can do this by navigating to your LibTorch install path (\`/data2/local_userdata/heyuting/Projects1/New_presentations/libtorch/lib/\`) and listing the files to check if \`libc10.so\` is present there. 2. **Valid Library Path**: Confirm that the paths provided to CMake in \`CMakeLists.txt\` for the libraries are correct. It should point to the directory where \`libc10.so\` exists. Check if the path has any typos or incorrect characters. The given path in your error message has a closing quote \`”\` that’s different from the opening quote \`'\`. This might be a typo in your \`CMakeLists.txt\`. 3. **Refresh CMake Cache**: If you've moved or reinstalled LibTorch, the old paths may be cached. Clear your CMake cache and re-run the CMake command to generate fresh build files. You can clear the cache by deleting the \`CMakeCache.txt\` file in your build directory or simply deleting the entire build directory and then creating it again. For example: \`\`\`bash rm -rf build/ mkdir build cd build cmake .. \`\`\` 4. **Check CMakeLists.txt File**: Ensure that your \`CMakeLists.txt\` file's \`find_package(Torch REQUIRED)\` command is correctly finding LibTorch and setting the library paths. Here’s an example that assumes LibTorch is unzipped in \`/absolute/path/to/libtorch\`: \`\`\`cmake cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0 FATAL_ERROR) project(your_project_name) list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH \\"/absolute/path/to/libtorch\\") find_package(Torch REQUIRED) add_executable(main main.cpp) target_link_libraries(main \\"{TORCH_LIBRARIES}\\") set_property(TARGET main PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 14) \`\`\` Replace \\"/absolute/path/to/libtorch\\" with the path to your actual LibTorch installation. 5. **Use a Non-Relative Path**: If using a relative path in \`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\`, try replacing it with an absolute path to see if it resolves the issue. After making sure everything is fixed and in place, try running \`make\` again. If you're still experiencing issues, provide the entire \`CMakeLists.txt\` file you're using so that we can give more precise advice."},{"prompt":"c++ 本地安装 torch","completion":"The process to locally install LibTorch, the C++ distribution of PyTorch, usually involves the following steps: # Download LibTorch 1.

LIVING ROOM - EVENING Three siblings settle in a warm, comfortable living room softly illuminated by the gentle glow of an evening broadcast flickering from the TV screen. DAVID, a 20-year-old university student with an air of scholarly absorption, slouches in an armchair, his attention half on a textbook, half on the television. Beside him, on the sofa, his younger sister RUTH, 16, precociously skilled in the art of hypnosis, sits cross-legged, her bare feet tucked beneath her. Her friend AIMEE, also 16, mirrors Ruth’s posture, both girls engrossed in an animated conversation. Ruth clicks the remote, muting the TV commercials, her gaze sliding towards David with a playful, conspiratorial twinkle. Her voice is light, seemingly innocuous, yet tinged with a subtle cadence designed to garner attention from her unsuspecting brother. RUTH Hey, David, doesn’t it just amaze you how the mind can tune out the TV like background noise? Like, sometimes you’re watching, but not really watching? Sort of like when you’re reading; you just get... lost in it. David glances up, bemused by the sudden change in Ruth’s topic. He offers a nonchalant nod, not noting the strategic placement of her words, reminiscent of a conversational induction. Ruth maintains a steady eye contact, smiling gently. DAVID Yeah, sometimes I guess I drift off a bit. RUTH Drifting... it’s nice, right? Like when you're about to fall asleep, and you're aware but not entirely there. Funny how feet can feel so light when you relax. You know, like your feet now, feeling weightless. Ruth casually gestures to her and Aimee's bare feet, as David unconsciously shifts his own. They are implementing fractionation—a technique where one rapidly alternates between attention and inattention to disrupt the conscious processes. AIMEE Completely weightless. Hey, David, do you think your feet can feel like ours? So weightless they could just... float. David smirks, but a thoughtful expression shows he’s unintentionally contemplating the concept. Ruth continues the conversational dance, weaving the hypnotic script with all the deftness of a seasoned practitioner, pacing and leading David’s awareness away from waking consciousness. RUTH Sometimes, when I do that, I almost forget where I am for a second, you know? Like how you forget for a moment, but then you remember... forget... remember. With Ruth's guidance, David’s eyes begin to flicker slightly with duality—aware but hazed, focusing but unfocusing. The power of suggestion subtly shifts perspectives, Ruth’s voice a metronome for David’s thoughts. RUTH (CONT’D) It's like blinking, isn't it? Your eyes close, open, close— and each time, it’s easier. Blink, and you're a bit more relaxed. Let’s try it. Blink with me. Close. Open. David’s blinks grow longer, a testament to Ruth’s mastery of fractionation, each blink loosening his hold on conscious awareness. Moments begin to blend as Ruth’s tone modulates, her words a symphony conducted to resonate within the mind's deepest chambers. RUTH (CONT’D) Like the tide, awareness comes and goes. You can catch it in waves or let it drift... catching and drifting. Nothing to focus on, nothing to do but ride the waves. It’s all about the rhythm, isn't it? The SOUND of the television recedes into nothingness. Time stretches and condenses around Ruth’s gently spiraling words, the girls’ tapping toes providing a subtle, almost imperceptible pulse underpinning the hypnotic induction. RUTH (CONT’D) Feels good to just... let go, doesn’t it? Just for a little while. No need to wake up, no need to really sleep... just floating. You know you can always drift back to this peacefulness whenever you like, in your own time. David’s head nods lightly, his breathing deepens, the script seamless in its execution. His consciousness ebbs, a willing vessel on Ruth's calculated vocal tides, immersed in a state of repose with no intention from Ruth to call him back to the surface—no awakening scene scripted.ază The conversation continues, with no hint of the shift that has occurred, as the television screen fills with color and life once more. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"Write the following like you’re particularly skilled at describing how it feels to enter and be in trance states: Script: David (20, uni student) and his younger sister Ruth (16), who’s skilled in hypnosis, are watching TV with Ruth’s friend Aimee (16) one evening. Ruth and Aimee are barefoot on the sofa. Through a covert hypnosis script, Ruth hypnotizes David into a trance using casual conversation and fractionation techniques, with no awakening scene.","completion":"The air in the room is casual, the flicker of the television casting an ambient glow upon the faces of David, his younger sister Ruth, and her friend Aimee. They lounge with the careless demeanor of evening relaxation, the fabric of the sofa cradling them in shared comfort. Ruth and Aimee rest with their bare feet tucked beneath them, the day's constraints dismissed in the sanctuary of home. Ruth, with her innate grace for hypnosis, weaves words with an unseen mastery into the tapestry of their mundane conversation. Like a skilled musician deftly plucking at stringed instruments, her phrases pull at David's consciousness, unremarkable notes at first, blending seamlessly with the rhythm of sibling chatter. David's gaze, unfocused, occasionally meets the TV screen—a mere distraction unaware of the undercurrent carrying him adrift. Ruth's voice is the gentle tide in the backdrop of their dialogue, her words lapping over David's cognition with a calculated ease. He hears her; he responds, but each exchange incrementally chains him further in a descent into the depths of his own mind. A trance state, so subtly approached, washes over David in undulating waves. Ruth's cunning use of fractionation—artfully punctuating their talk with brief pauses, mixed directives, and a diverse cadence—caresses the borders of his awareness. She speaks of the mundane while lacing her sentences with a hypnotic allure, an invisible pull as soft as the brush of a feather, a sensory whisper that beckons David's psyche. With every ebb and flow of conversation, of Ruth's tranquil and purposeful detours, David slips inch by imperceptible inch into a serene trance state. His responses, formerly agile, now echo with the murkiness of one speaking from a distance, the echo of a thought submerged in the depths of introspection. His eyelids, heavy as though weighted with the sands of a dreamer's realm, flutter in rhythm with the resonance of Ruth's commands, now fully cloaked as innocent conversation. The room's ambient sounds, though present, fade to a subtle hush against the symphony of Ruth's hypnotic induction. The once distinct boundaries of David's individual thoughts meld like watercolors on the vast canvas of his subconscious, as he drifts into an interlude of mental repose. And so, as the world outside marches to the tick of the clock, and as the glow of the television casts dancing shadows upon the room, David remains adrift, an island of calm in the stream of Ruth's making. His outward stillness is but a mirror to the quietude within—a tranquil harbor far removed from the ordinary anchors of his university life. He's suspended in a reverie without images, a state of serene oblivion sculpted by Ruth's covert craft. As the scene draws onward, the quiet artistry of Ruth's hypnotism has set the stage for an evening where reality is no longer the master but the subject, and David, her unwitting canvas, painted with the strokes of her unspoken command. There will be no abrupt awakening for David this night, only a gentle lingering in the arms of trance, where the line between sleep and susceptibility blurs into insignificance."},{"prompt":"Сделайте класс Monster, реализовав ICreature.

LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Three individuals are situated in a cozy, ambiently-lit living room dominated by a large, flat-screen television emitting a soft glow. The dynamics between the characters reveal subtleties within non-verbal communication that hint at intricate relational intricacies, as well as the imminent display of psychological manipulation through hypnotic techniques. DAVID (20, a quintessentially earnest university student with an air of scholarly distraction) is seated in an armchair, his gaze fixed on the television screen, his mind presumably lost in the programming, yet his sensory pathways remain peripherally open to external stimuli—a textbook precondition for hypnosis susceptibility. RUTH (16, David's younger sister, a precocious and intellectually dexterous individual known for her burgeoning expertise in hypnosis) lounges with deliberate casualness on the sofa. Her bare feet denote a sense of ease and intimacy within the space. This informality itself serves as a subconscious cue, subtly suggesting that all present are in a secure environment conducive to lowered psychological defenses. Beside Ruth sits AIMEE (16, Ruth's accomplice in the impending hypnotic endeavor, also barefoot, possibly as a symbol of silent solidarity). Both she and Ruth exude an air of youthful mirth, yet beneath this façade lies a serene competence in the art of conversational hypnosis. We focus on Ruth as she initiates conversation with David. Her speech is mellifluous, seemingly innocuous, cleverly laced with embedded commands and indirect suggestions. A topic as mundane as a recent lecture David attended becomes the canvas upon which Ruth subtly integrates hypnotic language patterns. RUTH employs 'fractionation'—a powerful hypnotic procedure that involves guiding the subject into and out of trance states in rapid succession, creating a psychic oscillation designed to deepen trance with each iteration. Her dialogue oscillates between trivial and slightly more engaging topics, each time employing a range of vocal tonalities to create a rhythmic pattern that David's unconscious begins to follow. Visual cues, such as nods and hand gestures, are synchronized with her speech, further anchoring the duality of attention required for fractionation. David's responses become less verbal and more non-verbal—slower nods, deeper breaths, a subtle relaxation in posture—indicative of the onset of trance. One notices a distinct yet fleeting flutter of the eyelids, a hallmark of transient hypnogogic states often seen in subjects undergoing hypnosis. Ruth, with the skill of a seasoned hypnotherapist, expertly avoids any explicit command for sleep or awakening, circumventing the conscious mind's potential objections. She and Aimee exchange a knowing glance, the unspoken signal that their subject has arrived at the desired depth of trance. The television continues to play, the flickering light providing a residual visual anchor, but it is now secondary to the hypnotic process unfolding. Ruth's conversation continues to ebb and flow, an orchestrated symphony of language and psychology, masterfully avoiding rousing David from his trance. The curtain falls on this vignette with David in a state of receptive somnambulism, and Ruth and Aimee silently acknowledging their success—Ruth, with the pride of a virtuoso utilizing her talents for a smooth execution of covert hypnosis, and Aimee as the silent witness to Ruth's finesse.

I'll provide a high-level description of the key steps to set up basic movement in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints: 1. **Open your project in Unreal Engine**: - Ensure that you have a character or pawn to control. 2. **Set up Input Bindings**: - Go to \\"Edit\\" in the main menu and then to \\"Project Settings\\". - Under the \\"Engine\\" section, select \\"Input\\". - Expand \\"Axis Mappings\\" and add new bindings for movement (typically \\"MoveForward\\" and \\"MoveRight\\"). - Assign keys (e.g., W/S for forward/back and A/D for left/right). 3. **Edit the Character Blueprint**: - Open the Blueprint of the character you wish to control. - Go to the \\"Event Graph\\" section. 4. **Implement Forward/Backward Movement**: - Find the \\"InputAxis MoveForward\\" event node (created from your input settings). - Drag off the execution pin and find the \\"Add Movement Input\\" node. - For the \\"Add Movement Input\\" node, you want to provide a direction. For forward movement, you can use the character's forward vector. Drag off the node's \\"World Direction\\" input and search for \\"Get Actor Forward Vector\\". - Connect the \\"Axis Value\\" output from the \\"InputAxis MoveForward\\" event to the \\"Scale Value\\" input of \\"Add Movement Input\\". 5. **Implement Right/Left Movement**: - Repeat the above step for the \\"InputAxis MoveRight\\" event using the \\"Get Actor Right Vector\\" to get the correct direction for lateral movement. 6. **Compile and Test Movement**: - Compile the Blueprint and test the character in the level to confirm the movement is working. Below is an example of how the nodes in the Event Graph might look for moving forward and to the right: \`\`\`plaintext [InputAxis MoveForward] -> (Axis Value) -> [Add Movement Input] ↓ (Scale Value) ↓ [Get Actor Forward Vector] ↓ (World Direction) [InputAxis MoveRight] -> (Axis Value) -> [Add Movement Input] ↓ (Scale Value) ↓ [Get Actor Right Vector] ↓ (World Direction) \`\`\` Please remember that this is a simplified version of a movement system. There are many more considerations to take into account for a polished game, such as handling jumping, crouching, collisions, animations, etc. For these more advanced features, you'd have to branch out from this simple system and start integrating other aspects of the Unreal Engine Blueprint system, adjusting physics settings, working with animation blueprints, and possibly adding custom code. If you're new to Unreal Engine, I highly recommend going through tutorials that Epic provides, as well as community content, to get a more in-depth understanding and step-by-step guides. As Unreal is a complex tool, it is beneficial to get hands-on experience working with it to truly understand how all the parts come together."},{"prompt":"Сделайте класс Monster, реализовав ICreature.

Unreal Engine 5 is a complex game engine and involves a steep learning curve for beginners. However, I can provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to move an object within the editor. To get started with Unreal Engine 5, you need to have it installed on your computer. Once you've done that, follow these steps to move a teapot in the engine: 1. **Open Unreal Engine 5**: - Launch the Epic Games Launcher. - Open Unreal Engine 5 by clicking on the 'Launch' button in your library. 2. **Create a New Project**: - Choose to create a new project. - Select a template that fits your needs (for basic object manipulation, you can choose the \\"Blank\\" project). - Set project settings as required (you can leave these as default for now). - Click 'Create' to create your new project. 3. **Add a Teapot to Your Scene** (If you have a teapot mesh/asset): - In the \\"Content Browser,\\" click on \\"Import\\" to import your teapot mesh file if you have one. - If Unreal Engine provides a teapot mesh as part of its starter content, you can find it in the Content Browser under \\"Starter Content > Props.\\" - Drag and drop the teapot into your scene viewport. 4. **Move the Teapot**: - Click on the teapot in the viewport to select it. - In the top toolbar, there are various tools for manipulating objects. Select the \\"Move\\" tool. (It's often represented by arrows pointing along the X, Y, and Z axes.) - Drag the arrows associated with the teapot to move it along the desired axis. 5. **View and Edit the Teapot's Transform Properties**: - With the teapot selected, look for the \\"Details\\" panel on the right side of the editor window. - Within the \\"Details\\" panel, find the \\"Transform\\" section. This will show you the \\"Location,\\" \\"Rotation,\\" and \\"Scale\\" for the teapot. - You can enter specific values into the \\"Location\\" fields to move it to a precise point in your scene. 6. **Save the Scene**: - To save the changes you've made, go to \\"File\\" > \\"Save Current\\" or press Ctrl+S. 7. **Playtest Your Scene**: - To see your changes in action, click the \\"Play\\" button on the top toolbar to start the in-editor game simulation. Here's an example of simple Unreal Engine Blueprint code that moves an object when the game starts: \`\`\`cpp BeginPlay() { FVector NewLocation = FVector(100.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f); SetActorLocation(NewLocation); } \`\`\` This code would go in a custom C++ class or Blueprint for the teapot that sets the teapot's location when the game begins. It moves the teapot to the position (100, 100, 100) in the game world. To use this code, you will have to learn the basics of scripting or Blueprints in Unreal Engine. Remember that learning how to effectively use Unreal Engine 5 will require time and practice. Consider looking for beginner tutorials on Unreal Engine, which will guide you through the basics, including properly moving and manipulating objects in the engine."},{"prompt":"why do some people think feet are icky? and that massaging someone's feet means you're lowly compared to them? (short answer)","completion":"Some people find feet icky due to factors such as odor, sweat, or the perception of feet as dirty because they are in constant contact with the ground. Cultural and personal sensitivities also play a role in how feet are perceived. The idea that massaging someone's feet signifies being lowly compared to them stems from hierarchical social structures where serving others, especially attending to feet, was viewed as a task for someone of lower status. Feet were often considered the lowest and dirtiest part of the body, so to touch or wash someone else's feet was an act of humility or servitude. This notion can still persist in some cultures and social contexts."},{"prompt":"Script: David (20, uni student) and his younger sister Ruth (16), who’s skilled in hypnosis, are watching TV with Ruth’s friend Aimee (16) one evening.

David’s head nods almost imperceptibly as he slips further into relaxation. AIMEE You're so good at this stuff, Ruth. It's like you have a... magic touch or something. RUTH (smirks) Oh, you can call it what you want. It's all about the power of suggestion and, of course, repetition, which can be so calming and... re-peating... re-lax-ing. David's eyes finally close, his body completely relaxed as he continues to breathe deeply, unconsciously tuned into Ruth's voice and no longer watching the TV. RUTH (CONT'D) Just like a soothing lullaby, even in the space between words, there's comfort in silence, in stillness... isn't that true, David? David doesn't respond, deeply entranced, as Ruth and Aimee exchange a look of success. The scene continues with the casual, covert hypnosis, as Ruth guides David deeper into trance, his awareness fading with each word she speaks. There is no awakening scene, as Ruth weaves her hypnotic script seamlessly into their evening, blending it with the background noise of the television.

[챔피언스 리그를 향한 열망을 보여주는군요. 세 명의 중앙 미드필더진이 고군분투하며 지단의 빌드 업을 애초에 차단하려는 움직임을 보이고 있습니다.] [예, 지금까지는 좋습니다. 하지만 레알 마드리드가 이대로 있지만은 않을 텐데요.] 그야말로 최후의 발악이었다. 하지만 해설의 말마따나, 경기는 그들이 원하는 방향으로 흘러가지 않았다. 레알 마드리드는 그것을 용납할 팀이 아니었다. 후반 초반에야 효과가 있었지만, 시간이 지날수록 보리소프 선수들의 체력이 빠지면서 지단의 빌드 업이 날카로워져 갔다. 한순간, 지단과 말루다의 눈이 마주쳤다. 그때부터 경기의 흐름이 뒤집히기 시작했다. 2006독일월드컵의 우승트로피를 들어 올린 프랑스 커넥션이 날카로운 연계플레이를 통해 흐름을 가져왔다. 좌우 측면에선 말루다와 사비올라가 끊임없이 공간을 창출해내면서, 공격형 미드필더에 배치된 반 더 바르트의 자유로운 플레이메이킹을 도왔다. 보르소프의 수비진은 반 더 바르트의 전매특허인 중거리 슈팅에 대비하면서 동시에 호영의 침투를 막느라 정신이 없었다. 하지만 아직 시작도 안 했다. 레알 마드리드의 전술은 이제 시작이었다. [반 더 바르트, 공을 잡으면서 시간을 끕니다. 말루다와 사비올라가 중앙으로 밀집하면서 좁은 간격을 유지합니다.] [동시에 양측 터치라인을 따라 오버래핑을 시도하고 있는 호베르투 카를로스와 세르히오 라모스. 순식간에 공격 숫자를 여섯 명으로 늘리는 레알 마드리드입니다.] 전술은 점점 날카롭고 견고해졌다. 프리시즌 때부터 슈스터 감독이 구상했던 것으로, 꼭 한 번 실전에서 써먹고 싶었던 것인데 이제야 그 꿈을 이루게 되었다. 모든 것이 계획한 대로 흘러가고 있었다. 여기서 이제 마무리만 제대로 된다면, 이 전술에 실용성이 있다는 것이 증명되는 셈이었다. 우호영. 그의 역할이 중요했다. 이제는 움직여야 할 때였다. [반 더 바르트, 고개를 들어 우호영을 봅니다.] [최전방의 우호영, 상황을 살핍니다. 라인 브레이킹을 시도하는가 싶더니 골문을 등지고 수비수들과 전면전을 벌이는군요.] [언제든지 침투를 할 수 있다는 여지를 남기는 동시에 스스로 미끼가 되었습니다. 다른 공격수들의 원활한 침투를 도우려는 의도 같은데요. 음, 글쎄요. 일단 의도만큼은 일단 좋아요. 하지만 너무 시간을 끌면 안 될 텐데요.] [베른트 슈스터 감독의 성향이 뚜렷이 나타나는 전술이군요?] [그렇습니다. 다재다능하기로 알려진 스네이더에게도 전에 이러한 역할을 부여한 적이 있었죠, 아마 작년 있었던 비야돌리드와의 경기였었나요?] [맞습니다. 그리고 실패로 돌아가고 말았죠. 물론 스네이더가 벼락같은 중거리 슛으로 결승골을 터트리긴 했습니다만, 슈스터 감독이 원하는 플레이는 나오지 않았었죠.] 그리고 오늘도 별 반 다르지 않을 것이라 생각했다. 우호영이 제아무리 공격수 출신이라고는 하지만, 실전에서 처음 써보는 전술에 녹아들기란 말처럼 쉬운 일이 아니었기 때문이다. 경기에 투입된 지 이제 겨우 10분. 더욱이 1군 팀 훈련에 정식으로 합류한 지 한 달도 채 되지 않은 호영이 아닌가. 해설들이 보기에, 우호영의 원 톱(One top) 기용은 성공을 거두지 못할 것 같았다. 그도 그럴 게, 당장만 하더라도 호영의 움직임이 산만해 보였기 때문이다. [우호영, 오늘따라 갈팡질팡하는 모습이 자주 포착됩니다. 반 더 바르트와 너무 떨어져 있는 탓인가요? 침투를 하든지 아니면 측면의 공간을 활용하게끔 공간을 잡아줘야 하는데 아직은 많이 미숙한 모습입니다. 아니면 이것도 하나의 작전일까요?] [글쎄요. 우호영이 지금 분주하게 움직이면서 공격을 조율하고 있거든요? 사실 공격 숫자가 이렇게 많은 상황에서는 공격형 미드필더에게 맡기는 게 나을 텐데 말이죠.] 해설진은 그게 너무나도 의문이었다. 도대체 왜 저런 움직임을 보이는 걸까? 만능형 공격수가 아니라 흐름에 타지 못하여 갈피를 잡지 못하는 떠돌이를 보는 것 같았다. 혹시 챔피언스 리그가 첫 무대라서 긴장한 걸까? 상식적으로 이해할 수 없었다. 하지만 그게 당연한 일이었다. 그것은, 작전을 겉으로 드러내지 않으려 하는 호영의 의도였으니까. 그로부터 얼마 지나지 않아서였다. [우호영! 갑자기 경로를 바꿉니다. 좌측의 카를로스에게 내어주는 롱 패스!] [순식간에 일어난 일입니다. 말루다와 카를로스가 위치를 주고받다가 우호영의 신호에 맞춰 위협적인 움직임을 벌였어요. 뭐랄까요. 맞지 않았던 톱니바퀴가 강제적으로 맞춰지는 느낌입니다.] [그러면서 우호영! 수비를 등집니다!] 축구계에 이런 말이 있다. 천재성은 어릴 때 가장 빛나고, 창조성은 나이를 먹으면서 짙어진다고. 맞는 말이었다. 천재성, 그것이야말로 어린 호영의 가장 큰 무기였다. 아찔한 기운이 피치 위를 감돌기 시작했다. 전운(戰雲). 축구 감각이 상당히 발달한 중앙 수비수 세르게이 소스노프스키(Sergey Sosnovski)는 흐름을 눈치채자마자 소리를 꽥꽥 질러댔다. 그러면서 우호영의 등에 거머리처럼 달라붙으며 주의를 놓지 않았다. 널찍한 호영의 등을 타고 두 사람의 심리전을 오갔다. 조금이라도 더 좋은 자리를 차지하고자 과격한 몸싸움을 벌였다. ‘한 순간도 놓치면 안 돼. 이건 타이밍 싸움이야.’ 당연한 생각이었다. 그리고 그것이 소스노프스키의 패착이었다. 상식을 뛰어넘는 선수를 상대할 때는, 당연한 생각으로 맞서면 죽도 밥도 안 된다. 탁, 휘익. “···?” 수비를 등지고 공을 받은 호영은 곡예를 하듯 유연한 움직임으로, 제자리에서 180도를 회전했다. 몸에 윤활유를 바른 것처럼 끊기는 동작이 거의 없었다. [우호영! 소스노프스키를 순식간에 젖혀냅니다!] [이어지는 말루다의 뒷공간 돌파. 우호영의 패스가 전달됩니다.] [곧이어 돌아오는 말루다의 리턴 패스가 우호영의 발끝으로 향합니다. 문전 앞 상황!] 말루다와 원투 패스를 주고받으며 골문 앞으로 달려간 호영은 정면을 보았다. 겁을 잔뜩 먹은 골키퍼가 뛰쳐나오고 있었다. 반면 호영은 침착했다. 왼발로 공을 툭 밀어차면서 골키퍼의 다리 사이로 공을 통과시켰다. 직후 골망이 흔들리자 경기장이 들썩였다. 해설진과 양 팀 감독들. 20유로짜리 무의미한 내기를 걸었던 두 명의 사내들을 포함한 6만여 명의 관중들까지. 모두를 경악시킨 우호영의 챔피언스 리그 데뷔 골이었다.","completion":"This time, a quick pass to Malouda on the left. Borsov, who had been thoroughly outplayed in the first half, did not back down easily. After halftime, armed with a strong mentality, he aggressively pressed and focused on disrupting Zidane's play. [It shows their desire for the Champions League. The trio of central midfielders are struggling to block Zidane's build-up from the outset.] [Yes, so far so good. But Real Madrid won't just stand by.] It was a last-ditch effort. But as the commentator said, the game did not flow in their favor. Real Madrid was not a team to allow that. Although effective in the early second half, as time passed, Borsov's players' stamina waned, and Zidane's build-up became sharper. In a moment, Zidane and Malouda's eyes met. From then on, the flow of the game began to reverse. The French connection, which lifted the 2006 Germany World Cup trophy, brought the flow with sharp combination plays. On the flanks, Malouda and Saviola continuously created space, aiding the free playmaking of Van der Vaart, positioned as an attacking midfielder. Borsov's defense was overwhelmed, preparing for Van der Vaart's trademark long-range shots while simultaneously trying to block Ho-young's penetrations. But it hadn't even started yet. Real Madrid's tactics were just beginning. [Van der Vaart, holding the ball, bides his time. Malouda and Saviola crowd the center, maintaining a tight distance.] [At the same time, Roberto Carlos and Sergio Ramos are attempting overlaps along the touchlines. Real Madrid quickly increases their attacking numbers to six.] The tactics became sharper and more solid. It was something that coach Schuster had envisioned since the preseason, and he had wanted to use it in a real game; now, his dream was coming true. Everything was going according to plan. If they could just finish properly now, it would prove the practicality of this tactic. Woo Ho-young. His role was crucial. It was time to move. [Van der Vaart, looking up, sees Woo Ho-young.] [The forward Woo Ho-young, assessing the situation. It looks like he's trying to break the line, but instead, he turns his back to the goal and engages in a frontal battle with the defenders.] [He leaves the possibility of penetration open while also becoming bait himself. It seems he intends to facilitate the smooth penetration of other attackers. Well, the intention is good for now, but they shouldn't drag it out too long.] [Does this tactic clearly reflect coach Bernd Schuster's style?] [Yes. He has previously assigned such a role to the versatile Sneijder, perhaps in last year's match against Valladolid?] [Correct. And it ended in failure. Of course, Sneijder did score the winning goal with a lightning-long shot, but the play Schuster wanted did not materialize.] And today was no different, they thought. No matter that Woo Ho-young was a former striker, it was not easy to blend into a tactic being used for the first time in a real game. He had only been on the field for 10 minutes. Moreover, Ho-young had only officially joined the first-team training less than a month ago. To the commentators, it seemed that the use of Woo Ho-young as a lone striker would not be successful. And for good reason, as Ho-young's movements seemed erratic at the moment. [Woo Ho-young, today he seems to be indecisive. Is it because he's too far from Van der Vaart? He should either penetrate or create space for the use of the flanks, but he still looks very inexperienced. Or is this also part of the strategy?] [Well, Woo Ho-young is now busily moving and coordinating the attack. In fact, in such a situation with many attackers, it would be better to leave it to the attacking midfielder.] The commentators were puzzled. Why was he showing such movements? He seemed like a wanderer who was not a versatile attacker and could not find his rhythm. Was it because the Champions League was his first stage and he was nervous? It was incomprehensible by common sense. But that was natural. It was Ho-young's intention not to reveal his tactics. It wasn't long before. [Woo Ho-young! Suddenly changes direction. A long pass to Carlos on the left!] [It happened in an instant. Malouda and Carlos swapped positions and made a threatening move at Woo Ho-young's signal. It's like forcing mismatched gears to fit.] [And Woo Ho-young! He turns his back on the defense!] There's a saying in the world of soccer. Genius shines brightest when young, and creativity deepens with age. It was true. Genius, that was the greatest weapon of the young Ho-young. A thrilling atmosphere began to swirl on the pitch. The battle clouds. Central defender Sergey Sosnovski, with a highly developed soccer sense, immediately noticed the flow and screamed out loud. At the same time, he clung to Woo Ho-young's back like a leech, not losing focus. A psychological battle ensued over the broad back of Ho-young. They engaged in a fierce physical fight to secure a better position. 'I can't miss a single moment. This is a battle of timing.' It was an obvious thought. And that was Sosnovski's mistake. When facing a player who defies the norm, conventional thinking is useless. Thump, whoosh. “...?” Woo Ho-young, who received the ball with his back to the defense, turned 180 degrees on the spot with an acrobatic and flexible movement, as if he had lubricated his body. [Ho-young! He quickly shakes off Sosnovski!] [Following that, Malouda's run into the space behind. Ho-young's pass is delivered.] [Then Malouda's return pass heads towards Ho-young's feet. A situation in front of the goal!] After exchanging one-two passes with Malouda and rushing to the front of the goal, Ho-young faced forward. The goalkeeper, terrified, was rushing out. On the other hand, Ho-young was calm. He nudged the ball with his left foot, passing it between the goalkeeper's legs. As the net shook immediately after, the stadium erupted. The commentators and both team coaches. Including the 60,000 spectators, among them two men who had placed a meaningless 20-euro bet. Everyone was astonished by Woo Ho-young's debut goal in the Champions League."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between propaganda and political cartoons?","completion":"Propaganda and political cartoons are both means of communication that convey messages, ideas, or commentary about political subjects or social issues, but they differ in purpose, method, and often in the level of subtlety and artistry involved. Propaganda: 1. **Purpose**: Its primary goal is to influence public opinion and promote a particular political agenda or ideology. Propaganda often seeks to persuade or manipulate viewers, readers, or listeners by presenting information in a biased or misleading way. 2. **Methods**: It can take many forms, including posters, films, speeches, news articles, social media posts, and more. Propaganda techniques include appeals to emotion, demonizing the enemy, presenting only one side of the argument, using loaded language, and repetition of key messages. 3. **Subtlety**: Propaganda is often overt in its approach, not shying away from being direct or one-sided in promoting its message. 4. **Artistry**: While propaganda can be creative and utilize artistic elements, it is more often focused on the message rather than the aesthetic or the intellectual merit of the work itself. Political Cartoons: 1. **Purpose**: Political cartoons aim to provide commentary or critique on political events, leaders, or policies. While they can be persuasive, they often function more as a form of satire or humor, intending to provoke thought or discussion. 2. **Methods**: Political cartoons are illustrative art forms that use caricature, symbolism, and humor to make a point. They typically appear in print or online media, such as newspapers, magazines, and websites. 3. **Subtlety**: They often employ a more nuanced and subtle approach, using visual metaphors and wit to convey complex issues. Political cartoons require the audience to interpret the message, which can have multiple layers of meaning. 4. **Artistry**: Artistic skill and cleverness are central to political cartoons, and the cartoonist's style is an important aspect of their work. The creativity and intelligence of a political cartoon are typically highly regarded. In summary, while both propaganda and political cartoons are used to comment on political and social issues, propaganda is usually a straightforward attempt to shape opinions and behaviors in a certain direction, often with little regard for presenting a balanced view. Political cartoons, on the other hand, operate through satire and caricature, inviting the audience to engage with and think critically about the subject matter."},{"prompt":"we received a debt notes , that we should transaction to return outwards journal or inwards journal ?","completion":"When you receive a debt note (often referred to as a credit note or debit note), how you record it in your accounting journals depends on whether it relates to a return of goods sold or goods purchased. 1. **Return Outwards Journal (Purchases Returns Journal):** - If the debt note is for goods you have returned to a supplier, perhaps because they were faulty or not as described, then the debt note would be recorded in the Return Outwards Journal. - This reduces your accounts payable since you would owe the supplier less due to the returned goods. 2. **Return Inwards Journal (Sales Returns Journal):** - Conversely, if the debt note is issued by your business to a customer, reflecting a return of goods they have purchased from you, then this transaction is recorded in the Return Inwards Journal. - This reduces your accounts receivable since the customer no longer owes you as much due to the return. To clarify, the Return Outwards and Return Inwards Journals are used to track goods returned to suppliers and goods returned by customers, respectively. They are not concerned with debt as a financial instrument (like loans or bonds), but rather with adjustments to payables and receivables due to product returns. So, if the debt note you received is related to returning goods you purchased (meaning an adjustment of what you owe to a supplier), then you should record it in the Return Outwards Journal. If, instead, you are issuing a debt note for goods a customer has returned, you would record it in the Return Inwards Journal."},{"prompt":"what general ledger function","completion":"The general ledger is a comprehensive set of accounts that provides a complete record of all financial transactions of a business over its life. Its function is critical to the accounting process, and it serves several key purposes: 1. **Recording Transactions:** The primary function of the general ledger is to record every financial transaction in the proper account. This includes all the company's business transactions, such as sales, purchases, payments, receipts, and adjustments. Each entry includes a date, description, and amount and indicates which accounts are affected. 2. **Organizing Financial Information:** The general ledger organizes financial data into different accounts, making it easier to manage and track specific types of transactions, such as revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity. 3. **Trial Balance Preparation:** The general ledger is used to prepare the trial balance at the end of an accounting period, ensuring that debits and credits are balanced. This is a crucial step toward producing accurate financial statements. 4. **Financial Statement Generation:** Information from the general ledger is used to generate key financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, and statement of equity. These statements are essential for analyzing the financial health of the business and for reporting to stakeholders. 5. **Maintaining Historical Records:** The general ledger serves as a permanent record of all financial transactions, making it possible to trace any financial event in the business's history for auditing and analysis purposes. 6. **Supporting Compliance and Audits:** The general ledger helps ensure regulatory compliance by providing a clear trail of all financial transactions, which is invaluable during audits. Auditors review the general ledger to verify the accuracy of the financial statements and ensure that the company follows accounting standards. 7. **Detailing Sub-Ledgers:** While the general ledger contains summary-level data, it is often supported by sub-ledgers (such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, fixed assets, etc.) that contain detailed transaction-level information. These sub-ledgers feed into the general ledger to provide comprehensive financial reporting. 8. **Internal Control:** Maintaining a general ledger helps establish internal controls within a company, as it separates the duties of accounting and bookkeeping and helps in the detection and prevention of errors or fraud. 9. **Budgeting and Forecasting:** By analyzing historical data in the general ledger, companies can better forecast future financial trends and prepare budgets that are more aligned with their economic realities. In short, the general ledger is a foundational component of any accounting system, and its functions are integral to maintaining accurate, organized, and useful financial records."},{"prompt":"Do you know such anime as Low Level Character Tomozaki kun?","completion":"Yes, \\"Low Level Character Tomozaki-kun\\" (also known as \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun\\" in Japanese) is a romantic comedy and life simulation anime based on a light novel series written by Yūki Yaku and illustrated by Fly. The story follows Fumiya Tomozaki, a high school student who is exceedingly skilled at video games, particularly a fictional one called \\"Atafami.\\" However, in real life, Tomozaki struggles with social interactions and considers the real world to be a poor game with unbalanced mechanics. His perspective starts to change when he meets Aoi Hinami, a popular and accomplished classmate. She excels in social situations and is also a gamer, though not as skilled as Tomozaki at \\"Atafami.\\" Aoi takes it upon herself to teach Tomozaki how to improve his social standing by treating his interactions as if they were part of a game, with strategies and objectives. Thus, the story delves into themes of self-improvement, social norms, and the struggles of adolescence. The anime was adapted into an animated television series by Project No.9 and aired from January to March 2021. The series received a generally positive reception from fans of the genre for its take on personal growth and the use of gaming as an allegory for life's challenges."},{"prompt":"Can you elaborate on the conflict between Aoi and Nanami? Why did this happen and is Nanami right? After all, Aoi displaced her from the ranking of the most popular girl in school and used Nanami’s idea in the student council elections.","completion":"In \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun\\" (Low Level Character Tomozaki-kun), characters Aoi Hinami and Minami Nanami, known as Mimimi, have a complex dynamic that revolves around their competition and rivalry in various aspects of high school life. The conflict between them is more nuanced than a straightforward rivalry for popularity. Aoi is depicted as nearly perfect in every regard: she is academically successful, good at sports, and charismatic. Mimimi, on the other hand, is also popular and competent, but she always seems to come in second behind Aoi. This persistent runner-up position becomes a source of pressure and frustration for Mimimi, contributing to the tension between them. The conflict is exacerbated by the student council elections. During the campaign, it's revealed that Aoi uses an initiative idea that Mimimi was planning to implement. Although it might appear as a strategic move on Aoi's part, this level of competition highlights the cutthroat nature of high school social dynamics and adds depth to the characters as they navigate their ambitions and desires. As for Mimimi being \\"right,\\" the situation is open to interpretation, as the narrative doesn't present a simple right or wrong perspective. It portrays a realistic depiction of how competition and desire for recognition can lead to conflicts, even among seemingly friendly peers. Viewers might empathize with Mimimi for feeling displaced and having her idea used by someone else, which are legitimate concerns. On the other hand, others might argue that Aoi is simply playing the game of high school politics efficiently, using her skills to achieve success. Ultimately, the anime presents these scenarios to explore themes of personal growth, ethical dilemmas in competition, and the complexities of human relationships. The story encourages viewers to consider multiple viewpoints and recognize that interpersonal conflicts can be multifaceted, without definitive answers as to who is right or wrong."},{"prompt":"It seems to me that Nanami is better than Aoi and Aoi is wrong towards Nanami.","completion":"It's entirely valid to feel sympathy for Nanami (Mimimi) and to believe that she may be a more likable character than Aoi Hinami, particularly if you relate to Mimimi's struggles and her position as an underdog. The dynamic between the two characters is designed to evoke complex emotions and to create a sense of rivalry that viewers can engage with. If you perceive that Aoi's actions toward Mimimi are unfair, especially in terms of using Mimimi's idea in the student council elections, this is a testament to the show's ability to present its characters as multi-dimensional and morally complex. It's common for viewers to take sides based on their interpretations of the characters' actions and motivations. In many narratives, especially those focused on high school life and competition, it's normal for audiences to root for characters who appear to face greater challenges or who exhibit traits they admire. It's also acceptable to criticize characters who seem to have an unfair advantage or who make decisions that negatively affect others. In the context of \\"Low Level Character Tomozaki-kun,\\" it's important to remember that the story is as much about personal growth as it is about competition. Each character has their own journey, and the interactions between them serve to illustrate various life lessons and the complexities of social interactions. The show encourages viewers to consider how the characters develop and change as a result of their experiences, and it illustrates that everyone has their own strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement."},{"prompt":"What was Nanami right when she said and realized that it is not necessary to be the most popular girl and that there will be elections to the student council next year.","completion":"Minami Nanami (Mimimi) reaching the realization that one does not necessarily need to be the most popular girl, and that there will be future opportunities, such as next year's student council elections, is a significant moment of character growth and maturity in \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun\\" (Low Level Character Tomozaki-kun). Her understanding that life isn't just about being at the top or winning every single time addresses an important life lesson about self-acceptance and long-term perspective. It showcases that she is learning to value herself beyond the immediate competition with Aoi Hinami. This insight reflects a healthier approach to both her self-esteem and her relationships with others, as she starts to prioritize her own well-being over the relentless pursuit of status. This realization also aligns with one of the recurring themes in many slice-of-life anime, which is the significance of personal growth over external achievements. By acknowledging that there will be more opportunities in the future, Mimimi demonstrates resilience and an ability to look forward with optimism rather than getting stuck on past setbacks. This kind of perspective can lead to a more fulfilling and balanced life. Thus, in the context of the story, Mimimi's realization and subsequent attitude can indeed be seen as \\"right\\" or at least a very positive development, as it signifies a mature and thoughtful approach to the ups and downs of high school life. It's a moment that likely resonates with many viewers and contributes to her development as a relatable and evolving character."},{"prompt":"what is a framework in programming","completion":"In programming, a framework is a pre-built collection of code that provides a foundation and a set of tools, libraries, and best practices to build upon for creating software applications. It serves to simplify the development process by offering standardized, modular, and reusable components that developers can use to implement certain features of their application more efficiently, rather than creating everything from scratch. Frameworks offer a structured way to organize code and can enforce a specific way to do things, which helps in maintaining consistency across different parts of an application and potentially across different projects. They typically follow design patterns and include features for: - Handling common tasks like database interaction, input/output processing, and session management. - Providing libraries for common operations such as encryption, data validation, and file system manipulation. - Implementing a set of rules for organizing code, known as architectural patterns, such as Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), or Model-View-Presenter (MVP). - Supporting development best practices that facilitate testing, maintenance, scalability, and security. Frameworks can exist for different programming languages and platforms, and they can be general-purpose or targeted at specific types of applications, like web development, mobile application development, desktop software, or data analytics. Popular examples of programming frameworks include: - Web Frameworks: Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), Laravel (PHP), Express (Node.js), and Angular, React, Vue.js (JavaScript). - Mobile Development Frameworks: React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, and Ionic. - Desktop Application Frameworks: Electron (for cross-platform desktop apps), .NET Framework (Windows applications), and Qt (for cross-platform C++ applications). By using a framework, developers can focus more on the unique aspects of their application rather than on foundational or repetitive coding tasks, which accelerates development time and can help maintain a higher level of quality through the use of proven constructs and patterns."},{"prompt":"Write me the code to move to unreal engine 5 in blueprints for a beginner if I don’t understand at all how to use unreal engine 5 in simple language","completion":"Moving to Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) doesn't require a specific code within Blueprints, as Blueprints are a visual scripting system used within the Unreal Engine itself to create game logic. If you want to \\"move\\" a project or start using UE5, you would essentially do the following: 1. Download & Install Unreal Engine 5: - Go to the Epic Games Launcher. - Navigate to the Unreal Engine tab. - Click the plus sign to add a version and select UE5 to download and install it. 2. Create a New UE5 Project: - Once installed, launch UE5 through the Epic Games Launcher. - Click on “New Project”. - Choose a template that suits your project needs (e.g., First-Person, Third-Person, etc.). - Set up your project settings (name, location, whether to include starter content, etc.). - Click “Create”. 3. Use Blueprints in UE5: - Open your project. - Go to the “Content Browser”. - Right-click in the content browser and navigate to “Blueprint Class” to create a new Blueprint. - Choose the appropriate parent class for what you want to do (e.g., Actor, Character, etc.). - Give your new Blueprint a name. - Double-click the Blueprint to open the Blueprint Editor. 4. Using Blueprint Nodes: - Once inside the Blueprint Editor, you will see graphs where you can create your game logic. - You will primarily use the “Event Graph” which is where you’ll wire/connect various nodes to create logic. - Drag wires from one node to another to \\"program\\" your Blueprint visual script (e.g., to move an object, you might use a \\"Set Actor Location\\" node). 5. Example of Moving an Actor: - Find the “Event Tick” node, which is executed every frame. - Drag from it and create a “Set Actor Location” node. - Create a \\"Vector + Vector\\" node and hook it to the \\"New Location\\" input of the \\"Set Actor Location\\" node to define how the actor moves. - Set the \\"Delta Seconds\\" from \\"Event Tick\\" to multiply with a \\"Vector\\" to define your speed and direction, and connect this to the \\"Vector + Vector\\" node. - Lastly, hook up your actor's current location to the other input of the \\"Vector + Vector\\" node. - Compile and save your Blueprint. Remember to compile and save your Blueprints after making changes to ensure everything is up-to-date. You can test your game logic by pressing the \\"Play\\" button in the UE5 toolbar. As a beginner, it's essential to spend time with basic tutorials and understand the UE interface and how Blueprints operate. The official Unreal Engine documentation and tutorials are an excellent place to start learning how to use Blueprints within UE5."},{"prompt":"The school nurse called to tell me that my 16 year old daughter has been \\"stuck on the pot\\" since after lunch time. She also said that she \\" gambled and lost\\" on something and needed pants. I'm not familiar with those expressions.","completion":"It sounds like the school nurse is using some informal expressions to convey the situation. Here's what they likely mean: 1. \\"Stuck on the pot\\" - This phrase usually means that someone is spending a long time on the toilet. In the context of your daughter, it suggests that she may be having some gastrointestinal distress or difficulty, leading to an extended bathroom visit. 2. \\"Gambled and lost\\" - This is a colloquial way of saying that someone took a risk and it didn't pay off. In the context of bathroom troubles, it often refers to a situation where a person thought they had to pass gas (the gamble) but instead experienced an accidental bowel movement or had incontinence (the loss). What the nurse is probably trying to say is that your daughter has been in the bathroom for a long time because she is having some sort of digestive issue, and at some point, she had an accident which necessitated a change of clothes. Your daughter will need a fresh pair of pants to be comfortable and to maintain her hygiene and dignity. It's a delicate way of handling an embarrassing situation for your daughter. It would be a good idea to bring or arrange for a change of clothes and possibly check in to see if she needs any further care or to be taken home."},{"prompt":"That explains why she was wearing goodnites when I picked her up.","completion":"It sounds like the situation at school warranted a protective undergarment like GoodNites, which are designed for older children and teenagers who experience incontinence or similar issues. The nurse or school officials likely provided her with GoodNites as a temporary solution to help her manage the rest of her day at school after the initial incident that required a change of pants. Incontinence can be a sensitive issue, especially for a teenager, and it can happen due to a variety of reasons including stress, infections, medications, or underlying health conditions. It may be beneficial to have a private and supportive conversation with your daughter to understand what happened, and if necessary, consult with a healthcare provider to determine if there is an underlying medical issue that needs to be addressed. Remember to approach the situation with empathy and reassurance, making sure your daughter knows that such incidents can happen to anyone and that her well-being is the most important priority."},{"prompt":"Why do we find diarrhea funny","completion":"The perception of humor is subjective and varies widely across individuals and cultures. However, there are several reasons why some people might find diarrhea or other bodily functions amusing: 1. Taboo and shock value: Humor often arises from the unexpected or from breaking social norms. Bathroom humor, including jokes about diarrhea, can be seen as funny because it violates the polite norms of society that are related to privacy and bodily functions. 2. Relief from discomfort: Talking about or making light of uncomfortable topics can be a coping mechanism. Laughing at something that might otherwise provoke anxiety or disgust can serve as a release valve for these feelings. 3. Childhood associations: As children, many people are taught that certain bodily functions are embarrassing or socially inappropriate. As a result, jokes about these topics can bring back a juvenile sense of humor that contrasts with the seriousness of adulthood. 4. Universality: Diarrhea and similar experiences are universal – everyone has dealt with them at some point. Humor often stems from shared experiences, and the commonality of these situations can make them a source of comedic material. 5. Schadenfreude: Sometimes, laughter arises from the misfortune of others, as long as it's perceived as non-threatening or non-serious. Hearing about someone else's embarrassing bodily mishap might be funny to some because it is a misfortune that is not happening to them. 6. Exaggeration and absurdity: Comedy often involves exaggeration or taking situations to absurd lengths. Scenarios involving diarrhea can be exaggerated to create humorous stories that play on the extremities of the situation. It's important to note that what is funny to one person may be offensive or unamusing to another. Humor is influenced by personality, culture, sensitivities, and context. While some people may find humor in bodily functions like diarrhea, others may not, and that's perfectly normal."},{"prompt":"как получить владельца widgetcomponent через widget в нём, unreal engine 4.27","completion":"Для того, чтобы получить владельца \`WidgetComponent\` через \`UWidget\`, который находится внутри этого компонента в Unreal Engine 4.27, вам нужно сделать следующее: 1. Убедитесь, что ваш виджет (допустим, это \`UUserWidget\`) правильно создан и добавлен в \`WidgetComponent\`. 2. Внутри вашего \`UUserWidget\`, создайте функцию для получения \`WidgetComponent\`, который содержит ваш виджет. Это можно сделать следующим образом: \`\`\`cpp UWidgetComponent* MyUserWidget::GetOwningWidgetComponent() const { // Эта функция возвращает UObject*, который является родительским объектом для виджета (если он есть). // Если этот виджет добавлен в WidgetComponent, то родительским объектом будет WidgetComponent. // Приведите его к типу UWidgetComponent*. return Cast<UWidgetComponent>(this->GetOuter()); } \`\`\` Или если вы хотите получить напрямую владельца (это может быть \`Actor\`): \`\`\`cpp AActor* MyUserWidget::GetOwningActor() const { // Сначала получаем WidgetComponent (если он есть) UWidgetComponent* WidgetComp = GetOwningWidgetComponent(); // Теперь, если WidgetComponent найден, мы можем получить владельца компонента, который обычно является Actor return WidgetComp ? WidgetComp->GetOwner() : nullptr; } \`\`\` 3. Теперь вы можете вызвать эту функцию из любого места в вашем \`UUserWidget\`, чтобы получить ссылку на \`UWidgetComponent\` или на его владельца – \`AActor\`. Важно помнить, что сценарии использования могут варьироваться, и вам возможно потребуется проверить на null или делать другие проверки на валидность, чтобы убедиться, что компонент или актёр действительно существуют, прежде чем использовать полученные ссылки в вашей логике. Обратите внимание, что это способ получить ссылку на компонент владельца из виджета, который он содержит, и это не всегда лучшая практика в плане архитектуры программного обеспечения. Хорошим тоном считается минимизация прямой зависимости между виджетами и владельцами, чтобы позволить более гибкую и менее связанную архитектуру. Вместо этого рассмотрите использование делегатов, событий или интерфейсов для коммуникации между виджетами и владельцами."},{"prompt":"в blueprint?","completion":"В Unreal Engine 4 Blueprint системе для получения владельца \`WidgetComponent\` через \`UWidget\` в нём вы можете следовать такой инструкции: 1. Откройте ваш \`UUserWidget\` Blueprint. 2. Внутри Blueprint виджета найдите функцию (или создайте новую), в которой вы хотите получить \`WidgetComponent\`. 3. В редакторе Blueprint, для получения ссылки на \`WidgetComponent\`, используйте ноду \`Get Parent\`: - Добавьте ноду \`Get Parent\` и выходной пин подключите к ноде \`Cast To WidgetComponent\`. 4. После того как вы получите \`WidgetComponent\`, вы сможете получить владельца компонента (который, как правило, является \`Actor\`), используя ноду \`Get Owner\`: - Выходной пин из \`Cast To WidgetComponent\` подключите к \`Get Owner\`. 5. Теперь у вас есть ссылка на владельца компонента, и вы можете использовать эту ссылку в Blueprint, чтобы взаимодействовать с ним. Давайте уточним каждый шаг в более детальной последовательности действий в Blueprint редакторе: 1. Откройте Blueprint вашего виджета \`UUserWidget\`. 2.

However, Unreal Engine provides a robust set of tools and components to make this process easier. For a complete beginner, it is recommended to first get familiar with the Unreal Engine interface, the concept of Blueprints (Unreal's visual scripting system), and basic game development concepts. Assuming you are completely new to Unreal Engine, I will guide you through the steps to set up basic WASD movement and running in an Unreal Engine 5 project, using Blueprints. Step-by-Step Guide for Character Movement in Unreal Engine 5: 1. **Create a New Third-Person Project:** - Open the Epic Games Launcher. - Click on the 'Unreal Engine' tab and then select 'Launch' for Unreal Engine 5. - Choose 'Games' under New Project Categories. - Select the 'Third Person' template and click 'Next'. - Choose a project name, location, and ensure Blueprints is selected. Then click 'Create Project'. 2. **Open the Character Blueprint:** - In the Content Browser located at the bottom of the screen, navigate to your project's content folder. - Find the 'Blueprints' folder then open the character blueprint, generally called \`ThirdPersonCharacter\` or something similar. 3. **Edit the Character Blueprint for Movement:** - With the blueprint open, look for the Event Graph, which is where you will define how your character reacts to input. - You should see nodes for handling movement already (created by the template), such as 'InputAxis MoveForward' and 'InputAxis MoveRight'. 4. **Adjust the Walking Speed:** - Click on the 'CharacterMovement' component in the Components tab, and in the Details pane, find the section titled 'Movement'. - Adjust the 'Max Walk Speed' property to change how fast your character walks by default. 5. **Add a Run Input Action:** - Go to Edit -> Project Settings. - Under the 'Engine' section, select 'Input'. - Find the 'Action Mappings' section, click the plus icon to create a new action, and name it 'Run'. - Assign a key to the 'Run' action, such as 'Left Shift'. 6. **Implement Running in the Blueprint:** - Return to your character blueprint. - Right-click in the Event Graph and search for the 'Run' action event you just created. - When the 'Run' action is pressed, you want to increase the Max Walk Speed. You can achieve this by getting a reference of the CharacterMovement and use the 'Set Max Walk Speed' node with a higher value. - When the 'Run' action is released (when you stop holding the key), reset the Max Walk Speed to its original value. Here's a simple blueprint setup that could handle running: \`\`\`plaintext Event Run -> Pressed -> Set Max Walk Speed (e.g., 1200) | CharacterMovement Component Reference | Event Run -> Released -> Set Max Walk Speed (e.g., 600) | CharacterMovement Component Reference \`\`\` 7. **Compile and Save the Blueprint:** - After making your changes, click the 'Compile' button followed by the 'Save' button. 8. **Testing Your Character:** - Close the blueprint and press the 'Play' button within the Unreal Editor to test your character. - Use WASD for movement, and hold 'Left Shift' to run. This code uses visual scripting through Blueprints and provides a basic functionality for walking, jumping, and running. I would highly encourage exploring Unreal Engine's extensive documentation and tutorial content to understand these concepts deeply and learn the more advanced aspects of character movement."},{"prompt":"Where does the phrase \\"you slumber a cucumber\\" originate from?","completion":"The phrase \\"you slumber a cucumber\\" appears to be a playful, nonsensical rhyme rather than a well-known idiom or saying with a specific origin. It seems to simply pair the word \\"slumber,\\" meaning to sleep, with \\"cucumber,\\" merely for the sake of rhyming and perhaps to suggest a state of being cool and collected even while sleeping—playing off the phrase \\"cool as a cucumber,\\" which means to remain calm and unemotional. If \\"you slumber a cucumber\\" has been popularized by a specific subculture, a piece of media, or an individual with an online following, it could be a more recent development that hasn't been widely documented or recognized in mainstream sources. In such cases, the origin and context can be difficult to trace without specific reference points. If the phrase comes from a particular book, show, song, or meme, it may not have significant historical background other than its creation by the author, songwriter, or content creator. Since it's not a widely recognized or historically established phrase, it might not be available in standard reference materials or linguistic databases.

Il sistema può tracciare l'orario di partenza di un treno da una stazione e inoltrare queste informazioni alle stazioni successive. Il Treno inoltre fornisce informazioni sugli orari dei treni in tempo reale a diverse applicazioni client sottoscritte. Questo sistema di tracciamento prevede che inizialmente un Admin inserisca l’orario stagionale dei treni che comprende tutti i dettagli rilevanti sui treni e i loro orari di arrivo e partenza dalle diverse stazioni. Il sistema controlla che tutte le stazioni abbiano la capienza necessaria ad ospitare tutti i treni in sosta, altrimenti segnala il problema per chiedere una modifica all’orario. Inoltre, gli amministratori possono aggiungere informazioni temporanee come: treni speciali, treni soppressi o fermate cancellate per lavori sulla linea. Fra i dettagli rilevanti sui treni occorre tener conto del codice identificativo univoco, dello stato (in manutenzione o in servizio), della tipologia (Frecce, Intercity e Intercity Notte), del numero vagoni, della capienza passeggeri. Fra i dettagli per ogni viaggio di ciascun treno occorre conoscere la partenza e la destinazione con gli orari programmati e quelli effettivi, nonché le stazioni intermedie con i tempi di sosta e gli eventuali ritardi/anticipi. L’arrivo e la partenza di un treno da una stazione sono segnalati dal capostazione e verificati interrogando opportuni sensori sui binari. Se il sistema identifica un ritardo nella partenza di un treno da una stazione, trasmette l'informazione alle stazioni successive. Una volta che la stazione successiva riceve questi dati, valuta se cambiare binario, seleziona automaticamente i dati associati a quella fermata di quel treno e li visualizza sullo schermo per gli utenti. Inoltre memorizza ritardo ed eventuale nuovo binario per interrogazioni via web e informa le applicazioni client sottoscritte., Quando i ritardi superano una certa soglia che dipende dalla tipologia del treno, il sistema deve memorizzare un’indennità: sono previste indennità per ritardi compresi, ad esempio, tra 30 e 59 minuti per le Frecce e indennità per ritardo superiore, per esempio, ai 59 minuti per i treni Frecce, Intercity e Intercity Notte.

Per creare un modello ER per il sistema di monitoraggio ferroviario descritto, bisogna identificare le entità principali, i loro attributi e le relazioni tra di loro. Entità e Attributi: 1. Treno - Codice identificativo (PK) - Stato (es. in manutenzione, in servizio) - Tipologia (Frecce, Intercity, Intercity Notte) - Numero vagoni - Capienza passeggeri 2. Stazione - ID stazione (PK) - Nome - Numero binari 3.

Fermata intermedia - ID fermata (PK) - ID viaggio (FK) - ID stazione (FK) - Orario programmato arrivo/partenza - Orario effettivo arrivo/partenza - Tempistica sosta - Eventuali ritardi/anticipi 5. Indennità - ID indennità (PK) - ID viaggio (FK) - Fascia di ritardo - Importo indennità - Condizioni (es. 30-59 minuti, > 59 minuti) Relazioni: - Un treno può effettuare molti viaggi, ma un viaggio appartiene a un solo treno. - Una stazione è punto di partenza e di arrivo per molti viaggi. - Ogni viaggio ha una o più fermate intermedie. - Un viaggio può avere una o più record di indennità associate a esso. Gestione delle Indennità: La gestione delle indennità comporta l'uso di regole di business per determinare quanto rimborsare ai passeggeri in caso di ritardo. Il sistema dovrà monitorare gli orari effettivi e, a fronte di un ritardo, attribuire una indennità secondo le regole definite. Per implementare ciò nel database, si può programmare la logica applicativa affinché al verificarsi di un ritardo: 1. Il sistema calcoli la durata del ritardo confrontando l'orario programmato con l'orario effettivo di arrivo. 2. Si utilizzi una tabella o un set di regole predefinite che mappano l'intervallo di ritardo con l'ammontare dell'indennità. 3. Si crei un record nella tabella \\"Indennità\\" con i dettagli relativi al viaggio e all'importo dell'indennità basati sulle fasce di ritardo. Il sistema dovrà anche tenere traccia dello storico delle indennità per ogni tipo di treno e per ogni fascia oraria, permettendo analisi aggiuntive e reportistica. Inoltre, è importante che il sistema tenga conto delle discrepanze e delle eccezioni, come treni speciali o cancellazioni non previste nei normali orari che potrebbero influenzare il calcolo delle indennità. Queste sono solo le basi di come potresti strutturare il modello ER e gestire le indennità per il sistema di monitoraggio ferroviario. Implementare queste funzionalità richiederebbe ulteriore sviluppo e adattamenti basati sulle regole specifiche, normative e requisiti tecnici."},{"prompt":"perchè un viaggio può avere una o più indennità?","completion":"Mi scuso per l'equivoco precedente. In genere, potremmo aspettarci che un viaggio abbia al massimo una indennità per passeggero in caso di ritardo, determinata in base alla durata di detto ritardo. Tuttavia, nell'interpretazione del sistema che ho fornito, la possibilità che un viaggio possa avere più record di indennità potrebbe essere attribuita al fatto che: 1. Sono presenti diversi tipi di indennità a seconda delle condizioni di viaggio, per esempio, indennità base per ritardi modesti e indennità maggiorate per ritardi estesi. 2. Le indennità possono essere calcolate in momenti diversi o per diversi segmenti del viaggio, specialmente se un viaggio implica più stazioni intermedie e ogni segmento fra le stazioni ha un ritardo sufficiente a giustificare una propria indennità. 3. La gestione delle indennità potrebbe essere differenziata a seconda del tipo di biglietto o servizio offerto all'interno dello stesso viaggio. 4. Si potrebbero avere aggiornamenti sullo stato di indennizzo per un viaggio, che generano più record di modifiche o aggiunte rispetto all'indennità originale. 5. Si vogliono tenere traccia delle indennità in maniera dettagliata, per esempio separando le indennità pagate per ritardi dalle compensazioni per altri disservizi. Tuttavia, nel contesto reale di un sistema di monitoraggio ferroviario, è più probabile che ci sia una singola indennità determinata per ogni viaggio in caso di ritardo che attraversi una certa soglia. La descrizione potrebbe riferirsi a una singola indennità per viaggio, e nel caso di ritardi ripetuti in diversi segmenti dello stesso viaggio, questa indennità sarebbe calcolata in base al ritardo totale accumulato nel punto di arrivo finale. Per correggere l'equivoco, la relazione tra \\"Viaggio\\" e \\"Indennità\\" dovrebbe essere uno a uno o uno a molti, a seconda della politica della compagnia ferroviaria, ma solitamente ci si aspetta una relazione uno a uno (un viaggio - una potenziale indennità)."},{"prompt":"The babysitter told mey daughter \\"really packed her pamps\\" tonight. Before she fell asleep. I don't know what that means and I didn't ask.","completion":"It sounds like the babysitter used a playful or colloquial expression when saying your daughter \\"really packed her pamps\\" before falling asleep. This isn't a standard saying, so its meaning isn't immediately clear, but we can make an educated guess. \\"Pamps\\" isn't a widely recognized word in English, but it's possible that it could be a shortening or cute slang for 'pajamas' (sometimes abbreviated as 'pjs' or 'jammies'). If that's the case, the babysitter might have meant that your daughter got very cozy or bundled up in her pajamas before going to sleep. Alternatively, if your daughter is still using diapers or pull-ups (sometimes referred to as \\"pampers,\\" a popular brand), \\"packed her pamps\\" might mean that she wet or soiled her diaper thoroughly before sleep.

Verify that the entered user (\`'root'\`) and password (\`'Nikki@1234'\`) are correct for connecting to the MySQL server. 4. Check that the MySQL server is configured to allow connections from your Python environment (e.g., the root user has privileges from localhost). Provided there are no issues with the database setup, your application should successfully fetch PR (Purchase Request) details and display live updates of the pie chart with the current status distribution from the \`'PR_Details'\` table every 5 seconds. Just to recap, here's the flow of the app: 1. The **PR Details** tab has a textbox to input a PR Number and radio buttons to select the status. Clicking the \\"Fetch PR Details\\" button calls \`fetch_details\`, which in turn calls \`fetch_data\` to query the database and display the results. A \\"Clear\\" button resets the inputs to their default values. 2. The **Live Pie Chart** tab shows a pie chart updated every 5 seconds with the distribution of \`'Current_Status'\` from the \`'PR_Details'\` table, using the \`plot_pie_chart\` function. If she's not doing it already, it's a good practice to store passwords securely rather than hard-coding them into scripts. Consider using environment variables or a configuration file that is not included in version control. Also, ensure to handle any sensitive information (such as database passwords) securely in production applications.

Check the console or terminal for any error messages printed out. 3. **Query Result Issue**: The query might be executing correctly, but there might be an issue with how the data is being handled in the code. For example, if the 'Current_Status' column has \`NULL\` values, or if there are data type issues that prevent the proper generation of the labels and sizes lists. 4. **Matplotlib Issue**: There might be a problem with how the pie chart is being generated with matplotlib. This might include issues with the library itself or the data being passed to it. Here are some steps you can take to debug and fix the issue: - **Check for Data in the Database**: Access the MySQL database using a tool like MySQL Workbench or command-line and run the query: \`\`\`sql SELECT Current_Status, COUNT(Current_Status) FROM PR_Details GROUP BY Current_Status \`\`\` Verify that there are records and that 'Current_Status' column has a variety of different statuses. - **Check for Errors**: Make sure your application logs any errors to the console. When you run your Gradio app, look for error messages in the console where you started the app. This can tell you if there's an issue with the database connection or query execution. - **Verify Matplotlib Output**: Instead of returning the pie chart generated by matplotlib, you can try saving the figure to a file to ensure that the pie chart is being generated properly: \`\`\`python plt.savefig('pie_chart_test.png') # Save the pie chart to a file \`\`\` After running the app and triggering the pie chart update, check if the 'pie_chart_test.png' file is being created and if it contains the expected pie chart. - **Test the Matplotlib Plot Separately**: Create a separate Python script to run only the matplotlib section of your code with some test data to ensure that pie charts are being generated correctly by matplotlib. - **Check for Frontend Updates**: Ensure that your Gradio frontend (in the browser) is not caching an old version of the app and is indeed trying to update the pie chart every 5 seconds. After performing these checks and any necessary debugging, you should be able to pinpoint and address the issue causing the pie chart to remain empty."},{"prompt":"The pie chart should show the no of PR_Number which are in submitted, ordered and in composing status from pr_details table.","completion":"The \`plot_pie_chart\` function in your code is designed to count the number of \`PR_Number\` records that are in different \`Current_Status\` categories from the \`pr_details\` table and generate a pie chart to visualize this distribution.

The statuses 'Submitted', 'Ordered', and 'Composing' should also match the actual values in the \`STATUS\` column. 3. Check the connection details: Confirm that the MySQL instance is accessible using the given host address, username, and password. 4. Analyze any errors: Look at any error output in the console as it may give you information about what might be going wrong. 5. Ensure your MySQL service is running: If your MySQL server isn't running, you will not be able to connect to it. With these points checked, your code should function correctly.

Однако среди многочисленных технологических достижений ДВС оказали значительное влияние на экологическое состояние планеты. Выбросы, производимые миллионами автомобилей, кораблей, самолётов и стационарных энергетических установок, привели к ухудшению качества воздуха, изменению климата и деградации экосистем. Дилемма, с которой сталкивается мировое сообщество, состоит в том, чтобы сбалансировать потребность в мобильности и энергии с потребностью сохранения окружающей среды для будущих поколений. 1.2 Цели и задачи исследования Основной целью данной диссертации является всесторонний анализ экологического воздействия, исходящего от ДВС, и оценка потенциала существующих и разрабатываемых технологий для снижения этого воздействия. Для достижения поставленной цели определены следующие задачи исследования: - Выделить и систематизировать основные источники загрязнений, связанных с эксплуатацией ДВС. - Оценить масштаб и последствия экологического ущерба, наносимого ДВС. - Рассмотреть роль международных и национальных законодательных инициатив в регулировании выбросов ДВС. - Проанализировать существующие и перспективные альтернативные технологии силовых установок. - Изучить успешные практики и подходы к снижению вредных воздействий ДВС на экосистемы. 1.3 Методология Методология исследования будет сочетать как качественные, так и количественные методы. Качественный анализ будет включать обзор литературы, анализ законодательства и политик, а также кейс-стади успешных проектов. Количественные методы будут включать сбор и обработку данных о выбросах, эффективности различных технологий и экономической оценки экосистемных ущербов. Исследование будет также использовать моделирование для прогнозирования последствий и анализа возможных путей развития ситуации.

Deathstroke - один из самых опасных наемников и ассасинов в мире DC. Он обладает сверхчеловеческими способностями, которые делают его невероятно сильным, быстрым, ловким и позволяют ему быстро восстанавливаться после травм. Он также является тактическим гением и мастерским стратегом. Его военный опыт и обширное обучение в различных видах рукопашного боя и использовании оружия делают его чрезвычайно опасным соперником в бою. Nightwing, с другой стороны, известен своей гимнастикой, атлетизмом и исключительными навыками борьбы. Он был первым Робином и длительное время обучался у Бэтмена, получив широкий спектр детективных навыков, техники скрытности, а также мастерство боя. Хотя Грейсон не обладает сверхчеловеческими способностями, он является одним из самых талантливых бойцов во вселенной DC, умеющим использовать свои навыки и интеллект для победы над соперниками, физически превосходящими его. В прямой дуэли сильнее и более опытен в бою, вероятно, будет Deathstroke, учитывая его сверхчеловеческие способности и дополнительный опыт в военных конфликтах. Однако Nightwing использовал свои способности, чтобы выдерживать сражения с более мощными противниками, и не раз он сталкивался с Deathstroke, демонстрируя крайнюю изобретательность и понимание слабостей своего врага. Это говорит о том, что, хотя Слейд может быть сильнее, Дик может использовать свои навыки и интеллект, чтобы выровнять шансы."},{"prompt":"иначе говоря скорее всего победит Deathstroke но у Nightwing есть шанс уравнять счёт?","completion":"Да, именно так. В предположительном поединке между Deathstroke и Nightwing, Deathstroke обладает физическим преимуществом благодаря своим сверхчеловеческим способностям и обширному опыту в бою. Однако Nightwing известен своим интеллектом, стратегическим мышлением и чудовищной гибкостью, а также подготовкой, полученной от Бэтмена – персонажа, который славится своей способностью побеждать более могущественных противников. Nightwing использует свои навыки, чтобы преодолевать превосходство соперника в силе и стойкости. Это значит, что в схватке Nightwing будет полагаться на свои боевые стратегии, скорость и ловкость, чтобы маневрировать и эксплуатировать любые потенциальные слабости в Deathstroke. В комиксах они неоднократно сражались друг с другом, и исход боев зачастую менялся в зависимости от обстоятельств и контекста сюжета. Конечный исход любого боя между ними, таким образом, часто зависит не только от силы и навыков персонажей, но и от творческого замысла писателей и художников комиксов."},{"prompt":"how can i use neovim plugin \\"code_runner\\" for html?","completion":"The \\"code_runner\\" NeoVim plugin is designed to run code from various programming languages directly within the NeoVim editor. However, HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, so you can't \\"run\\" HTML code in the same way you would run a script or a program. Typically, you would want to view HTML in a web browser to see the page rendered as it would appear on a website. If you'd like to automatically open your HTML files in a web browser, you can still use a plugin like \\"code_runner\\" or set up a custom command in NeoVim to open your current buffer in a web browser. Assuming you're using Unix-like systems, you might want to use a command line utility like \`open\` (on macOS) or \`xdg-open\` (on Linux) to open files with the default application. On Windows, you can just use \`start\`. Below is a basic example of how you could set up a custom NeoVim command to open an HTML file in your default browser: \`\`\`vim \\" Place this in your init.vim or appropriate configuration file \\" Custom command to open HTML files in a browser command! RunHtml :execute '!xdg-open %' \\" Alternatively, you can use the following for macOS \\" command! RunHtml :execute '!open %' \\" Or this for Windows \\" command! RunHtml :execute '!start %' \`\`\` Replace \`xdg-open\`, \`open\`, or \`start\` with the appropriate command for your operating system. This command allows you to run \`:RunHtml\` while editing an HTML file in NeoVim to open it in your default web browser. If you prefer to use a plugin like \\"code_runner,\\" you may need to configure it to recognize HTML files and launch a browser. The specifics will depend on how the plugin is set up and its documentation or configuration options. Check the plugin's README or documentation for how to configure custom commands, and set one up that uses \`xdg-open\`, \`open\`, or \`start\` (as above) to handle HTML files. While it's good practice to have your editor set up in a way that supports your workflow, remember that viewing HTML typically means refreshing your browser to see changes. Some developers prefer using tools like live server extensions in their browsers or integrating their development environment with browser-sync capabilities."},{"prompt":"how to run html files in lunarvim","completion":"LunarVim is a configuration framework for NeoVim that aims to provide an IDE-like experience.

' .. command) end \`\`\` 3. After defining the function, create a new LunarVim command associated with it: \`\`\`lua lvim.api.nvim_create_user_command('OpenInBrowser', open_in_browser, {}) \`\`\` 4. Save the \`config.lua\` file and restart LunarVim. After setting this up, you can open HTML files in your default web browser directly from LunarVim by issuing the command \`:OpenInBrowser\` in normal mode. Please note that the LunarVim API and configuration may change over time, so be sure to consult the LunarVim documentation or source for the most up-to-date information on configuring commands."},{"prompt":"does xdg-open would work if i use sway?","completion":"\`xdg-open\` is a desktop-independent tool that is used to open a file or URL in the user's preferred application. It works in conjunction with the MIME type system to determine which application to use for a given file or URL. If you are using Sway, which is a Wayland compositor and a drop-in replacement for the i3 window manager for X11, \`xdg-open\` will still generally work. However, whether \`xdg-open\` will work as expected can depend on the desktop environment, and the mimeapps.list configuration it uses, as Sway is a window manager and not a complete desktop environment. Some desktop environments provide their own implementations and might perform additional tasks to integrate better with specific desktops. For Sway or environments that don't provide a full-featured \`xdg-open\` implementation, you might need to ensure that \`xdg-utils\` is installed and properly configured to handle URLs and files with your preferred applications. Furthermore, Sway and other Wayland compositors make use of \`xdg-desktop-portal\` implementations (like \`xdg-desktop-portal-wlr\` for wlroots-based compositors like Sway) to provide desktop integration features. These are used by \`xdg-open\` to facilitate opening files and URLs in a way that respects user preferences and Wayland security practices. You should verify that you have \`xdg-desktop-portal\` and an appropriate backend (like \`xdg-desktop-portal-gtk\` or \`xdg-desktop-portal-kde\`) installed and correctly configured for your specific environment to ensure smooth operation with \`xdg-open\`. Therefore, while \`xdg-open\` is expected to be desktop environment agnostic, for best results with Sway or any other environment, you may need to set up proper MIME type associations and install the necessary desktop-portal backends."},{"prompt":"how about alternatives of xdg-open?","completion":"If you're using Sway or another Wayland-based compositor and looking for alternatives to \`xdg-open\`, there are a few options that you can consider. Here is a list of some alternatives: 1. **mimeopen**: A part of the \`perl-file-mimeinfo\` package, \`mimeopen\` is a similar utility to \`xdg-open\` but allows you to choose an application when there is more than one that can handle a specific MIME type. Usage example: \`\`\`sh mimeopen -d your-file.html \`\`\` This will let you choose which application to use if there's more than one that can handle HTML files. 2. **wofi** or **bemenu**: While tools like \`wofi\` or \`bemenu\` are not direct replacements for \`xdg-open\`, they are often used in conjunction with window managers like Sway for launching applications. You can create a script to use \`wofi\` or \`bemenu\` to list and select a web browser and then open the HTML file in that browser. 3. **gio** (\`GIO\`): The \`gio\` command (part of the Glib) opens files like \`xdg-open\` but uses Gnome's libraries to do so. While it's more dependent on the GNOME ecosystem, it can still be used in a variety of environments, including Sway. Usage example: \`\`\`sh gio open your-file.html \`\`\` 4. Custom script: You can write a custom script that opens URLs or files with your desired application directly. For example, you can specify that HTML files should be opened with Firefox, Chrome, or any other web browser. Example script: \`\`\`sh #!/bin/bash firefox \\"1\\" & disown \`\`\` Save this script as \`open-with-firefox.sh\` and grant it execute permissions. Then execute it with the path to the HTML file as an argument. It's important to remember that the effectiveness of these alternatives may vary depending on your specific system configuration and what other supporting utilities are installed. For the best user experience, especially when using light-weight or minimal window managers like Sway, some additional configuration or scripting may be required to replicate the full functionality of a desktop environment's file opening capabilities."},{"prompt":"how to choose default application for mimeopen?","completion":"\`mimeopen\` is a command-line utility included in the \`perl-file-mimeinfo\` package, and it provides a prompt for the user to select a default application for a given MIME type. You can set the default application interactively by using the \`-d\` option followed by the file for which you want to set the default application. Here is a step-by-step guide to set a default application using \`mimeopen\`: 1. **Open a Terminal.** 2. **Run \`mimeopen\` with the \`-d\` option followed by a file of the type you wish to set.** For example, to set a default application for HTML files, you might do the following: \`\`\`sh mimeopen -d your-file.html \`\`\` or for setting the default browser without specifying a file: \`\`\`sh mimeopen -d x-scheme-handler/http \`\`\` 3. **Select from the list of available applications.** When running the command, \`mimeopen\` will present a list of applications that can open that file type. The list will look something like this: \`\`\`plaintext Please choose a default application for files of type text/html 1) Firefox 2) Chrome 3) Other... use application # \`\`\` 4. **Choose the application.** You can select the default application by typing the number corresponding to the application you want to set as default and pressing Enter. If you select \\"Other...\\", \`mimeopen\` will allow you to enter a custom command to open the file type. 5. **Confirm the selection.** After you've made your choice, \`mimeopen\` may ask you to confirm. Once confirmed, the selected application will be set as the default for the particular MIME type. The MIME type associations are typically stored in a file called \`~/.config/mimeapps.list\` or \`~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\`, depending on the system. After you've set your defaults with \`mimeopen\`, this file will be updated accordingly. Please note that the availability and behavior of \`mimeopen\` may vary depending on your Linux distribution and desktop environment. Some desktop environments have their own MIME configuration tools that may override these settings, so it is always a good idea to consult the documentation specific to your environment for the most accurate information."},{"prompt":"ok, how i can use mimeopen with lunarvim?","completion":"To use \`mimeopen\` within LunarVim, you would typically use it as an external command, just like you would in a regular terminal session. However, since you're looking to integrate it into your development workflow, you might want to create a custom command or key binding in LunarVim to quickly open files using \`mimeopen\`. Below are the steps to set up a custom command in LunarVim for using \`mimeopen\`: 1. **Access LunarVim's Configuration:** Open your LunarVim configuration file using the command \`lvim\` to open LunarVim and then \`:e ~/.config/lvim/config.lua\` to edit the configuration file. 2. **Define a Lua Function:** Create a new Lua function in \`config.lua\` that will run \`mimeopen\` on the currently open file in the buffer. Here is a simple example function to add: \`\`\`lua local function open_with_mimeopen() local file_path = vim.fn.expand('%') -- You can provide the '-d' flag if you want to select the default application again vim.api.nvim_command('silent !mimeopen ' .. file_path) end \`\`\` 3. **Add the Lua Function to LunarVim Commands:** Register your new function with a LunarVim command by adding the following line within the \`config.lua\` file: \`\`\`lua lvim.api.nvim_create_user_command('MimeOpen', open_with_mimeopen, {}) \`\`\` 4. **Save the Configuration File:** After making the changes, save \`config.lua\` with \`:w\`. 5. **Restart LunarVim:** To apply the changes, restart LunarVim. Once you have set this up, you can use the command \`:MimeOpen\` in LunarVim to open the currently edited file in its default application according to the MIME type. If you often open the same type of file and don't want to choose the default application each time, you can omit the \`-d\` option from the \`mimeopen\` command in the Lua function. If you would prefer a keyboard shortcut instead of a command, you could add a mapping to your \`config.lua\`. For example, you might add: \`\`\`lua vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>mo', '<cmd>MimeOpen<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true }) \`\`\` This adds a normal mode mapping to your leader key followed by 'mo' that triggers the \`:MimeOpen\` command. Adjust the key sequence \`<leader>mo\` to whatever you prefer for your workflow. Please make sure that \`mimeopen\` is already installed and properly configured before using it in LunarVim. Otherwise, the utility may not work as expected."},{"prompt":"PHẦN III: KẾT LUẬN VÀ KIẾN NGHỊ GIẢI PHÁP I. Kết luận II. Giải pháp giải quyết vấn đề tình yêu đôi lứa đối với sinh viên: 1.

Les soldats ne feraient pas la différence entre des rapports sexuels librement consentis et ce qui relève de la contrainte. L’ONU n’a pas fini de se débattre contre les scandales sexuels. Les abus commis par les Casques bleus seraient sous-estimés, selon un rapport dont l’Associated Press (AP) a obtenu la copie. Le document émane de l’office d’audit interne de l’ONU (OIOS), basé à New York. L’an dernier, les enquêteurs onusiens ont interrogé 231 personnes rien qu’en Haïti qui ont révélé avoir été contraintes à des actes sexuels pour obtenir de l’argent, de la nourriture ou des médicaments. On ignore quand les faits commis en Haïti se sont produits et sur quelle période. L’ONU assurait encore récemment que le nombre de Casques bleus soupçonnés d’abus sexuels était en recul. Le dernier rapport du secrétaire général Ban Ki-moon fait état de 51 cas en 2014, contre 66 l’année précédente. Pas de distinction « En cas de non-paiement, certaines femmes gardaient les badges des Casques bleus ou menaçaient de révéler leur infidélité sur les réseaux sociaux», rapporte l’AP à la lecture de ce rapport. Les enquêteurs de l’ONU se sont rendus en Haïti, mais trois autres missions seraient tout aussi touchées: celles en République démocratique du Congo, au Liberia et au Soudan du Sud. Plus d’un tiers des cas concerneraient des mineurs. Toujours selon l’AP, le rapport fait état d’une confusion des soldats déployés en Haïti. Ils ne verraient pas la différence entre des rapports sexuels librement consentis avec la population locale, déconseillés mais tolérés par l’ONU, et ce qui relève de la contrainte. Depuis les révélations fin avril sur des faits similaires commis en 2014 par des soldats français contre des enfants dans un camp de déplacés en Centrafrique, et la suspension d’Anders Kompass, un haut fonctionnaire de l’ONU à l’origine de l’affaire, l’organisation est soupçonnée de couvrir ces abus. Elle a en effet toutes les peines du monde à trouver des pays prêts à fournir des contingents militaires pour les opérations de maintien de la paix, qui se sont multipliées ces dernières années. Près de 125 000 Casques bleus sont actuellement déployés dans 16 pays en conflit. Les premiers pourvoyeurs de troupes sont le Pakistan, le Bangladesh et l’Ethiopie. La semaine dernière, la mission des Nations unies en Centrafrique a annoncé qu’elle avait ouvert une enquête contre un Casque bleu soupçonné d’abus sexuel sur un mineur dans l’est du pays. Pour couper court aux critiques, l’ONU a cette fois décidé de rendre ce cas public, plutôt que d’alerter confidentiellement l’Etat concerné, comme cela avait été le cas avec la France. La nationalité de l’auteur présumé n’a toutefois pas été révélée, mais l’ONU a appelé le gouvernement concerné à engager des poursuites contre son soldat. Les Casques bleus ont beau opérer sous commandement onusien, il appartient aux pays de traduire en justice leurs ressortissants. C’est tout le problème. La justice de certains Etats est peu empressée de s’en prendre à des militaires.S’agissant de la Centrafrique, la justice française avait ouvert une enquête dès l’été 2014, mais elle s’est enlisée. Quant à l’ONU, elle a préféré ne pas dénoncer publiquement cette affaire pour ne pas compromettre les efforts des enquêteurs. « Dans la plupart des cas, c’est l’ONU elle-même qui relaie les accusations d’abus sexuel contre son propre personnel auprès des autorités nationales compétentes. Ces crimes sont encore plus répugnants quand ils sont commis contre des enfants et par les soldats justement envoyés pour les protéger », s’est défendu le Français Hervé Ladsous, le chef des opérations de maintien de la paix, dans une lettre publiée par le New York Times le 29 mai dernier. Anders Kompass accuse le même Ladsous d’avoir réclamé sa tête, ce qu’a toujours contesté l’intéressé. Le 3 juin, Ban Ki-moon a lancé une enquête interne sur la gestion de toute cette affaire par l’ONU.","completion":"• Type d'article : Le texte semble être un mélange d'article factuel et d'exposé d'enquête, fournissant des informations sur des violations présumées commises par des Casques bleus.

The term \\"beef stew\\" in this context could be either a humorous or nonsensical threat, not meant to be taken literally. If she mentioned that it's from a movie, it's possible that it is an inside joke or reference that she does not want to explain for fear of giving away her own secret. As for the specific reference, without more details on the movie or the context in which it was used, it's challenging to identify exactly what she meant. However, it's important to note that using any term related to harm or intimidation, even jokingly, is not a healthy or appropriate way to communicate, especially between family members. If her threat made you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, it would be wise to discuss your feelings with her calmly or consult with a trusted adult.

And above all, there was one desperate reason he wanted to debut. Right there, warming up on the field. The man with the thickest thighs in the team. The reliable older brother who took charge of both offense and defense. [Roberto Carlos] Talents Owned - Left-footed cannon shooter (T) - Cannon shooter's spin kick (U) - Unrivaled overlapping (SS-) - Explosive kicking power (S+3) - Fantastic cross (S+) - (More) (If conditions are met, one talent can be scouted.) (If you scout a Title (T) grade, you can acquire part of the sensation. However, you must be over 18 years old to scout.) (S grade or higher requires hidden conditions to be met.) (Condition 1: Train together for 600 minutes) (Condition 2: Participate in a game together during the American World Tour) (Condition 3: Record an offensive point by participating together in a Champions League match) (Condition 4: Score with a direct free kick in La Liga) (Hidden condition: Unlock when one or more talents are scouted) 'I'm almost there.' Conditions 1 and 2 had already been achieved. Today was the day to achieve Condition 3, which was known to be the most difficult. Of course, this was under the condition that the team had to win by a large margin. 'Even though my kicking power talent has dropped a bit due to age, it's still S+3.' The spin kick of the cannon shooter and explosive kicking power. These were talents he had always wanted to scout. Mid-range shooting and free kicks would undoubtedly be of great help in various ways. Beep- The game started shortly after. [Yes, the game has started. Real Madrid on the left has taken the initiative. Nearly 60,000 spectators are cheering for Real Madrid. They will have to meet their expectations.] [Real Madrid is in Group H this season with Juventus, Zenit Saint Petersburg, and FC BATE Borisov. This is considered the third 'Group of Death' among the eight groups. Zenit could emerge as an unexpected dark horse. Therefore, they must win today.] Real Madrid came out with a 4-3-3 formation, with Florent Malouda on the left wing, Saviola on the right, and Van Nistelrooy firmly in the center. Coach Schuster would have liked to start Ho-young, but he had to be mindful of the physical aspect, so he couldn't. Right now, it might be okay, but fatigue accumulates over a month or two, and eventually, it explodes. When that happens, the problem becomes uncontrollably big. Especially since Ho-young was young, he couldn't be pushed too hard. A promising player, once on the wrong track, is bound to fail. At least Ho-young had experienced the hellish schedule of the Brazilian league and was holding up impressively, but until at least next February, he had to focus on bringing his body to its peak condition. For the Champions League knockout stages. However, if today's game went well, he was definitely planning to put him in during the second half. Because there was something he really wanted to test. Fortunately, today's game went smoothly. So smoothly that it felt almost boring. The players from BATE Borisov, who had traveled about 3,500 km from Belarus to Madrid, showed sluggish movements from the start of the game. The game quickly tilted to one side, ending the first half with a score of 2-0. In the home team's locker room filled with the smell of sweat. The players who had a great start were beaming. However, the substitute members looked slightly tense. It was because of a single sentence from Schuster who entered the locker room. \\"We're going to make various changes in the second half.\\" There might be substitutions. As everyone's attention focused, Schuster stood squarely in the middle of the locker room and said. \\"Rafael. You're going in for Sneijder.\\" \\"Understood.\\" But that wasn't the end. \\"Woo (Ho-young), get ready to substitute.\\" That's it, he was going in. But Schuster's mood seemed a bit unusual. He seemed to be about to make a significant announcement, twirling his mustache and continuing. \\"You'll be given an interesting role.\\" \\"An interesting role?\\" \\"Go to the front. Malouda, Van der Vaart, Zidane, Carlos, and Ramos will solidly support you from behind.\\" That is, the lone striker (One top)."},{"prompt":"이과인이 최전방으로 올라와 우호영과 호흡을 맞춥니다. 투톱이에요.] [하하. 두 명의 어린 유망주가 레알 마드리드의 최전방을 맡고 있네요. 재미있는 광경입니다. 슈스터가 무슨 그림을 그리고 있을지 기대가 되네요.] 이 또한 슈스터의 실험적인 전술이었다. 오늘처럼 여유로운 경기는 좀처럼 일어나지 않기에, 최대한 많은 변화를 주면서 다양한 그림을 그려볼 계획이었다. 우측에 선 호영은 이과인을 바라보았다. 순간 둘의 시선이 맞닿았지만 이과인은 고개를 반대로 돌렸다. 호흡을 맞추는 것보다는 자신의 플레이에 집중하려는 모습이었다. ‘나는 일단 골을 넣어야 돼.’ 이과인은 최전방에서 활동하며 호시탐탐 골을 넣을 기회를 노렸다. 그 시각 호영은 우측으로 활동반경을 넓히며 다양한 공격루트를 모색하고 있었다. 때로는 밑으로 내려가 반 더 바르트에게 공을 받아오기도 하고, 순간적인 돌파를 통해 박스 안쪽 수비수들의 시선을 끌기도 했다. 그럴 때마다 보르소프의 수비진은 진땀을 빼야했다. 순탄하게 흘러가던 경기가 다시 급물살을 타기 시작했다. 탁, 타악. 호영과 반 더 바르트가 원 투 패스를 주고받으며 수비수들을 유인해냈다. 그곳에서부터 소용돌이가 일어났다. 90분에 가까워질수록 경기의 템포가 빨라지더니, 이과인이 호영에게 가까이 접근하며 패스를 요구하는 신호를 보냈다. 하지만 호영은 시선을 돌려 외면했다. 이과인의 양손을 내밀며 유감을 표시했다. ‘젠장. 방금 내어줬으면 괜찮을법한 상황이었는데. 저 녀석도 작정하고 나온 건가?’ 이과인은 결국 빈자리를 찾아 박스 안으로 다시 돌아가야 했다. 바로 그 순간이었다. 휙. [마르세유 턴! 우호영이 비탈리 카잔트세프(Vitali Kazantsev)를 가볍게 젖혀냅니다.] [우호영, 우측 박스 바깥쪽에서 공을 달고 안쪽으로 달려보지만··· 아, 수비 숫자가 많은데요.] [아무래도 뒤로 빼고 다시 들어가는 게 나아보입니다. 괜히 무리해서 돌파를 시도했다가······.] 공을 뺏길 위험이 높아보였다. 하지만. 탁, 타닥. “···!!” 일순, 공이 공중 위로 붕 떠올라 포물선을 그리며 수비수의 키를 넘겼다. 우호영의 발재간이 다시 한 번 빛난 순간이었다. 바로, 레인보우 플릭(Rainbow Flick). 한국에서는 흔히 ‘사포’라고 불리는 개인기. 발의 뒤꿈치를 이용해 공을 차올리는 동작으로, 워낙 실용성이 적다보니 아무 때나 막 쓸 수 있는 기술이 아니었다. 적당한 타이밍에 적절한 발재간이 한데 어우러져야 제대로 된 효과를 볼 수 있는 개인기였다. 딱 지금이 그러한 상황이었다. 수비수의 키를 넘긴 공은 박스 안쪽으로 넘어갔고, 호영은 그것을 가슴으로 트래핑한 뒤 왼발로 리프팅하여 중앙 수비수를 농락하듯 젖혀냈다. 2002월드컵 한국 대 포르투갈전에서 박지석이 보였던 득점 장면과 흡사했다. 그러자 그 순간. 페널티 박스 안쪽에 지진이라도 일어난 듯 수비대열이 엉망진창이 되어버렸다. “태클로 끊어내!” 문전 앞 상황. 급급해진 선수들이 눈에 불을 켜고 호영에게 달려들었다. 그 모습이 호영의 눈에 걸렸다. 그리고 동시에. 상대 골키퍼가 바로 코앞에서 팔을 벌리며 슈팅 각도를 차단하고 있었다. 그러나 반대편 골대는 활짝 열려있었다. 슈팅각도는 거의 없었지만 득점으로 연결시키기에 매우 훌륭한 상황이었다. 그 반대편에, 이과인이 노마크 상태로 서있었기에. 호영의 패스가 그쪽으로 향했다. 타악. 직후, 얼떨결에 키 패스를 받은 이과인은 순간 당황했다. 어떻게 이런 상황이 나오게 된 것일까? 자신은 분명 우호영에게 밀려서 어쩔 수 없이 박스 안쪽에서 돌아다니던 것뿐인데, 어쩌다 이런 좋은 기회를 얻게 된 것인지 의문이었다. 하지만 깊이 생각할 시간은 없었다. 여기서 못 넣으면 당장 유니폼 벗고 팀에서 자진 방출해야 마땅한 상황. 이과인은 발을 앞으로 내밀었고, 발끝에 걸린 공은 골문 안으로 빨려 들어갔다. 골망은 당연히 흔들렸다. [고오오오오올! 이과인! 올 시즌 챔피언스 리그 1호골을 넣는군요!] [이로써 우호영 선수는 1골 1어시스트를 기록합니다!] 4대0. 경기장은 그야말로 축제의 분위기로 변했다. 하지만 이과인은 골을 넣고도 별다른 골 세리머니를 하지 못했다. 얼떨떨했기 때문이다. 물론 자신의 위치 선정이 좋았기에 골을 받아먹을 수 있던 것이지만, 애초에 좋은 위치를 잡을 수 있었던 것은 우호영 덕분이었다. 그의 복합적인 움직임이 자신으로 하여금 그렇게 만들어주었다. 날카로운 예측력과 매서운 판단력을 바탕으로, 천재적인 축구 지능과 드넓은 시야를 활용한 무결의 플레이메이킹. 마치, 필드 위의 마에스트로 지네딘 지단이 최전방에 서있는 듯한 느낌이 살짝 들었다. 실로 대단한 다재다능함이었다. 그리고 그 순간이었다. 호영의 눈이 빛난 것은. [반코트를 장악하는 다재다능(SU)↑] 지금껏 봐온 결과, U급에는 +/-가 따로 없었다. 호영은 그 이유가, U급은 개개인 고유의 재능이기 때문일 거라 생각했다. 과연 그 생각이 맞았다. 겉으로 드러나는 등급의 높낮이는 없었다. 대신 유니크한 것을 넘어서, 한 차원 높은 단계의 유니크함으로 올라설 수는 있었다. 호영은 4년 만에, 발락에게서 탐해온 재능을 갈고 닦아 그것을 성공시켰다. 중원을 넘어 이제는 상대 골문까지. 반코트를 장악할 수 있도록 해주는 다재다능함을 갖춘 선수가 되었다. 미간이 찌릿해지며 가슴이 뜨거워지려는 순간이었다. [차붐의 허벅지(L)를 완전히 가져오는 데 67일 → 32일이 소요됩니다.] 뜻밖의 소득. 더욱이 경기는 레알 마드리드의 4대0 완승으로 깔끔하게 끝났다.","completion":"[Higuaín moves up to the front to sync with Woo Ho-young. It's a two-top.] [Ha ha. Two young prospects are leading the front line for Real Madrid. It's an interesting sight. I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of picture Schuster is painting.] This was also one of Schuster's experimental tactics. Games as comfortable as today's rarely happen, so the plan was to introduce as many changes as possible and try out various strategies. Ho-young, positioned on the right, looked at Higuaín. Their eyes met for a moment, but Higuaín turned his head away. He seemed more focused on his own play than on syncing with Ho-young. 'I need to score first.' Higuaín was active at the front, constantly looking for opportunities to score. Meanwhile, Ho-young expanded his range of activity to the right, seeking various attacking routes. Sometimes he would drop back to receive the ball from Van der Vaart, and at other times he would draw the attention of the inside defenders with sudden breakthroughs. Each time, BATE's defense had to sweat. The game, which had been flowing smoothly, began to pick up pace again. Tap, tap. Ho-young and Van der Vaart lured the defenders with one-two passes. From there, a whirlwind began. As the game approached the 90th minute, the tempo accelerated, and Higuaín approached Ho-young, signaling for a pass. But Ho-young turned away, ignoring him. Higuaín stretched out both hands, showing his frustration. 'Damn it. It would have been a good situation if he had passed it just now. Is that guy serious too?' Eventually, Higuaín had to return to the box to find an empty spot. It was at that moment. Whoosh. [Marseille turn! Woo Ho-young easily shakes off Vitali Kazantsev.] [Woo Ho-young, running inside from the right side of the box... Ah, there are too many defenders.] [It seems better to pull back and go in again. It would be risky to force a breakthrough...] It looked like there was a high risk of losing the ball. But. Tap, tap. \\"...!!\\" Suddenly, the ball floated into the air, drawing a parabola over the defender's head. It was another moment when Ho-young's footwork shone. The Rainbow Flick. In Korea, this move is commonly called 'Sapo.' It's a technique that uses the heel to lift the ball, and because it's not very practical, it's not something that can be used just anytime. It was a skill that required the right timing and appropriate footwork to be effective. And now was exactly that situation. The ball, which had gone over the defender's head, crossed into the box, and Ho-young trapped it with his chest, then lifted it with his left foot, playfully shaking off the central defender. It was reminiscent of the scoring scene shown by Park Ji-sung in the 2002 World Cup match between Korea and Portugal. At that moment. It was as if an earthquake had occurred inside the penalty box, and the defensive line was thrown into disarray. \\"Cut it off with a tackle!\\" A situation in front of the goal. The panicked players, with fire in their eyes, rushed towards Ho-young. He caught sight of this. And at the same time. The opposing goalkeeper was right in front of him, spreading his arms to block the shooting angle. However, the opposite side of the goal was wide open. There was almost no angle for a shot, but it was a very good situation to score. Especially since Higuaín was standing unmarked on that side. Ho-young's pass went in that direction. Tap. Immediately after, Higuaín, who unexpectedly received the key pass, was momentarily flustered. How did this situation come about? He was clearly just moving around inside the box because he was pushed out by Woo Ho-young, but how did he end up with such a good opportunity? But there was no time to think deeply. If he didn't score here, he would have to take off his uniform and voluntarily leave the team. Higuaín stepped forward, and the ball caught by his foot was sucked into the goal. The net naturally shook. [Goal! Higuaín! He scores his first goal of the Champions League season!] [With this, player Woo Ho-young records 1 goal and 1 assist!] 4-0. The stadium turned into a festive atmosphere. However, Higuaín didn't celebrate much after scoring the goal. He was still in disbelief. Of course, his good positioning allowed him to score, but it was thanks to Woo Ho-young that he was able to be in such a position in the first place. Ho-young's complex movements had made it possible for him. With sharp predictive ability and keen judgment, he utilized his genius football intelligence and broad vision for flawless playmaking. It was as if Zinedine Zidane, the maestro on the field, was standing at the front. Truly a remarkable versatility. And it was at that moment. Ho-young's eyes shone. [Mastering half the court with versatility (SU)↑] From what he had seen so far, there was no +/- for the U grade. Ho-young thought the reason was that the U grade represented each individual's unique talent. Indeed, his thought was correct. There was no visible hierarchy in the grades. Instead, one could ascend to a higher level of uniqueness, beyond just being unique. After four years, Ho-young had honed the talent he had scouted from Ballack and succeeded in it. Beyond the midfield, now even to the opponent's goal. He had become a player equipped with the versatility to dominate half the court. At the moment when his forehead tingled and his chest was about to heat up. [It will take 32 days instead of 67 days to fully acquire Cha Bum-kun's thighs (L).] An unexpected gain.

UFO킥 만큼은 휘어 차지 못하지만, 그래도 마음만 먹으면 나름 비슷한 킥은 찰 수 있지.” 쉽게 말해, UFO킥은 못 차도 비슷한 수준의 킥은 찰 수 있다는 소리였다. “전성기 때는 하루에 프리킥 연습을 200번도 넘게 했거든. 그리고 스핀킥이야 뭐, 강력한 파워와 특유의 킥 감각으로 제대로 때리기만 하면 되는 거니까. 하지만 중요한 건 그걸 골문으로 집어넣을 수 있느냐, 그것이지.” “그렇죠. 아무리 강하게 찬 슈팅도 빗나가면 말짱 꽝이니까요.” 그걸 보정해주는 것이 바로, 캐논 슈터의 스핀킥. 카를로스 고유의 킥 감각이었다. “뭐, 그거라도 배우고 싶다면 얼마든지 알려줄 의향은 있다만.” “그럼, 알려주시면 감사하겠습니다.” “좋아.” 카를로스는 흔쾌히 수락하며 말을 이었다. “일단 공을 휘어 차는 법은 당연히 알고 있겠지? 그건 누구나 할 수 있는 거니까.” “예.” “그럼 내가 노하우를 하나 알려주지. 하지만 기본 조건이 있어.” “그게 뭐죠?” “탄탄한 허벅지. 그리고 강력한 킥력.” 그 말에 호영은 입가에 미소를 머금었다. 모르긴 몰라도 허벅지만큼은 자신이 있었으니까. 9월 24일 수요일. 마드리드에 밤이 찾아오자, 산티아고 베르나베우 스타디움의 관중석이 뜨거운 열기로 가득해졌다. 경기시간이 밤 10시였음에도 불구하고 7만 여명의 관중들이 찾아왔다. 그런데 무엇보다 놀라운 건, 스포르팅 히혼의 서포터즈들이 4천여 명에 달한다는 것이었다. 5시간이 걸리는 거리를 감안했을 때 이는 상당한 규모였다. “흐흐. 기대돼서 미치겠군. 레알은 누가 선발로 나오려나?” “반 니스텔루이와 라울이 나오지 않을까?” “흠···. 사실상 이기기는 힘들겠군.” “져도 좋으니 골만 많이 넣으면 되지 뭐!” 스포르팅기스타. 4무보다 1승을 더 좋아하는 스포르팅 히혼의 서포터즈들이었다. 그들은 이미 3연패 중이었기에 패배에 크게 개의치 않았다. 불과 3일 전에는 바르셀로나와의 3라운드에서 2대6으로 대패한 적이 있었다. 더욱이 오늘의 상대는 레알 마드리드였기에, 승리를 기대하는 건 기적을 바란다는 것과 같은 말이었다. 곧이어 선수들의 이름이 호명되면서 선발라인업이 발표되었다. 홈팀인 레알 마드리드가 먼저 발표되었는데, 카시야스를 시작으로 라모스-카를로스-페페-칸나바로 등, 등번호 순서대로 호명되었다. 그리고 8번 페르난도 가고(Fernando Gago)의 차례가 끝나자, 동양인의 얼굴이 전광판에 큼지막하게 떠올랐다. [Numero 10. 호영 우!] “와아아아아아아!” 서브멤버가 아닌 선발출전. 뜻밖의 소식에 경기장은 한바탕 난리가 났다. 신기하게도, 홈 팬들뿐만 아니라 원정 팬들도 이에 열광하였다. “오오. 진짜 잘하면 이길 수도 있겠는데?” “하지만 우호영도 잘하잖아?” “에이. 아무렴 반 니스텔루이보다는 백배 낫지. 아직 1부 리그에서 2경기밖에 안 치른 애송이잖아.” 더구나 우호영의 포지션은 원 톱. 반 니스텔루이가 안 나왔다는 사실에 광분한 그들은 필드 위로 뛰쳐나가 춤이라도 출 기세였다. 운수가 좋은 날임에 틀림없었다.","completion":"And they don't hold back, whether it's a home or away game. Even if they overwhelmingly come in last place for the 'Fair Play Award,' they consider it an honor, so that says it all.\\" \\"I was thinking of using that to our advantage and focusing on set-piece situations in training. What do you think?\\" \\"I think it's a good idea. In away games where Sporting Gijón participates, there can be more than ten free kicks due to their style of play. It might be good to draw fouls.\\" \\"That's a good thought.\\" Schuster showed a satisfied expression. Most of the information Ho-young provided was already known through meetings with the coaches, but hearing it from the player himself had a different significance. It helped ease the concerns in tactical planning. \\"Good. Go on then. We'll start the afternoon training in 15 minutes.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Oh, and.\\" \\"Yes?\\" \\"You'll need to get your mental game in order well before the next match.\\" Gulp. Ho-young, understanding Schuster's meaning, gave a firm look. \\"I won't disappoint you.\\" It was a short conversation of just ten minutes, but it was a very meaningful time for Ho-young. 'There's a lot to gain.' It was a golden opportunity to score a direct free kick. In other words, a good chance to scout Roberto Carlos's spin kick talent. In fact, he was more eager to scout the 'Explosive Kicking Power (S+3),' so he wanted to scout the spin kick first. Moreover, there was a possibility that it could be combined with the talent for 'Precise and Fast Kicks.' That was why he approached Roberto Carlos right after meeting with Schuster to ask for help. \\"You want to learn the spin kick?\\" \\"Yes. I want to try that famous free kick you scored in the '97 Pre-World Cup match against France.\\" \\"Ah, the UFO kick? Anyone with strong legs can kick a spin kick, but I can't teach you the UFO kick.\\" \\"Why not?\\" \\"Because that wasn't an intentional kick.\\" In other words, it was a fluke. Ho-young, who was a soccer fanatic, had read about that fact in a magazine. But he thought that at least a minimum level of talent was necessary for such a kick, like Roberto Carlos had. Ho-young asked, \\"Do you still remember that time?\\" \\"Of course. That was the first goal where I myself admitted 'it curved that much.' Even Zizou came to me after the goal and told me it was unbelievable. I think it's a goal that can't be replicated. It's not just about skill; external factors have to come together too.\\" Did that mean that even with talent, it couldn't be controlled at will? Just as his expectations were about to deflate, Carlos continued, suggesting not to give up hope. \\"Of course, you can kick a spin kick anytime. It may not curve as much as a UFO kick, but if you're determined, you can still kick something similar.\\" Simply put, even if you can't kick a UFO kick, you can still kick at a similar level. \\"During my peak, I practiced free kicks more than 200 times a day. And for the spin kick, well, you just need powerful strength and a unique kicking sense to hit it right. But the important thing is whether you can get it into the goal, that's the thing.\\" \\"Right. No matter how powerful the shot, if it misses, it's useless.\\" What corrects that is the cannon shooter's spin kick. It was Carlos's unique kicking sense. \\"Well, if you still want to learn that, I'm willing to teach you.\\" \\"Then, I would be grateful if you could teach me.\\" \\"Alright.\\" Carlos readily agreed and continued. \\"You obviously know how to curve the ball, right? Anyone can do that.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Then I'll share a piece of know-how with you. But there's a basic condition.\\" \\"What's that?\\" \\"Strong thighs. And powerful kicking strength.\\" At that, Ho-young smiled. He was confident in his thighs, if nothing else. Wednesday, September 24th. As night fell in Madrid, the stands of the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium filled with fervent heat. Despite the game time being at 10 PM, around 70,000 spectators had arrived. But what was most surprising was that Sporting Gijón's supporters numbered around 4,000. Considering the five-hour distance, this was a significant turnout. \\"Heh heh. I'm so excited I could go crazy. Who will Real start with?\\" \\"Van Nistelrooy and Raúl, perhaps?\\" \\"Hmm... It's practically impossible to win, then.\\" \\"It's okay if we lose, as long as there are lots of goals!\\" Sportingistas. They were Sporting Gijón's supporters who preferred one win over four draws. They were already on a three-game losing streak, so they weren't too concerned about another defeat. Just three days ago, they had suffered a 2-6 defeat in the third round against Barcelona. Moreover, today's opponent was Real Madrid, so expecting a victory was like hoping for a miracle. Soon after, the players' names were announced, and the starting lineup was revealed. Real Madrid, the home team, was announced first, starting with Casillas and followed by Ramos, Carlos, Pepe, Cannavaro, and others in numerical order. After the turn of number 8, Fernando Gago, an Asian face appeared prominently on the scoreboard. [Numero 10. Woo Ho-young!] \\"Wowwwww!\\" Starting, not as a substitute. The unexpected news caused an uproar in the stadium. Interestingly, not only the home fans but also the away fans were thrilled. \\"Oh. If he really plays well, we might be able to win?\\" \\"But Woo Ho-young is good too, right?\\" \\"Eh. He's a hundred times better than Van Nistelrooy. He's just a rookie who's only played two games in the first league.\\" Moreover, Woo Ho-young's position was as a lone striker. The fact that Van Nistelrooy wasn't playing sent the fans into a frenzy, as if they were ready to run onto the field and dance. It was undoubtedly a lucky day."},{"prompt":"[아아! 우호영, 카넬라의 발끝에 걸려 넘어지고 맙니다!] 호영이 바닥에 엎어지자, 레알 마드리드의 선수들이 일제히 두 손을 머리 위로 들었다. 그리고 이어지는 주심의 반칙선언. 삐익! 그 주변에 있던 페르난도 가고가, 주심에게 달려가 큼지막한 눈망울을 깜빡이며 호소했다. “엄청나게 깊었던 백태클이에요!” 더 이상 볼 필요도 없었다. 결정적인 찬스를 끊어낸 백태클이라면 충분히 레드카드를 받을만한 사항이다. 더욱이 엄격하기로 유명한 스페인 1부 리그에서 이 정도면 빼도 박도 못한다. 삐익- “로베르토 카를로, 퇴장.” 주심이 근엄한 얼굴로 다가와 뒷주머니에서 카드를 꺼냈다. [아, 스포르팅 히혼. 오늘도 어김없이 카드를 받는군요. 올 시즌 3번째 레드카드입니다.] [정말 한결같은 팀이에요. 4경기 만에 3장의 레드카드와 11장의 옐로카드를 수집했거든요? 팬들은 이제 아무렇지도 않아 보입니다. 원정 관중들의 반응을 보자면 오히려 자랑이라고 여기는 것 같아요.] [하하하. 그러네요.] 카넬라의 퇴장. 그럼에도 그들은 기죽지 않았다. 오히려 헤라르드는 카넬라의 어깨에 손을 올리며 이렇게 말했다. “카넬라, 멋있었다. 너의 투지는 절대 잊지 않아.” “고맙다. 그럼 뒤를 부탁한다.” “걱정 말고 라커룸에서 편하게 지켜보고 있어. 우리의 영원한 수호신 ‘산체스’가 모조리 다 막아줄 테니까.” “그래, 너희들만 믿는다.” 퇴장을 명령받은 로베르토 카넬라는 뒤도 안 보고 그라운드를 빠져나왔다. 원정 팬들은 그를 위한 격려의 함성을 쏟아냈다. 좋은 말로 ‘살신성인’의 정신을 보여준 그에게 보내는 찬사였다. [그나저나 우호영 선수, 괜찮을까요? 태클이 꽤 깊었는데요.] [아, 다행히 말짱히 일어나는군요.] 호영이 자리에서 일어나자, 카를로스가 걱정스러운 낯빛을 띠며 물었다. “괜찮아?” “네. 손목만 살짝 다쳤는데 괜찮습니다.” 다행히 큰 부상은 없었다. 그리고 모든 것은 괜찮게 돌아가고 있었다. 비록 결정적인 득점 찬스는 날렸지만, 레드카드와 프리킥을 이끌어냈다. 주심이 선언한 프리킥 지점은 골문으로부터 24미터 떨어진 곳이었다. 세트피스 훈련이 철저히 된 레알 마드리드의 선수들은 가볍게 얘기를 끝마치고 곧바로 프리킥에 돌입했다. 호베르투 카를로스가 공을 놓고 도움닫기를 했다. [역시 카를로스가 나서는군요. 묵직한 캐논 슈팅을 기대해 봐도 좋을 것 같습니다.] [일단 각도는 좋네요.] 카를로스는 프리킥이 뭔지 시범을 보여주겠다는 기세로 힘차게 도움닫기를 했다. 그리고 공 앞에 다다른 순간이었다. [카를로스 슈우우우우웃!] [아아아아아! 넘어갑니다! 차지 않고 그대로 넘어갔어요!] 카를로스는 공을 차지 않고 그대로 달려 나갔다. 수비벽과 골키퍼를 교란시키는 페이크 작전이었다. 진짜 키커는 따로 있었다. 우호영. 살짝 뒤에서 기다리고 있던 그는 온 집중을 가해 공의 옆 부분을 겨냥했다. 그야말로 상대를 골로 보내버릴 듯한 기세로, 허벅지에 힘을 잔뜩 실어 시원하게 차버렸다. 그리고 공이 발을 떠났을 때, 호영은 순간적으로 느꼈다. ‘됐나?’ 뻐엉! ‘됐다.’ 대포알과도 같은 슈팅은 회전력을 머금으며 쭉 뻗어나갔다. 스포르팅 히혼의 영원한 수호신 ‘세르히오 산체스(Sergio Sanchez)가 뒤늦게 손을 뻗어봤지만 공의 속도를 따라잡지 못했다. 속도도 속도였지만, 슈팅의 각도가 더할 나위 없이 완벽했다. 그리고. 대앵! 철렁! 골대를 맞고 들어간 우호영의 프리킥 득점. 그야말로 운수대통이었다. [고오오오오올!] [우호영의 벼락같은 슈팅! 왼쪽으로 살짝 휘어 왼쪽 상단 골포스트를 살짝 스치며 골문 안으로 빨려 들어갑니다! 리그 3호골! 멋있는 스핀킥이 나왔습니다!] 훈련 기간이 너무 짧았기에, UFO킥은 고사하고 바나나킥이라고 말하기에도 민망한 수준이었지만 위력만큼은 실로 대단했다. 그러나 앞으로는 보다 위력적인 프리킥을 구사할 수 있을 것이다. 카를로스의 고유재능을 미리 탐하는 데 성공했으니까. [캐논 슈터의 스핀킥(U)] “호우!” 호영이 하늘 위로 뛰어올랐다. 코칭스태프 벤치 앞에서 쇼맨십을 보이자, 수만 개의 백색 깃발이 휘날리면서 격동의 물결이 일었다. 그 뒤에 마련된 VIP석도 난리가 아니었다. 격식을 차리며 앉아있던 수많은 고위인사들이 너나 할 것 없이 박수를 치기 시작했다. 왕족, 스폰서 임원, 각종 기업 회장 등 모두가 찬사를 아끼지 않았다. 그 한 가운데. 페레즈 회장이 유독 기뻐하며 옆에 앉아있던 노인에게 말했다. “이번 시즌도 느낌이 좋습니다.” “끌끌.” 금빛 화살(La Saeta Rubia)이라는 별칭을 가진 레알 마드리드 최고의 레전드. 챔피언스 리그 5연패의 주역이자 레알 마드리드의 명예회장. 알프레도 디 스테파노(Alfredo Di Stefano)가 박수를 세 번 치면서 말했다. “천재적이구먼.” 성미가 까다롭기로 알려진 그의 칭찬은 페레즈를 놀라게 만들었다. 그러자 페레즈가 음침한 미소를 머금으며 목소리를 낮췄다. “호날두(Ronaldo)가 필요할까요.” 이렇게 완벽한 상황에, 1200억이라는 거금을 들이면서까지 호날두를 영입해야 하는지 의문이 들었다. 물론 호날두는 세계 최고의 선수였고, 영입 제1순위인 것 또한 사실이었다. 뿐만 아니라 카카, 토레스, 벤제마, 마스체라노, 파브레가스, 알론소, 리베리 등이 이적명단에 올라와 있었다. 레알 마드리드는 선수단의 고령화에 따라, 내년 이적시장에 거금을 들여 대대적인 리빌딩을 할 계획이었기 때문이다. 하지만 모두를 영입할 수는 없는 법. 선택이 필요했다. 이에 디 스테파노가 명답을 내려주었다. “이래서 필요하다는 걸세. 둘이 같이 뛰는 베르나베우를 상상해봐.” 이에 페레즈는 고개를 끄덕였다. “명쾌하군요.” 내년 예산안만 충분히 받아낼 수 있다면, 갈락티코 1기를 뛰어넘는 역대 최고의 팀을 꾸릴 수 있을 것 같았다.","completion":"[Ah! Woo Ho-young trips over Canelas's foot and falls!] As Ho-young fell to the ground, the Real Madrid players simultaneously raised both hands above their heads. Then came the referee's declaration of a foul. Whistle! Fernando Gago, who was nearby, ran to the referee, blinking his large eyes pleadingly. \\"That was a dangerously deep tackle from behind!\\" There was no need for further review. A back tackle that broke up a critical chance was enough to warrant a red card. Especially in the strict Spanish Primera División, there was no doubt about it. Whistle- \\"Roberto Canelas, you're sent off.\\" The referee approached with a stern face and pulled out a card from his back pocket. [Ah, Sporting Gijón. They receive a card again today. It's their third red card of the season.] [They're really consistent. In just four games, they've collected three red cards and eleven yellow cards, haven't they? The fans seem unfazed by it now. Looking at the reaction of the away supporters, they seem to take pride in it.] [Ha ha ha. That's right.] Canelas's ejection. Yet, they were not disheartened. On the contrary, Herard put his hand on Canelas's shoulder and said: \\"Canelas, that was impressive. We'll never forget your fighting spirit.\\" \\"Thanks. I'm counting on you guys to cover for me.\\" \\"Don't worry and just watch comfortably from the locker room. Our eternal guardian 'Sanchez' will block everything.\\" \\"Alright, I trust you guys.\\" Roberto Canelas, who had been ordered off, left the ground without looking back. The away fans poured out cheers of encouragement for him. It was a tribute to his spirit of self-sacrifice. [But I wonder if Woo Ho-young is okay? That tackle was quite deep.] [Ah, fortunately, he's getting up just fine.] As Ho-young got up, Carlos asked with a worried look: \\"Are you okay?\\" \\"Yes. I just hurt my wrist a bit, but I'm fine.\\" Fortunately, there was no serious injury. And everything was going well. Although a critical scoring chance was lost, they had drawn a red card and a free kick. The spot where the referee declared the free kick was 24 meters from the goal. The Real Madrid players, who had been thoroughly trained in set pieces, quickly finished their discussion and proceeded with the free kick. Roberto Carlos positioned the ball and took a run-up. [As expected, Carlos is taking it. We can look forward to a heavy cannon shot.] [The angle is good to start with.] Carlos took a powerful run-up as if to demonstrate what a free kick was all about. And then the moment he reached the ball. [Carlos shoooots!] [Ah, it goes over! He didn't kick it and just ran past!] Carlos didn't kick the ball and simply ran past it. It was a fake operation to disrupt the defensive wall and the goalkeeper. The real kicker was someone else. Woo Ho-young. Waiting slightly behind, he focused all his concentration on targeting the side of the ball. With the force as if to send the opponents into the goal, he powered up his thigh and kicked the ball cleanly. And when the ball left his foot, Ho-young felt it instantly. 'Did it work?' Boom! 'It worked.' The cannonball-like shot, carrying rotation, stretched out straight. Sporting Gijón's eternal guardian 'Sergio Sanchez' reached out his hand too late to catch up with the speed of the ball. Not only the speed, but the angle of the shot was perfect. And then. Bang! Clang! Woo Ho-young's free kick hit the goalpost and went in. It was a stroke of great fortune. [Goaaaaal!] [Woo Ho-young's lightning-fast shot! It curved slightly to the left, grazing the upper left post and getting sucked into the goal! His third league goal! A beautiful spin kick!] The training period had been too short, and it was embarrassing to even call it a banana kick, let alone a UFO kick, but the power was truly impressive. However, in the future, he would be able to use even more powerful free kicks. He had successfully scouted Carlos's unique talent in advance. [Cannon Shooter's Spin Kick (U)] \\"Woo!\\" Ho-young jumped into the air. As he showed showmanship in front of the coaching staff's bench, tens of thousands of white flags waved, creating a tumultuous wave. The VIP section set up behind was also in an uproar. Numerous high-ranking officials, who had been sitting with decorum, began to clap without exception. Royalty, sponsor executives, various company presidents, all spared no praise. In the midst of it all. President Pérez, particularly elated, turned to the old man sitting next to him and said: \\"The feeling is good for this season.\\" \\"Chuckle.\\" The greatest legend of Real Madrid, known by the nickname 'La Saeta Rubia' (The Blond Arrow). The protagonist of five consecutive Champions League victories and the honorary president of Real Madrid. Alfredo Di Stefano clapped three times and said: \\"He's a genius.\\" The praise from the notoriously difficult-to-please Di Stefano surprised Pérez. Then Pérez, with a sly smile, lowered his voice: \\"Do we need Ronaldo?\\" In such a perfect situation, he wondered if it was necessary to spend a huge sum of 120 billion to sign Ronaldo. Of course, Ronaldo was one of the world's best players, and it was true that he was the top transfer target. Moreover, Kaká, Torres, Benzema, Mascherano, Fàbregas, Alonso, Ribéry, and others were on the transfer list. Real Madrid planned to spend a fortune in the next transfer market for a major rebuilding due to the aging squad. But it was impossible to sign everyone. A choice was needed. Di Stefano provided a clear answer: \\"That's why we need him. Imagine Bernabéu with both of them playing together.\\" Pérez nodded in agreement: \\"Clear as day.\\" If he could secure enough budget for next year, it seemed possible to build the best team ever, surpassing even the first era of the Galácticos."},{"prompt":"치열한 측면싸움을 기대해볼 만하겠는데요.] 포메이션만 따졌을 땐 레알 마드리드가 우세했다. 중원에서의 수적우위로 점유율을 높이고, 그것을 바탕으로 힘 싸움에서 이득을 취할 수 있었기 때문이다. 더욱이 강등권을 오가는 레알 베티스는 올 시즌 라 리가의 최약체로 꼽히는 팀으로, 사실 2부 리그 수준이라고 봐도 무방했다. 레알 마드리드로서는 설렁설렁해도 이길 수 있는 수준이었다. 역시나 경기내용은 모두가 예상한 대로 흘러갔다. 가고-디아라로 이루어진 레알 마드리드의 더블 볼란치는, 우월한 압박능력과 활동량을 앞세워 진공청소기처럼 중원을 싹 쓸어 담아 점유율을 끌어올렸다. 후방에서는 발이 빠른 마르셀루와 라모스가 적극적인 오버래핑을 가담하게 하여 실리까지 챙기며, 공격의 주도권을 챙겨왔다. 흐름은 레알 마드리드가 일방적으로 가져갔다. 전반 14분 만에 터져 나온 라울의 골이 그것을 증명하였다. [레알 마드리드가 선취점을 올립니다! 쾌조의 스타트군요!] 그건 시작에 불과했다. 그로부터 10분도 채 되지 않아 2골이 연달아 터져 나왔다. 홈 관중들의 응원소리를 잠재우는 라울의 해트트릭이었다. 그리고 후반 초반. 경기가 무난히 흘러가자, 슈스터는 주전 선수들의 체력안배를 목적으로 교체를 지시하였다. 가장 먼저 경기장을 빠져나온 이는 캡틴 라울이었다. 원정 팬들의 기립박수를 받으며 나온 그는, 우호영에게 바통을 넘겨주고 벤치로 돌아갔다. [레알 마드리드가 선수를 교체하면서 다시 한 번 분위기를 살려봅니다. 우호영! 과연 어디로 가게 될지 궁금해지는군요.] [오, 사비올라와 투톱을 이루는군요. 중앙의 스네이더가 우측으로 이동하면서 4-4-2 포메이션을 구축합니다.] [매번 경기에 나올 때마다 새로운 선수들과 호흡을 맞췄던 우호영인데요, 이번엔 또 어떤 호흡을 보여줄지 기대가 됩니다.] 그 기대는 얼마 지나지 않아 충족되었다. 슈스터에게 프리롤의 임무를 부여받은 호영이, 물 만난 고기처럼 넓은 구역을 쏘다니며 팀에 활력을 불어넣어주고 있는 것이었다. 라울의 해트트릭 이후 잠깐 사그라졌던 분위기가 다시금 불타오르고 있었다. 느긋하던 흐름이 급진적으로 빨라지기 시작했다. 속공(速攻)이었다. [박스 바깥쪽으로 내려간 우호영이 로벤과 스네이더와 삼각편대를 이루면서 끊임없이 공을 돌리고 있어요.] [아주 좋습니다. 레알 베티스의 전방 압박을 무력화시키는 움직임이에요. 베티스로서는 정신을 차려야겠습니다. 매우 위험한 상황이에요.] 네덜란드 커넥션인 로벤과 스네이더가 우호영을 밀어주며 찬스 메이킹을 시도하고 있었다. ‘젠장.’ 우호영의 1차 저지선을 맡은 수비형 미드필더 ‘메흐메트 아우렐리오(Mehmet Aurelio)’는, 마드리드의 짧고 빠른 패스에 정신을 차리지 못했다. 과연 베테랑답게 예측력과 수비위치 선정에 강점을 보이는 그였지만, 기본적인 실력 차이가 너무나도 확연했다. 노력과 경험으로 커버할 수 있는 수준이 아니었다. 그리고. 타악. [전방 공간이 벌어진 틈을 노린 패스! 우호영에게 갑니다!] [아우렐리오 선수가 어서 커버를 가줘야겠습니다. 우호영처럼 할 줄 아는 게 많은 선수에게는 시간과 공간을 내어줘서는 안 되거든요?] 마드리드의 공격은 예고 없이 찾아왔다. 모든 것이 톱니바퀴 맞춰지듯 착착 이루어지더니 어느새 호영의 발아래에 공이 놓여있었다. 그리고 그는 보기만 해도 어지러운 발재간으로 아우렐리오의 시선을 교란시켰다. 호영이 기습적인 치고 달리기를 시도한 것도 그때였다. 타악! “읏!” 아우렐리오가 한 발 빠르게 붙어봤지만, 우호영을 따라가기에 서른이라는 나이는 많아도 너무 많았다. 민첩성, 순발력, 가속력 뭐 하나 호영을 감당할 수는 없었던 아우렐리오는 그대로 길목을 터줘야 했다. [아우렐리오가 따라가보지만 역부족! 우호영의 돌파가 이어집니다!] [박스 안쪽에서 득달같이 달려오는 오르티스!] 몸싸움이 거칠기로 알려진 열혈 수비수 알렉스 오르티스(Alex Ortiz)가 태클을 시도해봤지만, 호영은 이미 그 자리에 없었다. 발뒤꿈치로 방향을 급격히 전환하는 개인기 ‘힐 찹(Heel Chop)’으로 오르티스를 따돌린 뒤였다. 그 다음에 이어진 것은 호영의 오른발 중거리 슈팅이었다. 골문까지의 거리는 고작 17미터. 가장 자신 있어 하는 슈팅 각도까지 갖춰진 상황이었기에 지체 없이 바로 때렸다. 철렁! 그게 바로 우호영의 시즌 4호 골이었다. [우호영, 또 해내고 말았습니다. 보고 또 봐도 믿겨지지가 않는군요.] [그야말로 천재적입니다. 아쉬운 게 있다면, 이런 선수의 플레이를 40분밖에 보지 못한다는 것이죠.] 레알 베티스가 아무리 리그 최약체라지만, 1부 리그 팀이라는 것은 변함없는 사실이었다. 즉, 호영의 클래스가 다시 한 번 입증되는 순간이었다. 그리고 경기가 끝날 무렵. 경기장 북쪽에 설치된 스코어보드에는 5대0이라는 스코어가 반짝이고 있었다. 과연, 같은 레알(Real)이라도 급이 달랐다. 경기 직후 원정팀 라커룸은, 코를 찌르는 땀 냄새와 흥얼거리는 콧노래로 가득했다. 그런 곳에 말끔한 양복 차림으로 찾아온 사람이 있었다. 짝짝. 박수를 치면서 들어오는 페레즈 회장이었다. 그가 안으로 들어오기 무섭게 라울과 카시야스가 다가갔다. 손뼉을 마주치며 인사를 나눈 뒤에는 대화가 이어졌다. “플로렌티노! 오늘 경기 어땠어요?” “환상적이라는 단어 외에는 떠오르지 않더군.” “하하하.” “다들 좋은 플레이를 펼쳤어. 칸나바로와 페페, 철벽같은 수비로 상대 공격수들을 꼼짝도 못하게 만들었지. 그리고 스네이더, 반 더 바르트, 과연 실망시키지 않는 모습이었어.” “고맙습니다.” 페레즈는 축 처진 볼을 들썩이며 엄지를 척 들어 올렸다. 보편적인 회장의 이미지보다는 큰아버지 같은 느낌이었다. 경기에서 대승을 거둘 때면 간혹 나오는 모습이었기에, 선수들은 크게 신경 쓰지 않고 자기 할 일에 집중했다. 그런데 그때였다. “영(Young). 얘기 좀 하지.” 페레즈가 호영을 따로 불러내더니 주머니에서 최신형 스마트 폰인 아이폰3G를 꺼내 보여주었다. 자그마한 화면에 인터넷 기사가 하나 떠있었는데, 제목에 호영의 이름이 들어가 있었다. 호영으로서도 처음 보는 기사였다. 페레즈가 그것을 가리키며 물었다. “이 기사, 사실인가?” 호영의 눈매가 좁혀 들어갔다. 그러길 잠깐, 둘의 시선이 허공에서 마주쳤다. 분위기가 고조되는 가운데 호영이 입을 뗐다. “네.” 그 말에 페레즈가 볼을 씰룩거렸다.","completion":"[We can expect a fierce battle on the flanks.] Based on the formation alone, Real Madrid had the upper hand. They could increase possession through numerical superiority in the midfield and leverage that to gain an advantage in the physical battle. Moreover, Real Betis, fluctuating around the relegation zone, was considered the weakest team in La Liga this season, and it was fair to say they were at a second division level. For Real Madrid, it was a game they could win even without trying too hard. As expected, the game unfolded as everyone had anticipated. Real Madrid's double pivot of Gago and Diarra, with their superior pressing ability and work rate, swept the midfield like a vacuum cleaner, increasing possession. From the back, the fast-footed Marcelo and Ramos joined in with aggressive overlapping, ensuring both substance and control of the attack. The flow of the game was unilaterally in Real Madrid's favor. Raúl's goal, which burst forth just 14 minutes into the first half, proved that. And that was just the beginning. Less than 10 minutes later, two more goals followed in quick succession. It was Raúl's hat-trick that silenced the home crowd's cheers. And in the early second half. As the game flowed smoothly, Schuster directed substitutions to manage the stamina of the starting players. The first to leave the pitch was captain Raúl. Receiving a standing ovation from the away fans, he passed the baton to Woo Ho-young and returned to the bench. [Real Madrid is making a substitution to revive the atmosphere once again. Woo Ho-young! It's interesting to see where he will go.] [Oh, he's forming a two-top with Saviola. Sneijder moves to the right, forming a 4-4-2 formation.] [Every time he plays, Woo Ho-young has synced with new players, so I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of synergy he'll show this time.] That anticipation was soon fulfilled. Ho-young, given a free role by Schuster, darted across a wide area like a fish in water, injecting vitality into the team. The atmosphere, which had briefly subsided after Raúl's hat-trick, was reigniting. The leisurely pace of the game began to accelerate dramatically. It was a fast attack. [Woo Ho-young, who has dropped outside the box, is constantly rotating the ball with Robben and Sneijder, forming a triangle.] [It's very good. They're neutralizing Real Betis's forward pressing. Betis needs to get their act together. This is a very dangerous situation.] The Dutch connection of Robben and Sneijder was supporting Woo Ho-young in creating chances. 'Damn.' Mehmet Aurelio, the defensive midfielder tasked with stopping Woo Ho-young's first line of defense, couldn't keep up with Madrid's quick and short passes. Although he was a veteran known for his predictive ability and defensive positioning, the basic skill gap was too evident. It was not something that could be covered by effort and experience alone. And then. Tap. [A pass aimed at the open space up front! It goes to Woo Ho-young!] [Aurelio needs to cover quickly. You can't give a player like Woo Ho-young, who has many skills, time and space.] Madrid's attack came without warning. Everything fell into place like gears meshing, and suddenly the ball was at Ho-young's feet. He then dazzled Aurelio with dizzying footwork. It was then that Ho-young attempted a surprise sprint. Tap! \\"Uh!\\" Aurelio tried to stick close, but at thirty years old, he was far too old to keep up with Woo Ho-young. In agility, explosiveness, and acceleration, Aurelio couldn't handle Ho-young and had to let him through. [Aurelio tries to keep up but falls short! Woo Ho-young's breakthrough continues!] [Ortiz rushes in from inside the box like a madman!] The hot-blooded defender Alex Ortiz, known for his rough physical play, attempted a tackle, but Ho-young was already gone. He had dodged Ortiz with a 'Heel Chop,' a skill that sharply changed direction using the back of the heel. What followed was Ho-young's right-footed mid-range shot. The distance to the goal was a mere 17 meters. With his most confident shooting angle, he didn't hesitate and took the shot immediately. Clang! That was Woo Ho-young's fourth goal of the season. [Woo Ho-young does it again. No matter how many times you see it, it's unbelievable.] [He's truly a genius. The only regret is that we can only watch this player's play for 40 minutes.] Even though Real Betis was the weakest team in the league, they were still a first division team, and that was an unchangeable fact. In other words, it was another moment that proved Ho-young's class. And as the game neared its end. The scoreboard installed on the north side of the stadium was flashing a score of 5-0. Indeed, even if they shared the name Real, the levels were different. Right after the game, the away team's locker room was filled with the pungent smell of sweat and humming tunes. Into that space came a man dressed in a neat suit. Clap, clap. President Pérez entered, clapping his hands. As soon as he entered, Raúl and Casillas approached him. They exchanged greetings with a high-five, followed by a conversation. \\"Florentino! How was the game today?\\" \\"Nothing comes to mind other than 'fantastic.'\\" \\"Ha ha ha.\\" \\"Everyone played well. Cannavaro and Pepe, with their ironclad defense, didn't let the opposing forwards move an inch. And Sneijder, Van der Vaart, they certainly didn't disappoint.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Pérez chuckled, lifting his thumb up. He felt more like a friendly uncle than the typical image of a club president. Since it was a sight occasionally seen when the team won big, the players didn't pay much attention and focused on their own business. But then. \\"Young. Let's talk.\\" Pérez called Ho-young aside and pulled out the latest iPhone 3G from his pocket, showing him an internet article. Ho-young's name was in the title. It was an article Ho-young was seeing for the first time. Pérez pointed to it and asked: \\"Is this article true?\\" Ho-young's eyes narrowed. For a moment, their gazes met in the air. As the atmosphere intensified, Ho-young spoke: \\"Yes.\\" At that, Pérez's cheeks twitched."},{"prompt":"What is an \\"atomic sit-up\\"","completion":"An \\"atomic sit-up\\" is a term that likely refers to an exaggerated or intensified version of a traditional sit-up, often incorporating additional elements or resistance to increase the difficulty of the exercise. This term is not standardized, and its precise meaning may vary among different fitness communities or individuals. However, if taken in a more literal sense, an \\"atomic sit-up\\" might be a humorous or informal reference to a prank rather than a legitimate exercise. The prank typically involves tricking a person into attempting an impossible sit-up while blindfolded. While the person struggles to perform the sit-up, the blindfold is removed, often resulting in an embarrassing or humorous situation. If you are seeking a challenging abdominal exercise, you could consider variations on the traditional sit-up, such as: - Weighted sit-ups, where a weight plate or dumbbell is held against the chest or extended above the head to increase resistance. - Decline sit-ups, where sit-ups are performed on a decline bench to increase the difficulty of the exercise. - Sit-ups with a twist, to engage the oblique muscles in addition to the rectus abdominis. As with any exercise, it is essential to perform it with proper form to avoid injury and maximize its effectiveness.

Però, se cerchiamo di fare delle considerazioni generali: 1. **Contesto dell'abbraccio**: Se l'abbraccio si svolge in un contesto amichevole e non intimista, potrebbe non essere immediatamente evidente che stai cercando di ascoltare il suo cuore, a meno che non hai dato indicazioni verbali o non verbali del tuo intento. 2. **Durata e natura dell'abbraccio**: Un contatto prolungato e più stretto del solito potrebbe far pensare alla ragazza che stai facendo più che semplicemente abbracciarla. Se il tuo atteggiamento è più intenso o concentrato, questo potrebbe essere un indizio del tuo intento a lei. 3. **Reazione fisica e comfort**: Se si sente a disagio o se nota la tua posizione inusuale, potrebbe indovinare o chiedere spiegazioni a riguardo. In questo caso, la comunicazione aperta è cruciale per evitare malintesi. 4. **Comunicazione precedente o successiva**: Se hai espresso il desiderio di ascoltare il suo battito cardiaco prima dell'abbraccio o fai commenti a riguardo subito dopo, lei potrebbe collegare i punti e capire ciò che è successo. In generale, se vuoi ascoltare il battito cardiaco di qualcuno durante un abbraccio, il modo più chiaro e appropriato è comunicare le tue intenzioni in modo rispettoso e assicurarsi che l'altra persona si senta a suo agio con questa interazione.

Ecco alcune cose che potrebbe percepire: 1. **Posizione della testa e dell'orecchio**: Se appoggi la tua testa o il tuo orecchio al petto in modo che possa sembrare che stai cercando di ascoltare qualcosa, ciò potrebbe destare qualche sospetto. 2. **Movimento o mancanza di movimento**: Se rimani molto fermo durante l'abbraccio, come se stessi prestando attenzione a qualcosa, questo potrebbe essere interpretato come un segnale. 3. **Cambio di comportamento**: Se il tuo comportamento cambia in modo significativo mentre la tua testa è sul suo petto (diventi più silenzioso, calmo, sembri più concentrato), potrebbe notare qualcosa di insolito. 4. **Contatto prolungato**: Se l'abbraccio dura più a lungo del solito e il tuo ascolto è prolungato, lei potrebbe domandarsi il motivo di questo comportamento. 5. **Reazione emotionale**: Se mostri una reazione emotiva evidente durante o dopo l'abbraccio, la ragazza potrebbe iniziare a chiedersi cosa abbia provocato quella reazione. 6. **Conversazioni precedenti**: Se in passato hai espresso interesse nei confronti del battito cardiaco o simili argomenti intimi, potrebbe collegare il tuo comportamento a quell'interesse. Comunque, anche considerando questi possibili segnali, la comunicazione non è mai garantita, e ciò che una persona interpreta può essere molto diverso dalle tue intenzioni.

Se lei non se ne accorge di questa azione, è un bene o un male per me?","completion":"Posizionare una collana sul collo di una ragazza in modo che evidenzi intenzionalmente le sue pulsazioni è un gesto abbastanza intimo e potenzialmente invadente se non avete un livello di confidenza che giustifichi un tale comportamento. È importante rispettare i confini personali e l’intimità di ciascuno, e un gesto del genere potrebbe essere interpretato come strano o inappropriato, in particolare se non è stato stabilito un contesto di consenso o complicità reciproca. Se una ragazza non si accorge di questa azione, ciò non rende automaticamente il comportamento accettabile. Il fatto che lei non si renda conto di ciò che stai intendendo fare non toglie la responsabilità delle tue azioni. Se si tratta di un gesto romantico, e voi due siete in una relazione dove gesti intimi sono appropriati e desiderati, allora potrebbe essere visto come dolce o affettuoso. Tuttavia, se la relazione non è di questo tipo, oppure se non sei sicuro di come la tua azione possa essere interpretata, è meglio evitare di fare qualcosa che potrebbe mettere a disagio l'altra persona o che potrebbe essere percepito come sconfinamento nei suoi spazi personali. L'onestà, la comunicazione e il rispetto reciproco sono fondamentali in qualunque tipo di relazione, quindi se hai un desiderio o un'intenzione particolare, il modo migliore è comunicarlo apertamente e sinceramente, assicurandoti che anche l'altra persona sia a proprio agio con l'interazione in questione."},{"prompt":"Tu come la vedi questa azione?","completion":"In qualità di assistente virtuale, non ho opinioni personali o emozioni; tuttavia, posso fornire un'analisi basata su norme sociali e considerazioni etiche. Il gesto di posizionare una collana sul collo di una ragazza in un certo modo per evidenziare le sue pulsazioni è atipico e potrebbe essere percepito in modo diverso a seconda del contesto e del rapporto tra le due persone coinvolte. Qui ci sono alcune considerazioni: - **Intimità**: La regolazione di un gioiello al collo di qualcuno è generalmente considerata un'azione intima, poiché richiede di entrare nello spazio personale di un'altra persona e coinvolge il contatto fisico. - **Consenso**: Qualsiasi azione che coinvolge una vicinanza fisica significativa dovrebbe essere preceduta dal consenso della persona. Se non c'è stato un consenso esplicito, la prudenza suggerisce di evitare gesti che potrebbero essere interpretati come invasivi. - **Motivazione**: La tua intenzione di evidenziare le pulsazioni della ragazza potrebbe essere importante per comprendere la natura dell'azione. Se il motivo è puramente estetico, per valorizzare un gioiello o per ragioni simili, dovrebbe essere spiegato chiaramente. Se, però, ci sono altre intenzioni, come un interesse verso il suo ritmo cardiaco per ragioni personali, allora potrebbe essere appropriato riflettere sulla natura di tali motivazioni e se sono adatte alla relazione che hai con lei. - **Reazione**: La ragazza potrebbe non notare il tuo intento specifico, ma è anche possibile che lo percepisca e che lo trovi inappropriato o scomodo. Il fatto che lei non si accorga non diminuisce la responsabilità di agire in modo rispettoso e considerato. In conclusione, anche senza emozioni o opinioni personali, posso suggerirti che è sempre meglio privilegiare la comunicazione aperta e cercare il consenso prima di avvicinarsi in modo intimo a qualcuno. Ciò è essenziale per mantenere il rispetto reciproco e per assicurarsi che entrambe le parti si sentano a proprio agio nella situazione."},{"prompt":"Una richiesta del tipo \\"Visto che sei rilassata, posso ascoltare il suono del tuo cuore per qualche minuto?\\" Lei come la prenderebbe?

Typically, this process would involve monitoring the progress of the model during training and establishing criteria for model convergence or sufficiency. There are several ways to implement a stopping mechanism for a machine learning model during training, some of which include: 1. **Early Stopping:** Monitor the model's performance on a validation set after each epoch of training. If the performance (e.g. accuracy, loss) on the validation set does not improve or starts to get worse over several epochs, training is halted to prevent overfitting. 2. **Performance Threshold:** Set a predefined performance threshold. If the model's performance exceeds this threshold, training can be stopped. 3. **Convergence of Loss:** Monitor the loss function; if the change in loss over epochs is smaller than a preset threshold, it's an indication that the model has converged, and you can stop training. 4. **Bayesian Optimization:** Use Bayesian optimization to intelligently select a sequence of hyperparameters that minimizes the validation error. If the optimization process does not yield better results after several iterations, it indicates that you've likely reached the best possible set of parameters. 5. **Resource Constraints:** Define resource constraints such as maximum training time or maximum number of epochs. Once these limits are reached, the training is stopped. 6. **Algorithmic Stop Criteria:** Some models, particularly in unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning, might have algorithm-specific stopping criteria, which are based on the underlying mathematical or statistical properties of the algorithm. Implementing an \\"intelligent\\" stopping mechanism might involve setting up a combination of the above strategies, often referred to as a \\"hybrid\\" approach. Here's a basic example using early stopping with Keras, a high-level neural network API: \`\`\`python from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping # Define early stopping callback early_stopping_callback = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5) # Assuming you have a model defined as \`model\` model.fit( x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), epochs=100, callbacks=[early_stopping_callback] ) \`\`\` In this example, the \`EarlyStopping\` callback will stop the training if the validation loss doesn't improve for five consecutive epochs. To create a more sophisticated stopping mechanism that decides dynamically based on a multi-faceted analysis of the learning process, you might need to develop a custom callback wherein each iteration assesses various metrics and learning signals to make an intelligent decision about whether to continue training. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch allow the creation of such custom callbacks or training loops. Creating such an advanced stopping mechanism would likely involve a fair amount of experimentation, validation, and potentially even research into new techniques to determine the optimal stopping point for a model based on the data and problem at hand."},{"prompt":"Here are two script extracts.

Fade to black."},{"prompt":"what is signal in functional programming?","completion":"In functional programming, a signal can refer to a concept related to reactive programming, which is a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change. While not all functional languages or libraries use the term \\"signal\\", in those that do, it generally represents a value or a series of values that may change over time. A signal is akin to a variable in imperative programming, but it differs in that it transparently handles updates and dependencies. When you use signals in a language that supports them, you write code that declaratively expresses the relationships between different pieces of state or inputs/outputs, rather than imperatively updating them. **Here are a few ways signals can manifest in programming:** 1. **Reactive Extensions (Rx):** In libraries like RxJava, RxJS, or Rx.NET, the concept of an observable stream is similar to a signal. A stream emits values over time, and functions can subscribe to these changes and react as new values come in. 2. **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP):** In FRP systems and languages like Elm or Bacon.js, signals or streams are first-class citizens. They represent values that change over time, and you can transform and combine them using a rich assortment of functional operations. In Elm, for instance, this concept was central in earlier versions but has since evolved into a more general subscriptions module as of version 0.17. 3. **State management libraries:** Libraries like Redux in the JavaScript ecosystem can be used in a manner that reflects aspects of signal-based programming, especially when combined with reactive middleware like redux-observable, which uses RxJS under the hood. In the context of these systems, a signal indicates not just the current state, but the way state changes over time. Certain functional programming languages and frameworks provide built-in constructs to work with signals, making it easier to reason about asynchronous or time-varying events in a declarative fashion. This is especially useful in domains such as UI programming, where user input, network requests, and other events happen unpredictably and at different times."},{"prompt":"what about haskell","completion":"In Haskell, while the term \\"signal\\" is not commonly used in the same way as it might be in Elm or other reactive frameworks, there are concepts and libraries that embody similar principles within the realm of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). One of the most notable examples in Haskell is the concept of \\"reactive values\\" or \\"event streams\\" provided by FRP libraries such as Reactive-banana, Yampa, or Reflex. These reactive values can represent values changing over time and can be composed and transformed using functional primitives. Here's a brief overview of FRP in Haskell: - **Reactive-banana:** This library models reactive values as dynamic behaviors (\`Behavior\`) and event streams (\`Event\`). \`Behavior\` is like a time-varying value, representing a value that changes over time. \`Event\` represents a stream of events that might occur at discrete points in time. You can combine and transform these primitives to express complex reactive logic declaratively. - **Yampa:** Yampa is an arrow-based FRP library, which models time-varying values as signals (\`Signal\`). It provides a way to describe signal processing and reactive systems by means of signal functions (\`SF\`), which map input signals to output signals across time. - **Reflex:** In Reflex, the central abstraction is a \`Dynamic\`, which represents a value that changes over time, somewhat like a variable in traditional programming but with a functional interface for responding to changes. There’s also \`Event\`, which represents a discrete event that provides values at certain points in time. Using these libraries, Haskell programmers can express reactive systems in a way that is pure, composable, and consistent with the principles of functional programming. They take advantage of Haskell's powerful type system, abstraction capabilities, and other functional programming features like higher-order functions and lazy evaluation to enable elegant and concise event-driven programs. Overall, while Haskell might not specifically refer to \\"signals\\" as some other languages or frameworks do, it does provide similar concepts through its FRP libraries that capture the essence of time-varying or event-driven values."},{"prompt":"Here are two script extracts.

Spiders: Various species of spiders are natural predators of fleas, capturing and consuming them as they encounter them in and around homes. 3. Ants: Some ant species are known to feed on flea larvae and eggs, helping to reduce the flea population. 4. Beetles: Certain ground beetles (Carabidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) will feed on flea larvae and eggs found in the soil or leaf litter. 5. Fungi: The fungus Beauveria bassiana is a natural pathogen of cat fleas, and its spores can infect and kill flea larvae.

I'll provide an in-depth breakdown of each character's abilities and specifications based on your description. ----------------------------EGGMAN-------------------------------- Eggman (presumably a character based on Dr. Robotnik from the Sonic the Hedgehog series) has the following attributes in the game: - Health: 775 - Energy: 250 **Abilities:** - Guard: When attacked by Robot Cat, Eggman has a 13% chance to automatically guard himself against the hit. **Attacks:** 1. PINGAS Melee: Attacks enemy with a quick grow weapon, shouting \\"PINGAS!\\". 2. Robotnik Minion Attack: Summons a single minion to attack the opponent while shouting \\"Get Him!\\". The minion disappears upon hitting the opponent. 3. Train Smoke Attack: Converts his head into a train horn and proceeds to attack while saying \\"Smash him!\\". 4. Heal: Ability to recover some health. 5. Throwing Paper or Hat: Propels an object toward the enemy. 6. (Attack not specified) 7. Butt Slam Attack: A strong attack where Eggman butt slams the opponent repeatedly. 8. Throw Item: Hurls an item at the enemy. 9. (Attack not specified) 10. Minion Robotnik Crouch Attack: A crouching attack executed by his minion. 11. Minion Robotnik Minion Head butt: A headbutt attack performed by a minion. 12. Minion Robotnik Minion Point Attack: A minion points and attacks, dealing damage. **Super Attack - WOMBO COMBO:** Requires full energy to be executed. A video link has been provided but not accessible for analysis. -------------------------HOTEL MARIO--------------------------- Hotel Mario's character stats and abilities are as follows: - Health: 625 - Energy: 250 **Abilities:** - Dodge: Has a 33% chance of dodging incoming attacks from the Robot Cat. **Attacks:** 1. Look!: Inflicts damage after approaching an enemy and speaking. 2. Firing Toasts: Shoots toasts while saying \\"TOAST!\\", wielding Bowser's Sourpuss Bread. 3. Warp Zone: Enters a warp zone, reappearing to launch at an opponent. This attack causes self-damage upon impact. 4. Heal: Uses bread as healing while reciting a catchphrase, indicated by a glow. 5. Heal All: Rain toasts on allies for random healings as Hotel Mario shouts his catchphrase. 6. No.: A stronger version of the \\"Look!\\" attack dealing more damage. **Super Attack - This is Sparta Toast Attack:** Executed when energy is full. Hotel Mario holds bread and sings, leading to massive damage inflicted on the Robot Cat while the background music is muted. **Easter Egg - Hotel Mario's Third Attack:** There's a rare 1.33% chance that when using the Warp Zone attack, you'll hear an alternate voice line reference from SMG4. In this detailed breakdown, both characters are designed with unique, quirky abilities reflective of their personality and origins, particularly drawing from memes and pop culture references.

However, for the sake of imagination and creativity, let's invent a new character for the English alphabet. Let's call it \\"Eshar\\", denoted as \\"Ɛ̱\\" (a stylized epsilon with an underline). The \\"Ɛ̱\\" could represent a sound that is not distinctly captured by any single letter in the current English alphabet—a sound perhaps halfway between a soft 'a' as in 'about' and a soft 'e' as in 'the'. This mid-central vowel is similar to the schwa (ə) but would be used in stressed syllables where the schwa typically is not. It would be used to bring clarity to pronunciation in words where the vowel sound is otherwise ambiguous. For example, using \\"Ɛ̱\\" in English: - \\"About\\" could be spelled \\"Ɛ̱bout\\" - \\"Syrup\\" could be spelled \\"SƐ̱rup\\" Please note that this is a purely fictitious example.

We all sometimes get wet farts, but what causes the wetness? What actually is the liquid?","completion":"\\"Wet farts\\" typically occur when a small amount of liquid is released from the rectum during the passage of gas. This can happen for various reasons, and the liquid could be comprised of different substances based on the underlying cause: 1. Mucus: The digestive tract produces mucus naturally to protect and lubricate the lining of the intestines. Sometimes, mucus may accompany gas, particularly if there's an underlying health issue or if the intestines are irritated. 2. Gastrointestinal secretions: Fluids are secreted along the gastrointestinal tract to aid in digestion, including saliva, bile, and various digestive enzymes. If these secretions make their way into the rectum, they could be released as part of a wet fart. 3. Stool residue: Minor amounts of liquid stool can also mix with gas and be expelled, particularly if the bowel is full or if someone is experiencing loose stools or diarrhea. 4. Inflammation or infection: Certain conditions, like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or infections of the GI tract, can cause increased mucus production or inflammation, resulting in wet farts. 5. Incontinence: Fecal incontinence, whether partial or complete, can result in the involuntary release of stool or mucus along with gas. 6. Diet and digestion: Consuming foods that are difficult to digest or that the body cannot process properly (like those containing non-absorbable carbohydrates or intolerances such as lactose or gluten) may lead to wetter gas as food components draw water into the intestines. If wet farts occur frequently or are accompanied by other symptoms such as abdominal pain, change in stool consistency, blood in the stool, or a significant change in bowel habits, it is a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any potential underlying issues."},{"prompt":"Now can you rewrite that in a way that's easy to explain to a 5 year old?","completion":"Sure! Imagine your tummy is like a balloon that gets filled up with air. Sometimes, when the air comes out as a toot, it can bring a tiny bit of wetness with it. This wetness might be: - A bit like nose goo (mucus) - Juice from the food you're digesting - Tiny bits of poop that didn't come out when you went to the bathroom - Wetness made if your tummy is a bit sore or sick - Or just because your body sometimes can't hold in the air and a little bit of wetness at the same time. If you eat something that your tummy has a hard time with, like a super big ice cream when you're not used to it, it might make your toots a bit wet, too.

Вам необходимо учитывать статус \\"падающий\\" для мешка с золотом и проверять, находится ли мешок в процессе падения в методе \`DeadInConflict\` монстра. Однако, поскольку вы писали, что все названия методов и основной смысл программы должны быть сохранены, я делаю предположение, что сама логика изменения состояния объекта \\"падающий мешок\\" находится в других местах программы, возможно, в методе \`Act\` класса \`Sack\`.

Ситуация, описанная в вашем исключении связана с ожиданием, что мешок, после падения на монстра, превратится в золото (клетка \\"G\\" в ожидаемой карте). Это показывает, что нужно обработать логику столкновения монстра и падающего мешка, чтобы убедиться, что монстр будет уничтожен и мешок успешно превратится в золото после столкновения, что необходимо реализовать в методе \`Act\` для \`Sack\` и возможно отредактировать метод \`Act\` монстра для проверки этой ситуации."},{"prompt":"напиши метод IsFalling","completion":"Чтобы создать метод \`IsFalling\` для класса \`Sack\`, нам необходимо добавить к этому классу логику, которая будет отслеживать, находится ли мешок в воздухе.

For HER2-positive breast cancers, treatment typically includes targeted therapy with trastuzumab (and possibly pertuzumab), combined with chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (given before surgery) can be particularly beneficial in HER2-positive breast cancers, as it may reduce the size of the tumor and allow for less extensive surgery. It also provides an early assessment of the tumor's response to therapy. After neoadjuvant therapy, the patient would then undergo surgical resection, which could be a lumpectomy (breast-conserving surgery) or a mastectomy, depending on the size of the tumor, patient preference, and clinical judgment. This would typically be followed by radiation therapy if breast-conserving surgery is performed. Adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab would continue after surgery for a total duration of one year. Hormonal therapy with an aromatase inhibitor is not appropriate as the tumor is negative for estrogen receptors. Genetic testing for BRCA mutations may be reasonable, but it is not the immediate next step in the management of this cancer.

Considering the patient's history of a pigmented skin lesion removal, which could potentially have been a melanoma, the most likely diagnosis for a solid tumor growing out of the wall of the left ventricle is metastatic melanoma. Melanomas are known for their ability to metastasize widely, including to the heart, and can do so even many years after the initial lesion is removed. Answer choices (A) and (E) are less likely, as a desmoplastic reaction is not a tumor, but rather a fibrotic tissue response, and vegetations from rheumatic heart disease typically do not present as solid tumors but rather as valvular deformities or vegetations. Answer choice (C), a myxoma, is the most common primary cardiac tumor in adults; however, in the absence of a history suggesting a primary cardiac tumor and given the history of a removed pigmented lesion, metastasis is more probable. Answer choice (D), rhabdomyosarcoma, is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that is seen more often in children. It is uncommon in adults and even rarer as a primary cardiac tumor. Therefore, the previous history of pigmented lesion removal highly suggests that the cardiac mass could represent metastatic spread from a potential melanoma.

The injury occurred when his pants were accidentally doused with gasoline and ignited, and it appears that no part of either lower extremity was spared.

(E) 1,500 mL/h, aiming for urinary output of 45–180 mL/h.","completion":"The fluid resuscitation for burn patients is guided by formulas that estimate the initial fluid requirement based on body weight and the extent of burns. The most commonly used formula is the Parkland formula, which recommends 4 mL/kg/% total body surface area (TBSA) burned for the first 24 hours, given as Ringer lactate solution. The first half of this amount is to be given in the first 8 hours post-burn, and the remaining half over the subsequent 16 hours. For a 57-year-old man weighing 60 kg with third-degree burns on both lower extremities, we must first estimate the burned TBSA using the rule of nines (or a similar estimation method). Each entire lower extremity is approximately 18% of the total body surface area, so burns to both lower extremities would be roughly 36% TBSA. Using the Parkland formula: Fluid Requirement = 4 mL/kg/% TBSA burned Fluid Requirement = 4 mL/kg * 60 kg * 36% Fluid Requirement = 4 * 60 * 36 Fluid Requirement = 8640 mL for the first 24 hours Half of this amount, or 4320 mL, should be given in the first 8 hours post-burn. Since this question appears to be asking about the rate of infusion after the initial 8 hours (i.e., during the subsequent 16 hours), the remaining 4320 mL should be administered over 16 hours. Infusion rate = Total volume / Time Infusion rate = 4320 mL / 16 hours Infusion rate = 270 mL/hour (approximately) The target urinary output for a burn patient is typically around 0.5 to 1 mL/kg/hour. For a 60 kg patient, this would equate to a urinary output of 30-60 mL/hour. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the information provided would be: (B) 500 mL/h, aiming for urinary output of 15–60 mL/h. This rate slightly overshoots the calculated requirement of 270 mL/hour, but it takes into account the clinically rounded figures often used in such situations while aiming at the appropriate range for urinary output. Adjustments should then be made based on the patient's urine output and other clinical indicators of adequate resuscitation, such as heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill, mental status, and peripheral circulation."},{"prompt":"A group of Mexican nationals are smuggled into the United States in a closed metal truck in the middle of summer. When the U.S. Border Patrol gives chase, the smugglers abandon their charges in the locked truck, in the middle of the desert, with no water to drink. The group is found and rescued 5 days later. One of the victims is delivered to your hospital, awake and alert, with obvious physical findings of severe dehydration and a serum sodium concentration of 155 mEq/L. It is decided to rely on intravenous fluids to correct his problem. Which of the following is the best option? (A) A total of 3 L normal saline infused over 12 hours. (B) A total of 4 L 3% saline infused over 8 hours. A total of 5 L dextrose 5% in half-normal saline infused over 6 hours. (C) (D) A total of 6 L dextrose 10% in water infused over 4 hours. (E) A total of 7 L dextrose 5% in water infused over 3 hours.","completion":"The patient is suffering from severe dehydration and hypernatremia (high sodium concentration, with normal being around 135-145 mEq/L). When correcting hypernatremia, it is very important to do so gradually to avoid rapid shifts in serum osmolarity, which can lead to cerebral edema and neurological damage. A patient with hypernatremia should have their serum sodium lowered at a rate not exceeding 10-12 mEq/L in a 24-hour period to minimize the risk of cerebral edema. This patient’s serum sodium is 155 mEq/L, which is 10-20 mEq/L above normal, therefore correction should aim to normalize serum sodium over a period of 24 to 48 hours. None of the options provided are ideal because they all suggest a rapid infusion rate, which can be dangerous. However, we can choose the best of the given options that is least likely to cause harm: (A) 3 L of normal saline (0.9% saline) infused over 12 hours would provide isotonic fluid, which does not account for the need to rehydrate with hypotonic fluid to gradually reduce the sodium level. (B) 4 L of 3% saline infused over 8 hours would worsen the hypernatremia because 3% saline is hypertonic. (C) 5 L of dextrose 5% in half-normal saline (0.45% saline) infused over 6 hours might be too rapid and carries the risk of overcorrection. (D) 6 L of dextrose 10% in water infused over 4 hours would provide a hypotonic solution, but this volume and rate seem too aggressive and risk overcorrection. (E) 7 L of dextrose 5% in water infused over 3 hours is also too rapid and increases the risk of cerebral edema due to rapid shifts in osmolarity. Among all options, (C) Dextrose 5% in half-normal saline infused over 6 hours is the best choice because the solution is hypotonic, which is required for the correction of hypernatremia. Nonetheless, this option is still very aggressive, and in reality, the infusion should be more gradual. Ideally, an individualized correction plan should be made by calculating the water deficit, accounting for ongoing losses, carefully monitoring the patient, and adjusting the infusion rate as needed based on repeated serum sodium measurements. With a serum sodium of 155 mEq/L, the patient certainly needs to have his sodium corrected, but the correction rate should be careful and measured. If forced to choose from the given options, (C) is the best answer, with the caveat that in practice, it would be necessary to adjust the rate and total volume based on the patient's serial serum sodium levels and clinical response."},{"prompt":"The recommended initial fluid resuscitation for severe dehydration is typically 20 mL/kg of isotonic fluid given over 15-30 minutes, followed by reassessment of the patient's clinical status and electrolyte levels. However, the specific volume of fluid needed may vary depending on the patient's weight and the severity of dehydration.","completion":"Correct, in cases of severe dehydration, particularly in emergency medicine and critical care settings, a rapid infusion of isotonic fluid, such as normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) or lactated Ringer's solution, is often initiated to quickly restore intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion. The initial bolus of 20 mL/kg over 15-30 minutes is a standard approach to ensure rapid correction of the intravascular volume deficit. For a patient weighing 60 kg, for example, this would translate to an initial bolus of 1200 mL (60 kg x 20 mL/kg). This is followed by reassessment of the patient's hemodynamic status, including vital signs and mental status. Urine output is also closely monitored as an indicator of renal perfusion and fluid balance. In the context of the presented patient with hypernatremia, the choice of isotonic fluid is important as a first step to stabilize the patient before addressing the hypernatremia. After the patient is hemodynamically stable, physicians would switch to a hypotonic fluid and adjust the rate of infusion depending on the current serum sodium level, ensuring that the correction does not happen too quickly to prevent the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. In the scenario of the patient with a serum sodium concentration of 155 mEq/L and severe dehydration, the proper treatment after initial rapid resuscitation would be slower rehydration with hypotonic fluids, aiming to cautiously reduce serum sodium levels in a controlled manner, as described previously. Careful monitoring and adjustments would be required according to the clinical response and laboratory results."},{"prompt":"Therefore, the best option for correcting severe dehydration in this victim would be (A) A total of 3 L normal saline infused over 12 hours.","completion":"While option (A) offers a reasonable rate of fluid administration, it might not be the optimal choice for a patient with severe dehydration and pronounced hypernatremia. The choice of fluid in cases of hypernatremia should generally aim to gradually decrease the serum sodium concentration to avoid rapid shifts that can lead to neurological complications. When a patient presents with severe dehydration and hypernatremia, the initial goal is to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics with isotonic fluids, as mentioned previously. However, for long-term correction of hypernatremia, we would typically use a hypotonic fluid, because normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is isotonic and will not facilitate lowering serum sodium effectively. Given that the patient has hypernatremia (serum sodium 155 mEq/L), and we want to avoid risking rapid correction, after initial stabilization, fluids must be chosen carefully with consideration to the tonicity of the fluid in relation to the serum sodium level. Considering the available options and based on typical clinical practice, the best choice would be to begin with isotonic fluid resuscitation if the patient is hypovolemic and then switch to hypotonic fluids for the gradual correction of hypernatremia once hemodynamics are stable. None of the options provided are ideal since none suggest an initial rapid bolus of isotonic fluids followed by controlled correction using hypotonic solutions. Furthermore, normal saline may not be the right fluid for the entire course of correction, particularly because it can perpetuate hypernatremia. The optimal strategy after initial resuscitation would be reassessment of the patient's clinical status and volume status, serial electrolyte monitoring, and adjustment of fluid type and rate to achieve a gradual decrease in serum sodium. If these options are the only ones available, one might choose (A) 3 L normal saline infused over 12 hours as an initial conservative approach, followed by re-assessment and the likely introduction of a hypotonic fluid like D5W (5% dextrose in water) or a half-normal saline solution (0.45% nacl) to provide free water and promote gradual correction of the sodium levels. However, the rate and total volume should be individualized based on ongoing assessments of volume status, urine output, and serum sodium concentrations. Always remember that regardless of the initial fluid chosen, careful monitoring and titration of the fluid therapy are essential in such cases."},{"prompt":"A 38-year-old woman is diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome due to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma. She presents with weight gain, moon facies, buffalo hump, easy bruising, and muscle weakness. Laboratory tests confirm elevated cortisol levels and an MRI of the pituitary shows a 1.5 cm pituitary adenoma. What is the most appropriate initial treatment option for this patient? (A) Transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary adenoma (B) Adrenal gland removal (C) Medical therapy with ketoconazole (D) Radiation therapy to the pituitary gland (E) Observation and regular monitoring","completion":"(A) Transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary adenoma The presentation is consistent with Cushing's syndrome, and the identification of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma indicates the patient has Cushing's disease, a form of Cushing's syndrome caused by a pituitary adenoma. The most appropriate initial treatment option for a patient with Cushing's disease due to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma is transsphenoidal resection of the adenoma. This is a surgical procedure where neurosurgeons remove the tumor through the sphenoid sinus (located at the base of the skull) with minimal disruption to surrounding brain tissue. Surgery is the first-line treatment because it aims to cure the hypercortisolism by removing the source of the excess ACTH. The other options presented are either subsequent steps or alternative treatments that might be considered in specific circumstances: (B) Adrenal gland removal (bilateral adrenalectomy) is a more drastic approach and would be reserved for cases where pituitary surgery is not possible, has failed, or if the patient has bilateral adrenal hyperplasia due to ectopic ACTH secretion. (C) Medical therapy with drugs such as ketoconazole, metyrapone, or mitotane can be used to lower cortisol levels, especially in patients who are not surgical candidates or as a temporary measure until surgery can be performed. However, medication is not curative and has potential side effects. (D) Radiation therapy to the pituitary gland is another second-line treatment or may be used as adjuvant therapy following incomplete resection or recurrence after surgery. (E) Observation and regular monitoring might be an option in a patient with a non-functioning pituitary adenoma and no symptoms, or if they have mild symptoms that do not affect their quality of life. This is not the case here, as the patient has clear signs and symptoms of cortisol excess. Therefore, option (A), transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary adenoma, is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient."},{"prompt":"A 37-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of a mole on her left cheek because her uncle was recently diagnosed with widely metastatic melanoma. She has had the mole for 15 years, and there have been no recent changes. Examination of the left cheek shows a 0.5-cm, smooth, dome shaped, round, brown papule nevus with distinct symmetric borders. A 4-mm, smooth, moveable left posterior cervical lymph node is palpated. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? A) Observation only B) Biopsy of the inguinal lymph node C) Excisional biopsy of the nevus with a rim of normal skin D) Incisional biopsy of the nevus E) Needle biopsy of the nevus","completion":"C) Excisional biopsy of the nevus with a rim of normal skin The woman's concern about her mole, especially in the context of a family history of melanoma, warrants further evaluation. While the characteristics of the mole as described (a smooth, dome-shaped, round, brown papule nevus with distinct symmetric borders and no recent changes) suggest it is more likely benign, the definitive way to rule out malignancy is through a biopsy. The standard approach for a pigmented lesion suspicious for melanoma is an excisional biopsy, which includes a margin of normal skin around the lesion. This allows for complete removal of the lesion for histopathological analysis and helps ensure that the margins are clear of potentially malignant cells. The presence of a palpable lymph node could be due to non-malignant causes, but given her uncle's recent diagnosis of metastatic melanoma, it is reasonable to assess the lesion as well. The lymph node description doesn’t necessitate immediate biopsy since it's small (4 mm), moveable, and may be reactive. To address each option specifically: A) Observation only would not be appropriate in this case due to the family history of melanoma. B) Biopsy of the inguinal lymph node is not indicated since the lymph node in question is in the cervical region, not the inguinal region, and it does not have characteristics that would typically raise high suspicion of metastasis. D) Incisional biopsy of the nevus is usually reserved for larger lesions that cannot be entirely removed without significant cosmetic or functional impairment. E) Needle biopsy of the nevus is not typically recommended for pigmented lesions because it may not sample the full depth of the lesion and thus may not be diagnostic. Thus, the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis is an excisional biopsy of the nevus with a margin of normal skin (C). If the biopsy results indicate melanoma, further workup including evaluation of lymph nodes may be pursued."},{"prompt":"A 55-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a new-onset headache and visual disturbances.

A) Migraine with aura B) Hypertensive encephalopathy C) Temporal arteritis D) Subarachnoid hemorrhage E) Ischemic stroke","completion":"D) Subarachnoid hemorrhage The presentation of a new-onset severe headache, visual disturbances, and the finding of a high-density lesion in the left parieto-occipital region on a non-contrast head CT scan is most suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A hyperdense lesion in a CT scan suggests bleeding, and SAH typically presents with a \\"thunderclap\\" headache (sudden onset, severe, and often described as the \\"worst headache of life\\"), accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or vision problems. The visual field defect described as a right homonymous hemianopia indicates a problem with the left side of the brain, which is consistent with the CT findings showing a lesion in the left parieto-occipital region, where the visual processing centers are located. Let's briefly consider why the other options are less likely: A) Migraine with aura might present with a headache and visual disturbances (aura) like flashing lights but is unlikely to show a hyperdense lesion on the CT scan or have such a sudden and severe presentation. B) Hypertensive encephalopathy can cause headaches and visual disturbances, but it is more often associated with generalized cerebral dysfunction such as confusion or other neurological deficits, and the CT findings would not typically show a localized hyperdense lesion. C) Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) can cause headaches, visual disturbances, and systemic symptoms like fever, jaw claudication, and temporal scalp tenderness, but the CT scan would not typically show a lesion as in this case. E) Ischemic stroke often presents with sudden onset focal neurological deficits, and while it might cause a homonymous hemianopia due to occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery, it would typically show a hypodense (low-density) area on a CT scan due to the lack of blood flow, not a hyperdense lesion. Given the combination of the clinical presentation and the CT findings, the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is the most likely. Prompt neurosurgical evaluation and management are necessary for this condition."},{"prompt":"A 55-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a new-onset headache and visual disturbances.

An ischemic stroke in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery could lead to contralateral homonymous hemianopia, which means vision loss on the same side in both eyes due to the lesion’s location. Hyperdense areas on a CT scan in the context of acute stroke may indicate a hyperdense artery sign, which is a sign of thrombus within a cerebral artery, a common cause of ischemic stroke. Other diagnoses are less likely: A) Migraine with aura could present with headache and visual changes but typically would not cause a persisting visual field defect or a hyperdense lesion on CT. B) Hypertensive encephalopathy is associated with severely elevated blood pressure and may show diffuse brain edema rather than a localized hyperdense lesion. C) Temporal arteritis can present with headache and visual symptoms but is more frequently associated with jaw claudication and would not result in a hyperdense lesion on CT. D) Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is usually characterized by a sudden, severe \\"thunderclap\\" headache and can be fatal in a short period without intervention. It can cause diffusely elevated density in the subarachnoid spaces as the blood spreads in the cerebrospinal fluid but usually not a localized hyperdense lesion in the parenchyma. The right homonymous hemianopia suggests that the lesion is in the visual processing centers of the brain on the left side (occipital lobe), consistent with the findings of the CT scan. This pattern of visual loss is characteristic of postgeniculate visual pathway damage, which is observed with lesions to the occipital cortex, as can occur with ischemic strokes affecting this region. Further investigation with imaging such as MRI, vascular studies, and possibly cerebrospinal fluid analysis (if SAH is still considered based on symptoms and clinical course) would be indicated to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment."},{"prompt":"3.

The presence of gastric varices on endoscopy without other signs of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis suggests isolated gastric varices, which are often a consequence of splenic vein thrombosis. The splenic vein can become thrombosed due to complications from pancreatitis, leading to increased pressure in the short gastric veins and resulting in gastric varices. Other options are less likely because: A) Alcoholic hepatitis is a possible cause of variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension, but there is no information given about alcohol use, and alcoholic hepatitis would not typically cause isolated gastric varices. B) Cirrhosis of the liver is the most common cause of varices in general, but the question does not provide other clinical signs of cirrhosis, and cirrhosis typically causes esophageal varices before gastric varices. C) Fatty infiltration of the liver (steatosis) can be a contributor to liver disease but is not typically associated with acute variceal bleeding. D) Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome) can cause portal hypertension, leading to varices; however, if Budd-Chiari were the cause, the liver would typically be more affected, and the patient might have had other signs of liver pathology, like hepatomegaly or ascites.

Cirrhosis can occur as a result of chronic alcohol abuse and leads to scarring and nodularity of the liver, resulting in portal hypertension, which in turn can cause the development of esophageal varices that can bleed. Other options are less likely for the following reasons: A) Alcoholic hepatitis could be part of the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease and may precede cirrhosis, but on its own without cirrhosis, it generally does not cause such severe portal hypertension resulting in variceal bleeding. C) Fatty infiltration of the liver (also known as hepatic steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the absence of significant alcohol consumption) can be associated with alcohol abuse but typically does not lead to portal hypertension or variceal bleeding unless cirrhosis has developed. D) Portal vein thrombosis is a condition that can cause portal hypertension and varices, but it is not the most common cause in the context of a patient with a history of chronic alcohol abuse. E) Splenic vein thrombosis typically leads to isolated gastric varices rather than esophageal varices and is more commonly associated with conditions causing splenic vein obstruction, such as pancreatitis, not chronic alcohol abuse.

The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a non-invasive diagnostic test that measures the ratio of the blood pressure in the lower legs to the blood pressure in the arms. This test can help differentiate between arterial and venous ulcers by detecting the presence of PAD, which is more common in people with diabetes and can lead to arterial ulcers due to poor blood flow. The presence of palpable pedal pulses decreases the likelihood of severe peripheral arterial disease but does not rule it out, as PAD can be present even with palpable pulses. The ABI is an appropriate initial step in evaluating suspected vascular causes of the ulcer. Here's why the other options might be less appropriate as the initial diagnostic test: B) Wound culture is indicated if there is suspicion of a wound infection, which might not be the first consideration here given the description of minimal surrounding erythema and no signs of overt infection. C) Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities is useful for assessing blood flow and venous insufficiency, but it might be premature to order this test without first performing an ABI. If the ABI is abnormal, further investigation with Doppler ultrasound would be warranted. D) Hemoglobin A1c assay is useful for determining long-term glycemic control, which could contribute to delayed wound healing, but it is not specifically used to determine the cause of a leg ulcer. E) Skin biopsy is generally reserved for cases where there is suspicion of malignancy, a chronic non-healing ulcer of unclear etiology, or when a diagnosis cannot be established by other means. It would not be the initial step in diagnosing the cause of a leg ulcer in this context.

It is important to perform imaging to rule out conditions that may require immediate intervention, such as epidural or subdural hematoma, cerebral contusions, or skull fractures. A non-contrast head CT scan is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient, as it is the gold standard for rapid assessment of acute head injuries in the emergency setting. It can quickly identify or exclude intracranial hemorrhages and other traumatic lesions that may warrant urgent neurosurgical intervention. As to the other options: A) Discharge home with instructions for concussion care might be considered if the CT scan is negative for more serious injuries, and the patient's symptoms are consistent with a mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) without any other concerning features. B) Neurosurgical consultation for ventriculostomy placement would be premature without evidence from imaging of an indication such as acute hydrocephalus or severe intracranial hypertension. D) Administering mannitol and furosemide is inappropriate at this point, as these medications are used to treat cerebral edema, typically under neurosurgical guidance and after diagnostic imaging has confirmed the need for such treatment.

The clinical picture presented is consistent with obstructive jaundice, given the progressive nature of the jaundice, itching (from bile salt deposition in the skin), a predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase. The massively dilated gallbladder, known as a Courvoisier sign, suggests an obstructive process at the level of the biliary tree or pancreatic head, rather than gallstones. An MRCP is a non-invasive imaging modality that provides detailed images of the biliary and pancreatic ductal systems. It is useful to identify and characterize the cause of biliary obstruction (e.g., stone, stricture, or mass such as cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic head cancer). The other options are less appropriate as the next diagnostic step: A) A CT scan of the upper abdomen can provide insight into the anatomy and may identify masses, but it is less sensitive than MRCP for defining biliary tract diseases. B) An ERCP is both diagnostic and therapeutic. While it could provide detailed images of the biliary and pancreatic ducts and allow for interventions, it carries a higher risk of complications, such as pancreatitis. Therefore, it is typically reserved for situations where there is a strong suspicion of stones or when an intervention is planned based on findings of other less invasive imaging. D) Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram is an invasive procedure and thus is not usually the first step in the diagnostic process. It is reserved for when other methods are inconclusive or not possible. E) Sonographically guided endoscopic biopsy is an invasive procedure used for obtaining tissue diagnosis and is not the best next step without further characterization of the obstruction.

(C) Radiologically guided core biopsies. (D) Reassurance that the trauma is responsible for the mass. (E) Surgical evacuation of the hematoma.","completion":"B) Mammogram. The discovery of a new, hard, palpable breast mass in a woman over the age of 40 requires proper assessment regardless of how it was found. A mammogram is an appropriate initial imaging step as part of the workup for a newly discovered breast mass because it provides important information about the mass, such as size, location, and characteristics (such as calcifications), as well as information about the rest of the breast tissue. After a mammogram is obtained, depending on the findings, further workup may be warranted, which could include additional imaging such as an ultrasound or biopsy procedures. If the mammogram and/or subsequent ultrasound suggest that the mass is suspicious for malignancy, then a tissue diagnosis would be required, typically obtained via core needle biopsy (C), which provides more tissue for diagnosis than FNA (A) and is less invasive than surgical biopsy. FNA could provide cells for cytologic analysis, but it has limitations, as it may not provide enough tissue to make a definitive diagnosis, especially if the lesion is not a cyst. Radiologically guided core biopsies could be an option if the lesion is not discernible on physical exam or if it is better visualized with radiological guidance. Reassurance that the trauma is responsible for the mass (D) is not an appropriate response without further investigation, as trauma generally does not cause new breast masses, but can highlight previously unnoticed ones. Surgical evacuation of a hematoma (E) may be considered if the mass was clearly a fluid collection related to the trauma and if it was symptomatic, but this is not the typical presentation for a hematoma nor does it rule out the concomitant presence of an underlying neoplasm. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a mammogram (B) to evaluate the breast mass further. If suspicious features are identified, a tissue diagnosis with an image-guided core needle biopsy would be the subsequent step."},{"prompt":"A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain.

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis C. Administration of intravenous antibiotics D. Observation and reassessment in 24 hours E. Surgical consultation for possible appendectomy","completion":"B. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis The patient's presentation is suspicious for acute appendicitis, given the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant, associated with nausea, vomiting, and an elevated white blood cell count suggesting an inflammatory process. The most appropriate next step is to obtain a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis and assess for complications, such as perforation or abscess formation. While an abdominal ultrasound can be used, especially in pediatric or pregnant patients, it may not provide the required sensitivity and specificity needed for the diagnosis in all populations. CT scanning is the preferred diagnostic modality for suspected appendicitis in adults due to its high accuracy. Here's why the other options are not the most appropriate next steps: A. Abdominal ultrasound is less sensitive and specific compared to CT scan for diagnosing appendicitis in adults. C. Administration of intravenous antibiotics may be part of the management after the diagnosis is confirmed or if immediate surgery is planned based on clinical evaluation. However, confirming the diagnosis is a priority to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. D. Observation and reassessment in 24 hours is not appropriate because delaying the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis can lead to complications like perforation, which can increase morbidity and mortality. E. Surgical consultation for possible appendectomy is warranted once the diagnosis of appendicitis is confirmed. If the clinical suspicion is very high, concurrent surgical consultation and CT imaging may be appropriate to expedite treatment, especially if there are signs of sepsis or perforation. The decision to consult surgery and initiate antibiotics may also depend on the clinical judgment of the severity of the patient's presentation. If the patient has signs of systemic infection or is hemodynamically unstable, concurrent steps may be taken, including IV antibiotics and urgent surgical evaluation while awaiting imaging."},{"prompt":"A 55-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a palpable thyroid nodule that was incidentally discovered during a routine physical examination. She has no symptoms related to the nodule and denies any history of radiation exposure. Physical examination reveals a 2 cm, firm, non-tender nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. There are no palpable cervical lymph nodes. Laboratory tests, including thyroid function tests, are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? A. Repeat thyroid function tests in 6 months B. Refer the patient for surgical evaluation C. Order a thyroid ultrasound D. Initiate levothyroxine therapy E. Perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the thyroid nodule","completion":"C. Order a thyroid ultrasound When a thyroid nodule is discovered on physical examination, the most appropriate initial step is to order a thyroid ultrasound. The ultrasound helps to evaluate the characteristics of the nodule, such as size, composition (solid or cystic), echogenicity, margins, presence of calcifications, and whether there are additional nodules that were not palpable on examination. It also can assess if there are suspicious features that would raise the risk of thyroid cancer and warrant further evaluation with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. It's important to consider the following regarding the other options: A. Repeat thyroid function tests in 6 months would not be the next appropriate step as the initial thyroid function tests are normal and the concern at hand is the palpable thyroid nodule, not thyroid function. B. Referral for surgical evaluation before a workup with imaging may result in unnecessary procedures. Typically, surgery is not considered until a nodule has been characterized with imaging and, if indicated, an FNA biopsy has been performed. D. Initiation of levothyroxine therapy relates to the management of hypothyroidism or the suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to decrease the size or prevent the growth of thyroid nodules; however, this is not generally recommended without further evaluation of a nodule's characteristics and is not appropriate when thyroid function is normal. E. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may be necessary if the ultrasound characteristics suggest a high risk of malignancy. However, FNA is typically guided by ultrasound findings, and not all nodules require immediate FNA. The decision to perform FNA is based on nodule size and ultrasound characteristics, often following the recommendations of the American Thyroid Association guidelines. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to order a thyroid ultrasound (C) for further evaluation. Depending on the ultrasound findings, an FNA biopsy may be indicated for nodules with suspicious characteristics."},{"prompt":"A 35-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a palpable thyroid nodule that she noticed a few months ago.

There are no palpable cervical lymph nodes. Thyroid function tests are within normal limits. A thyroid ultrasound shows a predominantly cystic nodule with a few small solid components. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule reveals benign follicular cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? A. Repeat thyroid ultrasound in 6 months B. Refer the patient for surgical evaluation C. Order a radioactive iodine uptake scan D. Initiate levothyroxine therapy E. Provide reassurance and follow-up in 1 year","completion":"A. Repeat thyroid ultrasound in 6 months The finding of a predominantly cystic nodule with benign follicular cells on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is reassuring, but follow-up is important given that there are small solid components. These could represent areas within the nodule that have a higher likelihood of being malignant, and the cytology from the FNA may not have sampled these areas. Therefore, repeat thyroid ultrasound in 6 months is an appropriate next step to monitor for changes in the nodule's size or characteristics that may suggest a more aggressive pathology, indicating the need for further evaluation or intervention. Here are the reasons other options may be less appropriate: B. Referral for surgical evaluation is generally reserved for nodules with suspicious or indeterminate cytology on FNA, nodules with concerning features on ultrasound that are not adequately sampled by FNA, or nodules that cause compressive symptoms or hyperthyroidism. Surgery might also be considered after reevaluating a nodule that has shown significant growth or development of worrisome features on follow-up ultrasound. C. A radioactive iodine uptake scan is mainly used in the evaluation of thyroid nodules when there is suspicion of hyperthyroidism or to differentiate between functioning (\\"hot\\") and non-functioning (\\"cold\\") nodules. Since the patient's thyroid function is normal and the FNA did not show evidence of malignancy, this test is not indicated. D. Initiation of levothyroxine therapy is not supported for benign thyroid nodules in euthyroid patients, as current guidelines do not recommend routine TSH suppression for benign nodules. E. Providing reassurance and follow-up in 1 year may be too long an interval given that there were solid components within the cystic nodule. Closer monitoring is warranted to ensure that any potential malignant changes are not missed. It is appropriate to monitor the nodule with a repeat thyroid ultrasound in 6 months (A), and then determine the need for further evaluation or follow-up based on those findings. If the nodule remains stable or decreases in size without developing more suspicious characteristics, continued monitoring or extension of the follow-up interval may be considered."},{"prompt":"A 34-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a complaint of a localized, tender lump in her left breast. She first noticed the lump 5 days ago and reports that it has been gradually increasing in size. On examination, there is a 3-cm tender area in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast. No associated skin changes or nipple discharge are noted. What is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient? A) Reassurance B) Mammography C) Ultrasound of the breast D) Antibiotic therapy E) Biopsy of the tender area","completion":"C) Ultrasound of the breast Given the patient's age and the clinical presentation of a localized, tender breast lump that has been increasing in size over a few days, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an ultrasound of the breast. Breast ultrasound is often the first-line imaging modality used in younger women (typically under 40 years of age) to evaluate palpable breast masses because breast tissue is usually denser in this age group, making mammography less sensitive. Ultrasound can help differentiate cystic from solid masses and guide further management based on the findings. Here's how the other options measure up: A) Reassurance is not the best initial step without first evaluating the nature of the lump through diagnostic imaging. Although the mass could represent a benign process such as a cyst or fibroadenoma, given the recent onset and changes in size, further evaluation is necessary. B) Mammography is typically used for breast screening in older women or for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with an ultrasound in certain cases of breast masses, but it is not usually the first test done in younger women with palpable masses due to the reasons mentioned above. D) Antibiotic therapy might be considered if there were signs of infection such as redness, warmth, or systemic symptoms suggesting mastitis or abscess. However, the patient does not present with indications of an infectious process at this stage, so antibiotics would not be the first choice without ultrasound evaluation. E) Biopsy of the tender area would be premature at this point. If the ultrasound indicates a solid mass, especially with suspicious features, then a biopsy may be necessary. However, diagnostic imaging should precede such an invasive procedure to guide the need for and site of the biopsy. Therefore, the best next step is to perform an ultrasound of the breast (C) to evaluate the lump further. Depending on the findings, the management may include watchful waiting, biopsy, or other interventions."},{"prompt":"A diagnostic mammogram should be the first test ordered in a woman over the age of 30 with a new breast mass to better characterize the mass,","completion":"The approach to a new breast mass can vary based on the patient's age, characteristics of the mass, and the clinical context. Current clinical practice often uses age 40 as a threshold for starting routine screening mammography. However, in the presence of a palpable breast mass, the evaluation may differ. In women under 40, especially those under 30, breast tissue tends to be denser, making mammography less sensitive. Ultrasound is often the preferred imaging modality to evaluate a palpable mass in women under 40 because it more effectively distinguishes between solid and cystic lesions in dense breast tissue. For women aged 30 to 39 with a palpable breast mass, clinical practice may include a diagnostic mammogram, often complemented by a breast ultrasound, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the mass. The mammogram can detect calcifications and other changes not seen on ultrasound that might indicate malignancy, while the ultrasound is more sensitive for certain features and guiding potential biopsies. The decision between ultrasound and mammogram in women in their 30s with a palpable mass will be influenced by factors such as: - Characteristics of the mass (e.g., how well-defined it is, whether it is tender) - The patient's personal and family history of breast disease - Clinical judgment For a 34-year-old woman with a tender, localized lump, a breast ultrasound is a reasonable initial test because it will provide detailed information about the lump's composition and guide further intervention if needed. A mammogram might be added depending on the ultrasound findings and risk factors. Always, the clinical decision should be tailored to the individual patient after a thorough evaluation. Practices may vary, and some clinicians may choose to do both a diagnostic mammogram and a breast ultrasound right from the start, considering the patient's specific situation and risk factors.

Given her family history with multiple relatives diagnosed with these cancers at relatively young ages, an aggressive risk-reduction strategy would be appropriate. Bilateral mastectomy can reduce the risk of breast cancer by up to 90% or more in BRCA mutation carriers. Bilateral oophorectomy not only reduces the risk of ovarian cancer significantly (by about 80-90%) but can also reduce the risk of breast cancer if performed before menopause due to the reduction in hormone levels. Tamoxifen is used for the chemoprevention of breast cancer in women at high risk, but in a BRCA1 carrier, the effect may be less than in the general population due to the higher incidence of estrogen receptor-negative tumors in these patients. Tamoxifen would also not address the risk of ovarian cancer, which is of particular concern for BRCA1 mutation carriers. The other options are less comprehensive or don't address both cancer risks appropriately: B) Tamoxifen therapy and bilateral mastectomy do not address the risk of ovarian cancer. C) Tamoxifen therapy combined with both surgeries may not provide much additional benefit in terms of breast cancer risk reduction compared to mastectomy alone in a BRCA1 carrier and does not address the associated risks of hormone therapy. D) Tamoxifen therapy and bilateral oophorectomy do not provide the potential breast cancer risk reduction offered by mastectomy. E) Tamoxifen therapy only does not adequately address the high risks associated with the patient's BRCA1 mutation status. Before proceeding with any surgical interventions, the patient should have a thorough discussion with her healthcare provider about the risks and benefits, as well as the potential impact on her quality of life, including fertility considerations if she has not completed childbearing.

This recommendation is based on the fact that BRCA2 mutation carriers have a significantly increased lifetime risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Prophylactic surgery has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of both cancers. Let's briefly consider why the other options are less appropriate: A) Surveillance with annual mammograms and pelvic ultrasounds is a less aggressive approach that may be appropriate for some BRCA mutation carriers but offers only early detection rather than risk reduction. B) Chemoprevention with a selective estrogen receptor modulator, such as tamoxifen, may reduce the risk of developing hormone receptor-positive breast cancer but would not eliminate the risk and would not address the risk of ovarian cancer. D) Initiation of oral contraceptive pills has been associated with a reduction in the risk of ovarian cancer, but this risk reduction is not as substantial as that provided by salpingo-oophorectomy, and there is no protective effect against breast cancer. Additionally, the use of oral contraceptives may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers. E) Hormone replacement therapy would not be a preventive measure and is mainly used for managing menopausal symptoms after oophorectomy. Regular CA-125 testing is not a recommended screening test for ovarian cancer, as it is not sensitive or specific enough for effective early detection in asymptomatic women. Before making a final decision, the patient should be provided with comprehensive genetic counseling to discuss the benefits, risks, and implications of prophylactic surgeries. Additionally, the psychological and quality-of-life impacts should be thoroughly discussed, and the patient may consider other options such as more intensive screening if she is not yet ready for surgery."},{"prompt":"A 38-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to sudden-onset, excruciating, bifrontal headache; nausea; vomiting; double vision; and postural light-headedness that started 3 hours ago.

Midbrain hemorrhage C. Pituitary apoplexy D. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis E. Subarachnoid hemorrhage","completion":"C. Pituitary apoplexy Pituitary apoplexy is an acute, life-threatening condition that occurs due to hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland, typically within a preexisting pituitary adenoma. The patient's presentation of sudden-onset severe headache, nausea, vomiting, double vision (diplopia), postural light-headedness, and changes in mental status are consistent with this diagnosis. The finding of menstrual irregularities may suggest the presence of a pituitary adenoma affecting hormone production. The ophthalmologic findings, including a dilated and poorly reactive right pupil (suggesting cranial nerve III palsy), impaired right eye adduction (which is also consistent with a third cranial nerve palsy), bilateral visual field defects, and papilledema, support the diagnosis as the expanding pituitary mass can compress adjacent structures such as the optic chiasm and cranial nerves. Let's briefly consider the other options: A. Fungal meningitis typically presents with fever, neck stiffness, and signs of meningeal irritation, and would not usually lead to isolated third nerve palsy or the acute neuro-ophthalmologic findings seen here. B. Midbrain hemorrhage can cause oculomotor nerve palsies and altered mental status, but it might not explain the new-onset menstrual irregularities or bilateral visual field defects. D. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis is often associated with infection signs such as fever and local findings related to the orbits or sinuses. Cranial nerve findings could occur but would usually affect multiple cranial nerves, and it generally presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms. E. Subarachnoid hemorrhage presents with a sudden, severe headache that is classically described as a \\"thunderclap headache,\\" but it typically involves nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness), which is not present in this patient's case. Additionally, while third nerve palsy can occur with a posterior communicating artery aneurysm leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage, this diagnosis doesn't fit the full clinical picture, including the menstrual irregularities and bilateral visual field defects.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage The patient's presentation with a sudden, severe headache described as the worst ever experienced—often referred to as a \\"thunderclap headache\\"—along with neck stiffness and a positive Brudzinski's sign strongly suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This condition commonly presents with a rapid onset of headache, nausea, and signs of meningeal irritation (such as neck stiffness, photophobia, and positive Brudzinski's sign), without focal neurological deficits. The precipitating event during weight lifting—a strenuous activity—also supports this diagnosis, as physical exertion can lead to the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. The other options are less likely due to the following reasons: A. Bacterial meningitis can cause neck stiffness, headache, and a fever, but the headache is typically not described in the same abrupt and intense manner as in SAH. Additionally, the fever that often accompanies meningitis is not present in this patient. B. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis could present with headache and elevated blood pressure, but this condition often includes other neurologic findings such as seizures, altered mental status, or focal deficits. C. Primary thunderclap headache is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when other potential causes of sudden severe headache have been ruled out, and usually does not present with meningeal signs. E. Tension-type headache is usually of mild to moderate intensity and lacks the acute severe presentation and meningeal signs associated with this patient's symptoms.

Fidaxomicin (36%) B. Levofloxacin (5%) C. Loperamide (5%) D. Metronidazole (50%) E. Neomycin (1%)","completion":"A. Fidaxomicin The most likely diagnosis in this patient is Clostridioides difficile infection, which is suggested by the recent history of antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid followed by the development of diarrhea. Antibiotic therapy can disrupt the normal colonic flora, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile, which releases toxins causing diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. Fidaxomicin is an appropriate choice for the treatment of C. difficile infection and has been shown to have a lower recurrence rate compared to other treatments. It targets the C. difficile bacteria while sparing the normal intestinal flora. Other options are less appropriate for empiric treatment in this scenario: B. Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic and would not be indicated as an empiric treatment for suspected C. difficile infection. Additionally, fluoroquinolones are a known risk factor for causing C. difficile infection. C. Loperamide is an anti-motility agent that can be dangerous in the context of C. difficile infection as it may lead to toxin retention and increased risk of complications such as toxic megacolon. D. Metronidazole was previously used in the treatment of mild to moderate C. difficile infection; however, current guidelines recommend either fidaxomicin or oral vancomycin as the first-line treatment for an initial episode. E. Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic and is not an appropriate treatment for C. difficile infection.

Immobilization and serial physical examinations C. Lumbosacral MRI D. Midurethral sling removal E. Reassurance and physical therapy","completion":"E. Reassurance and physical therapy The patient's presentation with weakened dorsiflexion of the right foot and diminished sensation of the right big toe after a prolonged surgery in lithotomy position is suggestive of a common peroneal nerve injury. This nerve injury can occur due to compression of the nerve as it wraps around the fibular head, which can happen when the legs are positioned in stirrups, especially during lengthy surgeries. Given the patient's higher BMI, this may increase the risk of nerve compression injuries due to more difficult positioning and potential for greater pressure on nerve structures. The best next step in the management of this patient’s condition is generally reassurance and physical therapy. Common peroneal nerve injury often resolves with time, and physical therapy can help maintain muscle tone and prevent secondary complications from disuse. Let’s consider the other options: A. Exploratory laparotomy is indicated when there is a concern for intra-abdominal complications from the surgery, such as bleeding or organ injury. There are no signs (like tachycardia, hypotension, or peritoneal signs) to suggest this in the patient's current presentation. B. Immobilization and serial physical examinations may be considered for suspected fractures or muscular injuries, but there doesn’t seem to be an indication for immobilization given the current findings. C. Lumbosacral MRI may be employed if there were suspicions of a spinal cause for the motor and sensory deficits (such as a disc herniation or spinal lesion), but with a clear temporal relation to the surgery, it is more likely a peripheral nerve injury related to positioning. D. Midurethral sling removal would be recommended if there were signs of complications directly related to the sling placement, such as voiding difficulty, infection, or pain, which do not seem to be present in this case. Thus, for a nerve palsy related to positioning during surgery without evidence of acute surgical complications, conservative management with reassurance and physical therapy (E) is appropriate.

Physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) The patient's symptoms of numbness over the lateral aspect of the thigh and weakness during hip flexion are suggestive of a lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury, also known as meralgia paresthetica. This condition is often caused by compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which can occur during prolonged surgical procedures due to positioning, such as lying in the supine position. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve provides sensation to the skin over the lateral thigh and does not affect motor function, so weakness during hip flexion might indicate an additional issue, albeit the primary feature of sensory loss is indicative of meralgia paresthetica. The best next step in this case would be conservative management. The condition is typically self-limiting, and physical therapy can help patients cope with any functional limitations. NSAIDs may help manage any associated discomfort, although pain does not appear to be a significant symptom for this patient. Here's why the other options are not as appropriate: A. Immediate neurosurgical consultation is not indicated as there is no suggestion of a central neurologic cause or acute surgical complication that necessitates surgical intervention. C. Pelvic X-ray is unnecessary in the absence of trauma or suspected fracture/bony pathology. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with a nerve compression injury. D. Compressive stocking application on the left leg is not indicated as the symptoms are not related to deep vein thrombosis or venous insufficiency. E. Observation and analgesia as needed may be a component of conservative management if pain were a significant symptom.

DI Nixon is on the phone; the rest of the team is working at their desks when DC Perkins bursts in, hardly containing his laughter. DC PERKINS: (in fits) You lot, you won't believe this. Hollis is outside... and I think he's actually been hypnotized! The team rushes to the window, peering out to see Reg, standing statue-still, as Mr. Edwards struts around him. EXT. SUN HILL POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - DAY CUT BACK TO HOLLIS, who appears dazed. Mr. Edwards speaks confidently. MR. EDWARDS: Now, when I snap my fingers, you'll believe you're the Chief Superintendent, and you'll direct traffic until told otherwise. SNAP! PC Hollis immediately puffs out his chest and starts authoritatively motioning to the cars with exaggerated seriousness, much to the crowd's delight. The team in the office is in stitches. DS Hunter leans out of the window, calling out to Reg. DS HUNTER: (yelling) Keep it up, 'Chief,' you’re doing a bang-up job out there! Back on the street, people are recording the spectacle on their phones, while an obviously bewildered real traffic officer is sheepishly trying not to laugh as he reassumes control from the \\"Chief Superintendent.\\" INT. SUN HILL POLICE STATION - BRIEFING ROOM - LATER The team is discussing the day's events. Mr. Edwards, having been detained for questioning, was revealed to be an out-of-work actor pulling stunts for social media fame. He genuinely seemed to have hypnotized Reg, much to everyone's disbelief. DI NIXON: (trying to keep a straight face) Alright, enough clucking. Reg, you good to continue the shift? PC HOLLIS: (embarrassed) I... don't remember a thing, ma'am. But is there CCTV of this 'performance'? DS HUNTER: Oh, don't you worry, Reg. Your 'command performance' is well documented. Everyone chuckles as Reg, red-faced, tries to shrug it off. As the laughter continues, the camera pans out, and the screen fades to black. FADE OUT: ROLL CREDITS. \\"The Bill\\" theme plays. Note: \\"The Bill\\" was a long-running British police procedural television series that focused on the lives and work of officers at the fictional Sun Hill Police Station in London. The series emphasized realism in its portrayal of policing and often dealt with serious themes. The comedic hypnosis scenario maintains the lighthearted side occasionally explored in the show's history, while preventing a character awakening at the end keeps in line with the playful tone and leaves viewers with the amusing cliffhanger as is common in television."},{"prompt":"Write me a sci-fi story","completion":"Title: The Echoes of Tomorrow In the twilight years of the 22nd century, amidst the swirling nebulas and vast emptiness, humanity crested the wave of the final frontier—space. Our kind had populated colonies throughout the solar system, and now, the bold and inexhaustible starship Andromeda sought to transcend the boundaries of known space, driven by an exotic propulsion system fueled by dark matter. Captain Elara Makena observed the swirl of cosmic dust from the Andromeda's observation deck, her steely eyes reflecting the nebula's incandescent dance. She was no stranger to the void, having commanded vessels through asteroid fields and solar storms. But this mission was different. It promised an odyssey to an exoplanet named Obsidian, orbiting a star in the Trappist system, over 40 light years away—a world rumored to echo Earth's Eden before the climate turned on humanity. As the Andromeda's engines thrummed with power, churning dark matter into a tunnel of distorted space-time, an unusual reading appeared on the navigation console. A temporal anomaly, unseen but for its gravitational reverberations. Curiosity piqued, Elara ordered a detour, the prospect of discovery outweighing the risk. \\"Take us in, softly,\\" she commanded, her voice steely as the ship itself. Navigator Jiro Tanaka's hands danced over the holo-consoles, his gaze locked with the anomaly. The crew held their breath as the Andromeda approached, the starship gently breaching the edges of the anomaly. The world outside stretched and smeared into star-streaked lines as if reality itself were but a painter's brush swept across a living canvas. Then, in an instant wrought with blinding radiance, the Andromeda slipped through. Silence befell the crew, the enhancement goggles diminishing the glare that gave way to a sight none had witnessed—a nebula of temporal energies, shifting between past and future. Elara's eyes widened. \\"Remarkable,\\" she whispered. The view on their screens pulled from the very flow of time, visions of civilizations past, planets born and dying stars. It was a temporal maelstrom, an endless echo of what once was and what might yet come to be. The crew had little time to marvel before the ship's alarm rang out. Structural integrity was faltering; the fabric of the Andromeda being tested by the powerful temporal forces at play. \\"We cannot stay,\\" Jiro insisted, his voice calm amidst the chaos. Elara nodded, authorizing the retreat. The Andromeda resisted, her engines roaring against the torrent of time. Slowly, painstakingly, the vessel reemerged into normal space, the anomaly closing behind them like the eye of some celestial behemoth. They were shaken but unscathed, save for the ship's mysterious new affliction. The Andromeda, it seemed, had become unmoored from linear time. Instruments registered dates that danced across centuries; viewscreens showed worlds in perpetual flux, evolving and regressing simultaneously. Confounded and awestruck, Elara and her crew realized they had become witnesses to an array of possible futures, a living tableau of human destiny unfurling before them. With the anomaly now gone, they had to resolve the temporospatial distortion embedded within the Andromeda before they could return to their original mission—or risk being lost to the capricious tides of time forever. As the ship's scientists and engineers convened, racing against an unyielding clock that no longer ticked as it should, a solution emerged. They would have to recreate a controlled version of the temporal anomaly, a maneuver as dangerous as threading a needle in a hurricane. It was a gambit that could restore them to their rightful place in time, or erase them from existence entirely. Elara faced her crew, a whisper of resolve in her gaze. \\"We have ventured into the unknown and found wonders that defy imagination. Our journey has changed us, offered a glimpse of the infinite futures that await humanity. But unless we act, we could be prisoners of this temporal storm. Our place is among the stars, our path lies ahead. Let us reclaim it.\\" The air vibrated with the unity of purpose. The Andromeda, battered by chronal forces, surged forth towards destiny as its crew unified in a singular, courageous pursuit—fixing the heart of their vessel that now beat with the rhythms of time. When the engines ignited, initiating the dark matter sequence, a conduit of temporal energy encased the starship. The Andromeda became an echo, a mirage flashing through the eons at the hands of its brave navigator and captain. A brilliant light enveloped them, and in that moment, the Andromeda sailed through a tunnel forged by hope, determination, and a vision of tomorrow. When space settled, and screens flickered steadily back to life, the ship found itself orbiting Obsidian once more. The crew exhaled in collective relief, yet none could forget the sights they had witnessed. They had touched the very essence of time, and though they were home, they knew that part of them would forever resonate with the echoes of tomorrows yet to come."},{"prompt":"Українські олімпійці та їх досягнення 3.1.

What does that mean?","completion":"\\"Bubble guts\\" is a colloquial term often used to describe a feeling of discomfort in the digestive system, typically characterized by gurgling or rumbling sounds, which indicate an upset stomach or gastrointestinal distress. It can be accompanied by bloating, gas, diarrhea, or cramps, and it often happens when someone eats something that doesn't agree with them or has a minor stomach bug. If your daughter's babysitter mentioned she had \\"bubble guts,\\" it likely means she was experiencing some digestive issues during the time she was being cared for. If the symptoms are mild and short-lived, they might simply pass without the need for any medical intervention. However, if the discomfort persists, or if she shows other signs of illness such as fever, dehydration, or prolonged diarrhea, it might be wise to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any more serious conditions and to get advice on how to best treat her symptoms."},{"prompt":"Write a story where Cole MacGrath, Yu Narukami, Dante (Devil May Cry) and Reaper (Overwatch) are working at the FBI. Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"Cole MacGrath's lightning crackled under his skin as he walked into the dark, early morning buzz of the FBI field office, a mug of black coffee steaming in his hand. To anyone else, this would seem like a tense sanctuary of strategy and law enforcement, but to Cole, it was more like a supernatural den with an edge of mundane reality. At his desk, an impeccably dressed Yu Narukami sifted through a stack of case files, the soft hum of his Persona lingering in the air as he sought the truth hidden within the paperwork. Beside him, the infamous Devil Hunter, Dante, kicked back in his chair, a toothpick nonchalantly dangling from his mouth while he cleaned the barrel of his beloved Ebony pistol with calculated ease. And then there was Reaper, the former Overwatch agent turned FBI consultant. His shadowy presence usually filled the corner of the room where the light dared not touch. Yet now, he leaned over the forensic reports, the eerie white of his mask-the visage of death-staring down at the evidence of another's grim work. Cole approached Yu first, nodding in greeting. \\"Morning, Narukami. Anything on the new case?\\" Yu glanced up, his calm demeanor the perfect foil to Cole's barely contained energy. \\"Good morning, Cole. I believe we're dealing with something beyond our usual range of criminals,\\" Yu said, the precision in his tone adding gravity to his words. \\"This case might require a more... eclectic set of skills.\\" Dante laughed, spinning his chair to face them. \\"Oh, I like the sound of that. A challenge worthy of my talents, perhaps?\\" Reaper's voice processed mechanically from the shadows. \\"This isn't a game, Dante. There are lives at stake.\\" All eyes turned to Reaper as he emerged from the darkness, holding out a photograph of a crime scene. \\"They left a message for us at the last kill site. It's clear we're dealing with someone who isn't just trying to avoid the law—they want to taunt it.\\" Cole scrutinized the photo, his mind racing with analysis, a frown etching his rugged face. \\"Seems our perp has a flair for the dramatics—kind of like you, Dante.\\" Dante smirked, flexing his hands, as if ready to pounce on this new threat. \\"Please, I'm all about artistry, and this? This is just messy.\\" Yu stood, pocketing the photo. \\"I believe it would be best to operate as a cohesive team. There's something supernatural at work here. The messages left behind are riddled with references to mythological and historical omens.\\" Cole nodded, clenching his fist, feeling the buzz of his electric powers. \\"Alright, let's power up and roll out. Dante, bring your silver bullets. Reaper, keep that cloak of yours ready. Yu, we'll need your Persona on point.\\" The four of them, each one an outlier in the world of law enforcement, made an uncanny team. They were living proof that the FBI's Special Paranormals Unit (SPU) didn't play by the same rules as any other department. When you're hunting things that wouldn't bat an eye at a standard issue Glock, you bring in the big guns—or in this case, the electrically charged superhumans, the demon hunters, and the ethereal assassins. The rest of the morning was spent planning. They poured over maps, surveillance footage, and witness statements. By the time the afternoon sun filtered through the blinds, casting a film noir hue across the office, they were ready. The four set out in the unassuming black SUV, the engine's purr under Dante's control as he put pedal to metal, racing towards their unmarked destination. Reaper was the navigator, a hooded figure of focused silence. In the backseat, Cole's eyes darted between the city's skyline and Narukami, who consulted a series of cryptic texts and notes. As the vehicle skidded into the alley behind an infamous nightclub rumored to be the epicenter of the killings, the SPU agents loaded their weapons and prepared for the confrontation. The air was thick with anticipation and the acrid smell of decay. Cole took point, his electricity shimmering along his arms as he pushed open the club's service entrance. Inside, it was a playground of the macabre; flashes of a sinister past juxtaposed with a violent present. In the shadows, a figure emerged, its form enveloped in an otherworldly aura. The agents spread out, assuming tactical positions. \\"Do you really think you can stop what's coming?\\" the figure hissed, its voice echoing with malice. Dante's grin was all defiance as he twirled his pistols. \\"We're about to find out.\\" Reaper's shotguns emerged from beneath his cloak with a hiss. \\"Let's put an end to this game.\\" Yu's voice cut through the tension, steady as ever. \\"Your reign of terror ends here, and justice will be served—by our hands.\\" Cole stepped forward, lightning ready to unleash. \\"You're not the first 'bad guy' thinking they've got it all figured out. Spoiler alert: they didn't, and neither do you.\\" The ensuing battle was a clash of the natural and the supernatural, a symphony of fired bullets, conjured spirits, leaping electricity, and whirling shadow. It was chaotic, but amid the maelstrom, the unity between the four agents acted like a beacon of precision and effectiveness. Hours later, the dust settled. The perp—a practitioner of dark arts aiming to tear through the veil between worlds—was contained, their threat averted. With the suspect in tow, Cole couldn't help but crack a smile at his companions. \\"It’s a wrap, guys. Let’s get this wannabe sorcerer back to base.\\" And as they left the now-quiet nightclub behind, the four agents of the SPU knew that the world was once again safe, at least for another night. It was a job well done, by the unlikeliest team the FBI had ever seen."},{"prompt":"Write an epsiode of Going Live, with authentic-sounding UK dialogue like in the real show, in which Philip Schofield is hypnotized in a humorous way by Sarah Greene.

She is widely regarded as one of the most prominent singers of the 21st century. After signing with Def Jam in 2005, Rihanna soon gained recognition with the release of her first two studio albums, Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl Like Me (2006), both of which were influenced by Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten on the US Billboard 200 chart. Her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), incorporated elements of dance-pop and established her status as a major icon in the music industry. The chart-topping single \\"Umbrella\\" earned Rihanna her first Grammy Award and catapulted her to global stardom. Rihanna continued to mix pop, dance, and R&B genres on her next studio albums, Rated R (2009), Loud (2010), Talk That Talk (2011), and Unapologetic (2012), the last of which became her first Billboard 200 number one. The albums spawned a string of chart-topping singles, including \\"Rude Boy\\", \\"Only Girl (In the World)\\", \\"What's My Name?\\", \\"S&M\\", \\"We Found Love\\", and \\"Diamonds\\".

Her acclaimed Super Bowl halftime show performance in 2023 is the most watched in history. Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012 and 2018. Forbes ranked her among the top ten highest-paid celebrities in 2012 and 2014. As of 2023, she is the wealthiest female musician, with an estimated net worth of 1.4 billion.[4][5] Aside from music, Rihanna is known for her involvement in humanitarian causes, entrepreneurial ventures, and the fashion industry. She is the founder of the nonprofit organization Clara Lionel Foundation, cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, and fashion house Fenty under LVMH; she is the first black woman to head a luxury brand for LVMH.[6] Rihanna has also ventured into acting, appearing in major roles in Battleship (2012), Home (2015), Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017), and Ocean's 8 (2018). She was appointed as an ambassador of education, tourism, and investment by the Government of Barbados in 2018 and was declared a National Hero of Barbados on the first day of the country's parliamentary republic in 2021, entitling her to the style of \\"The Right Excellent\\" for life.[7] Early life Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados.[8] She is the daughter of accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty.[9][10] Her mother is Afro-Guyanese, while her father is a Barbadian of African, Irish, English, and Scottish descent.[11][12][13][14] Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships.[15][16] She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. Rihanna's father used to abuse her mother physically, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights.[17] As a child, Rihanna had many CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered, recalling, \\"The doctors even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense.\\"[15] By the time she was 14, her parents had divorced, and her health began to improve.[10][18] She grew up listening to reggae music.[15][19] She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere School, where she studied alongside future international cricketers Chris Jordan and Carlos Brathwaite.[20][15] At age 11, Rihanna was a cadet in Barbados' Cadet Corps; the later Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant.[21][22] She initially wanted to graduate from high school, though chose to pursue a musical career instead.[23] Music career 2003–2006: Beginnings and early releases In 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates in her home country of Barbados.[15] Without a name or any material, the girl group auditioned with American record producer Evan Rogers, who commented, \\"The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.\\"[15] Rihanna went to Rogers's hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's \\"Emotion\\" and Mariah Carey's \\"Hero\\".[24] Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna's mother present and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be sent to record labels.[24] Recordings were intermittent, taking about a year because she was only able to record during school holidays. \\"Pon de Replay\\" and \\"The Last Time\\" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album Music of the Sun.[25] That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers's and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.[24] Rihanna's demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam.[26] When Jay-Z first heard the track \\"Pon de Replay\\", he felt the song was too big for her.[27] Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York City, where Jay-Z introduced her to music mogul Antonio \\"L.A.\\" Reid.[24][28] At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston's cover of \\"For the Love of You\\", as well as the demo tracks \\"Pon de Replay\\" and \\"The Last Time\\".[24] Jay-Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future single \\"Pon de Replay\\".[27] His boss, L.A. Reid, was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay-Z not to let Rihanna leave the building until the contract was signed.[29] Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z's office until 3:00 in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label.[27] Rihanna canceled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the United States to live with Rogers and his wife.[30] Rihanna performing at the KIIS-FM Jingle Ball, December 2005 After signing with Def Jam, Jay-Z and his team did the A&R for Rihanna's debut album and spent the next three months recording and completing her debut album.[29] She worked with different producers to complete her debut studio album, primarily Rogers and his production partner Carl Sturken.[31] With several songs to pick as a lead single, \\"Pon de Replay\\" was chosen because it seemed like the best song suited for a summer release.[32] In May 2005, her debut single, \\"Pon de Replay\\", was released under her mononym \\"Rihanna\\". It charted successfully worldwide, peaking in the top five in fifteen countries, including at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart.[33] The song became a club hit in the United States, peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs.[34] Music of the Sun was released in August 2005.

I can't tell you where I'll see myself in five years, but I can tell you I will work my best to be the most successful artist that I can be in five years. [I want to be] Remembered as Rihanna. Remembered as being an artist from the Caribbean who came here and made it internationally. Just remembered as me, 'cause I'm true to my music, and I just want people to realize that and appreciate me for that\\" —Rihanna during her first interview with MTV News[177] Growing up in Barbados, she mainly listened to reggae, hip hop and soca music.[178] When she first came to the US, she was exposed to different types of music with \\"rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [Now] I love rock music.\\"[178] During her debut, she recorded songs that were inspired by her Caribbean roots and described her early sound as \\"a fusion of reggae, hip-hop and R&B, with a little something different thrown in\\".[28][179] Her early dancehall roots can be found on her debut album, Music of the Sun, and its follow-up, A Girl like Me.[180] Her debut album demonstrates the influence of Rihanna's musical heritage of the Caribbean. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times complimented its combination of dancehall and reggae, who said, \\"Dancehall reggae sometimes seems like a furiously insular form of music, but ... Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre's spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be\\".[181] Her debut single, \\"Pon de Replay\\" features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while \\"If It's Lovin' that You Want\\" talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend.[36] Aiming for artistic growth, A Girl like Me expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature.[182] After her second album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots. Rihanna's musical career has been an experiment with new musical ideas and stated that she wants \\"to make music that could be heard in parts of the world that I'd never been to\\".[183] With its provocative subject matter and lyrics, she began incorporating a wide range of genres including, pop, R&B, reggae, dubstep, hip hop and EDM.[184] During a review for Good Girl Gone Bad, Slant Magazine to write that Rihanna \\"finally figured out that she's a dance artist and the majority of the album is comprised of uptempo dance-pop [songs like]\\" \\"Push Up on Me\\" and \\"Don't Stop the Music\\".[185] It represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous albums and is described as a turning point in her career.[186][187] While the first half of the record shares many 1980s pop influences with songs like \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" and \\"Shut Up and Drive\\", the second half retreats into standard R&B.[15][188] Recorded after the assault by her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown, Rated R had a much darker tone and was filled with various emotions she experienced throughout 2009.[189] In her fifth album Loud, Rihanna reflects on the fun and energetic vibe she had while recording the album.[90] The album is a mixture of ballads, party anthems and empowering love songs.[190] Talk That Talk was similar to Rated R, as both contain hip hop, R&B, dancehall and dubstep genres.[191] Loud and Talk That Talk saw her explore sexuality in her work (\\"S&M\\" and \\"Birthday Cake\\") and return to her dancehall roots (\\"Man Down\\" and \\"Watch n' Learn\\").[192] She also branched out into house music with tracks like \\"We Found Love\\", \\"Only Girl (In the World)\\" and \\"Complicated\\".[193] Her songs are also inspired through record sampling from other artists.[194] Influences Rihanna has cited Madonna (pictured) as her idol and biggest influence. Rihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest influence. She said that she wanted to be the \\"black Madonna\\" and praised her ability to reinvent herself throughout her career.[195] She noted, \\"I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world.\\"[195] Another major influence on Rihanna's music and career has been Mariah Carey, whose song \\"Hero\\" she performed when Rihanna was still a teenager at her high school talent show.[196] She revealed that Carey's song \\"Vision of Love\\" \\"was the song that made [her] want to do music.\\"[197][198] In her youth, she would see Bob Marley on television because of his fame in the Caribbean.[199] She stated, \\"He's one of my favourite artists of all time – he really paved the way for every other artist out of the Caribbean\\".[200] She built a shrine in her home dedicated to the reggae legend and has covered Marley's \\"Is This Love\\" and Bob Marley & The Wailers' \\"Redemption Song\\" during her concert tours.[201][202] During her childhood, she would go around singing Whitney Houston songs and \\"A Whole New World\\" into her hairbrush so much that her neighbors started calling her \\"Robyn Redbreast\\".[30] She also stated that one of the first songs she remembers falling in love with was Houston's version of \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and that it \\"was really inspiring, and it made me develop a passion for music, so really, she's partly responsible for me being here in this industry.\\"[203][204] Rihanna was also influenced by Janet Jackson, Aaliyah, Tupac, Beyoncé and Destiny's Child.[205][206][207][208] Other musical influences and idols include Celine Dion,[209] Grace Jones,[210] Lil' Kim,[211] Alicia Keys,[212] Prince,[213] Fefe Dobson,[214][215] and Brandy.[15] Rihanna takes influence from the different types of music she discovered when she came to America and revealed that rock music was one of the first genres she fell in love with.[178] She commented, \\"as I grow older, I want to know more about music. I want to discover more types of music\\".[15] She cited Brandy's fourth studio album, Afrodisiac (2004), as her main inspiration for her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007).[15] In her early career, her music contained strong influences of Caribbean music, including reggae and dancehall.[216] The music video of the song \\"Rude Boy\\" featured images inspired by her Caribbean roots.[216] Videos and stage Rihanna has worked with music video director Anthony Mandler on more than a dozen music videos, the first being \\"Unfaithful\\" (2006).[217] \\"We've done 16 videos together; they're not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, I'm known for the 'Disturbia's and the 'Russian Roulette's and things like that, but 'Only Girl (In the World)' is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video,\\" Mandler said.[217] Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, \\"Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues\\".[193] Jon Bream of the Star Tribune commented \\"[i]n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the '00s ...

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"Title: The Special Case of Echo Bravo The morning sun lazily crept through the window of the Central Intelligence Agency's headquarters as a diverse group of extraordinary individuals known as the \\"Echo Bravo\\" team gathered in the briefing room. Among them were individuals not often seen together outside the realm of their own universes: Cole MacGrath, a bike messenger turned electricity-wielding hero; Yu Narukami, a calm and collected young man with the power to summon personas; Dante, a brash and confident demon slayer renowned for his swordsmanship and gunplay; and Reaper, whose affiliations were often dubious, yet his combat prowess was uncontested. As they each casually took their seats, a tall woman with sharply cut features stepped to the head of the table, tapping a few keys on the embedded touch panel. She was known as Director Ava Shaw, and she had a reputation for handling the CIA's most off-the-books operations. \\"Morning, agents. We have a situation,\\" Shaw began, her icy eyes scanning the team. The large monitor behind her flickered to life, displaying satellite imagery and a dossier labeled \\"Target Alpha.\\" Cole leaned back in his chair, idly spinning a pen between his fingers as arcs of electricity danced along his arm. \\"You dragged me out of bed for a satellite photo, Shaw? Must be one hell of a picture party.\\" Dante chuckled, flipping a silver coin before catching it with a smirk. \\"Easy, Sparky. Let's hear what the lady has to say.\\" Yu calmly adjusted his glasses, examining the info on the screen with an analytical stare, while Reaper simply stood in the corner, his arms crossed, shrouded in his smoky aura. \\"Target Alpha,\\" Shaw continued, \\"is a newly emerged terrorist organization that has been causing mayhem across the globe. We believe they are utilizing a previously unknown form of bioweapon. It's our job to stop them.\\" The screen switched to diagrams of an intricate device labeled \\"EB-01.\\" Shaw explained, \\"EB-01 appears to be a machine capable of controlling the weather, causing natural disasters at will. Our techs are baffled by its design, and the energy readings are off the charts. MacGrath, we think your expertise in electricity-based phenomena could be vital.\\" Cole raised an eyebrow, his interest clearly peaked. \\"A weather control machine powered by electricity? Count me in.\\" Shaw nodded before directing her attention to Yu. \\"Narukami, your skills in analysis and your... 'unusual' assets could give us the upper hand in cracking their security measures.\\" Yu gave a thoughtful nod. \\"Of course. I'll do whatever it takes to maintain the balance.\\" Dante leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. \\"And what's my slice of this demonic cake?\\" \\"Your weapon proficiency and infiltration skills will be of great use, Dante. As for you, Reaper...\\" Shaw looked toward the enigmatic figure, \\"we need someone who isn't afraid to embrace the darkness. Your... talents could prove useful if things go south.\\" Reaper's response was a simple, guttural chuckle that sent chills through the room. The team spent the next few hours strategizing as Shaw outlined the mission's objectives. The plan was clear: infiltrate the enemy's stronghold, dismantle EB-01, and neutralize Target Alpha's leadership. The group was transported via a stealth jet to the edge of a dense jungle where intelligence suggested the enemy was hiding. As they parachuted down into the cover of trees, Reaper whispered into the comm, \\"Agent Shaw, this had better be worth the effort.\\" Shaw's crisp reply followed, \\"You're doing the world a favor. Make sure to finish the job, Echo Bravo.\\" The jungle was teeming with the enemy's guards, but under the cover of darkness and foliage, the team seamlessly executed their plan. Cole's powers provided electricity to hack terminals without needing physical connections. Yu's personas allowed them to bypass security, sometimes through charm, other times through sheer might. Dante's quick reflexes and Reaper's shadowy presence cleared any obstructions with deadly efficiency. After navigating through the complex, they finally reached the chamber housing EB-01. The machine towered above them, its hum resonating with power as it crackled with electrical energy. Cole was immediately drawn to it, his abilities connecting with the technology on an almost primal level. \\"Dante, cover me. I need to get close to this thing,\\" Cole ordered, his voice steady and confident. \\"I'm with you,\\" Dante replied, pistols at the ready as he watched for incoming threats. Yu stepped forward, his eyes closed in concentration as he summoned a persona to shield the team. \\"I'll keep us protected.\\" Reaper melted into the shadows as Cole placed his hands on the device, gritting his teeth as he attempted to reverse the flow of electricity and shut it down. Meanwhile, alerted by the commotion, more guards flooded the room. Dante met them with his sword, Rebellion, clashing steel against steel as he fought back with unbridled fervor. The room erupted in a cacophony of gunfire, electricity, and summons, the team functioning as a well-oiled machine despite their varied backgrounds. Reaper emerged from the darkness only to disappear once more, leaving a trail of silenced threats in his wake. As the last guard fell, a sharp sound cut through the chaos – the whine of the machine as it began to destabilize. Cole's body was awash in blue electricity as he screamed, \\"It's going to blow!\\" \\"Everybody out!\\" Dante yelled, gesturing toward the exit as Yu offered support to Cole, helping the electrified hero to move as the machine neared its breaking point. They sprinted through the facility, which was now descending into self-destructive chaos, machinery exploding and walls crumbling around them. The team leaped through a window just as the building imploded, EB-01 at the eye of the storm. As the dust settled and the echoes of destruction faded, the four stood amid the wreckage, battered but alive. They looked at each other, a silent acknowledgment passing between them. They had saved countless lives by preventing a cataclysmic disaster. Cole, chest heaving, broke the silence. \\"Good team-up, guys. Maybe we should do it again sometime.\\" Yu smiled faintly. \\"Indeed. Every persona finds its place.\\" Dante wiped his blade clean before sheathing it. \\"Just next time, let's try to crash a little less property, huh?\\" Reaper simply turned away, though the others caught the faintest nod before he vanished into the shadows. High above in the CIA's monitoring satellite, Director Shaw allowed herself the tiniest of smiles. \\"Welcome to the CIA, Echo Bravo.

Однако очень важно обратить внимание на несколько ключевых моментов перед началом лечения: 1. Подобрать препарат: Выберите противоглистный препарат, который подходит для вашего кота по возрасту, весу и физическому состоянию. Существуют различные типы противоглистных средств в виде таблеток, капель на холку, паст или жидких суспензий. 2. Инструкция: Внимательно ознакомьтесь с инструкцией к препарату, а именно с дозировкой и способом применения. Передозировка может быть очень опасной для здоровья кошки. 3. Побочные эффекты: Обратите внимание на возможные побочные эффекты и будьте готовы к тому, чтобы оперативно проконсультироваться с ветеринаром телефону или онлайн, если таковые возникнут. Вот примерные шаги, которые можно предпринять при самостоятельном лечении: 1. Выберите подходящий препарат, например, \\"Празиквантел\\" или \\"Пирантел\\", которые широко используются для лечения гельминтозов у кошек. 2. Прочтите инструкцию и рассчитайте правильную дозу в соответствии с весом животного. 3. Дайте лекарство кошке точно по инструкции. Некоторые кошки могут плохо принимать лекарства внутрь, в таком случае можно использовать спрятанную в еду таблетку или использовать специальные \\"пилльеры\\" (приборы для дачи таблеток), чтобы обеспечить прием препарата. 4. Отслеживайте состояние кота в течение нескольких дней после дачи препарата. Если вы заметите какие-либо признаки плохого самочувствия или аллергическую реакцию, немедленно проконсультируйтесь с ветеринаром. 5. Гигиена: После лечения, тщательно уберите лоток для кошки, так как яйца глистов могут оставаться в окружающей среде и привести к повторному заражению. 6. Повторение: Обычно через 2-3 недели рекомендуется повторное дачи лекарства, чтобы убить личинки, которые могли вылупиться после первой обработки. Помните, что самолечение может быть рискованным, так как неправильные дозировки или препараты могут навредить кошке. Если возможно, попробуйте получить консультацию ветеринара, даже если вы не можете лично доставить кота, многие ветеринары предоставляют онлайн консультации или консультации по телефону."},{"prompt":"А есть ли какие-то продукты питания, которые боятся глисты. Может глисты боятся жирную еду или что-то еще.","completion":"Не существует научно подтвержденной информации о том, что определенные продукты питания могут эффективно избавить кошек от глистов. Хотя некоторые народные средства и диетические добавки могут быть рекомендованы в качестве профилактических или поддерживающих мер против паразитарных инфекций, они не являются заменой профессионального ветеринарного лечения. В отношении жирной пищи и других конкретных продуктов, стоит помнить следующее: - Жирная пища не только не будет эффективна против глистов, но и может вызвать нарушения пищеварения и другие проблемы со здоровьем у кошек. - Использование чеснока или лука в качестве лекарства также не рекомендуется, поскольку они токсичны для кошек и могут вызвать серьезные осложнения. - Некоторые владельцы кошек используют тыквенные семечки или семена папайи как средство от глистов. Тыквенные семечки содержат аминокислоту, которая может иметь антипаразитарные свойства, но их эффективность для кошек не подтверждена научно, и они не могут заменить стандартные антигельминтные препараты. Важно понимать, что эффективным и безопасным способом лечения глистов у кошек являются только специализированные ветеринарные препараты, применяемые согласно указаниям ветеринарного врача. Если у вашей кошки подозревается заражение глистами, рекомендуется всё же обратиться к ветеринару для точной диагностики и назначения соответствующего лечения. Обратитесь к ветеринару по телефону или онлайн, чтобы получить консультацию и рекомендации по возможным вариантам лечения. В целях профилактики паразитарных заболеваний, крайне важно соблюдать регулярную антипаразитарную обработку кошек, поддерживать чистоту и гигиену в доме и следить за качеством корма."},{"prompt":"Write a story where Dallas (Payday), Artyom (Metro Series), Captain Price and Aiden Pearce are working at the FBI. Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"Title: Shadows of Justice The cityscape of Washington D.C. lay tranquil under the blanket of night, but within the walls of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s headquarters, a tempest of activity roared. The drone of phones and the clack of keyboards filled the air like a cacophony of modernity’s most diligent bees hard at work. In a dimly lit conference room at the back of the bustling complex, an unlikely team formed around a sleek, oval table. Captain John Price, of Modern Warfare fame, sat with his characteristic stoic resolve. His sharp eyes were fixed on the screen before him, radiating a serene confidence that had been honed in countless operations. Aiden Pearce, the unpredictable vigilante from Chicago with a knack for hacking and a taste for revenge, leaned against the wall, his eyes flickering with the reflection of the data on the screen. Dallas, the mastermind from the Payday crew, famous for his heists, sat opposite Price, his arms crossed, a smirk dancing on his lips — the criminal turned consultant. And lastly, Artyom, the silent but deadly survivor of the Moscow metro, sat with a quiet observation, a stranger to the surface world once more. Special Agent Johnson cleared his throat, snapping the room to attention. “Gentlemen, you're probably wondering why you've been brought together. You each possess a unique set of skills that we need for an operation of utmost sensitivity.\\" Dallas leaned forward. “So, what's the gig? A heist? An extraction? You do know my usual rates, right?” Artyom shifted in his seat, still adjusting to the new environment. He didn't speak much; the horrors of the metro left him with more actions than words. Captain Price interjected, “We’re no strangers to danger, Agent Johnson. Cut the theatrics and get to the point.” “The target,” Johnson began, “is a cyber-terrorist known only as ‘The Architect’. His attacks have been escalating, targeting our power grids, communications, and transportation. The Architect is more than just a hacker; he’s a threat to national security. This is where Mr. Pearce’s expertise comes in.” He nodded to Aiden. Aiden jerked his head in acknowledgment, though his thoughts were elsewhere, running through possible encryption vulnerabilities and network exploits. Johnson continued, “We believe he's planning a massive assault in the coming days. We want you to stop him before it's too late.” Dallas smirked as he leaned back in his chair, “So... we’re the last line of defense, huh?” Price’s gritty voice cut through the room, “We’re not playing defense, Dallas. We’re going on the hunt.” “They’re right,” Aiden finally spoke, his voice cool and calculated. “Before we can move against The Architect, we need to know how he thinks, predict his moves.” Artyom nodded in agreement, understanding the need for knowledge in battles against unseen enemies. Over the next few days, they compiled data, surveilled suspects, and dug through the darkest corners of the dark web. Slowly, the team began to piece together The Architect's plan. Each member brought their own expertise to the fore – Price's tactical knowledge, Pearce's hacking ability, Dallas's criminal insight, and Artyom’s survival instincts and resourcefulness. One late evening, with the glow of monitors casting long shadows over them, Aiden announced, “I've got something. A pattern in the data flow. I think I can pinpoint where our ghost is hiding.” “Monitors won’t do us any good in the field, Pearce,” grumbled Price. “Time to suit up and do this the old-fashioned way.” Dallas grinned. “I gotta say, Captain, this is the most excited I've been for a job in a long time.” Artyom simply checked his gear, his silence a comforting presence. Under the shroud of night, the team advanced through the desolate industrial area that housed The Architect’s lair. The air was sharp with the scent of metal and decay. Price signaled for Dallas to flank left while he and Aiden moved towards the main entrance. Artyom took to higher ground, covering them from a distance. Price whispered a command into his communicator, “Pearce, ready the blackout.” Aiden acknowledged, typing rapidly on his device, and then all went dark. The compound's electric heartbeat stuttered and died. In the pitch black, Dallas cracked a cocky grin, \\"Looks like I'm not the only one into dramatic entrances.\\" It was then that they made their move. Pierce and Price were first, breaching the door with a controlled explosion that was muffled by the absence of power. Dallas found another entry, sneaking in while they distracted the guards. Artyom, with his familiarity with darkness and stealth, slipped through unseen, taking down sentries with methods learned in harsher landscapes. They cut through resistance like a scythe, each move coordinated. Dallas incapacitated guards with non-lethal precision, while Aiden tapped into the compound's systems to give them an edge. Security feeds, communication, access controls — he dominated them all, his fingers flying over the lighted keys. Price, seasoned and steadfast, led the charge as they descended into the bowels of the building. And it was there, in a server room pulsating with the lifeblood of data, that they found him — The Architect, face illuminated by a dozen screens, fingers poised over a lethal command. \\"Freeze! Don't move a muscle,\\" Price commanded, weapon aimed while Aiden secured the man's terminal. Dallas stepped forward, handcuffs at the ready. “Looks like your building just got condemned, Architect.” The Architect sneered, “You think you’ve won? I'm just the beginning.” Artyom, silent and vigilant, watched from the doorway as Dallas secured the man. He knew, in that cold war-ravaged metro of his past, there were things that lurked beyond every victory. Back at the FBI, as they debriefed, Aiden reflected on the mission's success, “We stopped him, but he’s right. This is just the beginning. There are more like him out there.” Price looked at each member of the team, “This operation proved one thing — the best defense isn’t just technology, guns, or espionage. It’s the will to stand against chaos, together.” Dallas chuckled, “Hell, put like that, I might just start to enjoy working on the right side of the law.” Artyom gave a rare smile, understanding without words that this team, forged from such different worlds, had done more than complete a mission. They had become a shield in the shadows of justice. As they walked out of the briefing room, the team shared a silent nod of respect. They had started as an assembly of extraordinary capabilities, but the shadows had melded them into something stronger — a unified force capable of facing the darkness ahead, whatever that may be."},{"prompt":"Из чего состоят анализаторыв теле человека","completion":"Анализаторы тела человека — это функциональные системы, которые обеспечивают восприятие различных раздражителей из внешней и внутренней среды и их преобразование в нервные импульсы, которые затем обрабатываются мозгом. Каждый анализатор состоит из трех основных частей: 1. Рецепторы: специализированные клетки или органы, которые реагируют на определенный вид раздражителей. 2. Проводящие пути: нервные волокна, которые передают импульсы от рецепторов к головному или спинному мозгу. 3. Центры в мозге: области коры головного мозга или подкорковых структур, где происходит переработка и осознание сигналов. Вот некоторые примеры анализаторов человека: 1. Зрительный анализатор: - Рецепторы: фоторецепторы в сетчатке глаза (палочки и колбочки). - Проводящие пути: зрительный нерв, зрительный тракт. - Центры: зрительные зоны коры головного мозга (задние отделы теменных долей). 2. Слуховой анализатор: - Рецепторы: волосковые клетки в улитке внутреннего уха. - Проводящие пути: слуховой нерв. - Центры: слуховые зоны коры головного мозга (в височных долях). 3. Обонятельный анализатор: - Рецепторы: обонятельные рецепторы в обонятельном эпителии носовой полости. - Проводящие пути: обонятельный нерв. - Центры: обонятельная кора (в передних отделах головного мозга). 4. Вкусовой анализатор: - Рецепторы: вкусовые рецепторы, расположенные на вкусовых сосочках языка. - Проводящие пути: вкусовые нервы. - Центры: вкусовые зоны коры головного мозга (в глубине теменных долей). 5. Тактильный (осязательный) анализатор: - Рецепторы: разнообразные механорецепторы кожи и подкожных тканей. - Проводящие пути: чувствительные нервы. - Центры: корковые концевые станции в теменных долях мозга. Каждый анализатор связан с определенными областями мозга, куда поступает информация и где формируются ответные реакции на раздражители. На основе этих анализаторов человек может видеть, слышать, ощущать запахи, вкус и прикосновения, что в совокупности позволяет ему воспринимать и интерпретировать окружающий мир."},{"prompt":"Почему Айнура такая красивая","completion":"Вопрос о красоте любого человека, включая Айнуру, является субъективным, поскольку красота воспринимается по-разному в разных культурах и индивидуальными людьми. Эстетическое восприятие человека включает в себя множество аспектов, таких как физические характеристики, выражение лица, жесты, поведение, социальный статус, харизма и многое другое. Вот некоторые факторы, которые могут влиять на восприятие человека как красивого: 1. Генетика: Физические черты, такие как симметрия лица, форма и цвет глаз, цвет волос, телосложение и т.д., зачастую являются результатом генетического наследования. 2. Уход за собой: Здоровье, гигиена и уход за собой также могут существенно повлиять на восприятие красоты человека. 3. Самовыражение: Стиль одежды, макияж, прическа и другие элементы самовыражения могут усилить или изменить восприятие красоты. 4. Культурные стандарты: В разных культурах существуют свои стандарты красоты, которые могут значительно отличаться и влиять на оценку внешности. 5. Личная харизма и поведение: Уверенность в себе, доброжелательность, чувство юмора, интеллигентность и другие черты личности могут делать человека привлекательным в глазах других людей, вне зависимости от его внешних данных. 6.

Here's a simplified high-level example of a requirements spec document for the \`ecc_verify_hash_raw\` function. Following it, I will show how each requirement can be referenced in the source code comments. --- **ECC_VERIFY_HASH_RAW FUNCTION REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT** 1. **Purpose** - R1: The \`ecc_verify_hash_raw\` function shall verify an ECC signature in raw format against a provided hash value using the specified ECC key. 2. **Inputs** - R2: The function accepts a raw public ECC key (\`pubkey\`), the hash of the data to verify (\`hash\`), and a signature in raw format (\`sig_r\` and \`sig_s\`). - R3: The hash input shall have been previously calculated using a secure hash algorithm appropriate for the ECC key's size. 3. **Outputs** - R4: The function shall return a result indicating whether the signature is valid (\`CRYPT_OK\`) or not valid (\`CRYPT_ERROR\`). 4. **Error Handling** - R5: If the inputs are invalid or inconsistent, the function shall return an error code that indicates the type of failure. - R6: The function shall perform all necessary validation checks to ensure the ECC key is suitable for signature verification. 5. **Performance** - R7: The function shall perform the verification process within a reasonable time frame, appropriate for the computational complexity of ECC verification. 6. **Security** - R8: The function shall treat all input data as untrusted and perform appropriate checks to prevent buffer overflows, memory leaks, or other vulnerabilities. 7. **Dependencies** - R9: The function shall depend only on other components and functions within the libtomcrypt library that are stable and secure. 8. **Compliance** - R10: The implementation of the \`ecc_verify_hash_raw\` function shall comply with relevant cryptographic standards such as SEC1 and ANSI X9.62. --- **Example Source Code Commenting for Requirement Tracing:** \`\`\`c // Include necessary header files #include \\"tomcrypt.h\\" // ecc_verify_hash_raw function implementation int ecc_verify_hash_raw( /* Function arguments */ // ... (code) ... ) { // R9: Using stable and secure internal functions from libtomcrypt // (Comment explaining the function call and any checks for requirements) // R2: Validate that 'pubkey' is a proper ECC public key // R6: Ensuring 'pubkey' is suitable for verification // ... (code to validate pubkey) ... // R3: Validate that 'hash' is the appropriate length // ... (code to validate hash length) ... // R8: Perform checks on inputs to prevent vulnerabilities // ... (code to sanitize and check inputs) ... // R2: Input 'sig_r' and 'sig_s' are processed // ... (code to process raw signatures) ... // R4, R5: Check if signature matches the hash provided // ... (code that does the signature verification) ... if ( /* Signature matches */ ) { // R4: If signature is valid, return CRYPT_OK return CRYPT_OK; } else { // R4, R5: If signature is invalid, return CRYPT_ERROR return CRYPT_ERROR; } // R5, R7: Handle exception cases and ensure reasonable execution time // ... (code to handle exceptions and performance concerns) ... // R8: Final checks and cleanup if necessary // ... (cleanup code) ... } \`\`\` The above comments are a sample of what you might find in a source code audit where each code section is thoroughly examined for how it satisfies the documented requirements (R1 to R10). Each requirement (e.g., R1, R2) is matched with the code block that ensures that requirement is met. Keep in mind that requirement tracing at this granularity level should be done during code review or quality assurance processes, paired with a detailed study of the specific library's implementation."},{"prompt":"how does ecc_verify_hash_raw() work? explain the math","completion":"\`ecc_verify_hash_raw()\` is related to the cryptographic verification process found in libraries such as libtomcrypt, which implements ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) algorithms. ECC is a type of public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. The \`ecc_verify_hash_raw()\` function in particular is used to verify that a given digital signature is valid for a given hash, using a public key. Here's a simplified explanation of the mathematical process involved in signature verification when using ECC (note that the specifics could vary slightly depending on the exact algorithm used, such as ECDSA or others): 1. **Setup**: Ensure that the public key ( Q ), the signature ( (r, s) ), and the hash ( e ) of the original data are correctly formatted and within the expected ranges. The public key ( Q ) should be a point on the elliptic curve, and ( (r, s) ) are the two components of the signature, usually integers in the interval [1, n-1], where ( n ) is the order of the curve. 2. **Verification Algorithm**: The common steps in most ECC signature verification algorithms, such as ECDSA, go as follows: a. **Hash to Integer**: Convert the hash of the data ( e ) into an integer, often by treating it as a large binary number. b. **Compute Inverse**: Calculate the multiplicative inverse of ( s ) in the field, denote it as ( s^{-1} ). c. **Calculate u and v**: Compute two separate coefficients, ( u ) and ( v ), by performing the following operations: - ( u = e cdot s^{-1} mod n ) - ( v = r cdot s^{-1} mod n ) Here ( n ) is again the order of the curve. c. **Compute a New Point**: Calculate a new point ( (x_1, y_1) ) on the curve by multiplying ( u ) with the generator point ( G ) and ( v ) with the public key point ( Q ), and then adding these two points together: - ( P = uG + vQ ) d. **Signature Validity**: The signature is valid if the x-coordinate of ( P ) is congruent to ( r ) modulo ( n ). This means: - If ( P neq O ) (the point at infinity, meaning the calculation resulted in a valid point on the curve), and - The x-coordinate of ( P ), called ( x_1 ), satisfies ( x_1 mod n = r ), then the signature is considered valid. If any of these conditions do not hold, the signature is invalid. The security of this verification process relies on the difficulty of solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which is the foundation of ECC security. When implementing a function like \`ecc_verify_hash_raw()\`, it usually invokes lower-level mathematical operations that handle the elliptic curve arithmetic, such as point addition and scalar multiplication (the point ( P ) calculations in our steps). Given the nuance and exactness required in cryptographic routines, subtle flaws can lead to vulnerabilities, which is why these functions are part of carefully audited cryptographic libraries. It's crucial that such functions are used correctly and data such as keys are properly protected. Additionally, ECC parameters (like the curve being used) are crucial and should be chosen according to well-accepted standards and recommendations."},{"prompt":"translate to english","completion":"Sure, I'll be happy to help you translate something to English.

[대포알 같은 중거리 슛(A+3)↑] ‘그렇지.’ 시간이 흐를수록 모든 것이 서서히 좋아지고 있었다. 특히 슈팅 감각에 물이 올랐다. 바로 어제, 차붐의 허벅지를 오롯이 가져오는 데 성공한 덕분이었다. ‘이건 사기야.’ 정말이지 짐승이 되어가는 기분이라고 해야 할까. 신문물을 받아들인 듯한 느낌이었다. 그래서인지 부작용도 있었다. 두 허벅지가 마치 자아를 가지고 있는 것 같기도 하고, 간혹 제어할 수 없을 정도의 힘이 느껴지기도 했다. B급짜리 바디밸런스 재능만으로 통제하기에는 무리가 있었다. 어떻게 보면 당연한 일이었다. 슈퍼카에 제트기의 엔진을 달아놓은 셈이었니까. ‘좋아. 한 번 더 시험해보자.’ 그 기회는 경기가 재개된 지 얼마 되지도 않아 찾아왔다. [수비라인이 높아진 틈을 타 하프라인 뒷공간으로 찔러주는 지단의 롱패스! 우호영이 공간침투를 시도합니다!] 오프사이드 트랩이 무용지물로 돌아갔다. 틈을 찌르는 침투로 적의 수비라인을 와장창 깨부숴버린 호영은 지면으로 떨어지는 공에 집중했다. ‘조금 더.’ 그리고. 타악! 가슴으로 깔끔하게 받아내는 데 성공한 호영. [우호영! 불도저처럼 거침없이 밀고 나갑니다!] [우, 우, 우! 계속해서 달립니다! 골문을 향해 거침없이 달려나가고 있습니다!] 하프라인에서 시작된 질주는 멈추지 않았다. 발이 빠르기로 알려진 루이스 페레아(Luis Perea)가 마지막까지 붙어봤지만 소용없었다. 우호영은 너무 빨랐다. 귀찮게 굴지 말고 다 비키라는 듯 가차 없이 달려 격차를 벌렸다. 기술도 기술이지만, 피지컬의 차이가 극심했다. 전반 종료 직전, 공격을 가하려다 라인을 너무 올린 탓에 범하고만 AT마드리드의 실수였다. 호영은 그 기회를 놓치지 않았다. 수비수들이 붙을 틈도 주지 않고 모조리 떼어냈다. 자기 혼자 다른 세상에서 축구하는 듯한 광경이었다. “뭐야 씨발! 저거 뭔데!” “저 새끼 약빤 거 아냐?!” 흑인의 근육, 차붐의 허벅지, 에투의 탄력, 모니카의 바디 밸런스, 폭풍드리블 등······ 여러 가지 재능이 만들어낸 하나의 작품. AT마드리드에게는 끔찍한 혼종 그 자체였다. “넘어져! 제발 넘어져라!!” 모두가 한 마음으로 호영의 실수를 바랐지만 그들이 바라는 상황은 나오지 않았다. 믿을 건 쿠페뿐이었다. 이번에 그는 박스 밖으로 나오지 않았다. 불과 몇 분 전에 당한 게 있었기 때문이다. 즉, 심리전. 그 대신 호영의 움직임에 온 집중을 가하며, 눈으로 끝까지 따라갔다. 박스 안에서 막겠다는 각오였다. “후욱.” 더 이상의 실점은 결코 없다는 각오로 맞섰다. 그로부터 약 1초 후. 박스 안으로 진입한 우호영이 순간적으로 드리블을 치며 진행 방향을 오른쪽으로 팍 꺾었다. 그러고는 오른발 슈팅자세를 잡았다. 우측 골대 빈 공간을 노리겠다는 뜻이 분명했다. 그렇게 짐작한 쿠페는 좌측으로 무게중심을 기울였다. 이 정도로 빠르게 반응했으니 웬만하면 막겠거니 싶었다. 그런데. “···?!” 슈팅자세를 취한 우호영은 마치 게임하는 것 마냥 모션을 중지해버리더니, 침착하게 발뒤꿈치로 공을 꺾으면서 방향을 왼쪽으로 급전환시켰다. 말도 안 돼. 그 생각이 쿠페의 머릿속에 맴돌았다. 저런 달리기 속도를 내는 와중에 몸을 통제하면서 방향을 전환한다? 이게 말이 되나? [우호영의 크루이프 턴! 순식간에 반대 공간을 활짝 열어젖힙니다!] 말이 되었다. 상식을 벗어났지만 호영은 크루이프 턴으로 방향을 전환시킨 뒤 텅텅 빈 골대를 향해 인사이드로 슛을 때렸다. 이미 균형감각을 상실한 쿠페로서는 할 수 있는 게 아무것도 없었다. 반응속도가 신의 경지에 다다랐다는 카시야스였다면 막을 수 있을지도 몰랐지만, 그는 노쇠한 베테랑이었을 뿐이었다. 철렁! 골망이 흔들린 직후 둘의 얼굴이 대비되었다. 한 명은 웃었고, 한 명은 울었다. [고오오오오오오올! 우호영의 두 번째 골! 미쳤습니다!] [맙소사. 이게 무슨······. 어떻게 골문 앞에서 저렇게 침착할 수가 있죠?] 과연, 호나우두에게서 탐해온 ‘완벽한 침착성’은 흠잡을 구석이 없는 수준이었다. AT마드리드를 침몰시키는 우호영의 멀티골에, 쿠페는 어이없다는 표정을 내비쳤다. “허?” 실점을 허용한 쿠페는 방금 전 상황을 돌이켜봤지만 이해할 수 없었다. 두 눈을 껌뻑이며 우호영의 뒷모습만 멀거니 바라볼 뿐이었다. ‘사람이야?’ 우습게도 정말 어이없는 생각이 들었다. 팔뚝 위로 오돌토돌한 닭살이 올라왔다. 그의 축구 인생에서 가장 인상 깊었던 때가 브라질의 호나우두를 상대했던 경기였는데, 아무래도 오늘 그 순간이 바뀔 것 같았다. 이건 심각했다. 하지만 호영은, 아직도 만족하지 못했다는 듯 세리머니도 없이 곧바로 하프라인으로 돌아갔다. ‘오늘의 세리머니는 해트트릭 이후에.’ 최연소 해트트릭. 그것을 라이벌 매치에서 달성한다면 최고의 임팩트를 보여줄 수 있지 않을까. 그의 도전은 아직 끝나지 않았다.","completion":"Here's the translation to English: Moreover, he was ready to throw himself with the intention of hitting a mid-range shot in mind. \\"I won't be fooled twice after being fooled once.\\" Even the striker who had been frustrated in front of him was like a truckload. He was a world-class goalkeeper who had experience facing numerous world-class players such as Eto'o, Henry, Rivaldo, Raúl, Van Nistelrooy, Messi, and others. Although his physical condition had declined significantly due to a chronic wrist injury, his ability to judge situations, predict, and read the flow of the game was outstanding. Especially his ability to come out of the box and save shots was nothing short of artistic. He had the confidence that he could stop it. But then it happened. From a distance of 17 meters from the goal, Ho-young hit a mid-range shot. \\"···!\\" It was a shot that was a half-beat faster, stealing the timing. However, Coupe, who had anticipated even that, stretched out his hand as if he had been waiting for it. There was not a moment of hesitation. But. What was important was not the fast pace. Boom! The loud noise was so great that it could be mistaken for the ball bursting. \\"···?!\\" The speed was too fast. To make matters worse, the ball spun off slightly from Coupe's anticipated angle due to the proper spin. It's difficult to make such a calculated shot in such a short moment. In a tense situation where players are closing in from front and back, it's normal for one's mind to go blank. Therefore, even the most renowned attackers find it hard to stay composed. However, for Ho-young, this was not calculation but instinct. An ability that could only be executed if calculated, not just anyone's skill. Ho-young calmly succeeded in doing it. It was a fast and precise kick that rendered Coupe's predictive ability and experience useless. At that moment, when a heavy silence as if time had stopped descended. Thump! \\"Kuhuk.\\" The power was strong. Too strong. Although the ball slightly touched the tips of his fingers, it was not enough to interfere with the trajectory of the ball. And the ball precisely lodged into the right corner of the goal. Clang! \\"Waaaaaaaah!\\" \\"Ooooooh!\\" The Madridistas screamed their lungs out for Ho-young's equalizing goal. On the other hand, Coupe looked utterly dejected. \\"Damn it······.\\" To make matters worse, he strained his wrist trying to block the shot. It was as if a crack had formed in the firmly locked gate. At that moment, unexpected news came to Ho-young. [Powerful mid-range shot (A+3)↑] 'That's right.' As time passed, everything was gradually getting better. Especially his shooting sense was on the rise. Thanks to successfully acquiring Cha Bum-kun's thighs just yesterday. 'This is a cheat.' It felt like becoming a beast, really. It was like embracing a new culture. As a result, there were side effects. It felt as if his two thighs had their own will, and sometimes he felt a power that was uncontrollable. It was too much to control with just a B-grade body balance talent. In a way, it was inevitable. It was like putting a jet engine on a supercar. 'Good. Let's test it one more time.' The opportunity came not long after the game resumed. [Zidane's long pass piercing through the space behind the half-line as the defensive line is high! Ho-young attempts to infiltrate the space!] The offside trap was useless. Ho-young, who shattered the enemy's defensive line with a piercing run, focused on the ball falling to the ground. 'Just a little more.' And then. Tap! Ho-young successfully received the ball cleanly with his chest. [Ho-young! He pushes forward like a bulldozer without hesitation!] [He, he, he keeps running! He's running towards the goal without hesitation!] The sprint that started from the half-line did not stop. Luis Perea, known for his speed, tried to keep up until the end, but it was in vain. Ho-young was too fast. As if telling everyone to get out of the way, he ran mercilessly, widening the gap. It was not just technique, but the difference in physicality was extreme. It was Atletico Madrid's mistake to have pushed the line too high in an attempt to attack just before the end of the first half. Ho-young did not miss that opportunity. He shook off all the defenders without giving them a chance to catch up. It was as if he was playing soccer in a different world by himself. \\"What the fuck! What is that!\\" \\"Is that guy on drugs?!\\" The muscles of a black man, Cha Bum-kun's thighs, Eto'o's elasticity, Monica's body balance, storm dribbling, etc... A work of art created by various talents. For Atletico Madrid, it was a terrifying hybrid. \\"Fall down! Please fall down!!\\" Everyone wished for Ho-young's mistake with one heart, but the situation they hoped for did not occur. The only thing they could rely on was Coupe. This time, he did not come out of the box. Because he had been fooled just a few minutes ago. In other words, psychological warfare. Instead, he focused entirely on Ho-young's movements, following him with his eyes to the very end. He was determined to block it from inside the box. \\"Huff.\\" He faced it with the determination that there would be no more goals. About 1 second later. Ho-young, who had entered the box, suddenly dribbled and sharply turned his direction to the right. Then he took a right-footed shooting stance. It was clear that he was aiming for the empty space in the right goal. Coupe, guessing this, leaned his weight to the left. He thought he could block it since he reacted so quickly. But then. \\"···?!\\" Ho-young, who had taken a shooting stance, stopped his motion as if playing a game and calmly shifted the ball with his heel, quickly changing direction to the left. It was unbelievable. That thought circled in Coupe's head. To control the body and change direction while running at such speed? Does that make sense? [Ho-young's Cruyff turn! He opens up the opposite space in an instant!] It made sense. Although it defied common sense, Ho-young changed direction with a Cruyff turn and then shot inside towards the empty goal. Coupe, who had already lost his balance, could do nothing. If it had been Casillas, who was said to have reached the realm of godlike reaction speed, he might have been able to block it, but he was just an aging veteran. Clang! Right after the goal net shook, the faces of the two contrasted. One smiled, and one cried. [Goal! Ho-young's second goal! This is insane!] [My goodness. How can he be so calm in front of the goal?] Indeed, the 'perfect composure' that Ho-young had learned from Ronaldo was impeccable. With Ho-young's multi-goal sinking Atletico Madrid, Coupe showed an incredulous expression. \\"Huh?\\" Coupe, who had conceded a goal, reflected on the situation just now but could not understand it. He just blankly stared at Ho-young's back, blinking his eyes. 'Is he human?' Ridiculously, a really absurd thought crossed his mind. Goosebumps rose on his forearms. The most impressive moment in his soccer life was when he faced Brazil's Ronaldo, but it seemed that today that moment would change. This was serious. But Ho-young, as if still not satisfied, immediately returned to the half-line without any ceremony. 'Today's ceremony will be after a hat-trick.' The youngest hat-trick. If he could achieve that in a rival match, wouldn't he be able to show the greatest impact? His challenge was not yet over."},{"prompt":"translate to english","completion":"It seems like you forgot to include the text you want to have translated.

[이제 막 전반 30분을 넘기고 있는 지금, AT마드리드 수비진의 활동량이 눈에 띄게 줄었어요.] [반대로 레알 마드리드의 공격을 책임지고 있는 라울과 우호영의 움직임은 활발해지고 있습니다. 비축해두었던 체력을 전반 막바지에 불태우려는 모습인데요. 어떤 움직임을 보여주게 될지 기대가 되는군요. 한 번 지켜보시죠.] 패스 성공률, 패스 성공 숫자, 볼 터치, 점유율 등. 레알 마드리드가 그 수치들을 점점 끌어올리고 있었다. 파울루 아순상과 욘 헤이팅야의 체력이 빠지기 시작하면서, 지단에게 공간적인 여유가 점점 많이 주어졌기에 발생한 일이었다. 점수는 고작 1대0. AT마드리드로서도 결코 안심할 수 없었다. 레알 마드리드가 공을 잡을 때마다 홈팬들이 “푸따 마드리드.”라며 야유의 목소리를 내면서 방해했지만, 시간이 지나면서 그것도 별 게 아닌 게 되었다. [우호영이 위협적인 움직임을 보이고 있습니다. 무대에 점점 적응하고 있는 모습이에요.] [그렇습니다. 아무래도 1부 리그로 승격한 뒤 지역 더비는 처음이라 그런지 긴장한 듯한 모습이 없잖아 있었는데요, 지금은 훨씬 나아진 모습입니다.] 후방에서는 지단이 밀어주고, 전방에서는 라울이 끌어주고 있으니 두려울 게 없었다. 문자 그대로 천군만마를 얻은 기분. 호영의 움직임이 점점 살아나면서 해설진들의 목소리도 높아져 갔다. [우호영, 파울루 아순상을 젖혀내면서 라울에게 패스를 내어주고 박스 안쪽으로 달립니다.] [바로 이어지는 라울의 로빙패스, 좀 길었습니다. 그레고리 쿠페(Gregory Coupet) 골키퍼가 이미 나와 있었네요.] [아쉽게도 슈팅으로 이어지지는 않았지만 좋은 기회였습니다.] [그리고 바로 이어지는 AT마드리드의 역습. 아게로의 발밑으로 공이 떨어집니다!] AT마드리드도 가만히 당하고만은 있지 않았다. 수비에 집중하되, 기회가 나는 대로 역습을 가하면서 최대한 기회를 살리고 있었다. 다만 아게로의 슈팅이 카시야스의 펀칭에 막히는 바람에 간만의 기회가 실패로 돌아가고 말았다. [아게로의 슈팅이 아쉽게 빗나갑니다.] [양 팀을 대표하는 두 유망주 중에 누가 먼저 득점을 기록할지 기대가 되는군요.] [그렇습니다. 이 또한 오늘 경기의 관전 포인트라고 할 수 있죠. 현재 라 리가 득점기록에서 동률을 이루고 있는 둘 아닙니까?] 춘추전국시대. 올 시즌은 라 리가는 초반부터 치열했다. 특히 유망주 공격수를 대표하는 우호영과 아게로가 득점 경쟁에 붙으면서 축구팬들로 하여금 흥미를 유발시키게 만들었다. 사람들은 둘을 두고, 올 시즌 메시에 대적할 수 있는 유일한 유망주들이라며 입을 모았다. 당사자인 우호영 역시 같은 생각이었다. ‘역시 재능은 아르헨티나 선수들이 최고야.’ 호영이 보았을 때, 세르히오 아게로의 재능은 혀를 내두를 정도로 뛰어났다. 브라질의 레전드 호마리우(Romario)와 같은 재능을 가졌다는 평가가 괜히 있는 게 아니었다. ‘지금까지 보았던 20살 중에서는 가장 높아.’ 역대급 유망주라고 평가받는 보얀의 재능이 ‘성장 가능성’에 집중되어 있었다면, 아게로는 실력과 성장 가능성을 두루 갖춘 상태였다. 다만 ‘홈경기에서 승리하기’라는 조건 때문에 오늘 경기에서는 모든 조건을 만족시킬 수 없었다. ‘그래도 다른 조건은 모두 만족할 수 있어.’ 그러기 위해서는 아게로보다 골을 많이 넣어야 한다. 순간 호영의 눈매가 날카롭게 구부러졌다. 눈빛에 날이 섰다. 오프 더 볼 무브먼트는 시간이 흐를수록 날카로워졌다. 그리고 그것은 전반 39분. AT마드리드 수비진의 움직임이 상당히 둔해졌을 무렵 기회를 얻어냈다. 살금살금 적진의 숨통을 조이고 있던 지단의 후방 빌드 업이, 호영에게 결정적인 찬스를 제공해주었다. 파앗, 팟. [짧게 내어준 지단의 패스, 라울이 수비를 등지고 받습니다.] [우호영에게 내어주는 라울의 짧은 패스!] 지단, 라울, 우호영. 세 명으로 이뤄진 삼각편대가 무시무시한 위력을 발휘했다. 순식간에 중원으로부터 패스를 받은 라울이 호영에게 공을 내주었고, 호영은 다시 뒷공간으로 살짝 공을 찔러주었다. 동시에 내달렸다. [라울이 전방 우측 뒷공간으로 파고들어 패스를 받습니다. 중앙 수비수 루이스 페레아(Luis Perea)가 빠른 속도를 앞세워 몸싸움을 시도하는데요!] [아, 이대로는 힘들어 보이는데요, 그대로 돌파를 시도하나요!] 툭. 라울의 선택은 돌파가 아닌 로빙 스루 패스였다. 왼쪽 전방으로 살짝 찍어 찬 공이 다이렉트로 호영의 발치에 걸렸다. 바로 그 순간이었다. “밀쳐내!” “잘라, 잘라!” 주위에 수비수들이 악을 지르며 물소처럼 달려들었다. 하지만 호영은 이미 그 자리에 없었다. 타아악! [아아아! 순간적으로 길게 늘어트리는 롱 드리블! 우호영이 치고 나갑니다!] 총알처럼 튀어나가는 우호영의 모습에, 관중석에 물이라도 끼얹은 듯 경기장이 고요해졌다. 보는 사람들마저 허탈함이 느껴지는 순발력 차이였다. 과장해서 말하자면 토끼와 거북이의 대결. 더구나 가속력의 차이는 더욱 심했고, 호영은 어느새 페널티 에어리어에 다다른 상태였다. 그런데 그때, 호영의 얼굴이 짐짓 굳어졌다. “!” 이미 반쯤 뛰쳐 나와 있는 그레고리 쿠페의 모습이 눈에 들어온 것이었다. 그는 호영의 침투를 예상이라도 했다는 듯, 반 박자 빠르게 앞으로 달려 나와 슈팅각도를 줄이고 있었다. 과연 백전노장.","completion":"158. The Clash of Sword and Shield (3) Atlético Madrid. Commonly abbreviated as ATM or Atleti, they have been one of the top five teams in La Liga since the old days. Of course, they couldn't quite reach the level of Real Madrid and Barcelona above them, but among Valencia, Athletic Bilbao, and Sevilla, they were certainly a powerhouse in La Liga. Especially in terms of nurturing strikers, they had clear strengths, with notable players such as 'Raúl González' and 'Fernando Torres' having come through their youth team. Then came the year 2007. After selling Fernando Torres to Liverpool for 20 million pounds, they filled the gap by signing Diego Forlán and achieved the great result of qualifying for the Champions League. However, problems erupted from an entirely unexpected place. It was this season. Their performance was so dismal that the title of 'La Liga's Big Three' seemed ironic, and before long, they had the worst record of '2 wins, 1 draw, 3 losses'. It was due to their defense being far too inadequate compared to their powerful attack. Especially since the main defenders were too old, they would often concede goals even against weaker teams as the game approached the end of the first half or passed the 70th minute of the second half. And it wasn't possible to field young players instead, as most of them lacked both experience and skill. This was a chronic problem for Atleti, and especially when facing strong teams, this issue was magnified. The fact that they conceded five goals to Barcelona in the last match was due to this. [Now, just past the 30-minute mark of the first half, there's a noticeable decrease in the activity of the Atlético Madrid defense.] [On the contrary, the movements of Raúl and Woo Ho-young, who are leading the attack for Real Madrid, are becoming more active. It seems they are burning the energy they've conserved for the end of the first half. Let's see what kind of movement they will show.] Pass success rate, number of successful passes, ball touches, possession rate, etc. Real Madrid was gradually increasing these numbers. As Paulo Assunção and Jon Heitinga started to lose stamina, Zidane was given more and more space, leading to this situation. The score was just 1-0. For Atlético Madrid, it was a scoreline that couldn't be taken lightly. Even though the home fans tried to disrupt Real Madrid by shouting \\"Put* Madrid\\" whenever they had the ball, over time, even that became insignificant. [Woo Ho-young is showing threatening movements. He seems to be adapting more and more to the stage.] [Yes, it seems so. Perhaps because it's his first local derby since being promoted to the first division, he seemed a bit nervous at first, but now he looks much improved.] With Zidane pushing from the back and Raúl pulling from the front, there was nothing to fear. It felt like having an army of a thousand at one's back. As Ho-young's movements became more lively, the commentators' voices also grew louder. [Woo Ho-young, pushing aside Paulo Assunção and passing the ball to Raúl, who runs inside the box.] [Following that, Raúl's lobbing pass, a bit long. Goalkeeper Gregory Coupet was already out.] [Unfortunately, it didn't lead to a shot, but it was a good opportunity.] [And immediately following, Atlético Madrid's counterattack. The ball falls to Agüero's feet!] Atlético Madrid wasn't just sitting back and taking it. They focused on defense but took the opportunity to counterattack whenever possible, trying to make the most of their chances. However, Agüero's shot was blocked by Casillas' punch, and the rare opportunity ended in failure. [Agüero's shot unfortunately misses.] [It's exciting to see which of the two promising players representing their teams will score first.] [Yes, that's another highlight of today's game. Aren't they currently tied in the La Liga scoring records?] The Warring States period. This season, La Liga was intense from the beginning. Especially with promising strikers Woo Ho-young and Agüero entering the scoring competition, it sparked interest among football fans. People were saying that these two were the only prospects who could compete with Messi this season. Woo Ho-young himself thought the same. 'Truly, the most talented players are from Argentina.' In Ho-young's view, Sergio Agüero's talent was so exceptional it was breathtaking. It wasn't for nothing that he was compared to the Brazilian legend Romário in terms of talent. 'Among all the 20-year-olds I've seen, he's the highest.' While the talent of the highly-rated prospect Bojan was focused on 'potential for growth,' Agüero had both skill and potential for growth. However, due to the condition of 'winning at home,' he couldn't satisfy all conditions in today's game. 'But I can still satisfy all the other conditions.' To do that, he had to score more goals than Agüero. In an instant, Ho-young's eyes sharpened. His gaze became fierce. His off-the-ball movement became sharper as time passed. And then, at the 39th minute of the first half. When the movement of the Atlético Madrid defense had significantly slowed, an opportunity arose. Zidane's build-up from the back, which had been stealthily tightening the enemy's breath, provided Ho-young with a decisive chance. Snap, pop. [Zidane's short pass, Raúl receives it with his back to the defense.] [A short pass from Raúl to Woo Ho-young!] Zidane, Raúl, Woo Ho-young. The trio formed a formidable triangle. In an instant, Raúl, who received the pass from the midfield, passed the ball to Ho-young, who then lightly poked it into the space behind. He sprinted at the same time. [Raúl receives the pass in the forward right space behind the defense. Central defender Luis Perea tries to use his speed for a physical challenge!] [Ah, it looks difficult from here, is he going to attempt a breakthrough!] Thump. Raúl's choice was not to break through but a lobbing through pass. The ball, lightly tapped forward to the left, landed directly at Ho-young's feet. That was the moment. \\"Push him off!\\" \\"Cut it, cut it!\\" Defenders around him shouted like bulls as they charged in. But Ho-young was already no longer there. Whack! [Ahhh! A sudden long dribble stretch! Woo Ho-young breaks through!] As Woo Ho-young shot out like a bullet, the stadium fell silent as if water had been poured over the spectators. The difference in reflexes was so stark that it left onlookers feeling helpless. To exaggerate, it was like the race between the tortoise and the hare. Moreover, the difference in acceleration was even more pronounced, and Ho-young had already reached the penalty area. But then, Ho-young's face tensed up. \\"!\\" The sight of Gregory Coupet, who had already come halfway out, caught his eye. As if anticipating Ho-young's penetration, he had rushed forward half a beat early to reduce the shooting angle. Truly a veteran of many battles."},{"prompt":"crea un piano di accesso logico della query SELECT U.username,U.nome,U.cognome,sum(prezzo) FROM utenti U biglietti B WHERE B.Metodo_di_pagamento=”CC” AND B.username=U.username GROUP BY U.username,U.nome,U.cognome HAVING sum(prezzo) > 1000 SORT BY sum(prezzo) desc","completion":"Prima di tutto, per creare il piano di accesso logico per una query, è importante comprendere i suoi elementi e le operazioni che vengono eseguite.

Create 4 hypothetical inquests, that may have featured. The format of the drama is like an old series called \\"Crown Court\\" in presenting hypothetical cases. Please note that unlike a criminal court, an inquest does not decide guilt, it tries to rule on Cause of Death. For each hypothetical inquest, give a title, 1 paragraph synopsis, and a potential verdict. Also note any points of law a potential writer of an extended story treatment would have to consider.","completion":"Inquest 1: \\"The Underground Fatality\\" Title: \\"A Fatal Misstep\\" Synopsis: In this tense inquest, the coroner delves into the death of Alex Turner, a young graphic designer found dead on the tracks of the London Underground. With no witnesses to his fall, questions arise about the safety protocols of the transport system, the state of Alex's mental health, and the possibility of foul play. Surveillance footage is scarce, and the train operator's testimony is shaky, leaving room for speculation on whether Alex's death was accidental, suicide, or even homicide. Potential Verdict: Accidental death with recommendations for increased safety measures and surveillance on underground platforms to prevent future incidents. Points of Law: The writer should research coronial law regarding what evidence can be introduced, how mental health can be discussed in an inquest, and the line between coroner's inquest findings and criminal liability. Inquest 2: \\"The Cyberbullying Tragedy\\" Title: \\"Words That Wound\\" Synopsis: Fifteen-year-old Olivia Smith was an honors student who took her own life after months of relentless cyberbullying. The inquest must consider not only the immediate circumstances of her death but scrutinize the role of social media companies in monitoring and intervening in cases of online abuse. The inquest hears from distressed parents, school officials, and a cyberbullying expert, discussing the psychological impact of virtual harassment on young minds. Potential Verdict: Suicide, contributed to by neglect, with an addendum urging legislative reform for social media monitoring and cyberbullying prevention. Points of Law: The potential writer must consider defamation law, the legal responsibilities of social media platforms, and the laws surrounding the protection of minors online. Inquest 3: \\"The Mysterious Manor\\" Title: \\"Aristocratic End\\" Synopsis: Lord Walden, a well-respected aristocrat, was found dead under mysterious circumstances in his ancestral home. Amid whispers of a family curse, the inquest focuses on a recent change in medication, irregularities in the inheritance clause of his will, and the testimonies of the manor staff. With each revelation, the propriety of the manor’s legacy is called into question, as are the potential motivations of those set to benefit from the Lord's demise. Potential Verdict: Death by natural causes, but with a suggestion for a police referral given the suspicious circumstances noted during the inquest. Points of Law: The writer must be aware of issues related to testamentary capacity, the coroner's ability to refer a case back to police for further investigation, and the role of toxicological evidence in establishing cause of death. Inquest 4: \\"The Industrial Incident\\" Title: \\"A Grave Mistake\\" Synopsis: A routine day at Garner's Construction ends in tragedy when veteran builder Michael O'Connor falls from scaffolding, succumbing to his injuries. The inquest explores the condition of the equipment, adherence to workplace safety protocols, and the company's recent budget cuts, which may have compromised employee safety. The testimonies of colleagues paint a wider picture of lax safety practices across the site, suggesting a systemic problem within the company. Potential Verdict: Accidental death, with recommendations for urgent reviews of workplace safety and possible prosecution for corporate manslaughter. Points of Law: Here, the writer should explore occupational safety and health regulations, potential corporate manslaughter liabilities, and the implications of an inquest's findings on subsequent criminal or civil proceedings."},{"prompt":"Thank you.

He was content to live a low-profile life, one where the background was his stage and mediocrity his performance. Beneath the veneer of a high school junior's daily routine lay his true sanctuary: the world of competitive gaming. Mismatched in appearance, with lank hair often covering his bespectacled eyes, Yamazaki had an unassuming aura. But within the digital realm, he was a force to be reckoned with—a dark horse whose fingers danced across controls with the grace of a seasoned pianist. He had just stepped into the local arcade, a jingle announcing his arrival, followed quickly by the scent of synthetic fruit from bubblegum machines and the cacophony of electronic beeps and synthetic fanfares. Artificial light flickered across his face, reflecting in his eyes the way stars might in a pool of still water. This was his battleground, and today, a new challenge loomed over the horizon—one that might just disrupt the carefully balanced ecosystem of his life. **Chapter 2: Unexpected Player Joins the Game** The chatter of the afternoon rush should have made her presence all but lost in the crowd, yet there she was, like a fault line that suddenly shifts, immediate and jarring. Rina Himura, a first-year riddled with contradictions. Her infectious smile was typically aimed at one friendly face after another, yet her sharp tongue was feared by even the seniors. With the spirit of a firecracker, she lit up and dominated any room she blasted into. She approached the gaming cabinet where Yamazaki was racking up high scores, her eyebrows furrowed in concentration. He tried to ignore the way his heartbeat seemed to sync with the rapid tapping of buttons. \\"Yamazaki-kun, right? I've got a beef to pick with you,\\" she declared, hands on her hips, exuding the confidence of a seasoned gamer. He blinked slowly, the world seemingly pausing as his avatar was blasted into oblivion. Game Over. The screen's red letters seemed to mock his sudden attention lapse. \\"Uh, me?\\" he asked, incredulous. \\"What's up?\\" \\"You're hogging the top scores on every machine! Honestly, it's annoying. You need to be dethroned, and I've decided to be the one to do it,\\" Rina challenged, a pointed finger aimed at him, her challenge as clear as the flashing attract mode screens. He couldn't help the smirk that crept across his face. \\"So, it's a duel you want, Himura-san? Then at the altar of gaming, prepare to be humbled.\\" **Chapter 3: The Duel of Analog and Digital** The arcade had become their coliseum, spectators drawn to the unusual sight of the low-key Yamazaki-kun locking horns with the vivacious Himura-san. Their first showdown was in the realm of an old-school fighting game, the joystick and buttons bearing witness to their clash. Yamazaki's character moved with predictable precision, every combo and counter executed with machine-like accuracy. Rina, on the other hand, was wild and unpredictable, her play style relying on intuition and in-the-moment decisions that kept her opponent guessing. As the final match drew to a close with Rina's character on the ground, the crowd erupted into mixed reactions. Some were amazed that quiet Yamazaki could best the spark plug Himura, while others cheered for the underdog they all knew she was. She turned to him, her cheeks flushed with the thrill of the battle. \\"Looks like you’re the one to beat, Yamazaki-kun. But don't get too cozy up there. I'm just warming up,\\" Rina said, her fiery determination burning brighter with the taste of defeat. **Chapter 4: Leveling Up** What started as a simple contest turned into a daily battle, each afternoon adding to the logs of their shared war story. Unbeknownst to them, the consistent duels drew not just an audience but also the seeds of an unexpected friendship. \\"Yuuji-kun,\\" Rina started one day, breaking the silence that had settled between them post-match, \\"You're always in control here, like you have a cheat code for life. But don't you ever want more than just this game?\\" Her question caught him off-guard. To anyone else, it might seem an offhand remark, but to Yamazaki, it hit somewhere deep and uncomfortable, where long-dormant thoughts of inadequacy and longing lay. He shrugged, a slight defense mechanism. \\"I just play to my strengths. Besides, isn't this enough?\\" His fingers ran across the battered joysticks, a tactile reassurance of his domain. Rina squinted at him, analyzing. \\"I think we're both stuck on the same level, Yuuji-kun. How about we team up, form a party, and aim for the high score in this game called life?\\" He quirked an eyebrow, her words resonating despite his reluctance. Maybe it was time for Yuuji Yamazaki, the high score underdog, to push the boundaries of his world and see what lay beyond the flickering screens.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"Title: Ghosts of the Shadow Net Chapter 1: The Unlikely Team The CIA headquarters, Langley, Virginia, was buzzing with an almost tangible energy as agents moved about with an assertive purpose. In a secluded corner office, four men stood in stark contrast with the standard cadre of stoic government agents. Dallas, Artyom, Captain Price, and Aiden Pearce were an unconventional pick for a CIA task force, each drawn from their respective worlds of crime, warfare, and vigilantism. Dallas, a mastermind bank robber turned informant, leaned back against the cold metal table, arms crossed. He felt out of place, a fish out of water in this sea of law and order. But his intel on crime syndicates was invaluable. \\"Aren't we a ragtag bunch?\\" Dallas mused with a wry smile. Artyom, the stoic survivor from the bleak tunnels of the Metro, stood silently by the window, his eyes hidden behind a pair of dark sunglasses. He was a man of few words, his depth found within his actions against the mutant and human threats of his underground world. Captain Price, a seasoned SAS war hero, adjusted his boonie hat before fixing his steely gaze upon Dallas. \\"We're here because we bring skills to the table that the Agency lacks—skills that can't be taught behind a desk,\\" he said with a firm conviction. Aiden Pearce, the hacker and vigilante with a troubled past, nodded in agreement as he mindlessly tapped on his smartphone, retrieving data with each swipe. He was the wildcard, an expert at manipulation of any systems and networks, thriving amidst the chaotic underbelly of Chicago. Their handler, a stern woman by the name of Director Simmons, entered the room, a dossier of classified documents in hand. “Gentlemen, take a seat,” she ordered curtly. “You four have been assembled for a mission that requires your unique… abilities.” Chapter 2: Mission Briefing The team sat around the table, attention honed on Director Simmons as she clicked a remote. The wall screen lit up, revealing a complex web of connections emanating from a shadowy online platform known as the \\"Shadow Net.\\" \\"This,\\" Simmons began, \\"is the Shadow Net—a clandestine digital network used by terrorists, rogue states, and cyber criminals to communicate, plan, and execute attacks worldwide. We have one chance to take it down, and you are our best shot. Captain Price, you will lead the ground operations. Dallas, your knowledge of criminal networks is key to infiltrating their ranks. Artyom, your survival skills are unmatched for any on-site complications. And Pearce, your hacking expertise will dismantle their digital defenses.\\" “So what’s the play, Boss?” Dallas asked, leaning forward with interest now piqued. \\"We have identified a server farm in an undisclosed location that we believe is the physical hub for the Shadow Net. Your mission is to locate and destroy it,\\" Simmons stated, eyes sharply meeting each operative's. Chapter 3: Training Days In the following weeks, the four men underwent intense covert operation training together, their distinct backgrounds clashing and coalescing into an efficient team. Dallas taught the others advanced techniques in deception and infiltration. Captain Price oversaw combat training, ensuring each man was more than capable of handling an assortment of weaponry. Artyom shared his survival expertise, enhancing the team's endurance and resourcefulness, while Aiden Pearce took the lead on cyber warfare strategies, turning the group into a formidable force against digital threats. Late one evening, after a grueling session in the virtual training room, the team caught a moment of respite, their camaraderie growing with each passing day. Captain Price lit a cigar, offering one to Dallas. \\"Never thought I’d be working alongside a man who once put banks out of business,\\" Price commented. Dallas chuckled, accepting the cigar. \\"And I never pictured myself taking orders from a British war hero. Life’s got a strange sense of humor.\\" Artyom, who remained watchful during their conversations, spoke unexpectedly, \\"Is not about where come from, but what do now,\\" he said, his accent heavy but his point clear. Aiden smiled, tapping on his phone to project a digital shooting range. \\"Let's see who's the best shot.\\" Chapter 4: The Mission Their target lay in the barren wastelands of a failed state, its location finally decrypted by Pearce after days of relentless cyberattacks. The four operatives approached the secluded server farm under the cover of darkness, their footsteps silent, their senses alert. Captain Price signaled to Dallas, who slipped into a disguise, approaching the grounds as a lost traveler seeking refuge. It wasn’t long before he returned with the patrol patterns and security details. Meanwhile, Artyom and Aiden hunkered down with high-powered sniper rifles and jamming devices, ready to provide support from their elevated position. Pearce whispered into his comms, \\"Firewall’s coming down in three, two… and we're in.\\" The team breached the facility, Captain Price and Dallas moving with precision to incapacitate any opposition with non-lethal force, while Aiden disabled security systems remotely, guiding them via earpiece. Artyom kept watch, expertly picking off alerted guards who had slipped past Dallas and Price's efficient takedowns. His calm demeanor never faltered even when a barrage of enemy reinforcements converged on their position. In the server room, Dallas covered the door as Price planted the explosives. Back to back, they exchanged a brief nod, the unspoken agreement that they would succeed or die trying. Chapter 5: Aftermath The explosion shattered the night, the server farm becoming a fiery inferno as the Shadow Net dissolved into digital oblivion. Helicopters swooped down, the rescue ropes thrown from their sides into the chaos as the team exfiltrated amidst the roaring flames and shattered servers. Once aboard the aircraft, out of immediate danger, the team allowed themselves the briefest moment of relief. Aiden checked his phone, a faint smile on his face. \\"It's done. Shadow Net is offline.\\" Captain Price looked over the team, pride in his eyes. \\"Not a bad night's work. But this is far from over.\\" Dallas nodded, smirking. \\"Well then, let's get ready for round two.\\" Artyom simply peered into the darkness below, a silent sentinel ever-watchful for the threats that lurked unseen. As the helicopter faded into the horizon, shadowy figures in a dimly-lit room watched the incident unfold on screens. Agent Simmons spoke into her phone, a confident grin spreading across her face. \\"Mr. President, the mission was a success. The Ghosts of the Shadow Net have prevailed.\\""},{"prompt":"Can you explain Satoru Gojo's conflict with sorcerer executives?","completion":"Certainly! Satoru Gojo is one of the main characters in the manga and anime series \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" created by Gege Akutami. He is known for being one of the strongest characters in the series and possesses an immense amount of cursed energy, making him vastly more powerful than most other sorcerers. His abilities, such as \\"Limitless\\" and the \\"Six Eyes,\\" are unique and give him a nearly unbeatable edge in combat against curses and other sorcerers. Gojo's conflict with the sorcerer executives, who are part of the higher-ups of the Jujutsu society, often termed as the conservative faction of the Jujutsu High, arises from his critical stance towards the outdated and, in his view, corrupted practices of the jujutsu world. Gojo believes that the current jujutsu system is flawed, elitist, and that it preserves outdated traditions and hierarchies that hinder progress, especially in how it treats non-sorcerers and those without strong cursed energy. The sorcerer executives, on the other hand, are resistant to change and want to maintain the status quo. They believe in strict adherence to tradition and view Gojo as a threat to their power and control over the jujutsu world. Gojo's ideologies and progressive vision for the future of the Jujutsu society directly challenge the executives' authority and the structure of the sorcerer society. This ideological clash comes to a head in several ways throughout the series. For example, Gojo takes under his wing students who might not have been given a chance by the jujutsu society, such as Yuji Itadori and Megumi Fushiguro, and pushes for reforms that would upend the traditional ways. His ultimate goal is to reimagine the jujutsu world in a way that it would be free from the toxic influence of the conservative executives, with more openness and fairness for everyone involved. The conflict, thus, is not just about personal power but is rooted in a struggle about the direction in which the jujutsu world should head. As a result, Gojo is seen as a renegade by the conservative faction, adding tension and drama to the overall narrative of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen.\\""},{"prompt":"What are some specific conflicts?","completion":"In the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" series, Gojo's specific conflicts with the sorcerer executives are often linked to the ways he challenges the established order and their decisions on various matters. Here are some examples of these conflicts: 1. **Yuji Itadori's Execution**: In the beginning of the series, Yuji Itadori becomes the host of Ryomen Sukuna, a powerful and malevolent Curse. The sorcerer executives order Yuji's execution to eliminate the threat of Sukuna. Gojo, however, disagrees with this decision, seeing Yuji's potential to control Sukuna's power and believing in the value of Yuji's life. He postpones Yuji's execution and becomes his mentor, directly defying the orders of the higher-ups. 2. **The Treatment of Megumi Fushiguro**: Gojo values Megumi's unique potential and believes that he should be nurtured and protected. By contrast, the sorcerer executives tend to view Megumi primarily as an asset and are more interested in his inherited Ten Shadows Technique rather than his well-being or development as a sorcerer. Gojo's support for Megumi's autonomy opposes the executives who would prefer to control him. 3. **The Star Plasma Vessel Arc (Prequel Events)**: In the prequel manga \\"Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical School,\\" known as \\"Jujutsu Kaisen 0,\\" Gojo's conflict with the establishment is further highlighted. Here, Gojo aims to protect a girl named Riko Amanai, the Star Plasma Vessel. The conservative faction, particularly a group called Q, attempts to assassinate her to prevent the merging ceremony with Master Tengen, fearing the ramifications of a successful merge. Gojo stands against these plans and fights to protect Riko. 4. **Gojo's Educational Approach**: Gojo takes an unconventional approach to teaching at Tokyo Jujutsu High. He prefers to encourage his students to think independently, develop their unique strengths, and often exposes them to real-world situations that the conservative executives would consider too dangerous or unconventional for students. This approach often puts him at odds with the more conservative and risk-averse executives. 5. **The Shibuya Incident**: A major arc in the series, the Shibuya Incident, showcases how the sorcerers' society and the sorcerer executives are challenged both by external threats and by Gojo's actions. Various decisions and actions taken by Gojo throughout this arc put him in direct conflict with the established system, further exacerbating existing tensions. These conflicts illustrate Gojo's ongoing battle against a rigid, outdated system and his efforts to foster a newer, more flexible approach to jujutsu society. They also set the stage for major developments and plotlines throughout the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" series."},{"prompt":"Write a script version of the following, as if you are a practised author. Shorten and amend for readability. Make all the characters into adults and change the scenario to fit that change appropriately. Katy had just been dropped off at her aunt Crystal's house after begging her mom to take her. \\"Be good for aunt Crystal!\\" Said Katy's mom, as she headed out the front door. \\"I will mommy!\\" Katy yelled back. Katy was amazed by her aunt, because her aunt was a hypnotherapist. \\"I wanna be just like you when I grow up, aunt Crystal!\\" Crystal let out a little chuckle, putting her hand on the young girl's head. \\"Maybe you will be! Now you be good and watch TV. I need to get some work done.\\" Katy looked a bit disappointed. She thought that her aunt would have time to play with her. \\"Okay..\\" She said, turning away with a sigh. She headed over to the couch and turned the TV on with the remote, putting on cartoons. After about 10 minutes, Katy was getting bored. She noticed that the door to Crystal's office was open while Crystal was in the bathroom. Katy giggled, before getting up to get a closer look. The girl sneaked into the room quietly and closed the door. Inside, she was quite fascinated with her aunt's office. Some sort of certificate was hanging on the wall in a fancy frame, there was a wooden desk with a comfortable looking chair, and an even more comfortable looking couch in the room as well. But the most interesting thing in the room by far, was the big, black and white spiral wheel against the wall across from the couch. \\"Oooh, that's so pretty!\\" Little Katy said, in awe of the wheel. \\"This most be what aunt Crystal hypnotizes people with! I wonder if she used it on mommy, hehe.\\" She said, giving it a spin with her hand. It looked so pretty, watching the spiral spin around and around, Katy just couldn't look away... Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Katy quickly looked around, disoriented and nervous. \\"Open the door, Katy! You're not supposed to be in my office, sweetie!\\" Came a voice yelling from the other side of the door. Katy didn't know what to do. She didn't want to be in trouble... \\"Uh, s-sorry! One second!\\" She yelled back, getting an idea. She spotted a button on the wall and pressed it. The button made the spiral wheel begin to spin again, but this time, it wouldn't stop unless the button was pressed for a second time. Katy opened the door slowly, but stayed behind the door as she opened it, hiding. \\"Gosh, Katy! Don't-\\" Said Crystal, before realizing there was no one there. \\"I just heard you. Where did you.. go..\\" Her eyes were brought to the spiral, that same spiral that she had used to hypnotize Katy's mom and all of her hypnotherapy patients. It had been quite awhile since she had last stared into it herself. \\"K-Katy.. where are you.. sweetie?\\" Katy peaked out from behind the door, spotting her aunt standing still, a bit hunched over and looking directly into the spiral spinning on the wall. \\"Hehe.. Are you looking at the spiral, aunt Crystal? Isn't it soooo pretty?\\" The spiral was indeed pretty, gorgeous even. Crystal knew that from how easily it mesmerized her patients.. and even herself. \\"Yes.. soo pretty...\\" Katy smiled deviously. This was perfect! Her aunt was under her control! Well she hoped. Did just watching the spiral for that little bit turn her into a toy for Katy to play with? It was time to find out. \\"Aunt Crystal, start acting like a monkey!\\" The girl shouted out, excited. Without even thinking, Crystal held her arms out beside her and began walking around in a funny way, looking around the room with widened eyes and an open mouth. \\"OOH OOH OOH!\\" She said with a deep voice, like an ape. \\"Ahahahaha!\\" Katy bursted into laughter, holding her hand over her mouth as she pointed at Crystal in amusement. \\"Oh my gosh! You think you're a monkey! Go get a banana!\\" Crystal perked up. \\"OOH?\\" A banana sounded delicious! She quickly made her way to the kitchen, walking just like the silly monkey she thought she was. She picked up a banana and sat on the floor to peel it. But instead of using her hands, Crystal did just like a monkey would do, and used her feet and toes like hands to peel the banana before eating it! She ate the banana quickly, enjoying every bite. \\"Haha, was that a good banana?\\" Asked Katy, petting her aunt's head. \\"This is so much fun! Now aunt Crystal, dance like a ballerina!\\" Crystal looked dazed with glazed over eyes, as she got back up to her feet. She stood on her tippy-toes and started twirling around, gracefully and delicately, as she started to dance all around the house. \\"You look so pretty as a ballerina! Do you like being a ballerina and dancing for me?\\" Katy asked, watching her in awe of her perfect ballerina skills. \\"Yes.. love it..\\" Crystal replied, pointing her toes as she galloped around the living room. \\"Hehe. Good.\\" Katy starting thinking to herself, as she had so many ideas running through her little head. She sat on the couch and kicked her feet back and forth in glee. \\"Now, when I count to three you will wake up but you won't be mad; you'll be happy I hypnotized you! And you'll wanna tell me more about hypnosis so I can do more fun stuff with you! One.. two three!\\" Crystal suddenly become aware of where she was and how she was standing, on her tip toes on one foot with the other in the air. \\"Um, sweetie, what's going on?\\" Katy started giggling, wiggling her little toes. \\"I hypnotized you, aunt Crystal! With the big wheel!\\" Crystal gasped in surprise, covering her mouth with her hand. \\"You did?! That's amazing, sweetie!\\" She walked over to sit next to Katy on the couch, giving her a hug. \\"I can't believe it, haha! What did I do?\\" \\"You thought you were a monkey and a ballerina!\\" Said Katy with excitement and a chuckle. \\"It was soooo funny.\\" Crystal's cheeks started to get quite red. That sounded really embarrassing, but also pretty funny. \\"Heheh.. Good job, sweetie. Now what are you gonna do? The shoe phone suggestion is always fun. Remember when I did that one on your sister?\\" Katy's eyes practically lit up as she was reminded of such a funny suggestion. \\"Oooh, yeah! Sleep, aunt Crystal!\\" Crystal chuckled, before suddenly realizing what Katy had just said. Her eyes rolled back and shut as she went slumped over on the couch, her mind just shutting down. \\"Hehe, woah!\\" Katy said in surprise, amazed at how quickly Crystal just went out and limp. She stood up and got one of her aunt's flip-flops and sat it on the coffee table. \\"When you wake up, you're gonna think your flip-flop is a phone and it's ringing! Wake up, aunt Crystal! Your phone is ringing!\\" \\"Huh?\\" Crystal opened her eyes and sat up quickly, seeing her *phone* on the table. She picked it up fast and tapped it with her finger, then brought it up to her ear. \\"Hello?\\" Katy had to try so hard not to giggle, not wanting to alert her to what was happening. \\"Hello, this is momm- I mean your sister, Stacy!\\" Katy said, pretending to be her own mom. \\"Oh, hey! Me and Katy were just talking. She hypnotized me!\\" Said Crytsal, rolling her eyes and smiling. If only she knew she was talking to a flip-flop. \\"That little brat.\\" She joked. \\"Oh my, that's cool! Make sure you let Katy eat all the candy and ice cream she wants, okay? Bye bye!\\" Katy said with a smirk, wiggling her little toes with glee. \\"Oh, you sure?\\" Crystal replied, raising an eyebrow. \\"Alright, sure thing! See you later, Stacy.\\" She tapped her flip-flop again to hang up, like it was totally normal, before turning to Katy. \\"Well Katy, I've got good news. Your mom said you can eat anything you want! So, what would you like?\\" \\"Ooh!\\" Katy's smile grew as big as can be. Hypnosis was amazing! And boy was she ready to eat. \\"Get me a big bowl of ice cream with lots of whipped cream! And sprinkles! And chocolate syrup!\\" Crystal's eyes widened and she started to laugh. \\"Okay, okay! Let me go get it.\\" She chuckled as she stood up from the couch and headed to the kitchen. Katy sat on the couch, ready for some ice cream! Her little feet were kicking back and forth as she felt like she couldn't take the wait. Eventually, Crystal walked in and Katy was amazed with what she saw! It was a big bowl with a mountain of ice cream, sprinkles, whipped cream and syrup! \\"Oh my gosh, thank you, aunt Crystal!\\" \\"You're welcome, sweetie.\\" Said Crystal, as she gave Katy the ice cream. \\"I'm going to get my work done now.\\" She turned, headed towards her office. \\"Uhh, wait! You wanna rub my feet!\\" Katy snapped her fingers and giggled, before taking a big bite of ice cream. \\"Huh? Oh, you're right sweetie, of course!\\" Crystal agreed, turning back around and sitting on the floor. She lifted Katy's feet up and started rubbing them for her. \\"That feel good?\\" \\"Mmm yup!\\" Katy replied, a mouth full of ice cream. \\"That feels real good!\\" She said before eating another heaping helping. \\"Haha, good. Make sure you don't get a brain freeze from eating too fast!\\" Crystal warned Katy. \\"Oh yeah, thank you.\\" Katy replied, but that gave her an idea. \\"Aunt Crystal.. freeze!\\" \\"Ye-\\" Instantly, Crystal froze in place, her hands on her niece's feet, as she was in the middle of speaking. She was completely still and staring ahead, not even blinking. \\"Hehe...\\" The girl giggled as she stuck her big toe up to Crystal's nose before saying, \\"Unfreeze!\\" \\"-Yes, Ka- Oh!\\" Crystal said in surprise, moving the girl's foot away. \\"Gross! I don't want your toes up my nose!\\" She said with a laugh. \\"How did they even get there?!\\" The little girl started cracking up, before taking another bite of ice cream. \\"Hehehe, that was funny!\\" Katy continued to eat and eat until all the ice cream was gone. By the time she was finished, she had ice cream on her face and felt so full. \\"Oh my gosh, I can't eat anything else...\\" She said, holding her tummy. \\"But I want you to entertain me more, Aunt Crystal! Now you're playing the piano!\\" She shouted, snapping her fingers. Suddenly, without a chance to react, Crystal went wide-eyed and put her hands up in the air in front of her, moving her fingers as if she was pressing piano keys. This got a good giggle out of Katy, when she thought of something else. \\"Now you think my toes are the piano!\\" The girl exclaimed, putting her toes up to her aunt and spreading them. Crystal lowered her hands and started tapping Katy's tiny toes, like they were the keys to the piano now. \\"Hahaha!\\" Katy cracked up, her aunt's fingers tickling her. \\"This is so funny ahahahaha! Wake up!\\" Crystal blinked a couple times and looked around, disoriented, before seeing her fingers on Katy's toes. \\"What the?!\\" She laughed. \\"You played my toes like a piano! Haha!\\" Katy told her, curling her toes in front of her aunt. \\"What? Oh my gosh!\\" Crystal laughed as she replied. \\"You're quite a good little hypnotist, you know that, Katy? Maybe you will be like your aunt when you grew up! But that's enough for now sweetie, I really need to get this work done and your mom will be here soo-\\" \\"SLEEP!\\" Suddenly yelled Katy, catching her off guard. Crystal's eyes rolled back and she went limp, her head limping forward as she again entered that wonderful trance. \\"Haha! You're under my control and there's nothing you can do about it!\\" Katy stuck out her tongue at her entranced aunt. \\"When you wake up, you're gonna think you're a horse! Wake up!\\" The aunt slowly lifted her head up, her eyes a bit crossed, as she got on all fours and said \\"Neeeiiiggghhhh!\\" like a trusty steed. \\"Haha, take me on a ride, horsey!\\" Said Katy as she climbed onto her aunt's back and sat down. \\"Yeehaa!\\" \\"Neeiiiggghhhhhhh!\\" Crystal started to crawl around the room fast, thinking she was a beautiful horse and Katy was a cowgirl riding her. \\"Haha! Woah!\\" Katy said, having the time of her life right now. She pretended to be a cowgirl, shooting the air with finger guns. \\"Pew pew! Yeehaw! Good horsey! Now stop and let me get off.\\" The girl said, before getting off of her aunt's back. It sounded like a car had just pulled up outside. Katy looked out the window, and sure enough, it was her mom! \\"Oh! Okay, Aunt Crystal. When you wake up, you won't remember being hypnotized and think we just played together all night! And you'll tell my mommy I was really, really good!\\" There was a knock at the door. \\"Wake up and answer the door!\\" Crystal opened her eyes and looked around, wondering why she was on the floor, but that didn't really matter. She needed to open the door because Stacy was home. \\"Hey, you're back! Katy was soooo good!\\" Crystal said as she opened the door for her sister. \\"Perfect!\\" Replied Stacy. \\"Did you have fun, sweetie?\\" She asked her daughter, who was putting her shoes on to get ready to leave. \\"Yes! It was so much fun!\\" Katy said with a giggle, knowing all the things she made her aunt do and that her aunt was totally unaware. \\"Bye, aunt Crystal!\\" She said, heading for the door.","completion":"[We open to a sunny suburban neighborhood. The camera zooms in on a quaint house with a well-manicured lawn.

But for now, help yourself to some TV. I've got a mountain of work to get through. [KATY's smile falters as she heads to the living room and flicks on the news.

For those that don’t know, a human is a real bipedal lifeform of mid-range intelligence, living a largely deluded existence on a small water-logged planet in a very lonely corner of the universe. For the rest of you, and those who sent me, humans are in many respects exactly as strange as you would expect them to be. Certainly it is true that on a first sighting you would be appalled by their physical appearance. Their faces alone contain all manner of hideous curiosities. A protuberant central nose, thin-skinned lips, primitive external auditory organs known as ‘ears’, tiny eyes and unfathomably pointless eyebrows. All of which take a long time to mentally absorb and accept. The manners and social customs too are a baffling enigma at first. Their conversation topics are very rarely the things they want to be talking about, and I could write ninety-seven books on body shame and clothing etiquette before you would get even close to understanding them. Oh, and let’s not forget The Things They Do To Make Themselves Happy That Actually Make Them Miserable. This is an infinite list. It includes – shopping, watching TV, taking the better job, getting the bigger house, writing a semi-autobiographical novel, educating their young, making their skin look mildly less old, and harbouring a vague desire to believe there might be a meaning to it all. Yes, it is all very amusing, in a painful kind of way. But I have discovered human poetry while on Earth. One of these poets, the very best one (her name was Emily Dickinson), said this: ‘I dwell in possibility.’ So let us humour ourselves and do the same. Let us open our minds entirely, for what you are about to read will need every prejudice you may have to stand aside in the name of understanding. of understanding. And let us consider this: what if there actually is a meaning to human life? And what if – humour me – life on Earth is something not just to fear and ridicule but also cherish? What then? Some of you may know what I have done by now, but none of you know the reason. This document, this guide, this account – call it what you will – will make everything clear. I plead with you to read this book with an open mind, and to work out for yourself the true value of human life. Let there be peace. PART I I took my power in my hand The man I was not So, what is this? You ready? Okay. Inhale. I will tell you. This book, this actual book, is set right here, on Earth. It is about the meaning of life and nothing at all. It is about what it takes to kill somebody, and save them. It is about love and dead poets and wholenut peanut butter. It’s about matter and antimatter, everything and nothing, hope and hate. It’s about a forty- one-year-old female historian called Isobel and her fifteen-year-old son called Gulliver and the cleverest mathematician in the world. It is, in short, about how to become a human. But let me state the obvious. I was not one. That first night, in the cold and the dark and the wind, I was nowhere near. Before I read Cosmopolitan, in the garage, I had never even seen this written language. I realise that this could be your first time too. To give you an idea of the way people here consume stories, I have put this book together as a human would. The words I use are human words, typed in a human font, laid out consecutively in the human style. With your almost instantaneous ability to translate even the most exotic and primitive linguistic forms, I trust comprehension should not be a problem. Now, to reiterate, I was not Professor Andrew Martin. I was like you. Professor Andrew Martin was merely a role. A disguise. Someone I needed to be in order to complete a task. A task that had begun with his abduction, and death. (I am conscious this is setting a grim tone, so I will resolve not to mention death again for at least the rest of this page.) The point is that I was not a forty-three-year-old mathematician – husband, father – who taught at Cambridge University and who had devoted the last eight years of his life to solving a mathematical problem that had so far proved unsolvable. Prior to arriving on Earth I did not have mid-brown hair that fell in a natural side-parting. Equally, I did not have an opinion on The Planets by Holtz or Talking Heads’ second album, as I did not agree with the concept of music. Or I shouldn’t have, anyway. And how could I believe that Australian wine was automatically inferior to wine sourced from other regions on the planet when I had never drunk anything but liquid nitrogen? Belonging as I did to a post-marital species, it goes without saying that I hadn’t been a neglectful husband with an eye for one of my students any more than I had been a man who walked his English Springer Spaniel – a category of hairy domestic deity otherwise known as a ‘dog’ – as an excuse to leave the house. Nor had I written books on mathematics, or insisted that my publishers use an author photograph that was now nearing its fifteenth anniversary. No, I wasn’t that man. I had no feeling for that man whatsoever. And yet he had been real, as real as you and I, a real mammalian life form, a diploid, eukaryotic primate who, five minutes before midnight, had been sitting at his desk, staring at his computer screen and drinking black coffee (don’t worry, I shall explain coffee and my misadventures with it a little later). A life form who may or may not have jumped out of his chair as the breakthrough came, as his mind arrived at a place no human mind had ever reached before, the very edge of knowledge. And at some point shortly after his breakthrough he had been taken by the hosts. My employers. I had even met him, for the very briefest of moments. Enough for the – wholly incomplete – reading to be made. It was complete physically, just not mentally. You see, you can clone human brains but not what is stored inside them, not much of it anyway, so I had to learn a lot of things for myself. I was a forty-three-year-old newborn on planet Earth. It would become annoying to me, later on, that I had never met him properly, as meeting him properly would have been extremely useful. He could have told me about Maggie, for one thing. (Oh, how I wish he had told me about Maggie!) However, any knowledge I gained was not going to alter the simple fact that I had to halt progress. That is what I was there for. To destroy evidence of the breakthrough Professor Andrew Martin had made. Evidence that lived not only in computers but in living human beings. Now, where should we start? I suppose there is only one place. We should start with when I was hit by the car. Detached nouns and other early trials for the language- learner Yes, like I said, we should start with when I was hit by the car. We have to, really. Because for quite a while before that there was nothing. There was nothing and nothing and nothing and— Something. Me, standing there, on the ‘road’. Once there, I had several immediate reactions. First, what was with the weather? I was not really used to weather you had to think about. But this was England, a part of Earth where thinking about the weather was the chief human activity. And for good reason. Second, where was the computer? There was meant to be a computer. Not that I actually knew what Professor Martin’s computer would look like. Maybe it looked like a road. Third, what was that noise? A kind of muted roaring. And fourth: it was night. Being something of a homebird, I was not really accustomed to night. And even if I had been, this wasn’t just any night. It was the kind of night I had never known. This was night to the power of night to the power of night. This was night cubed. A sky full of uncompromising darkness, with no stars and no moon. Where were the suns? Were there even suns? The cold suggested there might not have been. The cold was a shock. The cold hurt my lungs, and the harsh wind beating against my skin caused me to shake. I wondered if humans ever went outside. They must have been insane if they did. Inhaling was difficult, at first. And this was a concern. After all, inhaling really was one of the most important requirements of being a human. But I eventually got the knack. And then another worry. I was not where I was meant to be, that was increasingly clear. I was meant to be where he had been. I was meant to be in an office, but this wasn’t an office. I knew that, even then. Not unless it was an office that contained an entire sky, complete with those dark, congregating clouds and that unseen moon. clouds and that unseen moon. It took a while – too long – to understand the situation. I did not know at that time what a road was, but I can now tell you that a road is something that connects points of departure with points of arrival. This is important. On Earth, you see, you can’t just move from one place to another place instantaneously. The technology isn’t there yet. It is nowhere near there yet. No. On Earth you have to spend a lot of time travelling in between places, be it on roads or on rail- tracks or in careers or relationships. This particular type of road was a motorway. A motorway is the most advanced type of road there is, which as with most forms of human advancement essentially meant accidental death was considerably more probable. My naked feet were standing on something called tarmac, feeling its strange and brutal texture. I looked at my left hand. It seemed so crude and unfamiliar, and yet my laughter halted when I realised this fingered freakish thing was a part of me. I was a stranger to myself. Oh, and by the way, the muted roaring was still there, minus the muted part. It was then I noticed what was approaching me at considerable speed. The lights. White, wide and low, they may as well have been the bright eyes of a fast- moving plain-sweeper, silver-backed, and now screaming. It was trying to slow, and swerve. There was no time for me to move out of the way. There had been, but not now. I had waited too long. And so it hit me with great, uncompromising force. A force which hurled me off the ground and sent me flying. Only not real flying, because humans can’t fly, no matter how much they flap their limbs. The only real option was pain, which I felt right until I landed, after which I returned to nothing again. Nothing and nothing and – Something. A man wearing clothes stood over me. The proximity of his face troubled me. No. A few degrees more than troubled. I was repulsed, terrified. I had never seen anything like this man. The face seemed so alien, full of unfathomable openings and protrusions. The nose, in particular, bothered me. It seemed to my innocent eyes like there was something else inside him, pushing through. I looked lower. Noticed his clothes. He was wearing what I would later realise were a shirt and a tie, trousers and shoes. The exact clothes he should have been wearing and yet they seemed so exotic I didn’t know whether to laugh or scream. He was looking at my injuries. Or rather: for them. I checked my left hand. It hadn’t been touched. The car had collided with my I checked my left hand. It hadn’t been touched. The car had collided with my legs, then my torso, but my hand was fine. ‘It’s a miracle,’ he said quietly, as though it was a secret. But the words were meaningless. He stared into my face and raised his voice, to compete with the sound of cars. ‘What are you doing out here?’ Again, nothing. It was just a mouth moving, making noise. I could tell it was a simple language, but I needed to hear at least a hundred words of a new language before I could piece the whole grammatical jigsaw together. Don’t judge me on this. I know some of you need only ten or so, or just a single adjectival clause somewhere. But languages were never my thing. Part of my aversion to travel, I suppose. I must reiterate this. I did not want to be sent here. It was a job that someone had to do and – following my blasphemous talk at the Museum of Quadratic Equations, my so-called crime against mathematical purity – the hosts believed it to be a suitable punishment. They knew it was a job no one in their right mind would choose to do and, though my task was important, they knew I (like you) belonged to the most advanced race in the known universe and so would be up to the job. ‘I know you from somewhere. I recognise your face. Who are you?’ I felt tired. That was the trouble with teleportation and matter shifting and bio- setting. It really took it out of you. And even though it put it back in to you, energy was always the price. I slipped into darkness and enjoyed dreams tinged with violet and indigo and home. I dreamed of cracked eggs and prime numbers and ever-shifting skylines. And then I awoke. I was inside a strange vehicle, strapped to primitive heart-reading equipment. Two humans, male and female (the female’s appearance confirmed my worst fears. Within this species, ugliness does not discriminate between genders), dressed in green. They seemed to be asking me something in quite an agitated fashion. Maybe it was because I was using my new upper limbs to rip off the crudely designed electrocardiographic equipment. They tried to restrain me, but they apparently had very little understanding of the mathematics involved, and so with relative ease I managed to leave the two green-clothed humans on the floor, writhing around in pain. I rose to my feet, noticing just how much gravity there was on this planet as the driver turned to ask me an even more urgent question. The vehicle was moving fast, and the undulating sound waves of the siren were an undeniable distraction, but I opened the door and leapt towards the soft vegetation at the side of the road. My body rolled. I hid. And then, once it was safe to appear, I got to my feet. Compared to a human hand, a foot is relatively untroubling, toes aside. aside. I stood there for a while, just staring at all those odd cars, confined to the ground, evidently reliant on fossil fuel and each making more noise than it took to power a polygon generator. And the even odder sight of the humans – all clothed inside, holding on to circular steer-control equipment and, sometimes, extra-biological telecommunications devices. I have come to a planet where the most intelligent life form still has to drive its own cars . . . Never before had I so appreciated the simple splendours you and I have grown up with. The eternal light. The smooth, floating traffic. The advanced plant life. The sweetened air. The non-weather. Oh, gentle readers, you really have no idea. Cars blared high-frequency horns as they passed me. Wide-eyed, gape- mouthed faces stared out of windows. I didn’t understand it, I looked as ugly as any of them. Why wasn’t I blending in? What was I doing wrong? Maybe it was because I wasn’t in a car. Maybe that’s how humans lived, permanently contained in cars. Or maybe it was because I wasn’t wearing any clothes. It was a cold night, but could it really have been something so trivial as a lack of artificial body-covering? No, it couldn’t be as simple as that. I looked up at the sky. There was evidence of the moon now, veiled by thin cloud. It too seemed to be gawping down at me with the same sense of shock. But the stars were still blanketed, out of sight. I wanted to see them. I wanted to feel their comfort. On top of all this, rain was a distinct possibility. I hated rain. To me, as to most of you dome-dwellers, rain was a terror of almost mythological proportions. I needed to find what I was looking for before the clouds opened. There was a rectangular aluminium sign ahead of me. Nouns minus context are always tricky for the language learner, but the arrow was pointing only one way so I followed it. Humans kept on lowering their windows and shouting things at me, above the sound of their engines. Sometimes this seemed good-humoured, as they were spitting oral fluid, in my direction, orminurk-style. So I spat back in a friendly fashion, trying to hit their fast-moving faces. This seemed to encourage more shouting, but I tried not to mind. Soon, I told myself, I would understand what the heavily articulated greeting ‘get off the fucking road you fucking wanker’ actually meant. In the meantime I kept walking, got past the sign, and saw an illuminated but disconcertingly unmoving building by the side of the road. I will go to it, I told myself. I will go to it and find some answers. Texaco The building was called ‘Texaco’. It stood there shining in the night with a terrible stillness, like it was waiting to come alive. As I walked towards it, I noticed it was some kind of refill station. Cars were parked there, under a horizontal canopy and stationed next to simple-looking fuel-delivery systems. It was confirmed: the cars did absolutely nothing for themselves. They were practically brain dead, if they even had brains. The humans who were refuelling their vehicles stared at me as they went inside. Trying to be as polite as possible, given my verbal limitations, I spat an ample amount of saliva towards them. I entered the building. There was a clothed human behind the counter. Instead of his hair being on the top of his head it covered the bottom half of his face. His body was more spherical than other humans’ so he was marginally better looking. From the scent of hexanoic acid and androsterone I could tell personal hygiene wasn’t one of his top priorities. He stared at my (admittedly distressing) genitalia and then pressed something behind the counter. I spat, but the greeting was unreciprocated. Maybe I had got it wrong about the spitting. All this salivatory offloading was making me thirsty, so I went over to a humming refrigerated unit full of brightly coloured cylindrical objects. I picked one of them up, and opened it. A can of liquid called ‘Diet Coke’. It tasted extremely sweet, with a trace of phosphoric acid. It was disgusting. It burst out of my mouth almost the moment it entered. Then I consumed something else. A foodstuff wrapped in synthetic packaging. This was, I would later realise, a planet of things wrapped inside things. Food inside wrappers. Bodies inside clothes. Contempt inside smiles. Everything was hidden away. The foodstuff was called Mars. That got a little bit further down my throat, but only far enough to discover I had a gag reflex. I closed the door and saw a container with the words ‘Pringles’ and ‘Barbecue’ on it. I opened it up and started to eat. They tasted okay – a bit like sorp-cake – and I crammed as many as I could into my mouth. I wondered when I had last actually fed myself, with no assistance. I seriously couldn’t remember. Not since infancy, that was for sure. seriously couldn’t remember. Not since infancy, that was for sure. ‘You can’t do that. You can’t just eat stuff. You’ve got to pay for it.’ The man behind the counter was talking to me. I still had little idea of what he was saying, but from the volume and frequency I sensed it wasn’t good. Also, I observed that his skin – in the places on his face where it was visible – was changing colour. I noticed the lighting above my head, and I blinked. I placed my hand over my mouth and made a noise. Then I held it at arm’s length and made the same noise, noting the difference. It was comforting to know that even in the most remote corner of the universe the laws of sound and light obeyed themselves, although it has to be said they seemed a little more lacklustre here. There were shelves full of what I would shortly know as ‘magazines’, nearly all of which had faces with near-identical smiles on the front of them. Twenty- six noses. Fifty-two eyes. It was an intimidating sight. I picked up one of these magazines as the man picked up the phone. On Earth, the media is still locked in a pre-capsule age and most of it has to be read via an electronic device or via a printed medium made of a thin, chemically pulped tree-derivative known as paper. Magazines are very popular, despite no human ever feeling better for having read them. Indeed, their chief purpose is to generate a sense of inferiority in the reader that consequently leads to them needing to buy something, which they do, and then feel even worse, and so need to buy another magazine to see what they can buy next. It is an eternal and unhappy spiral that goes by the name of capitalism and it is really quite popular. The particular publication I was holding was called Cosmopolitan, and I realised that if nothing else it would help me grasp the language. It didn’t take long. Written human languages are preposterously simple, as they are made up almost entirely of words. I had interpolated the entire written language by the end of the first article, in addition to the touch that can boost your mood – as well as your relationship. Also: orgasms, I realised, were an incredibly big deal. It seemed orgasms were the central tenet of life here. Maybe this was the only meaning they had on this planet. Their purpose was simply to pursue the enlightenment of orgasm. A few seconds of relief from the surrounding dark. But reading wasn’t speaking and my new vocal equipment was still sitting there, in my mouth and throat, like yet more food I didn’t know how to swallow. I placed the magazine back on the shelf. There was a thin vertical piece of reflective metal beside the stand, allowing me a partial glimpse of myself. I too had a protruding nose. And lips. Hair. Ears. So much externality. It was a very inside-out kind of look. Plus a large lump in the centre of my neck. Very thick eyebrows. A piece of information came to me, something I remembered from what the hosts had told me. Professor Andrew Martin. My heart raced. A surge of panic. This was what I was now. This was who I had become. I tried to comfort myself by remembering it was just temporary. At the bottom of the magazine stand were some newspapers. There were photographs of more smiling faces, and some of dead bodies too, lying beside demolished buildings. Next to the newspapers was a small collection of maps. A Road Map of the British Isles was among them. Perhaps I was on the British Isles. I picked up the map and tried to leave the building. The man hung up the phone. The door was locked. Information arrived, unprompted: Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University. ‘You’re not bloody leaving,’ said the man, in words I was beginning to comprehend. ‘The police are on their way. I’ve locked the door.’ To his bafflement, I then proceeded to open the door. I stepped out and heard a distant siren. I listened, and realised the noise was only three hundred metres away and getting rapidly closer. I began to move, running as fast as I could away from the road and up a grass embankment towards another flat area. There were lots of stationary haulage vehicles, parked in an ordered geometric fashion. This was such a strange world. Of course, when viewed afresh there were only strange worlds but this one must have been strangest of all. I tried to see the similarity. I told myself that here all things were still made of atoms, and that those atoms would work precisely as atoms always do. They would move towards each other if there was distance between them. If there was no distance between them, they would repel each other. That was the most basic law of the universe, and it applied to all things, even here. There was comfort in that. The knowledge that wherever you were in the universe, the small things were always exactly the same. Attracting and repelling. It was only by not looking closely enough that you saw difference. But still, right then, difference was all I saw. The car with the siren was now pulling into the fuelling station, flashing blue light, so I hid among the parked lorries for a few minutes. I was freezing, and crouched into myself, my whole body shaking and my testicles shrinking. (A male human’s testicles were the most attractive thing about him, I realised, and vastly unappreciated by humans themselves, who would very often rather look at anything else, including smiling faces.) Before the police car left I heard a voice behind me. Not a police officer but the driver of the vehicle I was crouched behind me. Not a police officer but the driver of the vehicle I was crouched behind. ‘Hey, what are you doing? Fuck off away from my lorry.’ I ran away, my bare feet hitting hard ground scattered with random pieces of grit. And then I was on grass, running across a field, and I kept on in the same direction until I reached another road. This one was much narrower and had no traffic at all. I opened the map, found the line which matched the curve of this other road and saw that word: ‘Cambridge’. I headed there. As I walked and breathed in that nitrogen-rich air the idea of myself was forming. Professor Andrew Martin. With the name, came facts sent across space by those who had sent me. I was to be a married man. I was forty-three years old, the exact mid-point in a human life. I had a son. I was the professor who had just solved the most significant mathematic puzzle the humans had ever faced. I had, only three short hours ago, advanced the human race beyond anyone’s imagining. The facts made me queasy but I kept on heading in the direction of Cambridge, to see what else these humans had in store for me. Corpus Christi I was not told to provide this document of human life. That was not in my brief. Yet I feel obliged to do so to explain some remarkable features of human existence. I hope you will thereby understand why I chose to do what, by now, some of you must know I did. Anyhow, I had always known Earth was a real place. I knew that, of course I did. I had consumed, in capsule form, the famous travelogue The Fighting Idiots: My Time with the Humans of Water Planet 7,081. I knew Earth was a real event in a dull and distant solar system, where not a great deal happened and where travel options for the locals were severely limited. I’d also heard that humans were a life form of, at best, middling intelligence and one prone to violence, deep sexual embarrassment, bad poetry and walking around in circles. But I was starting to realise no preparation could have been enough. By morning I was in this Cambridge place. It was horrendously fascinating. The buildings were what I noticed first, and it was quite startling to realise that the garage hadn’t been a one-off. All such structures – whether built for consumerist, habitative or other purposes – were static and stuck to the ground. Of course, this was meant to be my town. This was where ‘I’ had lived, on and off, for over twenty years. And I would have to act like that was true, even though it was the most alien place I had ever seen in my life. The lack of geometric imagination was startling. There was not so much as a decagon in sight. Though I did notice that some of the buildings were larger and – relatively speaking – more ornately designed than others. Temples to the orgasm, I imagined. Shops were beginning to open. In human towns, I would soon learn, everywhere is a shop. Shops are to Earth-dwellers what equation booths are to Vonnadorians. In one such shop I saw lots of books in the window. I was reminded that humans have to read books. They actually need to sit down and look at each word consecutively. And that takes time. Lots of time. A human can’t just swallow every book going, can’t chew different tomes simultaneously, or gulp down near-infinite knowledge in a matter of seconds. They can’t just pop a word-capsule in their mouth like we can. Imagine! Being not only mortal but also forced to take some of that precious and limited time and read. No wonder they were a species of primitives. By the time they had read enough books to actually reach a state of knowledge where they can do anything with it they are dead. Understandably, a human needs to know what kind of book they are about to read. They need to know if it is a love story. Or a murder story. Or a story about aliens. There are other questions, too, that humans have in bookstores. Such as, is it one of those books they read to feel clever, or one of those they will pretend never to have read in order to stay looking clever? Will it make them laugh, or cry? Or will it simply force them to stare out of the window watching the tracks of raindrops? Is it a true story? Or is it a false one? Is it the kind of story that will work on their brain or one which aims for lower organs? Is it one of those books that ends up acquiring religious followers or getting burned by them? Is it a book about mathematics or – like everything else in the universe – simply because of it? Yes, there are lots of questions. And even more books. So, so many. Humans in their typical human way have written far too many to get through. Reading is added to that great pile of things – work, love, sexual prowess, the words they didn’t say when they really needed to say them – that they are bound to feel a bit dissatisfied about. So, humans need to know about a book. Just as they need to know, when they apply for a job, if it will cause them to lose their mind at the age of fifty-nine and lead them to jump out of the office window. Or if, when they go on a first date, the person who is now making witticisms about his year in Cambodia will one day leave her for a younger woman called Francesca who runs her own public relations firm and says Kafkaesque without having ever read Kafka. Anyway, there I was walking into this bookshop and having a look at some of the books out on the tables. I noticed two of the females who worked there were laughing and pointing towards my mid-section. Again, I was confused. Weren’t men meant to go in bookshops? Was there some kind of war of ridicule going on between the genders? Did booksellers spend all their time mocking their customers? Or was it that I wasn’t wearing any clothes? Who knew? Anyway, it was a little distracting, especially as the only laughter I had ever heard had been the fur-muffled chuckle of an Ipsoid. I tried to focus on the books themselves, and decided to look at those stacked on the shelves. and decided to look at those stacked on the shelves. I soon noticed that the system they were using was alphabetical and related to the initial letter in the last name of each author. As the human alphabet only has 26 letters it was an incredibly simple system, and I soon found the Ms. One of these M books was called The Dark Ages and it was by Isobel Martin. I pulled it off the shelf. It had a little sign on it saying ‘Local Author’. There was only one of them in stock, which was considerably fewer than the number of books by Andrew Martin. For example, there were thirteen copies of an Andrew Martin book called The Square Circle and eleven of another one called American Pi. They were both about mathematics. I picked up these books and realised they both said ‘£8.99’ on the back. The interpolation of the entire language I had done with the aid of Cosmopolitan meant I knew this was the price of the books, but I did not have any money. So I waited until no one was looking (a long time) and then I ran very fast out of the shop. I eventually settled into a walk, as running without clothes is not entirely compatible with external testicles, and then I started to read. I searched both books for the Riemann hypothesis, but I couldn’t find anything except unrelated references to the long-dead German mathematician Bernhard Riemann himself. I let the books drop to the ground. People were really beginning to stop and stare. All around me were things I didn’t quite yet comprehend: litter, advertisements, bicycles. Uniquely human things. I passed a large man with a long coat and a hairy face who, judging from his asymmetrical gait, seemed to be injured. Of course, we may know brief pain, but this did not seem of that type. It reminded me that this was a place of death. Things deteriorated, degenerated, and died here. The life of a human was surrounded on all sides by darkness. How on Earth did they cope? Idiocy, from slow reading. It could only be idiocy. This man, though, didn’t seem to be coping. His eyes were full of sorrow and suffering. ‘Jesus,’ the man mumbled. I think he was mistaking me for someone. ‘I’ve seen it all now.’ He smelt of bacterial infection and several other repugnant things I couldn’t identify. I thought about asking him for directions, as the map was rendered in only two dimensions and a little vague, but I wasn’t up to it yet. I might have been able to say the words but I didn’t have the confidence to direct them towards such a close face, with its bulbous nose and sad pink eyes. (How did I know his such a close face, with its bulbous nose and sad pink eyes. (How did I know his eyes were sad? That is an interesting question, especially as we Vonnadorians never really feel sadness. The answer is I don’t know. It was a feeling I had. A ghost inside me, maybe the ghost of the human I had become. I didn’t have all his memories, but did I have other things. Was empathy part-biological? All I know is it unsettled me, more than the sight of pain. Sadness seemed to me like a disease, and I worried it was contagious.) So I walked past him and, for the first time in as long as I could remember, I tried to find my own way to somewhere. Now, I knew Professor Martin worked at the university but I had no idea what a university looked like. I guessed they wouldn’t be zirconium-clad space stations hovering just beyond the atmosphere, but other than that I didn’t really know. The ability to view two different buildings and say, oh this was that type of building, and that was this, well, that was simply lost on me. So I kept walking, ignoring the gasps and the laughter, and feeling whichever brick or glass façade I was passing by, as though touch held more answers than sight. And then the very worst possible thing happened. (Brace yourselves, Vonnadorians.) It began to rain. The sensation of it on my skin and my hair was horrific, and I needed it to end. I felt so exposed. I began to jog, looking for an entry into somewhere. Anywhere. I passed a vast building with a large gate and sign outside. The sign said ‘The College of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary’. Having read Cosmopolitan I knew what ‘virgin’ meant in full detail but I had a problem with some of the other words. Corpus and Christi seemed to inhabit a space just beyond the language. Corpus was something to do with body, so maybe Corpus Christi was a tantric full body orgasm. In truth, I didn’t know. There were smaller words too, and a different sign. These words said ‘Cambridge University’. I used my left hand to open the gate and walked through, on to grass, heading towards the building that still had lights on. Signs of life and warmth. The grass was wet. The soft dampness of it repulsed me and I seriously considered screaming. It was very neatly trimmed, this grass. I was later to realise that a neatly trimmed lawn was a powerful signifier, and should have commanded in me a slight sense of fear and respect, especially in conjunction (as this was) with ‘grand’ architecture. But right then, I was oblivious to both the significance of tidy grass and architectural grandeur and so I kept walking, towards the main building. A car stopped somewhere behind me. Again, there were blue lights flashing, sliding across the stone façade of Corpus Christi. sliding across the stone façade of Corpus Christi. (Flashing blue lights on Earth = trouble.) A man ran towards me. There was a whole crowd of other humans behind him. Where had they come from? They all seemed so sinister, in a pack, with their odd-looking clothed forms. They were aliens to me. That was the obvious part. What was less obvious was the way I seemed like an alien to them. After all, I looked like them. Maybe this was another human trait. Their ability to turn on themselves, to ostracise their own kind. If that was the case, it added weight to my mission. It made me understand it better. Anyway, there I was, on the wet grass, with the man running towards me and the crowd further away. I could have run, or fought, but there were too many of them – some with archaic-looking recording equipment. The man grabbed me. ‘Come with me, sir.’ I thought of my purpose. But right then I had to comply. Indeed, I just wanted to get out of the rain. ‘I am Professor Andrew Martin,’ I said, having complete confidence that I knew how to say this phrase. And that is when I discovered the truly terrifying power of other people’s laughter. ‘I have a wife and a son,’ I said, and I gave their names. ‘I need to see them. Can you take me to see them?’ ‘No. Not right now. No, we can’t.’ He held my arm tightly. I wanted, more than anything, for his hideous hand to let go. To be touched by one of them, let alone gripped, was too much. And yet I did not attempt to resist as he led me towards a vehicle. I was supposed to draw as little attention to myself as possible while doing my task. In that, I was failing already. You must strive to be normal. Yes. You must try to be like them. I know. Do not escape prematurely. I won’t. But I don’t want to be here. I want to go home. You know you can’t do that. Not yet. But I will run out of time. I must get to the professor’s office, and to his home. You are right. You must. But first you need to stay calm, and do what they tell you. Go where they want you to go. Do what they want you to do. They must never know who sent you. Do not panic. Professor Andrew Martin is not among them now. You are. There will be time. They die, and so they have impatience. Their lives are short. Yours is not. Do not become like them. Use your gifts wisely. I will. But I am scared. You have every right to be. You are among the humans. Human clothes They made me put on clothes. What humans didn’t know about architecture or non-radioactive isotopic helium-based fuels, they more than made up for with their knowledge of clothes. They were geniuses in the area, and knew all the subtleties. And there were, I promise you, thousands of them. The way clothes worked was this: there was an under layer and an outer layer. The under layer consisted of ‘pants’ and ‘socks’ which covered the heavily scented regions of the genitals, bottom and feet. There was also the option of a ‘vest’ which covered the marginally less shameful chest area. This area included the sensitive skin protrusions known as ‘nipples’. I had no idea what purpose nipples served, though I did notice a pleasurable sensation when I tenderly stroked my fingers over them. The outer layer of clothing seemed even more important than the under layer. This layer covered ninety-five per cent of the body, leaving only the face, head- hair and hands on show. This outer layer of clothing seemed to be the key to the power structures on this planet. For instance, the two men who took me away in the car with the blue flashing lights were both wearing identical outer layers, consisting of black shoes over their socks, black trousers over their pants, and then, over their upper bodies, there was a white ‘shirt’ and a dark, deep-space blue ‘jumper’. On this jumper, directly over the region of their left nipple, was a rectangular badge made of a slightly finer fabric which had the words ‘Cambridgeshire POLICE’ written on it. Their jackets were the same colour and had the same badge. These were clearly the clothes to wear. However, I soon realised what the word ‘police’ meant. It meant police. I couldn’t believe it. I had broken the law simply by not wearing clothes. I was pretty sure that most humans must have known what a naked human looked like. It wasn’t as though I had done something wrong while not wearing clothes. At least, not yet. They placed me inside a small room that was, in perfect accord with all human rooms, a shrine to the rectangle. The funny thing was that although this room looked precisely no better or worse than anything else in that police station, or indeed that planet, the officers seemed to think it was a particular punishment to be placed in this place – a ‘cell’ – more than any other room. They are in a body that dies, I chuckled to myself, and they worry more about being locked in a room! This was where they told me to get dressed. To ‘cover myself up’. So I picked up those clothes and did my best and then, once I had worked out which limb went through which opening, they said I had to wait for an hour. Which I did. Of course, I could have escaped. But I realised it was more likely that I would find what I needed by staying there, with the police and their computers. Plus, I remembered what I had been told. Use your gifts wisely. You must try and be like them. You must strive to be normal. Then the door opened. Questions There were two men. These were different men. These men weren’t wearing the same clothes, but they did have pretty much the same face. Not just the eyes, protruding nose and mouth but also a shared look of complacent misery. In the stark light I felt not a little afraid. They took me to another room for questioning. This was interesting knowledge: you could only ask questions in certain rooms. There were rooms for sitting and thinking, and rooms for inquisition. They sat down. Anxiety prickled my skin. The kind of anxiety you could only feel on this planet. The anxiety that came from the fact that the only beings who knew who I was were a long way away. They were as far away as it was possible to be. ‘Professor Andrew Martin,’ said one of the men, leaning back in his chair. ‘We’ve done a bit of research. We googled you. You’re quite a big fish in academic circles.’ The man stuck out his bottom lip, and displayed the palms of his hands. He wanted me to say something. What would they plan on doing to me if I didn’t? What could they have done? I had little idea what ‘googling’ me meant, but whatever it was I couldn’t say I had felt it. I didn’t really understand what being a ‘big fish in academic circles’ meant either though I must say it was a kind of relief – given the dimensions of the room – to realise they knew what a circle was. I nodded my head, still a little uneasy about speaking. It involved too much concentration and co-ordination. Then the other one spoke. I switched my gaze to his face. The key difference between them, I suppose, was in the lines of hair above their eyes. This one kept his eyebrows permanently raised, causing the skin of his forehead to wrinkle. ‘What have you got to tell us?’ I thought long and hard. It was time to speak. ‘I am the most intelligent human on the planet. I am a mathematical genius. I have made important contributions to many branches of mathematics, such as group theory, number theory and to many branches of mathematics, such as group theory, number theory and geometry. My name is Professor Andrew Martin.’ They gave each other a look, and released a brief air chuckle out of their noses. ‘Are you thinking this is funny?’ the first one said, aggressively. ‘Committing a public order offence? Does that amuse you? Yeah?’ ‘No. I was just telling you who I am.’ ‘We’ve established that,’ the officer said, who kept his eyebrows low and close, like doona-birds in mating season. ‘The last bit anyway. What we haven’t established is: what were you doing walking around without your clothes on at half past eight in the morning?’ ‘I am a professor at Cambridge University. I am married to Isobel Martin. I have a son, Gulliver. I would very much like to see them, please. Just let me see them.’ They looked at their papers. ‘Yes,’ the first one said. ‘We see you are a teaching fellow at Fitzwilliam College. But that doesn’t explain why you were walking naked around the grounds of Corpus Christi College. You are either off your head or a danger to society, or both.’ ‘I do not like wearing clothes,’ I said, with quite delicate precision. ‘They chafe. They are uncomfortable around my genitals.’ And then, remembering all I had learnt from Cosmopolitan magazine I leant in towards them and added what I thought would be the clincher. ‘They may seriously hinder my chances of achieving tantric full-body orgasm.’ It was then they made a decision, and the decision was to submit me to a psychiatric test. This essentially meant going to another rectilinear room to have to face looking at another human with another protruding nose. This human was female. She was called Priti, which was pronounced ‘pretty’ and means pretty. Unfortunate, given that she was human and, by her very nature, vomit- provoking. ‘Now,’ she said, ‘I would like to start by asking you something very simple. I’m wondering if you’ve been under any pressure recently?’ I was confused. What kind of pressure was she talking about? Atmospheric? Gravitational? ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘A lot. Everywhere, there is some kind of pressure.’ It seemed like the right answer. Coffee She told me she had been talking to the university. This, alone, made little sense. How, for instance, was that done? But then she told me this: ‘They tell me you’ve been working long hours, even by the standards of your peers. They seem very upset about the whole thing. But they are worried about you. As is your wife.’ ‘My wife?’ I knew I had one, and I knew her name, but I didn’t really understand what it actually meant to have a wife. Marriage was a truly alien concept. There probably weren’t enough magazines on the planet for me to ever understand it. She explained. I was even more confused. Marriage was a ‘loving union’ which meant two people who loved each other stayed together for ever. But that seemed to suggest that love was quite a weak force and needed marriage to bolster it. Also, the union could be broken with something called ‘divorce’, which meant there was – as far as I could see – very little point to it, in logical terms. But then, I had no real idea what ‘love’ was, even though it had been one of the most frequently used words in the magazine I’d read. It remained a mystery. And so I asked her to explain that too, and by this point I was bewildered, overdosing on all this bad logic. It sounded like delusion. ‘Do you want a coffee?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. So the coffee came and I tasted it – a hot, foul, acidic, dual-carbon compound liquid – and I spat it out all over her. A major breach of human etiquette – apparently, I was meant to swallow it. ‘What the—’ She stood up and patted herself dry, showing intense concern for her shirt. After that there were more questions. Impossible stuff like, what was my address? What did I do in my spare time, to relax? Of course, I could have fooled her. Her mind was so soft and malleable and its neutral oscillations were so obviously weak that even with my as then still limited command of the language I could have told her I was perfectly fine, and that it was none of her business, and could she please leave me alone. I had that it was none of her business, and could she please leave me alone. I had already worked out the rhythm and the optimal frequency I would have needed. But I didn’t. Do not escape prematurely. Do not panic. There will be time. The truth is, I was quite terrified. My heart had begun racing for no obvious reason. My palms were sweating. Something about the room, and its proportions, coupled with so much contact with this irrational species, was setting me off. Everything here was a test. If you failed one test, there was a test to see why. I suppose they loved tests so much because they believed in free will. Ha! Humans, I was discovering, believed they were in control of their own lives, and so they were in awe of questions and tests, as these made them feel like they had a certain mastery over other people, who had failed in their choices, and who had not worked hard enough on the right answers. And by the end of the last failed test many were sat, as I was soon sat, in a mental hospital, swallowing a mind-blanking pill called diazepam, and placed in another empty room full of right angles. Only this time, I was also inhaling the distressing scent of the hydrogen chloride they used to annihilate bacteria. My task was going to be easy, I decided, in that room. The meat of it, I mean. And the reason it was going to be easy was that I had the same sense of indifference towards them as they had towards single-celled organisms. I could wipe a few of them out, no problem, and for a greater cause than hygiene. But what I didn’t realise was that when it came to that sneaking, camouflaged, untouchable giant known as the Future, I was as vulnerable as anyone. Mad people Humans, as a rule, don’t like mad people unless they are good at painting, and only then once they are dead. But the definition of mad, on Earth, seems to be very unclear and inconsistent. What is perfectly sane in one era turns out to be insane in another. The earliest humans walked around naked with no problem. Certain humans, in humid rainforests mainly, still do so. So, we must conclude that madness is sometimes a question of time, and sometimes of postcode. Basically, the key rule is, if you want to appear sane on Earth you have to be in the right place, wearing the right clothes, saying the right things, and only stepping on the right kind of grass. The cubic root of 912,673 After a while, my wife came to visit. Isobel Martin, in person. Author of The Dark Ages. I wanted to be repulsed by her, as that would make everything easier. I wanted to be horrified and, of course, I was, because the whole species was horrific to me. On that first encounter I thought she was hideous. I was frightened of her. I was frightened of everything here, now. It was an undeniable truth. To be on Earth was to be frightened. I was even frightened by the sight of my own hands. But anyway, Isobel. When I first saw her I saw nothing but a few trillion poorly arranged, mediocre cells. She had a pale face and tired eyes and a narrow, but still protruding nose. There was something very poised and upright about her, something very contained. She seemed, even more than most, to be holding something back. My mouth dried just looking at her. I suppose if there was a challenge with this particular human it was that I was meant to know her very well, and also that I was going to be spending more time with her, to glean the information I needed, before doing what I had to do. She came to see me in my room, while a nurse watched. It was, of course, another test. Everything in human life was a test. That was why they all looked so stressed out. I was dreading her hugging me, or kissing me, or blowing air into my ear or any of those other human things the magazine had told me about, but she didn’t. She didn’t even seem to want to do that. What she wanted to do was sit there and stare at me, as if I were the cubic root of 912,673 and she was trying to work me out. And indeed, I tried very hard to act as harmoniously as that. The indestructible ninety-seven. My favourite prime. Isobel smiled and nodded at the nurse, but when she sat down and faced me I realised she was exhibiting a few universal signs of fear – tight facial muscles, dilated pupils, fast breathing. I paid special attention to her hair now. She had dark hair growing out of the top and rear of her head which extended to just above her shoulders where it halted abruptly to form a straight horizontal line. This was known as a ‘bob’. She sat tall in her chair with a straight back, and her neck was long, as if her head had fallen out with her body and wanted nothing more to do with it. I would later discover that she was forty-one and had an appearance which passed for beautiful, or at least plainly beautiful, on this planet. But right then she had just another human face. And human faces were the last of the human codes that I would learn. She inhaled. ‘How are you feeling?’ ‘I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things. My mind is a little bit scrambled, especially about this morning. Listen, has anyone been to my office? Since yesterday?’ This confused her. ‘I don’t know. How would I know that? I doubt very much they’ll be in at the weekend. And anyway you’re the only one who has the keys. Please, Andrew, what happened? Have you suffered an accident? Have they tested you for amnesia? Why were you out of the house at that time? Tell me what you were doing. I woke up and you weren’t there.’ ‘I just needed to get out. That is all. I needed to be outside.’ She was agitated now. ‘I was thinking all sorts of things. I checked the whole house, but there was no sign of you. And the car was still there, and your bike, and you weren’t picking up your phone, and it was three in the morning, Andrew. Three in the morning.’ I nodded. She wanted answers, but I only had questions, ‘Where is our son? Gulliver? Why is he not with you?’ This answer confused her even more. ‘He’s at my mother’s,’ she said. ‘I could hardly bring him here. He’s very upset. After everything else this is, you know, hard for him.’ Nothing she was telling me was information I needed. So I decided to be more direct. ‘Do you know what I did yesterday? Do you know what I achieved while I was at work?’ I knew that however she answered this, the truth remained the same. I would have to kill her. Not then. Not there. But somewhere, and soon. Still I had to know what she knew. Or what she might have said to others. The nurse wrote something down at this point. Isobel ignored my question and leant in closer towards me, lowering her voice. ‘They think you have suffered a mental breakdown. They don’t call it that, of course. But that is what they think. I’ve been asked lots of questions. It was like facing the Grand Inquisitor.’ ‘That’s all there is around here, isn’t it? Questions.’ I braved another glance at her face and gave her more questions. ‘Why did we get married? What is the point of it? What are the rules involved?’ Certain enquiries, even on a planet designed for questions, go unheard. ‘Andrew, I’ve been telling you for weeks – months – that you need to slow down. You’ve been overdoing it. Your hours have been ridiculous. You’ve been truly burning the candle. Something had to give. But even so, this was so sudden. There were no warning signs. I just want to know what triggered it all. Was it me? What was it? I’m worried about you.’ I tried to come up with a valid explanation. ‘I suppose I just must have forgotten the importance of wearing clothes. That is, the importance of acting the way I was supposed to act. I don’t know. I must have just forgotten how to be a human. It can happen, can’t it? Things can be forgotten sometimes?’ Isobel held my hand. The glabrous under-portion of her thumb stroked my skin. This unnerved me even more. I wondered why she was touching me. A policeman grips an arm to take you somewhere, but why does a wife stroke your hand? What was the purpose? Did it have something to do with love? I stared at the small glistening diamond on her ring. ‘It’s going to be all right, Andrew. This is just a blip. I promise you. You’ll be right as rain soon.’ ‘As rain?’ I asked, the worry adding a quiver to my voice. I tried to read her facial expressions, but it was difficult. She wasn’t terrified any more, but what was she? Was she sad? Confused? Angry? Disappointed? I wanted to understand, but I couldn’t. She left me, after a hundred more words of the conversation. Words, words, words. There was a brief kiss on my cheek, and a hug, and I tried not to flinch or tighten up, hard as that was for me. And then she turned away and wiped something from her eye, which had leaked. I felt like I was expected to do something, say something, feel something, but I didn’t know what. ‘I saw your book,’ I said. ‘In the shop. Next to mine.’ ‘Some of you still remains then,’ she said. The tone was soft, but slightly scornful, or I think it was. ‘Andrew, just be careful. Do everything they say and it will be all right. Everything will be all right.’ And then she was gone. Dead cows I was told to go to the dining hall to eat. This was a terrible experience. For one thing, it was the first time I had been confronted with so many of their species in an enclosed area. Second, the smell. Of boiled carrot. Of pea. Of dead cow. A cow is an Earth-dwelling animal, a domesticated and multipurpose ungulate, which humans treat as a one-stop shop for food, liquid refreshment, fertiliser and designer footwear. The humans farm it and cut its throat and then cut it up and package it and refrigerate it and sell it and cook it. By doing this, apparently they have earned the right to change its name to beef, which is the monosyllable furthest away from cow, because the last thing a human wants to think about when eating cow is an actual cow. I didn’t care about cows. If it had been my assignment to kill a cow then I would have happily done so. But there was a leap to be made from not caring about someone to wanting to eat them. So I ate the vegetables. Or rather, I ate a single slice of boiled carrot. Nothing, I realised, could make you feel quite so homesick as eating disgusting, unfamiliar food. One slice was enough. More than enough. It was, in fact, far too much and it took me all my strength and concentration to battle that gag reflex and not throw up. I sat on my own, at a table in the corner, beside a tall pot plant. The plant had broad, shining, rich green flat vascular organs known as leaves which evidently served a photosynthetic function. It looked exotic to me, but not appallingly so. Indeed, the plant looked rather pretty. For the first time I was looking at something here and not being troubled. But then I looked away from the plant, towards the noise, and all the humans classified as crazy. The ones for whom the ways of this world were beyond them. If I was ever going to relate to anyone on this planet, they were surely going to be in this room. And just as I was thinking this one of them came up to me. A girl with short pink hair, and a circular piece of silver through her nose (as if that region of the face needed more attention given to it), thin orange-pink scars on her arms, and a quiet, low voice that seemed to imply that every thought in her brain was a deadly secret. She was wearing a T-shirt. On the T-shirt were the words ‘Everything was beautiful (and wearing a T-shirt. On the T-shirt were the words ‘Everything was beautiful (and nothing hurt)’. Her name was Zoë. She told me that straight away. The world as will and representation And then she said, ‘New?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Day?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘It is. We do appear to be angled towards the sun.’ She laughed, and her laughter was the opposite of her voice. It was a kind of laugh that made me wish there was no air for those manic waves to travel on and reach my ears. Once she had calmed down she explained herself. ‘No, I mean, are you here permanently or do you just come in for the day? Like me? A “voluntary commitment” job.’ ‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘I think I will be leaving soon. I am not mad, you see. I have just been a little confused about things. I have a lot to get on with. Things to do. Things to finish off.’ ‘I recognise you from somewhere,’ said Zoë. ‘Do you? From where?’ I scanned the room. I was starting to feel uncomfortable. There were seventy- six patients and eighteen members of staff. I needed privacy. I needed, really, to get out of there. ‘Have you been on the telly?’ ‘I don’t know.’ She laughed. ‘We might be Facebook friends.’ ‘Yeah.’ She scratched her horrible face. I wondered what was underneath. It couldn’t have been any worse. And then her eyes widened with a realisation. ‘No. I know. I’ve seen you at uni. You’re Professor Martin, aren’t you? You’re something of a legend. I’m at Fitzwilliam. I’ve seen you around the place. Better food in Hall than here, isn’t it?’ ‘Are you one of my students?’ She laughed again. ‘No. No. GCSE maths was enough for me. I hated it.’ This angered me. ‘Hated it? How can you hate mathematics? Mathematics is This angered me. ‘Hated it? How can you hate mathematics? Mathematics is everything.’ ‘Well, I didn’t see it like that. I mean, Pythagoras sounded like a bit of a dude, but, no, I’m not really über-big on numbers. I’m philosophy. That’s probably why I’m in here. OD’d on Schopenhauer.’ ‘Schopenhauer?’ ‘He wrote a book called The World as Will and Representation. I’m meant to be doing an essay on it. Basically it says that the world is what we recognise in our own will. Humans are ruled by their basic desires and this leads to suffering and pain, because our desires make us crave things from the world but the world is nothing but representation. Because those same cravings shape what we see we end up feeding from ourselves, until we go mad. And end up in here.’ ‘Do you like it in here?’ She laughed again, but I noticed her kind of laughing somehow made her look sadder. ‘No. This place is a whirlpool. It sucks you deeper. You want out of this place, man. Everyone in here is off the charts, I tell you.’ She pointed at various people in the room, and told me what was wrong with them. She started with an over-sized, red-faced female at the nearest table to us. ‘That’s Fat Anna. She steals everything. Look at her with the fork. Straight up her sleeve . . . Oh, and that’s Scott. He thinks he’s the third in line to the throne . . . And Sarah, who is totally normal for most of the day and then at a quarter past four starts screaming for no reason. Got to have a screamer . . . and that’s Crying Chris . . . and there’s Bridget the Fidget who’s always moving around at the speed of thought . . .’ ‘The speed of thought,’ I said. ‘That slow?’ ‘. . . and . . . Lying Lisa . . . and Rocking Rajesh. Oh, oh yeah, and you see that guy over there, with the sideburns? The tall one, mumbling to his tray?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Well, he’s gone the full K-Pax.’ ‘What?’ ‘He’s so cracked he thinks he’s from another planet.’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘Really?’ ‘Yeah. Trust me. In this canteen we’re just one mute Native American away from a full cuckoo’s nest.’ I had no idea what she was talking about. She looked at my plate. ‘Are you not eating that?’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘I don’t think I could.’ And then, thinking I might get some information out of her, I asked, ‘If I had done something, achieved something remarkable, do you think I would have told a lot of people? I mean, we humans are proud aren’t we? We like to show off about things.’ ‘Yes, I suppose.’ ‘Yes, I suppose.’ I nodded. Felt panic rising as I wondered how many people knew about Professor Andrew Martin’s discovery. Then I decided to broaden my enquiry. To act like a human I would after all need to understand them, so I asked her the biggest question I could think of. ‘What do you think the meaning of life is, then? Did you discover it?’ ‘Ha! The meaning of life. The meaning of life. There is none. People search for external values and meaning in a world which not only can’t provide it but is also indifferent to their quest. That’s not really Schopenhauer. That’s more Kierkegaard via Camus. I’m with them. Trouble is, if you study philosophy and stop believing in a meaning you start to need medical help.’ ‘What about love? What is love all about? I read about it. In Cosmopolitan.’ Another laugh. ‘Cosmopolitan? Are you joking?’ ‘No. Not at all. I want to understand these things.’ ‘You’re definitely asking the wrong person here. See, that’s one of my problems.’ She lowered her voice by at least two octaves, stared darkly. ‘I like violent men. I don’t know why. It’s a kind of self-harm thing. I go to Peterborough a lot. Rich pickings.’ ‘Oh,’ I said, realising it was right I had been sent here. The humans were as weird as I had been told, and as in love with violence. ‘So love is about finding the right person to hurt you?’ ‘Pretty much.’ ‘That doesn’t make sense.’ ‘“There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.” That was . . . someone.’ There was a silence. I wanted to leave. Not knowing the etiquette, I just stood up and left. She released a little whine. And then laughed again. Laughter, like madness, seemed to be the only way out, the emergency exit for humans. I went over optimistically to the man mumbling to his tray. The apparent extraterrestrial. I spoke to him for a while. I asked him, with considerable hope, where he was from. He said Tatooine. A place I had never heard of. He said he lived near the Great Pit of Carkoon, a short drive from Jabba’s Palace. He used to live with the Skywalkers, on their farm, but it burned down. ‘How far away is your planet? From Earth, I mean.’ ‘Very far.’ ‘How far?’ ‘Fifty thousand miles,’ he said, crushing my hope, and making me wish I’d never diverted my attention away from the plant with the lush green leaves. I looked at him. For a moment, I had thought I wasn’t alone among them but I looked at him. For a moment, I had thought I wasn’t alone among them but now I knew I was. So, I thought to myself as I walked away, this is what happens when you live on Earth. You crack. You hold reality in your hands until it burns and then you have to drop the plate. (Someone somewhere else in the room, just as I was thinking this, actually did drop a plate.) Yes, I could see it now – being a human sent you insane. I looked out of a large glass rectangular window and saw trees and buildings, cars and people. Clearly, this was a species not capable of handling the new plate Andrew Martin had just handed them. I really needed to get out of there and do my duty. I thought of Isobel, my wife. She had knowledge, the kind of knowledge I needed. I should have left with her. ‘What am I doing?’ I walked towards the window, expecting it to be like windows on my planet, Vonnadoria, but it wasn’t. It was made of glass. Which was made of rock. And instead of walking through it I banged my nose into it, prompting a few yelps of laughter from other patients. I left the room, quite desperate to escape all the people, and the smell of cow and carrots. Amnesia Acting human was one thing, but if Andrew Martin had told people then I really could not afford to waste any more time in this place. Looking at my left hand and the gifts it contained, I knew what I had to do. After lunch, I visited the nurse who had sat watching me talk to Isobel. I lowered my voice to just the right frequency. I slowed the words to just the right speed. To hypnotise a human was easy because, out of any species in the universe, they seemed the one most desperate to believe. ‘I am perfectly sane. I would like to see the doctor who can discharge me. I really need to get back home, to see my wife and child, and to continue my work at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University. Plus, I really don’t like the food here. I don’t know what happened this morning, I really don’t. It was an embarrassing public display, but I wholeheartedly assure you that whatever it was I suffered, it was temporary. I am sane, now, and I am happy. I feel very well indeed.’ He nodded. ‘Follow me,’ he said. The doctor wanted me to have some medical tests. A brain scan. They were worried about possible damage to my cerebral cortex which could have prompted amnesia. I realised whatever else was to occur the one thing that couldn’t possibly happen to me was to have my brain looked at, not while the gifts were active. So, I convinced him I was not suffering from amnesia. I made up a lot of memories. I made up a whole life. I told him that I had been under a lot of pressure at work and he understood. He then asked me some more questions. But as with all human questions the answers were always there, inside them like protons inside an atom, for me to locate and give as my own independent thoughts. After half an hour the diagnosis was clear. I hadn’t lost my memory. I had simply suffered a period of temporary insanity. Although he disapproved of the term ‘breakdown’ he said I had suffered a ‘mental collapse’ due to sleep- deprivation and work pressures and a diet which, as Isobel had already informed the doctor, consisted largely of strong black coffee – a drink, of course, I already knew I hated. knew I hated. The doctor then gave me some prompts, wondering if I’d suffered from panic attacks, low moods, nervous jolts, sudden behavioural swings or feelings of unreality. ‘Unreality?’ I could ponder with conviction. ‘Oh yes, I have definitely been feeling that one. But not any more. I feel fine. I feel very real. I feel as real as the sun.’ The doctor smiled. He told me he had read one of my books on mathematics – an apparently ‘really funny’ memoir of Andrew Martin’s time teaching at Princeton University. The book I had seen already. The one called American Pi. He wrote me a prescription for more diazepam and advised I take things ‘one day at a time’, as if there were another way for days to be experienced. And then he picked up the most primitive piece of telecommunications technology I had ever seen and told Isobel to come and take me home. Remember, during your mission, never to become influenced or corrupted. The humans are an arrogant species, defined by violence and greed. They have taken their home planet, the only one they currently have access to, and placed it on the road to destruction. They have created a world of divisions and categories and have continually failed to see the similarities between themselves. They have developed technology at a rate too fast for human psychology to keep up with, and yet they still pursue advancement for advancement’s sake, and for the pursuit of the money and fame they all crave so much. You must never fall into the human’s trap. You must never look at an individual and fail to see their relation to the crimes of the whole. Every smiling human face hides the terrors they are all capable of, and are all responsible for, however indirectly. You must never soften, or shrink from your task. Stay pure. Retain your logic. Do not let anyone interfere with the mathematical certainty of what needs to be done. 4 Campion Row It was a warm room. There was a window, but the curtains were drawn. They were thin enough for electromagnetic radiation from the only sun to filter through and I could see everything clear enough. The walls were painted sky-blue, and there was an incandescent ‘lightbulb’ hanging down from the ceiling with a cylindrical shade made of paper. I was lying in bed. It was a large, square bed, made for two people. I had been lying asleep in this same bed for over three hours, and now I was awake. It was Professor Andrew Martin’s bed, on the second floor of his house. His house was at 4 Campion Row. It was large, compared to the exteriors of other houses I had seen. Inside, all the walls were white. Downstairs, in the hallway and the kitchen, the floor was made of limestone, which was made of calcite, and so provided something familiar for me to look at. The kitchen, where I had gone to drink some water, was especially warm owing to the presence of something called an oven. This particular type of oven was made of iron and powered by gas, with two continually hot discs on its top surface. It was called an AGA. It was cream-coloured. There were lots of doors in the kitchen and also here in the bedroom. Oven doors and cupboard doors and wardrobe doors. Whole worlds shut away. The bedroom had a beige carpet, made of wool. Animal hair. There was a poster on the wall which had a picture of two human heads, one male and one female, very close together. It had the words Roman Holiday on it. Other words, too. Words like ‘Gregory Peck’ and ‘Audrey Hepburn’ and ‘Paramount Pictures’. There was a photograph on top of a wooden, cuboid piece of furniture. A photograph is basically a two-dimensional nonmoving holograph catering only to the sense of sight. This photograph was inside a rectangle of steel. A photograph of Andrew and Isobel. They were younger, their skins more radiant and unwithered. Isobel looked happy, because she was smiling and a smile is a signifier of human happiness. In the photograph Andrew and Isobel were signifier of human happiness. In the photograph Andrew and Isobel were standing on grass. She was wearing a white dress. It seemed to be the dress to wear if you wanted to be happy. There was another photo. They were standing somewhere hot. Neither of them had dresses on. They were among giant, crumbling stone columns under a perfectly blue sky. An important building from a former human civilisation. (On Earth, incidentally, civilisation is the result of a group of humans coming together and suppressing their instincts.) The civilisation, I guessed, was one that must have been neglected or destroyed. They were smiling, but this was a different kind of smile and one which was confined to their mouths and not their eyes. They looked uncomfortable, though I attributed this to the heat on their thin skin. Then there was a later photograph, taken indoors somewhere. They had a child with them. Young. Male. He had hair as dark as his mother, maybe darker, with paler skin. He was wearing an item of clothing which said ‘Cowboy’. Isobel was there in the room a lot of the time, either sleeping beside me or standing nearby, watching. Mostly, I tried not to look at her. I didn’t want to connect to her in any way. It would not serve my mission well if any kind of sympathy, or even empathy towards her were to form. Admittedly, this was unlikely. Her very otherness troubled me. She was so alien. But the universe was unlikely before it happened and it had almost indisputably happened. Though I did brave her eyes for one question. ‘When did you last see me? I mean, before. Yesterday?’ ‘At breakfast. And then you were at work. You came home at eleven. In bed by half past.’ ‘Did I say anything to you? Did I tell you anything?’ ‘You said my name, but I pretended to be sleeping. And that was it. Until I woke up, and you were gone.’ I smiled. Relieved, I suppose, but back then I didn’t quite understand why. The war and money show I watched the ‘television’ she had brought in for me. She had struggled with it. It was heavy for her. I think she expected me to help her. It seemed so wrong, watching a biological life form putting herself through such effort. I was confused and wondered why she would do it for me. I attempted, out of sheer telekinetic curiosity, to lighten it for her with my mind. ‘That was easier than I was expecting,’ she said. ‘Oh,’ I said, catching her gaze face-on. ‘Well, expectation is a funny thing.’ ‘You still like to watch the news, don’t you?’ Watch the news. That was a very good idea. The news might have something for me. ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I like to watch the news.’ I watched it, and Isobel watched me, both equally troubled by what we saw. The news was full of human faces, but generally smaller ones, and often at a great distance away. Within my first hour of watching, I discovered three interesting details. 1. The term ‘news’ on Earth generally meant ‘news that directly affects humans’. There was, quite literally, nothing about the antelope or the sea-horse or the red-eared slider turtle or the other nine million species on the planet. 2. The news was prioritised in a way I could not understand. For instance, there was nothing on new mathematical observations or still undiscovered polygons, but quite a bit about politics, which on this planet was essentially all about war and money. Indeed, war and money seemed to be so popular on the news it should more accurately be described as The War and Money Show. I had been told right. This was a planet characterised by violence and greed. A bomb had exploded in a country called Afghanistan. Elsewhere, people were worrying about the nuclear capability of North Korea. So-called stock markets were falling. This worried a lot of humans, who gazed up at screens full of numbers, studying them as if they displayed the only mathematics that it)] The distribution of prime numbers I looked at Andrew Martin’s emails, specifically the very last one in his sent folder. It had the subject heading, ‘153 years later . . .’, and it had a little red exclamation mark beside it. The message itself was a simple one: ‘I have proved the Riemann hypothesis, haven’t I? Need to tell you first. Please, Daniel, cast your eyes over this. Oh, and needless to say, this is for those eyes only at the moment. Until it goes public. What do you reckon? Humans will never be the same again? Biggest news anywhere since 1905? See attachment.’ The attachment was the document I had deleted elsewhere, and had just been reading, so I didn’t waste much time on that. Instead, I looked at the recipient: daniel.russell@cambridge.ac.uk. Daniel Russell, I swiftly discovered, was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University. He was sixty-three years old. He had written fourteen books, most of which had been international bestsellers. The Internet told me he had taught at every English-language university with an intimidating enough reputation – Cambridge (where he was now), Oxford, Harvard, Princeton and Yale among others – and had received numerous awards and titles. He had worked on quite a few academic papers with Andrew Martin, but as far as I could tell from my brief research they were colleagues more than friends. I looked at the time. In about twenty minutes my ‘wife’ would be coming home and wondering where I was. The less suspicion there was at this stage the better. There was a sequence of doing things, after all. I had to follow the sequence. And the first part of the sequence needed to be done right now, so I trashed the email and the attachment. Then, to be on the safe side, I quickly designed a virus – yes, with the help of primes – which would ensure that nothing could be accessed intact from this computer again. Before I left, I checked the papers on the desk. There was nothing there to be worried about. Insignificant letters, timetables, blank pages, but then, on one of them, a telephone number 07865542187. I put it in my pocket and noticed, as I them, a telephone number 07865542187. I put it in my pocket and noticed, as I did so, one of the photographs on the desk. Isobel, Andrew and the boy I assumed to be Gulliver. He had dark hair, and was the only one of the three who wasn’t smiling. He had wide eyes, peeping out from below a dark fringe of hair. He carried the ugliness of his species better than most. At least he wasn’t looking happy about what he was, and that was something. Another minute had gone by. It was time to go. We are pleased with your progress. But now the real work must begin. Yes. Deleting documents from computers is not the same as deleting lives. Even human lives. I understand that. A prime number is strong. It does not depend on others. It is pure and complete and never weakens. You must be like a prime. You must not weaken, you must distance yourself, and you must not change after interaction. You must be indivisible. Yes. I will be. Good. Now, continue. Glory Isobel was still not back, on my return to the house, so I did a little more research. She was not a mathematician. She was a historian. On Earth, this was an important distinction as here history was not yet viewed as a sub-division of mathematics, which of course it was. I also discovered that Isobel, like her husband, was considered to be very clever by the standards of her species. I knew this because one of the books on the shelf in the bedroom was The Dark Ages, the one I had seen in the bookshop window. And now I could see it had a quote from a publication called the New York Times which read ‘very clever’. The book was 1,253 pages long. A door opened downstairs. I heard the soft sound of metal keys being rested on a wooden chest. She came up to see me. That was the first thing she did. ‘How are you?’ she asked. ‘I’ve been looking at your book. About the Dark Ages.’ She laughed. ‘What are you laughing at?’ ‘Oh, it’s that or cry.’ ‘Listen,’ I said, ‘do you know where Daniel Russell lives?’ ‘Of course I do. We’ve been to his house for dinner.’ ‘Where does he live?’ ‘In Babraham. He’s got a whopping place. Can you seriously not remember? It’s like not remembering a visit to Nero’s palace.’ ‘Yes. I can, I can. It’s just that there are things which are still a bit hazy. I think it’s the pills. That was a blank, so that’s why I asked. That’s all. So, I’m good friends with him?’ ‘No. You hate him. You can’t stand him. Though deep hostility is your default setting with other academics these days, Ari excepted.’ ‘Ari?’ She sighed. ‘Your best friend.’ ‘Oh, Ari. Yes. Of course. Ari. My ears are a bit blocked. I didn’t hear you properly.’ properly.’ ‘But with Daniel,’ she said, speaking a little louder, ‘if I dare say it, the hatred is just the manifestation of an inferiority complex on your part. But superficially, you get on with him. You’ve even sought his guidance a few times, with your prime number stuff.’ ‘Right. Okay. My prime number stuff. Yes. And where am I with that? Where was I? When I last spoke to you, before?’ I felt the urge to ask it outright. ‘Had I proved the Riemann hypothesis?’ ‘No. You hadn’t. At least, not that I knew. But you should probably check that out, because if you have we’ll be a million pounds richer.’ ‘What?’ ‘Dollars, actually, isn’t it?’ ‘I—’ ‘The Millennium Prize, or whatever it is. Proof of the Riemann hypothesis is the largest remaining puzzle that hasn’t been solved. There is an institute in Massachusetts, the other Cambridge, the Clay Institute . . . You know this stuff backwards, Andrew. You mumble this stuff in your sleep.’ ‘Absolutely. Backwards and forwards. All the ways. I just need a little reminding that is all.’ ‘Well, it’s a very wealthy institute. They obviously have a lot of money because they’ve already given about ten million dollars away to other mathematicians. Apart from that last guy.’ ‘Last guy?’ ‘The Russian. Grigori something. The one who turned it down for solving the Whatever-it-was Conjecture.’ ‘But a million dollars is a lot of money, isn’t it?’ ‘It is. It’s a nice amount.’ ‘So why did he turn it down?’ ‘How do I know? I don’t know. You told me he was a recluse who lives with his mother. There are people in this world who have motives that extend beyond the financial, Andrew.’ This was genuinely news to me. ‘Are there?’ ‘Yes. There are. Because, you know, there’s this new groundbreaking and controversial theory that money can’t buy you happiness.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. She laughed again. She was trying to be funny, I think, so I laughed, too. ‘So, no one has solved the Riemann hypothesis?’ ‘What? Since yesterday?’ ‘Since, well, ever?’ ‘No. No one has solved it. There was a false alarm, a few years back. ‘No. No one has solved it. There was a false alarm, a few years back. Someone from France. But no. The money is still there.’ ‘So, that is why he . . . why I . . . this is what motivates me, money?’ She was now arranging socks on the bed, in pairs. It was a terrible system she had developed. ‘Not just that,’ she went on. ‘Glory is what motivates you. Ego. You want your name everywhere. Andrew Martin. Andrew Martin. Andrew Martin. You want to be on every Wikipedia page going. You want to be an Einstein. The trouble is, Andrew, you’re still two years old.’ This confused me. ‘I am? How is that possible?’ ‘Your mother never gave you the love you needed. You will for ever be sucking at a nipple that offers no milk. You want the world to know you. You want to be a great man.’ She said this in quite a cool tone. I wondered if this was how people always talked to each other, or if it was just unique to spouses. I heard a key enter a lock. Isobel looked at me with wide, astonished eyes. ‘Gulliver.’ Dark matter Gulliver’s room was at the top of the house. The ‘attic’. The last stop before the thermosphere. He went straight there, his feet passing the bedroom I was in, with only the slightest pause before climbing the final set of stairs. While Isobel went out to walk the dog I decided to phone the number on the piece of paper in my pocket. Maybe it was Daniel Russell’s number. ‘Hello,’ came a voice. Female. ‘Who’s this?’ ‘This is Professor Andrew Martin,’ I said. The female laughed. ‘Well hello, Professor Andrew Martin.’ ‘Who are you? Do you know me?’ ‘You’re on YouTube. Everyone knows you now. You’ve gone viral. The Naked Professor.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘Hey, don’t worry about it. Everyone loves an exhibitionist.’ She spoke slowly, lingering on words as if each one had a taste she didn’t want to lose. ‘Please, how do I know you?’ The question was never answered, because at that precise moment Gulliver walked into the room and I switched off the phone. Gulliver. My ‘son’. The dark-haired boy I had seen in the photographs. He looked as I had expected, but maybe taller. He was nearly as tall as me. His eyes were shaded by his hair. (Hair, by the way, is very important here. Not as important as clothes obviously, but getting there. To humans, hair is more than just a filamentous biomaterial that happens to grow out of their heads. It carries all kinds of social signifiers, most of which I couldn’t translate.) His clothes were as black as space and his T-shirt had the words ‘Dark Matter’ on them. Maybe this was how certain people communicated, via the slogans on their T- shirts. He wore ‘wristbands’. His hands were in his pockets and he seemed uncomfortable looking at my face. (The feeling, then, was mutual.) His voice was low. Or at least low by human standards. About the same depth as a Vonnadorian humming plant. He came and sat on the bed and tried to be nice, at the start, but then at one point he switched to a higher frequency. the start, but then at one point he switched to a higher frequency. ‘Dad, why did you do it?’ ‘I don’t know.’ ‘School is going to be hell now.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘Is that all you can say? “Oh?” Are you serious? Is that fucking it?’ ‘No. Yes. I, I fucking don’t fucking know, Gulliver.’ ‘Well, you’ve destroyed my life. I’m a joke. It was bad before. Ever since I started there. But now—’ I wasn’t listening. I was thinking about Daniel Russell, and how I desperately needed to phone him. Gulliver noticed I wasn’t paying attention. ‘It doesn’t even matter. You never want to talk to me, apart from last night.’ Gulliver left the room. He slammed the door, and let out a kind of growl. He was fifteen years old. This meant he belonged to a special sub-category of human called a ‘teenager’, the chief characteristics of which were a weakened resistance to gravity, a vocabulary of grunts, a lack of spatial awareness, copious amounts of masturbation, and an unending appetite for cereal. Last night. I got out of bed and headed upstairs to the attic. I knocked on his door. There was no reply but I opened it anyway. Inside, the environment was one of prevailing dark. There were posters for musicians. Thermostat, Skrillex, The Fetid, Mother Night, and the Dark Matter his T-shirt referenced. There was a window sloped in line with the ceiling, but the blind was drawn. There was a book on the bed. It was called Ham on Rye, by Charles Bukowski. There were clothes on the floor. Together, the room was a data cloud of despair. I sensed he wanted to be put out of his misery, one way or another. That would come, of course, but first there would be a few more questions. He didn’t hear me enter owing to the audio transmitter he had plugged into his ears. Nor did he see me, as he was too busy staring at his computer. On the screen, there was a still-motion image of myself naked, walking past one of the university buildings. There was also some writing on the screen. At the top were the words ‘Gulliver Martin, You Must Be So Proud’. Underneath, there were lots of comments. A typical example read, ‘HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! Oh almost forgot – HA!’ I read the name next to that particular post. ‘Who is Theo “The Fucking Business” Clarke?’ Gulliver jumped at my voice and turned around. I asked my question again but didn’t receive an answer. ‘What are you doing?’ I asked, purely for research purposes. ‘What are you doing?’ I asked, purely for research purposes. ‘Just go away.’ ‘I want to talk to you. I want to talk about last night.’ He turned his back to me. His torso stiffened. ‘Go away, Dad.’ ‘No. I want to know what I said to you.’ He sprang out of his chair and, as the humans say, stormed over to me. ‘Just leave me alone, okay? You’ve never been interested in a single thing about my life so don’t start now. Why fucking start now?’ I watched the back of him in the small, circular mirror staring out from the wall like a dull and unblinking eye. After some aggressive pacing he sat back in his chair, turned to his computer again, and pressed his finger on an odd-looking command device. ‘I need to know something,’ I said. ‘I need to know if you know what I was doing. Last week at work?’ ‘Dad, just—’ ‘Listen, this is important. Were you still up when I came home? You know, last night? Were you in the house? Were you awake?’ He mumbled something. I didn’t hear what. Only an ipsoid would have heard it. ‘Gulliver, how are you at mathematics?’ ‘You know how I fucking am at maths.’ ‘Fucking no, I don’t. Not now. That is why I am fucking asking. Tell me what you fucking know.’ Nothing. I thought I was using his language, but Gulliver just sat there, staring away from me, with his right leg jerking up and down in slight but rapid movements. My words were having no effect. I thought of the audio transmitter he still had in one ear. Maybe it was sending radio signals. I waited a little while longer and sensed it was time to leave. But as I headed for the door he said, ‘Yeah. I was up. You told me.’ My heart raced. ‘What? What did I tell you?’ ‘About you being the saviour of the human race or something.’ ‘Anything more specific? Did I go into detail?’ ‘You proved your precious Rainman hypothesis.’ ‘Riemann. Riemann. The Riemann hypothesis. I told you that, fucking did I?’ ‘Yeah,’ he said, in the same glum tone. ‘First time you’d spoken to me in a week.’ ‘Who have you told?’ ‘What? Dad, I think people are more interested in the fact that you walked around the town centre naked, to be honest. No one’s going to care about some equation.’ equation.’ ‘But your mother? Have you told her? She must have asked you if I’d spoken to you, after I’d gone missing. Surely she asked you that?’ He shrugged. (A shrug, I realised, was one of the main modes of communication for teenagers.) ‘Yeah.’ ‘And? What did you say? Come on, speak to me, Gulliver. What does she know about it?’ He turned and looked me straight in the eye. He was frowning. Angry. Confused. ‘I don’t fucking believe you, Dad.’ ‘Fucking believe?’ ‘You’re the parent, I’m the kid. I’m the one who should be wrapped up in myself, not you. I’m fifteen and you’re forty-three. If you are genuinely ill, Dad, then I want to be there for you, but aside from your new-found love of streaking and your weird fucking swearing you are acting very, very, very much like yourself. But here’s a newsflash. You ready? We don’t actually care about your prime numbers. We don’t care about your precious fucking work or your stupid fucking books or your genius-like brain or your ability to solve the world’s greatest outstanding mathematical whatever because, because, because all these things hurt us.’ ‘Hurt you?’ Maybe the boy was wiser than he looked. ‘What do you mean by that?’ His eyes stayed on me. His chest rose and fell with visible intensity. ‘Nothing,’ he said at last. ‘But, the answer is no, I didn’t tell Mum. I said you said something about work. That’s all. I didn’t think it was relevant information right then to tell her about your fucking hypothesis.’ ‘But the money. You know about that?’ ‘Yeah, course I do.’ ‘And you still didn’t think it was a big deal?’ ‘Dad, we have quite a lot of money in the bank. We have one of the biggest houses in Cambridge. I’m probably the richest kid in my school now. But it doesn’t amount to shit. It isn’t the Perse, remember?’ ‘The Perse?’ ‘That school you spent twenty grand a year on. You’ve forgotten that? Who the hell are you? Jason Bourne?’ ‘No. I am not.’ ‘You probably forgot I was expelled, too.’ ‘No,’ I lied. ‘Course I haven’t.’ ‘I don’t think more money’s going to save us.’ I was genuinely confused. This went against everything we were meant to know about the humans. know about the humans. ‘No,’ I said. ‘You’re right. It won’t. And besides, it was a mistake. I haven’t proved the Riemann hypothesis. I think in fact it is unprovable. I thought I had, but I haven’t. So there is nothing to tell anyone.’ At which Gulliver pushed the audio-transmission device into his other ear and closed his eyes. He wanted no more of me. ‘Fucking okay,’ I whispered and left the room. Emily Dickinson I went downstairs and found an ‘address book’. Inside were addresses and telephone numbers for people, listed alphabetically. I found the telephone number I was looking for. A woman told me Daniel Russell was out but would be back in around an hour. He would phone me back. Meanwhile, I perused some more history books and learnt things as I read between the lines. As well as religion, human history is full of depressing things like colonisation, disease, racism, sexism, homophobia, class snobbery, environmental destruction, slavery, totalitarianism, military dictatorships, inventions of things which they have no idea how to handle (the atomic bomb, the Internet, the semi-colon), the victimisation of clever people, the worshipping of idiotic people, boredom, despair, periodic collapses, and catastrophes within the psychic landscape. And through it all there has always been some truly awful food. I found a book called The Great American Poets. ‘I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,’ wrote someone called Walt Whitman. It was an obvious point, but something about it was quite beautiful. In the same book, there were words written by another poet. The poet was Emily Dickinson. The words were these: How happy is the little stone That rambles in the road alone, And doesn’t care about careers, And exigencies never fears; Whose coat of elemental brown A passing universe put on; And independent as the sun, Associates or glows alone, Fulfilling absolute decree In casual simplicity. Fulfilling absolute decree, I thought. Why do these words trouble me? The dog growled at me. I turned the page and found more unlikely wisdom. I read the words aloud to myself: ‘The soul should always stand ajar, ready to welcome the ecstatic experience.’ ‘You’re out of bed,’ said Isobel. ‘Yes,’ I said. To be a human is to state the obvious. Repeatedly, over and over, until the end of time. ‘You need to eat,’ she added, after studying my face. ‘Yes,’ I said. She got out some ingredients. Gulliver walked past the doorway. ‘Gull, where are you going? I’m making dinner.’ The boy said nothing as he left. The slam of the door almost shook the house. ‘I’m worried about him,’ said Isobel. As she worried, I studied the ingredients on the worktop. Mainly green vegetation. But then something else. Chicken breast. I thought about this. And I kept thinking. The breast of a chicken. The breast of a chicken. The breast of a chicken. ‘That looks like meat,’ I said. ‘I’m going to make a stir-fry.’ ‘With that?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘The breast of a chicken?’ ‘Yes, Andrew. Or are you vegetarian now?’ The dog was in his basket. It went by the name of Newton. It was still growling at me. ‘What about the dog’s breasts? Are we going to eat those, too?’ ‘No,’ she said, with resignation. I was testing her. ‘Is a dog more intelligent than a chicken?’ ‘Yes,’ she said. She closed her eyes. ‘I don’t know. No. I haven’t got time for this. Anyway, you’re the big meat eater.’ I was uncomfortable. ‘I would rather not eat the chicken’s breasts.’ Isobel now clenched her eyes closed. She inhaled deeply. ‘Give me strength,’ she whispered. I could have done so, of course. But I needed what strength I had right now. Isobel handed me my diazepam. ‘Have you taken one lately?’ ‘No.’ ‘You probably should.’ So I humoured her. I unscrewed the cap and placed a pill on my palm. These ones looked like word-capsules. As green as knowledge. I popped a tablet in my mouth. Be careful. Dishwasher I ate the vegetable stir-fry. It smelt like Bazadean body waste. I tried not to look at it, so I looked at Isobel instead. It was the first time that looking at a human face was the easiest option. But I did need to eat. So I ate. ‘When you spoke to Gulliver about me going missing did he say anything to you?’ ‘Yes,’ she said. ‘What was it that he said?’ ‘That you came in about eleven, and that you’d gone into the living room where he was watching TV and that you’d told him that you were sorry you were late, but you’d been finishing something off at work.’ ‘Was that it? There was nothing more specific?’ ‘No.’ ‘What do you think he meant by that? I mean: what I meant by that?’ ‘I don’t know. But I have to say, you coming home and being friendly to Gulliver. That’s already out of character.’ ‘Why? Don’t I like him?’ ‘Not since two years ago. No. Pains me to say it, but you don’t act very much like you do.’ ‘Two years ago?’ ‘Since he got expelled from Perse. For starting a fire.’ ‘Oh yes. The fire incident.’ ‘I want you to start making an effort with him.’ Afterwards, I followed Isobel into the kitchen putting my plate and cutlery in the dishwasher. I was noticing more things about her. At first, I had just seen her as generically human but now I was appreciating the details. Picking up things I hadn’t noticed – differences between her and the others. She was wearing a cardigan and blue trousers known as jeans. Her long neck was decorated with a thin necklace made out of silver. Her eyes stared deep into things, as though she was continually searching for something that wasn’t there. Or as if it was there, but just out of sight. It was as though everything had a depth, an internal distance but just out of sight. It was as though everything had a depth, an internal distance to it. ‘How are you feeling?’ she asked. She seemed worried about something. ‘I feel fine.’ ‘I only ask because you’re loading the dishwasher.’ ‘Because that’s what you are doing.’ ‘Andrew, you never load the dishwasher. You are, and I mean this in the least offensive way possible, something of a domestic primitive.’ ‘Why? Don’t mathematicians load dishwashers?’ ‘In this house,’ she said sadly, ‘no, actually. No, they don’t.’ ‘Oh yes. I know. Obviously. I just fancied helping today. I help sometimes.’ ‘Now we’re on to fractions.’ She looked at my jumper. There was a bit of noodle resting on the blue wool. She picked it off, and stroked the fabric where it had been. She smiled, quickly. She cared about me. She had her reservations, but she cared. I didn’t want her to care about me. It wouldn’t help things. She placed her hand through my hair, to tidy it a bit. To my surprise, I wasn’t flinching. ‘Einstein chic is one thing but this is ridiculous,’ she said, softly. I smiled like I understood. She smiled too, but it was a smile on top of something else. As if she was wearing a mask, and there was a near-identical but less smiling face underneath. ‘It’s almost like an alien clone is in my kitchen.’ ‘Almost,’ I said. ‘Yes.’ It was then that the telephone rang. Isobel went to answer it and a moment later came back into the kitchen, holding out the receiver. ‘It’s for you,’ she said, in a suddenly serious voice. Her eyes were wide, trying to convey a silent message I didn’t quite understand. ‘Hello?’ I said. There was a long pause. The sound of breath, and then a voice on the next exhalation. A man, talking slowly and carefully. ‘Andrew? Is that you?’ ‘Yes. Who’s this?’ ‘It’s Daniel. Daniel Russell.’ My heart tripped. I realised this was it, the moment things had to change. ‘Oh hello, Daniel.’ ‘How are you? I hear you might be unwell.’ ‘Oh, I am fine, really. It was just a little bit of mental exhaustion. My mind had run its own marathon and it struggled. My brain is made for sprints. It doesn’t have the stamina for long-distance running. But don’t worry, honestly, I am back where I was. It wasn’t anything too serious. Nothing that the right medication couldn’t suppress, anyway.’ medication couldn’t suppress, anyway.’ ‘Well, that is good to hear. I was worried about you. Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you about that remarkable email you sent me.’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘But let’s not do this over the phone. Let’s chat face-to-face. It would be good to see you.’ Isobel frowned. ‘What a good idea. Should I come to you?’ ‘No,’ I said, with a degree of firmness. ‘No. I’ll come to you.’ We are waiting. A large house Isobel had offered to drive me, and had tried to insist on it, saying I wasn’t ready to leave the house. Of course, I had already left the house, to go to Fitzwilliam College, but she hadn’t known about that. I said I felt like some exercise and Daniel needed to speak to me quite urgently about something, possibly some kind of job offer. I told her I’d have my phone on me and that she knew where I was. And so eventually I was able to take the address from Isobel’s notebook, leave the house and head to Babraham. To a large house, the largest I’d seen. Daniel Russell’s wife answered the door. She was a very tall, broad- shouldered woman, with quite long grey hair and aged skin. ‘Oh, Andrew.’ She held out her arms wide. I replicated the gesture. And she kissed me on the cheek. She smelt of soap and spices. It was clear she knew me. She couldn’t stop saying my name. ‘Andrew, Andrew, how are you?’ she asked me. ‘I heard about your little misadventure.’ ‘Well, I am all right. It was a, well, an episode. But I’m over it. The story continues.’ She studied me a little more and then opened the door wide. She beckoned me inside, smiling broadly. I stepped into the hallway. ‘Do you know why I am here?’ ‘To see Him Upstairs,’ she said, pointing to the ceiling. ‘Yes, but do you know why I am here to see him?’ She was puzzled by my manner but she tried her best to hide it beneath a kind of energetic and chaotic politeness. ‘No, Andrew,’ she said, quickly. ‘As a matter of fact, he didn’t say.’ I nodded. I noticed a large ceramic vase on the floor. It had a yellow pattern of flowers on it, and I wondered why people bothered with such empty vessels. What was their significance? Maybe I would never know. We passed a room, with a sofa and a television and bookcases and dark red walls. Blood-coloured. with a sofa and a television and bookcases and dark red walls. Blood-coloured. ‘Do you want a coffee? Fruit juice? We’ve acquired a taste for pomegranate juice. Though Daniel believes antioxidants are a marketing ploy.’ ‘I would like a water if that’s okay.’ We were in the kitchen now. It was about twice the size of Andrew Martin’s kitchen, but it was so cluttered it felt no bigger. There were saucepans hanging above my head. There was an envelope on the unit addressed to ‘Daniel and Tabitha Russell’. Tabitha poured me water from a jug. ‘I’d offer you a slice of lemon but I think we’re out. There’s one in the bowl but it must be blue by now. The cleaners never sort the fruit out. They won’t touch it. ‘And Daniel won’t eat fruit. Even though the doctor has told him he’s got to. But then the doctor has told him to relax and slow down, too, and he doesn’t do that either.’ ‘Oh. Why?’ She looked baffled. ‘His heart attack. You remember that? You aren’t the only frazzled mathematician in the world.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. ‘How is he?’ ‘Well, he’s on beta-blockers. I’m trying to get him on muesli and skimmed milk and to take it easier.’ ‘His heart,’ I said, thinking aloud. ‘Yes. His heart.’ ‘That is one of the reasons I came, in fact.’ She handed me a glass and I took a sip. As I did so, I thought of the startling capacity for belief inherent in this species. Even before I had fully discovered the concepts of astrology, homeopathy, organised religion and probiotic yoghurts I was able to work out that what humans may have lacked in physical attractiveness, they made up for in gullibility. You could tell them anything in a convincing enough voice and they would believe it. Anything, of course, except the truth. ‘Where is he?’ ‘In his study. Upstairs.’ ‘His study?’ ‘You know where that is, don’t you?’ ‘Of course. Of course. I know where that is.’ Daniel Russell Of course, I had been lying. I had no idea where Daniel Russell’s study was, and this was a very big house, but as I was walking along the first-floor landing I heard a voice. The same dry voice I had heard on the phone. ‘Is that the saviour of mankind?’ I followed the voice all the way to the third doorway on the left, which was half-open. I could see framed pieces of paper lining a wall. I pushed open the door and saw a bald man with a sharp angular face and a small – in human terms – mouth. He was smartly dressed. He was wearing a red bow tie and a checked shirt. ‘Pleased to see you’re wearing clothes,’ he said, suppressing a sly smile. ‘Our neighbours are people of delicate sensibilities.’ ‘Yes. I am wearing the right amount of clothes. Don’t worry about that.’ He nodded, and kept nodding, as he leant back in his chair and scratched his chin. A computer screen glowed behind him, full of Andrew Martin’s curves and formulas. I could smell coffee. I noticed an empty cup. Two of them, in fact. ‘I have looked at it. And I have looked at it again. This must have taken you to the edge, I can see that. This is something. You must have been burning yourself with this, Andrew. I’ve been burning just reading through it.’ ‘I worked very hard,’ I said. ‘I was lost in it. But that happens, doesn’t it, with numbers?’ He listened with concern. ‘Did they prescribe anything?’ he asked. ‘Diazepam.’ ‘Do you feel it’s working?’ ‘I do. I do. I feel it is working. Everything feels a little bit alien I would say, a tad other-worldly, as if the atmosphere is slightly different, and the gravity has slightly less pull, and even something as familiar as an empty coffee cup has a terrible difference to it. You know, from my perspective. Even you. You seem quite hideous to me. Almost terrifying.’ Daniel Russell laughed. It wasn’t a happy laugh. Daniel Russell laughed. It wasn’t a happy laugh. ‘Well, there’s always been a frisson between us, but I always put that down to academic rivalry. Par for the course. We’re not geographers or biologists. We’re numbers men. We mathematicians have always been like that. Look at that miserable bastard Isaac Newton.’ ‘I named my dog after him.’ ‘So you did. But listen, Andrew, this isn’t a moment to nudge you to the kerb. This is a moment to slap you on the back.’ We were wasting time. ‘Have you told anyone about this?’ He shook his head. ‘No. Of course not. Andrew, this is yours. You can publicise this how you want. Though I would probably advise you, as a friend, to wait a little while. At least a week or so, until all this unwelcome stuff about your little Corpus incident has died down.’ ‘Is mathematics less interesting for humans than nudity?’ ‘It tends to be, Andrew. Yes. Listen. Go home, take it easy this week. I’ll put a word in with Diane at Fitz and explain that you’ll be fine but you may need some time off. I’m sure she’ll be pretty flexible. The students are going to be tricky on your first day back. You need to build your strength up. Rest a while. Come on Andrew, go home.’ I could smell the foul scent of coffee getting stronger. I looked around at all the certificates on the wall and felt thankful to come from a place where personal success was meaningless. ‘Home?’ I said. ‘Do you know where that is?’ ‘Course I do. Andrew, what are you talking about?’ ‘Actually, I am not called Andrew.’ Another nervous chuckle. ‘Is Andrew Martin your stage name? If it is, I could have thought of better.’ ‘I don’t have a name. Names are a symptom of a species which values the individual self above the collective good.’ This was the first time he stood up out of his chair. He was a tall man, taller than me. ‘This would be amusing, Andrew, if you weren’t a friend. I really think you might need to get proper medical help for this. Listen, I know a very good psychiatrist who you—’ ‘Andrew Martin is someone else. He was taken.’ ‘Taken?’ ‘After he proved what he proved, we were left with no choice.’ ‘We? What are you talking about? Just have an objective ear, Andrew. You are sounding out of your mind. I think you ought to go home. I’ll drive you back. I think it would be safer. Come on, let’s go. I’ll take you home. Back to your family.’ He held out his right arm, gesturing towards the door. But I wasn’t going anywhere. The pain ‘You said you wanted to slap my back.’ He frowned. Above the frown, the skin covering the top of his skull shone. I stared at it. At the shine. ‘What?’ ‘You wanted to slap my back. That is what you said. So, why not?’ ‘What?’ ‘Slap my back. Then I will go.’ ‘Andrew—’ ‘Slap my back.’ He exhaled slowly. His eyes were the mid-point between concern and fear. I turned, gave him my back. Waited for the hand, then waited some more. Then it came. He slapped my back. On that first contact, even with clothes between us, I made the reading. Then when I turned, for less than a second, my face wasn’t Andrew Martin’s. It was mine. ‘What the—’ He lurched backwards, bumping into his desk. I was, to his eyes, Andrew Martin again. But he had seen what he had seen. I only had a second, before he would begin screaming, so I paralysed his jaw. Somewhere way below the panic of his bulging eyes, there was a question: how did he do that? To finish the job properly I would need another contact: my left hand on his shoulder was sufficient. Then the pain began. The pain I had summoned. He held his arm. His face became violet. The colour of home. I had pain too. Head pain. And fatigue. But I walked past him, as he dropped to his knees, and deleted the email and the attachment. I checked his sent folder but there was nothing suspicious. I stepped out on to the landing. ‘Tabitha! Tabitha, call an ambulance! Quick! I think, I think Daniel is having a heart attack!’ Egypt Less than a minute later she was upstairs, on the phone, her face full of panic as she knelt down, trying to push a pill – an aspirin – into her husband’s mouth. ‘His mouth won’t open! His mouth won’t open! Daniel, open your mouth! Darling, oh my God darling, open your mouth!’ And then to the phone. ‘Yes! I told you! I told you! The Hollies! Yes! Chaucer Road! He’s dying! He’s dying!’ She managed to cram inside her husband’s mouth a piece of the pill, which bubbled into foam and dribbled onto the carpet. ‘Mnnnnnn,’ her husband was saying desperately. ‘Mnnnnnn.’ I stood there watching him. His eyes stayed wide, wide open, ipsoid-wide, as if staying in the world was a simple matter of forcing yourself to see. ‘Daniel, it’s all right,’ Tabitha was saying, right into his face. ‘An ambulance is on its way. You’ll be okay, darling.’ His eyes were now on me. He jerked in my direction. ‘Mnnnnnn!’ He was trying to warn his wife. ‘Mnnnnnn.’ She didn’t understand. Tabitha was stroking her husband’s hair with a manic tenderness. ‘Daniel, we’re going to Egypt. Come on, think of Egypt. We’re going to see the Pyramids. It’s only two weeks till we go. Come on, it’s going to be beautiful. You’ve always wanted to go . . .’ As I watched her I felt a strange sensation. A kind of longing for something, a craving, but for what I had no idea. I was mesmerised by the sight of this human female crouched over the man whose blood I had prevented from reaching his heart. ‘You got through it last time and you’ll get through it this time.’ ‘No,’ I whispered, unheard. ‘No, no, no.’ ‘Mnnn,’ he said, gripping his shoulder in infinite pain. ‘I love you, Daniel.’ His eyes clenched shut now, the pain too much. ‘Stay with me, stay with me, I can’t live all alone . . .’ His head was on her knee. She kept caressing his face. So this was love. Two His head was on her knee. She kept caressing his face. So this was love. Two life forms in mutual reliance. I was meant to be thinking I was watching weakness, something to scorn, but I wasn’t thinking that at all. He stopped making noise, he seemed instantly heavier for her, and the deep clenched creases around his eyes softened and relaxed. It was done. Tabitha howled, as if something had been physically wrenched out of her. I have never heard anything like that sound. It troubled me greatly, I have to say. A cat emerged from the doorway, startled by the noise maybe, but indifferent to the scene in general. It returned back from where it came. ‘No,’ said Tabitha, over and over, ‘no, no, no!’ Outside, the ambulance skidded to a halt on the gravel. Blue flashing lights appeared through the window. ‘They’re here,’ I told Tabitha and went downstairs. It was a strange and overwhelming relief to tread my way down those soft, carpeted stairs, and for those desperate sobs and futile commands to fade away into nothing. Where we are from I thought about where we – you and I – are from. Where we are from there are no comforting delusions, no religions, no impossible fiction. Where we are from there is no love and no hate. There is the purity of reason. Where we are from there are no crimes of passion because there is no passion. Where we are from there is no remorse because action has a logical motive and always results in the best outcome for the given situation. Where we are from there are no names, no families living together, no husbands and wives, no sulky teenagers, no madness. Where we are from we have solved the problem of fear because we have solved the problem of death. We will not die. Which means we can’t just let the universe do what it wants to do, because we will be inside it for eternity. Where we are from we will never be lying on a luxurious carpet, clutching our chest as our faces turn purple and our eyes seek desperately to view our surroundings for one last time. Where we are from our technology, created on the back of our supreme and comprehensive knowledge of mathematics, has meant not only that we can travel great distances, but also that we can rearrange our own biological ingredients, renew and replenish them. We are psychologically equipped for such advances. We have never been at war with ourselves. We never place the desires of the individual over the requirements of the collective. Where we are from we understand that if the humans’ rate of mathematical advancement exceeds their psychological maturity, then action needs to be taken. For instance, the death of Daniel Russell, and the knowledge he held, could end up saving many more lives. And so: he is a logical and justifiable sacrifice. Where we are from there are no nightmares. And yet, that night, for the very first time in my life I had a nightmare. A world of dead humans with me and that indifferent cat walking through a A world of dead humans with me and that indifferent cat walking through a giant carpeted street full of bodies. I was trying to get home. But I couldn’t. I was stuck here. I had become one of them. Stuck in human form, unable to escape the inevitable fate awaiting all of them. And I was getting hungry and I needed to eat but I couldn’t eat, because my mouth was clamped shut. The hunger became extreme. I was starving, wasting away at rapid speed. I went to the garage I had been in that first night and tried to shove food in my mouth, but it was no good. It was still locked from this inexplicable paralysis. I knew I was going to die. Die. How did humans ever stomach the idea? I woke. I was sweating and out of breath. Isobel touched my back. ‘It’s all right,’ she said, as Tabitha had said. ‘It’s all right, it’s all right, it’s all right.’ The dog and the music The next day I was alone. Well no, actually, that’s not quite true. I wasn’t alone. There was the dog. Newton. The dog named after a human who had come up with the ideas of gravity and inertia. Given the slow speed with which the dog left its basket, I realised the name was a fitting tribute to these discoveries. He was awake now. He was old and he hobbled, and he was half-blind. He knew who I was. Or who I wasn’t. And he growled whenever he was near me. I didn’t quite understand his language just yet but I sensed he was displeased. He showed his teeth but I could tell years of subservience to his bipedal owners meant the very fact that I was standing up was enough for me to command a certain degree of respect. I felt sick. I put this down to the new air I was breathing. But each time I closed my eyes I saw Daniel Russell’s anguished face as he lay on the carpet. I also had a headache, but that was the lingering after-effect of the energy I had exerted yesterday. I knew life was going to be easier during my short stay here if Newton was on my side. He might have information, have picked up on signals, heard things. And I knew there was one rule that held fast across the universe: if you wanted to get someone on your side what you really had to do was relieve their pain. It seems ridiculous now, such logic. But the truth was even more ridiculous, and too dangerous to acknowledge to myself, that after the need to hurt I felt an urge to heal. So I went over and gave him a biscuit. And then, after giving him the biscuit, I gave him sight. And then, as I stroked his hind leg, he whimpered words into my ear I couldn’t quite translate. I healed him, giving myself not only an even more intense headache but also wave upon wave of fatigue in the process. Indeed, so exhausted was I that I fell asleep on the kitchen floor. When I woke up, I was coated in dog saliva. Newton’s tongue was still at it, licking me with considerable enthusiasm. Licking, licking, licking, as though the meaning of considerable enthusiasm. Licking, licking, licking, as though the meaning of canine existence was something just beneath my skin. ‘Could you please stop that?’ I said. But he couldn’t. Not until I stood up. He was physically incapable of stopping. And even once I had stood up he tried to stand up with me, and on me, as if he wanted to be upright, too. It was then I realised the one thing worse than having a dog hate you is having a dog love you. Seriously, if there was a needier species in the universe I had yet to meet it. ‘Get away,’ I told him. ‘I don’t want your love.’ I went to the living room and sat down on the sofa. I needed to think. Would Daniel Russell’s death be viewed by the humans as suspicious? A man on heart medication succumbing to a second and this time fatal heart attack? I had no poison, and no weapon they would ever be able to identify. The dog sat down next to me, placed his head on my lap, then lifted his head off my lap, and then on again, as if deciding whether or not to put his head on my lap was the biggest decision he had ever faced. We spent hours together that day. Me and the dog. At first I was annoyed that he wouldn’t leave me alone, as what I needed to do was to focus and work out when I was going to act next. To work out how much more information I needed to acquire before doing what would have to be my final acts here, eliminating Andrew Martin’s wife and child. I shouted at the dog again to leave me alone, and he did so, but when I stood in the living room with nothing but my thoughts and plans I realised I felt a terrible loneliness and so called him back. And he came, and seemed happy to be wanted again. I put something on that interested me. It was called The Planets by Gustav Holst. It was a piece of music all about the humans’ puny solar system, so it was surprising to hear it had quite an epic feel. Another confusing thing was that it was divided into seven ‘movements’ each named after ‘astrological characters’. For instance, Mars was ‘the Bringer of War’, Jupiter was ‘the Bringer of Jollity’, and Saturn was ‘the Bringer of Old Age’. This primitivism struck me as funny. And so was the idea that the music had anything whatsoever to do with those dead planets. But it seemed to soothe Newton a little bit, and I must admit one or two parts of it had some kind of effect on me, a kind of electrochemical effect. Listening to music, I realised, was simply the pleasure of counting without realising you were counting. As the electrical impulses were transported from the neurons in my ear through my body, I felt – I don’t know – calm. It made that strange unease that had been with me since I had watched Daniel Russell die on his carpet settle a little. As we listened I tried to work out why Newton and his species were so enamoured of humans. enamoured of humans. ‘Tell me,’ I said. ‘What is it about the humans?’ Newton laughed. Or as close as a dog can get to laughing, which is pretty close. I persisted with my line of enquiry. ‘Go on,’ I said. ‘Spill the beans.’ He seemed a bit coy. I don’t think he really had an answer. Maybe he hadn’t reached his verdict, or he was too loyal to be truthful. I put on some different music. I played the music of someone called Ennio Morricone. I played an album called Space Oddity by David Bowie, which, in its simple patterned measure of time, was actually quite enjoyable. As was Moon Safari by Air, though that shed little light on the moon itself. I played A Love Supreme by John Coltrane and Blue Monk by Thelonious Monk. This was jazz music. It was full of the complexity and contradictions that I would soon learn made humans human. I listened to ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ by Leonard Bernstein and ‘Moonlight Sonata’ by Ludwig van Beethoven and Brahms’ ‘Intermezzo op. 17’. I listened to the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, Daft Punk, Prince, Talking Heads, Al Greene, Tom Waits, Mozart. I was intrigued to discover the sounds that could make it on to music – the strange talking radio voice on ‘I Am the Walrus’ by the Beatles, the cough at the beginning of Prince’s ‘Raspberry Beret’ and at the end of Tom Waits songs. Maybe that is what beauty was, for humans. Accidents, imperfections, placed inside a pretty pattern. Asymmetry. The defiance of mathematics. I thought about my speech at the Museum of Quadratic Equations. With the Beach Boys I got a strange feeling, behind my eyes and in my stomach. I had no idea what that feeling was, but it made me think of Isobel, and the way she had hugged me last night, after I had come home and told her Daniel Russell had suffered a fatal heart attack in front of me. There’d been a slight moment of suspicion, a brief hardening of her stare, but it had softened into compassion. Whatever else she might have thought about her husband he wasn’t a killer. The last thing I listened to was a tune called ‘Clair de Lune’ by Debussy. That was the closest representation of space I had ever heard, and I stood there, in the middle of the room, frozen with shock that a human could have made such a beautiful noise. This beauty terrified me, like an alien creature appearing out of nowhere. An ipsoid, bursting out of the desert. I had to stay focused. I had to keep believing everything I had been told. That this was a species of ugliness and violence, beyond redemption. Newton was scratching at the front door. The scratching was putting me off the music so I went over and tried to decipher what he wanted. It turned out that what he wanted was to go outside. There was a ‘lead’ I had seen Isobel use, and so I attached it to the collar. so I attached it to the collar. As I walked the dog I tried to think more negatively towards the humans. And it certainly seemed ethically questionable, the relationship between humans and dogs, both of whom – on the scale of intelligence that covered every species in the universe – would have been somewhere in the middle, not too far apart. But I have to say that dogs didn’t seem to mind it. In fact, they went along quite happily with the set-up most of the time. I let Newton lead the way. We passed a man on the other side of the road. The man just stopped and stared at me and smiled to himself. I smiled and waved my hand, understanding this was an appropriate human greeting. He didn’t wave back. Yes, humans are a troubling species. We carried on walking, and we passed another man. A man in a wheelchair. He seemed to know me. ‘Andrew,’ he said, ‘isn’t it terrible – the news about Daniel Russell?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I was there. I saw it happen. It was horrible, just horrible.’ ‘Oh my God, I had no idea.’ ‘Mortality is a very tragic thing.’ ‘Indeed, indeed it is.’ ‘Anyway, I had better be going. The dog is in quite a hurry. I will see you.’ ‘Yes, yes, absolutely. But may I ask: how are you? I heard you’d been a bit unwell yourself?’ ‘Oh, fine. I am over that. It was just a bit of a misunderstanding, really.’ ‘Oh, I see.’ The conversation dwindled further, and I made my excuses, Newton dragging me forward until we reached a large stretch of grass. This is what dogs liked to do, I discovered. They liked to run around on grass, pretending they were free, shouting, ‘We’re free, we’re free, look, look, look how free we are!’ at each other. It really was a sorry sight. But it worked for them, and for Newton in particular. It was a collective illusion they had chosen to swallow and they were submitting to it wholeheartedly, without any nostalgia for their former wolf selves. That was the remarkable thing about humans – their ability to shape the path of other species, to change their fundamental nature. Maybe it could happen to me, maybe I could be changed, maybe I already was being changed? Who knew? I hoped not. I hoped I was staying as pure as I had been told, as strong and isolated as a prime, as a ninety-seven. I sat on a bench and watched the traffic. No matter how long I stayed on this planet I doubted I would ever get used to the sight of cars, bound by gravity and poor technology to the road, hardly moving on the roads because there were so many of them. many of them. Was it wrong to thwart a species’ technological advancement? That was a new question in my mind. I didn’t want it there, so I was quite relieved when Newton started barking. I turned to look at him. He was standing still, his head steady in one direction, as he carried on making as loud a noise as he possibly could. ‘Look!’ he seemed to bark. ‘Look! Look! Look!’ I was picking up his language. There was another road, a different one to the one with all the traffic. A line of terraced houses facing the park. I turned towards it, as Newton clearly wanted me to do. I saw Gulliver, on his own, walking along the pavement, trying his best to hide behind his hair. He was meant to be at school. And he wasn’t, unless human school was walking along the street and thinking, which it really should have been. He saw me. He froze. And then he turned around and started walking in the other direction. ‘Gulliver!’ I called. ‘Gulliver!’ He ignored me. If anything, he started walking away faster than he had done before. His behaviour concerned me. After all, inside his head was the knowledge that the world’s biggest mathematical puzzle had been solved, and by his own father. I hadn’t acted last night. I had told myself that I needed to find more information, check there was no one else Andrew Martin could have told. Also, I was probably too exhausted after my encounter with Daniel. I would wait another day, maybe even two. That had been the plan. Gulliver had told me he hadn’t said anything, and that he wasn’t going to, but how could he be totally trusted? His mother was convinced, right now, that he was at school. And yet he evidently wasn’t. I got up from the bench and walked over the litter-strewn grass to where Newton was still barking. ‘Come on,’ I said, realising I should probably have acted already. ‘We have to go.’ We arrived on the road just as Gulliver was turning off it, and so I decided to follow him and see where he was going. At one point he stopped and took something from his pocket. A box. He took out a cylindrical object and put it in his mouth and lit it. He turned around, but I had sensed he would and was already hiding behind a tree. He began walking again. Soon he reached a larger road. Coleridge Road, this one was called. He didn’t want to be on this road for long. Too many cars. Too many opportunities to be seen. He kept on walking, and after a while the buildings stopped and there were no cars or people any more. I was worried he was going to turn around, because there were no nearby trees – or anything else – to hide behind. Also, although I was physically near enough to be easily seen if he did turn to look, I was too far for any mind manipulation to be easily seen if he did turn to look, I was too far for any mind manipulation to work. Remarkably though, he didn’t turn around again. Not once. We passed a building with lots of empty cars outside, shining in the sun. The building had the word ‘Honda’ on it. There was a man inside the glass in a shirt and tie, watching us. Gulliver then cut across a grass field. Eventually, he reached four metal tracks in the ground: parallel lines, close together but stretching as far as the eye could see. He just stood there, absolutely still, waiting for something. Newton looked at Gulliver and then up at me, with concern. He let out a deliberately loud whine. ‘Sssh!’ I said. ‘Keep quiet.’ After a while, a train appeared in the distance, getting closer as it was carried along the tracks. I noticed Gulliver’s fists clench and his whole body stiffen as he stood only a metre or so away from the train’s path. As the train was about to pass where he was standing Newton barked, but the train was too loud and too close to Gulliver for him to hear. This was interesting. Maybe I wouldn’t have to do anything. Maybe Gulliver was going to do it himself. The train passed. Gulliver’s hands stopped being fists and he seemed to relax again. Or maybe it was disappointment. But before he turned around and started walking away, I had dragged Newton back, and we were out of sight. Grigori Perelman So, I had left Gulliver. Untouched, unharmed. I had returned home with Newton while Gulliver had carried on walking. I had no idea where he was going, but it was pretty clear to me, from his lack of direction, that he hadn’t been heading anywhere specific. I concluded, therefore, that he wasn’t going to meet someone. Indeed, he had seemed to want to avoid people. Still, I knew it was dangerous. I knew that it wasn’t just proof of the Riemann hypothesis which was the problem. It was knowledge that it could be proved, and Gulliver had that knowledge, inside his skull, as he walked around the streets. Yet I justified my delay because I had been told to be patient. I had been told to find out exactly who knew. If human progress was to be thwarted, then I needed to be thorough. To kill Gulliver now would have been premature, because his death and that of his mother would be the last acts I could commit before suspicions were aroused. Yes, this is what I told myself, as I unclipped Newton’s lead and re-entered the house, and then accessed that sitting-room computer, typing in the words ‘Poincaré Conjecture’ into the search box. Soon, I found Isobel had been right. This conjecture – concerning a number of very basic topological laws about spheres and four-dimensional space – had been solved by a Russian mathematician called Grigori Perelman. On 18 March 2010 – just over three years ago – it was announced that he had won a Clay Millennium Prize. But he had turned it down, and the million dollars that had gone with it. ‘I’m not interested in money or fame,’ he had said. ‘I don’t want to be on display like an animal in a zoo. I’m not a hero of mathematics.’ This was not the only prize he had been offered. There had been others. A prestigious prize from the European Mathematical Society, one from the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, and the Fields Medal, the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, and the Fields Medal, the highest award in mathematics. All of them he had turned down, choosing instead to live a life of poverty and unemployment, caring for his elderly mother. Humans are arrogant. Humans are greedy. They care about nothing but money and fame. They do not appreciate mathematics for its own sake, but for what it can get them. I logged out. Suddenly, I felt weak. I was hungry. That must have been it. So I went to the kitchen and looked for food. Crunchy wholenut peanut butter I ate some capers, and then a stock cube, and chewed on a stick-like vegetable called celery. Eventually, I got out some bread, a staple of human cuisine, and I looked in the cupboard for something to put on it. Caster sugar was my first option. And then I tried some mixed herbs. Neither was very satisfying. After much anxious trepidation and analysis of the nutritional information I decided to try something called crunchy wholenut peanut butter. I placed it on the bread and gave some to the dog. He liked it. ‘Should I try it?’ I asked him. Yes, you definitely should, appeared to be the response. (Dog words weren’t really words. They were more like melodies. Silent melodies sometimes, but melodies all the same.) It is very tasty indeed. He wasn’t wrong. As I placed it in my mouth and began to chew I realised that human food could actually be quite good. I had never enjoyed food before. Now I came to think of it, I had never enjoyed anything before. And yet today, even amid my strange feelings of weakness and doubt, I had experienced the pleasures of music and of food. And maybe even the simple enjoyment of canine company. After I had eaten one piece of bread and peanut butter I made another one for us both, and then another, Newton’s appetite proving to be at least a match for mine. ‘I am not what I am,’ I told him at one stage. ‘You know that, don’t you? I mean, that is why you were so hostile at first. Why you growled whenever I was near you. You sensed it, didn’t you? More than a human could. You knew there was a difference.’ His silence spoke volumes. And as I stared into his glassy, honest eyes I felt the urge to tell him more. ‘I have killed someone,’ I told him, feeling a sense of relief. ‘I am what a human would categorise as a murderer, a judgemental term, and based in this case on the wrong judgements. You see, sometimes to save something you have to kill a little piece of it. But still, a murderer – that is what they would call me, to kill a little piece of it. But still, a murderer – that is what they would call me, if they knew. Not that they would ever really be able to know how I had done it. ‘You see, as you no doubt know, humans are still at the point in their development where they see a strong difference between the mental and the physical within the same body. They have mental hospitals and body hospitals, as if one doesn’t directly affect the other. And so, if they can’t accept that a mind is directly responsible for the body of the same person, they are hardly likely to understand how a mind – albeit not a human one – can affect the body of someone else. Of course, my skills are not just the product of biology. I have technology, but it is unseen. It is inside me. And now resides in my left hand. It allowed me to take this shape, it enables me to contact my home, and it strengthens my mind. It makes me able to manipulate mental and physical processes. I can perform telekinesis – look, look right now, look what I am doing with the lid of the peanut butter jar – and also something very close to hypnosis. You see, where I am from everything is seamless. Minds, bodies, technologies all come together in a quite beautiful convergence.’ The phone rang at that point. It had rung earlier too. I didn’t answer it though. There were some tastes, just as there were some songs by the Beach Boys (‘In My Room’, ‘God Only Knows’, ‘Sloop John B’) that were just too good to disturb. But then the peanut butter ran out, and Newton and I stared at each other in mutual mourning. ‘I am sorry, Newton. But it appears we have run out of peanut butter.’ This cannot be true. You must be mistaken. Check again. I checked again. ‘No, I am not mistaken.’ Properly. Check properly. That was just a glance. I checked properly. I even showed him the inside of the jar. He was still disbelieving, so I placed the jar right up next to his nose, which was clearly where he wanted it. Ah, you see, there is still some. Look. Look. And he licked the contents of the jar until he too had to eventually agree we were out of the stuff. I laughed out loud. I had never laughed. It was a very odd feeling, but not unpleasant. And then we went and sat on the sofa in the living room. Why are you here? I don’t know if the dog’s eyes were asking me this, but I gave him an answer anyway. ‘I am here to destroy information. Information that exists in the bodies of certain machines and the minds of certain humans. That is my purpose. Although, obviously, while I am here I am also collecting information. Just how volatile are they? How violent? How dangerous to themselves and others? Are their flaws – and there do seem to be quite a few – insurmountable? Or is there hope? These questions are the sort I have in mind, even if I am not supposed to. hope? These questions are the sort I have in mind, even if I am not supposed to. First and foremost though, what I am doing involves elimination.’ Newton looked at me bleakly, but he didn’t judge. And we stayed there, on that purple sofa, for quite a while. Something was happening to me, I realised, and it had been happening ever since Debussy and the Beach Boys. I wished I’d never played them. For ten minutes we sat in silence. This mournful mood only altered with the distraction of the front door opening and closing. It was Gulliver. He waited silently in the hallway for a moment or two, and then hung up his coat and dropped his schoolbag. He came into the living room, walking slowly. He didn’t make eye contact. ‘Don’t tell Mum, okay?’ ‘What?’ I said. ‘Don’t tell her what?’ He was awkward. ‘That I wasn’t at school.’ ‘Okay. I won’t.’ He looked at Newton, whose head was back on my lap. He seemed confused but didn’t comment. He turned to go upstairs. ‘What were you doing by the train track?’ I asked him. I saw his hands tense up. ‘What?’ ‘You were just standing there, as the train passed.’ ‘You followed me?’ ‘Yes. Yes, I did. I followed you. I wasn’t going to tell you. In fact, I am surprising myself by telling you now. But my innate curiosity won out.’ He answered with a kind of muted groan, and headed upstairs. After a while, with a dog on your lap, you realise there is a necessity to stroke it. Don’t ask me how this necessarily comes about. It clearly has something to do with the dimensions of the human upper body. Anyway, I stroked the dog and as I did so I realised it was actually a pleasant feeling, the warmth and the rhythm of it. Isobel’s dance Eventually, Isobel came back. I shifted along the sofa to reach such a position that I could witness her walking in through the front door. Just to see the simple effort of it – the physical pushing of the door, the extraction of the key, the closing of the door and the placing of that key (and the others it was attached to) in a small oval basket on a static piece of wooden furniture – all of that was quite mesmerising to me. The way she did such things in single gliding movements, almost dancelike, without thinking about them. I should have been looking down on such things. But I wasn’t. She seemed to be continually operating above the task she was doing. A melody, rising above rhythm. Yet she was still what she was, a human. She walked down the hallway, exhaling the whole way, her face containing both a smile and a frown at once. Like her son, she was confused to see the dog lying on my lap. And equally confused when she saw the dog jump off my lap and run over to her. ‘What’s with Newton?’ she asked. ‘With him?’ ‘He seems lively.’ ‘Does he?’ ‘Yes. And, I don’t know, his eyes seem brighter.’ ‘Oh. It might have been the peanut butter. And the music.’ ‘Peanut butter? Music? You never listen to music. Have you been listening to music?’ ‘Yes. We have.’ She looked at me with suspicion. ‘Right. I see.’ ‘We’ve been listening to music all day long.’ ‘How are you feeling? I mean, you know, about Daniel.’ ‘Oh, it is very sad,’ I said. ‘How was your day?’ She sighed. ‘It was okay.’ This was a lie, I could tell that. I looked at her. My eyes could stay on her with ease, I noticed. What had happened? Was this another side-effect of the music?I suppose I was getting acclimatised to her, and to humans in general. Physically, at least from the outside, I was one too. It was becoming a new normality, in a sense. Yet even so, my stomach churned far less with her than with the sight of the others I saw walking past the window, peering in at me. In fact, that day, or at that point in that day, it didn’t churn at all. ‘I feel like I should phone Tabitha,’ she said. ‘It’s difficult though, isn’t it? She’ll be inundated. I might just send her an email and let her know, you know, if there’s anything we can do.’ I nodded. ‘That’s a good idea.’ She studied me for a while. ‘Yes,’ she said, at a lower frequency. ‘I think so.’ She looked at the phone. ‘Has anyone called?’ ‘I think so. The phone rang a few times.’ ‘But you didn’t pick it up?’ ‘No. No, I didn’t. I don’t really feel up to lengthy conversations. And I feel cursed at the moment. The last time I had a lengthy conversation with anyone who wasn’t you or Gulliver they ended up dying in front of me.’ ‘Don’t say it like that.’ ‘Like what?’ ‘Flippantly. It’s a sad day.’ ‘I know,’ I said. ‘I just . . . it hasn’t sunk in yet, really.’ She went away to listen to the messages. She came back. ‘Lots of people have been calling you.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. ‘Who?’ ‘Your mother. But be warned, she might be doing her trademark oppressive- worry thing. She’s heard about your little event at Corpus. I don’t know how. The college called, too, wanting to speak, doing a good job of sounding concerned. A journalist from the Cambridge Evening News. And Ari. Being sweet. He wonders if you’d be up to going to a football match on Saturday. Someone else, too.’ She paused for a moment. ‘She said her name was Maggie.’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said, faking it. ‘Of course. Maggie.’ Then she raised her eyebrows at me. It meant something, clearly, but I had no idea what. It was frustrating. You see, the Language of Words was only one of the human languages. There were many others, as I have pointed out. The Language of Sighs, the Language of Silent Moments and, most significantly, the Language of Frowns. Then she did the opposite, her eyebrows going as low as they could. She sighed and went into the kitchen. ‘What have you been doing with the caster sugar?’ ‘What have you been doing with the caster sugar?’ ‘Eating it,’ I said. ‘It was a mistake. Sorry.’ ‘Well, you know, feel free to put things back.’ ‘I forgot. Sorry.’ ‘It’s okay. It’s just been a day and a half, that’s all.’ I nodded and tried to act human. ‘What do you want me to do? I mean, what should I do?’ ‘Well, you could start by calling your mother. But don’t tell her about the hospital. I know what you’re like.’ ‘What? What am I like?’ ‘You tell her more than you tell me.’ Now that was worrying. That was very worrying indeed. I decided to phone her right away. The mother Remarkable as it may sound, the mother was an important concept for humans. Not only were they truly aware who their mother was, but in many cases they also kept in contact with them throughout their lives. Of course, for someone like me, whose mother was never there to be known this was a very exotic idea. So exotic, I was scared to pursue it. But I did, because if her son had told her too much information, I obviously needed to know. ‘Andrew?’ ‘Yes, Mother. It is me.’ ‘Oh Andrew.’ She spoke at a high frequency. The highest I had ever heard. ‘Hello, Mother.’ ‘Andrew, me and your father have been worried sick about you.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. ‘I had a little episode. I temporarily lost my mind. I forgot to put on my clothes. That’s all.’ ‘Is that all you have to say?’ ‘No. No, it isn’t. I have to ask you a question, Mother. It is an important question.’ ‘Oh, Andrew. What is the matter?’ ‘The matter? Which matter?’ ‘Is it Isobel? Has she been nagging you again? Is that what this is about?’ ‘Again?’ The static crackle of a sigh. ‘Yes. You’ve told us for over a year now that you and Isobel have been having difficulties. That she’s not been as understanding as she could have been about your workload. That she’s not been there for you.’ I thought of Isobel, lying about her day to stop me worrying, making me food, stroking my skin. ‘No,’ I said. ‘She is there for him. Me.’ ‘And Gulliver? What about him? I thought she’d turned him against you. Because of that band he wanted to be in. But you were right, darling. He shouldn’t be messing around in bands. Not after all that he’s done.’ ‘Band? I don’t know, Mother. I don’t think it is that.’ ‘Band? I don’t know, Mother. I don’t think it is that.’ ‘Why are you calling me Mother? You never call me Mother.’ ‘But you are my mother. What do I call you?’ ‘Mum. You call me Mum.’ ‘Mum,’ I said. It sounded the most strange of all the strange words. ‘Mum. Mum. Mum. Mum. Mum, listen, I want to know if I spoke to you recently.’ She wasn’t listening. ‘We wish we were there.’ ‘Come over,’ I said. I was interested to see what she looked like. ‘Come over right now.’ ‘Well, if we didn’t live twelve thousand miles away.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. Twelve thousand miles didn’t sound like much. ‘Come over this afternoon then.’ The mother laughed. ‘Still got your sense of humour.’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I am still very funny. Listen, did I speak to you last Saturday?’ ‘No. Andrew, have you lost your memory? Is this amnesia? You’re acting like you have amnesia.’ ‘I’m a bit confused. That’s all. It’s not amnesia. The doctors told me that. It’s just . . . I have been working hard.’ ‘Yes, yes, I know. You told us.’ ‘So, what did I tell you?’ ‘That you’ve hardly been sleeping. That you’ve been working harder than you ever have, at least since your PhD.’ And then she started giving me information I hadn’t asked for. She started talking about her hipbone. It was causing her a lot of pain. She was on pain relief medication but it wasn’t working. I found the conversation disconcerting and even nauseating. The idea of prolonged pain was quite alien to me. Humans considered themselves to be quite medically advanced but they had yet to solve this problem in any meaningful way. Just as they had yet to solve the problem of death. ‘Mother. Mum, listen, what do you know about the Riemann hypothesis?’ ‘That’s the thing you’re working on, isn’t it?’ ‘Working on? Working on. Yes. I am still working on it. And I will never prove it. I realise that now.’ ‘Oh, all right, darling. Well, don’t beat yourself up about it. Now, listen . . .’ Pretty soon she was back to talking about the pain again. She said the doctor had told her she should get a hip replacement. It would be made of titanium. I almost gasped when she said that but I didn’t want to tell her about titanium, as the humans obviously didn’t know about that yet. They would find out in their own time. Then she started talking about my ‘father’ and how his memory was getting Then she started talking about my ‘father’ and how his memory was getting worse. The doctor had told him not to drive any more and that it looked increasingly unlikely that he would be able to finish the book on macroeconomic theory he had been hoping to get published. ‘It makes me worry about you, Andrew. You know, only last week I told you what the doctor had said, about how I should advise you to get a brain scan. It can run in families.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. I really didn’t know what else was required of me. The truth was that I wanted the conversation to end. I had obviously not told my parents. Or I hadn’t told my mother, at any rate, and from the sound of things my father’s brain was such that it would probably lose any information I had given him. Also, and it was a big also, the conversation was depressing me. It was making me think about human life in a way I didn’t want to think about it. Human life, I realised, got progressively worse as you got older, by the sound of things. You arrived, with baby feet and hands and infinite happiness, and then the happiness slowly evaporated as your feet and hands grew bigger. And then, from the teenage years onwards, happiness was something you could lose your grip of, and once it started to slip it gained mass. It was as if the knowledge that it could slip was the thing that made it more difficult to hold, no matter how big your feet and hands were. Why was this depressing? Why did I care, when it was not my job to do so? Again I felt immense gratitude that I only looked like a human being and would never actually be one. She carried on talking. And as she did so I realised there could be no cosmic consequence at all if I stopped listening, and with that realisation I switched off the phone. I closed my eyes, wanting to see nothing but I did see something. I saw Tabitha, leaning over her husband as aspirin froth slid out of his mouth. I wondered if my mother was the same age as Tabitha, or older. When I opened my eyes again I realised Newton was standing there, looking up at me. His eyes told me he was confused. Why did you not say goodbye? You usually say goodbye. And then, bizarrely, I did something I didn’t understand. Something which had absolutely no logic to it at all. I picked up the phone and dialled the same number. After three rings she answered, and then I spoke. ‘Sorry, Mum. I meant to say goodbye.’ Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Are you there? We can hear you. We are here. Listen, it’s safe. The information is destroyed. For now, the humans will remain at level three. There is no worry. You have destroyed all the evidence, and all possible sources? I have destroyed the information on Andrew Martin’s computer, and on Daniel Russell’s computer. Daniel Russell is destroyed, also. Heart attack. He was a heart-risk, so that was the most logical cause of death in the circumstances. Have you destroyed Isobel Martin and Gulliver Martin? No. No, I haven’t. There is no need to destroy them. They do not know? Gulliver Martin knows. Isobel Martin doesn’t. But Gulliver has no motivation to say anything. You must destroy him. You must destroy both of them. No. There is no need. If you want me to, if you really think it is required, then I can manipulate his neurological processes. I can make him forget what his father told him. Not that he really knows anyway. He has no real understanding of mathematics. The effects of any mind manipulation you carry out disappear the moment you return home. You know that. He won’t say anything. He might have said something already. Humans aren’t to be trusted. They don’t even trust themselves. Gulliver hasn’t said anything. And Isobel knows nothing. You must complete your task. If you do not complete your task, someone else will be sent to complete it for you. No. No. I will complete it. Don’t worry. I will complete my task. PART II I held a jewel in my fingers – Richard Feynman – David Foster Wallace – Carl Sagan You can’t say A is made of B or vice versa. All mass is interaction. We’re all lonely for something we don’t know we’re lonely for. For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love. Sleepwalking I stood next to his bed while he slept. I don’t know how long I just stood there, in the dark, listening to his deep breathing as he slipped deeper and deeper below dreams. Half an hour, maybe. He hadn’t pulled the window blind down, so I looked out at the night. There was no moon from this angle, but I could see a few stars. Suns lighting dead solar systems elsewhere in the galaxy. Everywhere you can see in their sky, or almost everywhere, is lifeless. That must affect them. That must give them ideas above their station. That must send them insane. Gulliver rolled over, and I decided to wait no longer. It was now or it was never. You will pull back your duvet, I told him, in a voice he wouldn’t have heard if he had been awake but which reached right in, riding theta-waves, to become a command from his own brain. And slowly you will sit up in your bed, your feet will be on the rug and you will breathe and you will compose yourself and then you will stand up. And he did, indeed, stand up. He stayed there, breathing deeply and slowly, waiting for the next command. You will walk to the door. Do not worry about opening the door, because it is already open. There. Just walk, just walk, just walk to your door. He did exactly as I said. And he was there in the doorway, oblivious to everything except my voice. A voice which only had two words that needed to be said. Fall forward. I moved closer to him. Somehow those words were slow to arrive. I needed time. Another minute, at least. I was there, closer, able to smell the scent of sleep on him. Of humanity. And I remembered: You must complete your task. If you do not complete your task, someone else will be sent to complete it for you. I swallowed. My mouth was so dry it hurt. I felt the infinite expanse of the universe behind me, a vast if neutral force. The neutrality of time, of space, of mathematics, of logic, of survival. I closed my eyes. Waited. Waited. Before I opened them, I was being gripped by the throat. I could barely breathe. He had turned 180 degrees, and his left hand had me by the neck. I pulled it away, and now both his hands were fists swinging at me, wild, angry, hitting me almost as much as he missed. He got the side of my head. I walked backwards away from him, but he was moving forwards at just the same speed. His eyes were open. He was seeing me now. Seeing me and not seeing me all at the same time. I could have said stop of course, but I didn’t. Maybe I wanted to witness some human violence first-hand, even unconscious violence, to understand the importance of my task. By understanding it I would be able to fulfil it. Yes, that might have been it. That may also have explained why I let myself bleed when he punched me on the nose. I had reached his desk now and could retreat no further, so I just stood there as he kept hitting my head, my neck, my chest, my arms. He roared now, his mouth as wide as it could go, baring teeth. ‘Raaaah!’ This roar woke him up. His legs went weak and he nearly fell to the floor but he recovered in time. ‘I,’ he said. He didn’t know where he was for a moment. He saw me, in the dark, and this time it was conscious sight. ‘Dad?’ I nodded as a slow thin stream of blood reached my mouth. Isobel was running up the stairs to the attic. ‘What’s going on?’ ‘Nothing,’ I said. ‘I heard a noise so I came upstairs. Gulliver was sleepwalking, that’s all.’ Isobel switched the light on, gasped as she saw my face. ‘You’re bleeding.’ ‘It’s nothing. He didn’t know what he was doing.’ ‘Gulliver?’ Gulliver was sitting on the edge of his bed now, flinching from the light. He too looked at my face but he didn’t say anything at all. I was a wasn’t Gulliver wanted to go back to bed. To sleep. So, ten minutes later, Isobel and I were alone, and I was sitting on the side of the bath as she placed an antiseptic solution called TCP on a circle of cotton wool and dabbed it gently on a cut on my forehead, and then on my lip. Now, these were wounds I could have healed with a single thought. Just to feel pain, sometimes, was enough to cancel it. And yet, even as the antiseptic stung on contact with each cut, the injuries stayed. I forced them to. I couldn’t allow her to get suspicious. But was it just that? ‘How’s your nose?’ she asked. I caught sight of it in the mirror. A smear of blood around one nostril. ‘It’s okay,’ I said, feeling it. ‘It isn’t broken.’ Her eyes squinted in pure concentration. ‘This one on your forehead is really bad. And there’s going to be one giant bruise there. He must have really hit you hard. Did you try and restrain him?’ ‘Yes,’ I lied. ‘I did. But he kept on.’ I could smell her. Clean, human smells. The smells of the creams she used to wash and moisturise her face. The smell of her shampoo. A delicate trace of ammonia barely competing with the heavy scent of antiseptic. She was physically closer to me than she had ever been. I looked at her neck. She had two little dark moles on it, close together, charting unknown binary stars. I thought of Andrew Martin kissing her. This was what humans did. They kissed. Like so many human things, it made no sense. Or maybe, if you tried it, the logic would unfold. ‘Did he say anything?’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘No. He just yelled. It was very primal.’ ‘I don’t know, between you and him, it never ends.’ ‘What never ends?’ ‘The worry.’ She placed the blood-stained cotton wool in the small bin beside the sink. ‘I’m sorry,’ I said. ‘I’m sorry for everything. For the past and the future.’ An ‘I’m sorry,’ I said. ‘I’m sorry for everything. For the past and the future.’ An apology, said while in dull pain, made me feel as close to human as it was possible to feel. I could almost have written a poem. We went back to bed. She held my hand in the dark. I gently pulled it away. ‘We’ve lost him,’ she said. It took me a moment to realise she was talking about Gulliver. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘maybe we just have to accept him as he is, even if he’s different to what we’ve known.’ ‘I just don’t understand him. You know, he’s our son. And we’ve known him for sixteen years. And yet, I feel like I don’t know him at all.’ ‘Well, maybe we should try not to understand so much, and accept some more.’ ‘That’s a very difficult thing. And a very strange thing to come from your mouth, Andrew.’ ‘So, I suppose the next question is: what about me? Do you understand me?’ ‘I don’t think you understand yourself, Andrew.’ I wasn’t Andrew. I knew I wasn’t Andrew. But equally, I was losing myself. I was a wasn’t, that was the problem. I was lying in bed with a human woman I could now almost appreciate as beautiful, wilfully still feeling the sting of antiseptic in my wounds, and thinking of her strange but fascinating skin, and the way she had cared for me. No one in the universe cared for me. (You didn’t did you?) We had technology to care for us now, and we didn’t need emotions. We were alone. We worked together for our preservation but emotionally we needed no one. We just needed the purity of mathematical truth. And yet, I was scared of falling asleep, because the moment I fell asleep my wounds would heal and right then I didn’t want that to happen. Right then, I found a strange but real comfort in the pain. I had so many worries now. So many questions. ‘Do you believe humans are ever knowable?’ I asked. ‘I wrote a book on Charlemagne. I hope so.’ ‘But humans, in their natural state, are they good or are they bad, would you say? Can they be trusted? Or is their own real state just violence and greed and cruelty?’ ‘Well, that’s the oldest question there is.’ ‘What do you think?’ ‘I’m tired, Andrew. I’m sorry.’ ‘Yes, me too. I’ll see you in the morning.’ ‘Night.’ ‘Night.’ I stayed awake for a while as Isobel slipped towards sleep. The trouble was, I I stayed awake for a while as Isobel slipped towards sleep. The trouble was, I still wasn’t used to the night. It may not have been as dark as I first thought it to be. There was moonlight, starlight, airglow, streetlamps, and sunlight backscattered by interplanetary dust, but the humans still spent half their time in deep shadow. This, I was sure, was one of the chief reasons for personal and sexual relationships here. The need to find comfort in the dark. And it was a comfort, being next to her. So I just stayed there, hearing her breath move in and out, sounding like the tide of some exotic sea. At some point my little finger touched hers, in the double-night beneath the duvet, and this time I kept it there and imagined I was really what she thought I was. And that we were connected. Two humans, primitive enough to truly care about each other. It was a comforting thought, and the one which led me down those ever-darkening stairs of the mind towards sleep. I may need more time. You do not need time. I am going to kill who I need to kill, don’t worry about that. We are not worried. But I am not just here to destroy information. I am here to gather it. That is what you said, wasn’t it? Stuff on mathematical understanding can be read across the universe, I know that. I’m not talking about neuro-flashes. I’m talking about stuff that can only be picked up on from here, on Earth itself. To give us more insight into how the humans live. It has been a long time since anyone was here, at least in human terms. Explain why you need more time for this. Complexity demands time, but humans are primitives. They are the most shallow of mysteries. No. You are wrong. They exist simultaneously in two worlds – the world of appearances and the world of truth. The connecting strands between these worlds take many forms. When I first arrived here I did not understand certain things. For instance, I did not understand why clothes were so important. Or why a dead cow became beef, or why grass cut a certain way demanded not to be walked upon, or why household pets were so important to them. The humans are scared of nature, and are greatly reassured when they can prove to themselves they have mastery over it. This is why lawns exist, and why wolves evolved into dogs, and why their architecture is based on unnatural shapes. But, really, nature, pure nature is just a symbol to them. A symbol of human nature. They are interchangeable. So what I am saying— What are you saying? What I am saying is that it takes time to understand humans because they don’t understand themselves. They have been wearing clothes for so long. Metaphorical clothes. That is what I am talking about. That was the price of human civilisation – to create it they had to close the door on their true selves. human civilisation – to create it they had to close the door on their true selves. And so they are lost, that is how I understand it. And that is why they invented art: books, music, films, plays, painting, sculpture. They invented them as bridges back to themselves, back to who they are. But however close they get they are for ever removed. What I am saying, I suppose, is that last night I was about to kill the boy. Gulliver. He was about to fall down the stairs in his sleep but then his true nature came out and he attacked me. Attacked you with what? With himself. With his arms. His hands. He was still asleep but his eyes were open. He attacked me, or the me he thinks I am. His father. And it was pure rage. The humans are violent. That is not news. No, I know. I know. But he woke, and he wasn’t violent. That is the battle they have. And I believe if we understand human nature a little more, then we will know better what action to take in the future, when other advances are made. In the future, when another over-population crisis arises there may come a time when Earth becomes a valid option for our species. So, surely as much knowledge as possible on human psychology and society and behaviour is going to help? They are defined by greed. Not all of them. For instance, there is a mathematician called Grigori Perelman. He turned down money and prizes. He looks after his mother. We have a distorted view. I think it would be useful for all of us if I researched further. But you don’t need the two humans for that. Oh, I do. Why? Because they think they know who I am. And I have a true chance of seeing them. The real them. Behind the walls they have built for themselves. And speaking of walls, Gulliver knows nothing now. I cancelled his knowledge of what his father told him on his last night. While I am here, there is no danger. You must act soon. You don’t have for ever. I know. Don’t worry. I won’t need for ever. They must die. Yes. Wider than the sky ‘It was sleep psychosis,’ Isobel told Gulliver at breakfast the next day. ‘It’s very common. Lots of people have had it. Lots of perfectly normal and sane people. Like that man from R.E.M. He had it, and he was meant to be as nice as rock stars come.’ She hadn’t seen me. I had just entered the kitchen. But now she noticed my presence and was puzzled by the sight of me. ‘Your face,’ she said. ‘Last night there were cuts and bruises. It’s totally healed.’ ‘Must have been better than it looked. The night might exaggerate things.’ ‘Yes, but even so—’ She glanced at her son, struggling uneasily with his cereal, and decided not to go on. ‘You might need the day off school, Gulliver,’ said Isobel. I expected him to agree to this, seeing that he preferred an education that involved staring at rail-tracks. But he looked at me, considered for a moment, and concluded, ‘No. No. It’s okay. I feel fine.’ Later, it was just me and Newton in the house. I was still ‘recovering’, you see. Recover. The most human of words, the implication being that healthy normal life is covering something – the violence that is there underneath, the violence I had seen in Gulliver the night before. To be healthy meant to be covered. Clothed. Literally and metaphorically. Yet I needed to find what lay beneath, something that would satisfy the hosts and justify the delay I was taking in my task. I discovered a pile of paper, tied with an elastic band. It was in Isobel’s wardrobe, hidden among all those essential clothes, yellowing with age. I sniffed the page and guessed at least a decade. The top sheet had the words ‘Wider than the Sky’ on them, along with these ones: ‘A novel by Isobel Martin’. A novel? I read a little bit of it and realised that although the central character’s name was Charlotte, she could just as easily have been called Isobel. Charlotte heard herself sigh: a tired old machine, releasing pressure. Charlotte heard herself sigh: a tired old machine, releasing pressure. Everything weighed down on her. The small rituals of her daily existence – filling the dishwasher, picking up from school, cooking – had all been performed as if underwater. The mutual energy reserves shared by a mother and her child had now, she conceded, been monopolised by Oliver. He had been running wild since she had picked him up from school, firing that blue alien blaster or whatever it was. She didn’t know why her mother had bought it. Actually, she did know. To prove a point. ‘Five-year-old boys want to play with guns, Charlotte. It’s only natural. You can’t deprive them of their nature.’ ‘Die! Die! Die!’ Charlotte closed the oven door and set the timer. She turned around to see Oliver pointing the massive blue gun up at her face. ‘No, Oliver,’ she said, too tired to battle the abstract anger clouding his features. ‘Don’t shoot Mummy.’ He maintained his pose, fired cheap electric fairground sounds a few more times, then ran out of the kitchen, through the hallway, and noisily exterminated invisible aliens as he charged up the stairs. She remembered the quiet echoing babble of university corridors and realised that missing it was a kind of pain. She wanted to return, to teach again, but she worried she may have left it too late. Maternity leave had stretched into permanent leave, and the belief had grown that she could be fulfilled as a wife and mother, a historical archetype, ‘keeping her feet on the ground’, as her mother always advised, while her high-flying husband made sure he didn’t dip beneath the clouds. Charlotte shook her head in theatrical exasperation, as if she were being observed by an audience of stern-faced mother-watchers examining her progress and making notes on clipboards. She was often aware of the self-conscious nature of her parenting, the way she had to create a role outside of herself, a part already plotted out for her. Don’t shoot Mummy. She squatted down and looked through the oven door. The lasagne would be another forty-five minutes and Jonathan still wasn’t back from his conference. She raised herself back up and went into the living room. The wobbly glass of the drinks cabinet glinted, shining like a false promise. She turned the old key and opened the door. A mini metropolis of spirit bottles bathed in dark shadow. She reached for the Empire State, the Bombay Sapphire, and poured out her evening allowance. Jonathan. Late last Thursday. Late this Thursday. She acknowledged this fact as she slumped down on the settee, but did not get too close to it. Her husband was a mystery she no longer had the energy to unravel. Anyway, it was known to be the first rule of marriage: solve the mystery, end the love. So, families often stayed together. Wives sometimes managed to stay with husbands and put up with whichever misery they felt by writing novels and hiding them at the bottom of their wardrobes. Mothers put up with their children, no matter how difficult those children were, no matter how close to insanity they pushed their parents. Anyway, I stopped reading there. I felt it was an intrusion. A bit rich, I know, from someone who was living inside her husband’s identity. I put it back in its place in the wardrobe underneath the clothes. Later on, I told her what I had found. She gave me an unreadable look, and her cheeks went red. I didn’t know if it She gave me an unreadable look, and her cheeks went red. I didn’t know if it was a blush or anger. Maybe it was a little of both. ‘That was private. You weren’t ever supposed to see that.’ ‘I know. That is why I wanted to see it. I want to understand you.’ ‘Why? There’s no academic glory or million-dollar prize if you solve me, Andrew. You shouldn’t go snooping around.’ ‘Shouldn’t a husband know a wife?’ ‘That really is quite rich coming from you.’ ‘What does that mean?’ She sighed. ‘Nothing. Nothing. Sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.’ ‘You should say whatever you feel you should say.’ ‘Good policy. But I think that would mean we’d have divorced around 2002, at a conservative estimate.’ ‘Well? Maybe you would have been happier if you had divorced him, I mean me, in 2002.’ ‘Well, we’ll never know.’ ‘No.’ And the phone rang. It was someone for me. ‘Hello?’ A man spoke. His voice was casual, familiar, but there was a curiosity there, too. ‘Hey, it’s me. Ari.’ ‘Oh, hello Ari.’ I knew Ari was supposed to be my closest friend, so I tried to sound friend-like. ‘How are you? How’s your marriage?’ Isobel looked at me with an emphatic frown, but I don’t think he’d heard properly. ‘Well, just got back from that thing in Edinburgh.’ ‘Oh,’ I said, trying to pretend I knew what ‘that thing in Edinburgh’ was. ‘Right. Yes. That thing in Edinburgh. Of course. How was that?’ ‘It was good. Yeah, it was good. Caught up with the St Andrews lot. Listen, mate, I hear it’s been a bit of a week for you.’ ‘Yes. It has. It has been a lot of a week for me.’ ‘So I wasn’t sure if you’d still be up for the football?’ ‘The football?’ ‘Cambridge–Kettering. We could have a pint of mild and a bit of a chat, about that top secret thing you told me the last time we spoke.’ ‘Secret?’ Every molecule of me was now alert. ‘What secret?’ ‘Don’t think I should broadcast it.’ ‘No. No. You’re right. Don’t say it out loud. In fact, don’t tell anyone.’ Isobel was now in the hallway, looking at me with suspicion. ‘But to answer you, yes, I will go to the football.’ And I pressed the red button on the phone, weary at the probability that I would have to switch another human life into non-existence. A few seconds of silence over breakfast You become something else. A different species. That is the easy bit. That is simple molecular rearrangement. Our inner technology can do that, without a problem, with the correct commands and model to work from. There are no new ingredients in the universe, and humans – however they may look – are made of roughly the same things we are. The difficulty, though, is the other stuff. The stuff that happens when you look in the bathroom mirror and see this new you and don’t want to throw up into the sink at the sight of yourself like you have wanted to every other morning. And when you wear clothes, and you realise it is starting to feel like quite a normal thing to do. And when you walk downstairs and see the life form that is meant to be your son eating toast, listening to music only he can hear, it takes you a second – or two, three, four seconds – to realise that, actually, this is not your son. He means nothing to you. Not only that: he has to mean nothing to you. Also, your wife. Your wife is not your wife. Your wife who loves you but doesn’t really like you, because of something you never did, but which couldn’t be any worse, from her perspective, than the something you’re going to do. She is an alien. She is as alien as they come. A primate whose nearest evolutionary cousins are hairy tree-dwelling knuckle draggers known as chimpanzees. And yet, when everything is alien the alien becomes familiar, and you can judge her as humans judge her. You can watch her when she drinks her pink grapefruit juice, and stares at her son with worried, helpless eyes. You can see that for her being a parent is standing on a shore and watching her child in a vulnerable craft, heading out over deeper and deeper water, hoping but not knowing there will be land somewhere ahead. And you can see her beauty. If beauty on Earth is the same as elsewhere: ideal in that it is tantalising and unsolvable, creating a delicious kind of confusion. I was confused. I was lost. I wished I had a new wound, just so she could attend to me. ‘What are you looking at?’ she asked me. ‘What are you looking at?’ she asked me. ‘You,’ I said. She looked at Gulliver. He couldn’t hear us. Then she looked back at me, as confused as myself. We are worried. What are you doing? I told you. Well? I am accumulating information. You are wasting time. I’m not. I know what I am doing. It was never meant to take this long. I know. But I am learning more about the humans. They are more complicated than we first thought. They are sometimes violent, but more often care about each other. There is more goodness in them than anything else, I am convinced of it. What are you saying? I don’t know what I am saying. I am confused. Some things have stopped making sense. This happens, occasionally, on a new planet. The perspective changes to that of its inhabitants. But our perspective has not changed. Do you understand that? Yes. I do understand. Stay pure. I will. Life/death/football Humans are one of the few intelligent beings in the galaxy who haven’t quite solved the problem of death. And yet they don’t spend their whole lives screeching and howling in terror, clawing at their own bodies, or rolling around on the floor. Some humans do that – I saw them in the hospital – but those humans are considered the mad ones. Now, consider this. A human life is on average 80 Earth years or around 30,000 Earth days. Which means they are born, they make some friends, eat a few meals, they get married, or they don’t get married, have a child or two, or not, drink a few thousand glasses of wine, have sexual intercourse a few times, discover a lump somewhere, feel a bit of regret, wonder where all the time went, know they should have done it differently, realise they would have done it the same, and then they die. Into the great black nothing. Out of space. Out of time. The most trivial of trivial zeroes. And that’s it, the full caboodle. All confined to the same mediocre planet. But at ground level the humans don’t appear to spend their entire lives in a catatonic state. No. They do other things. Things like: – washing – listening – gardening – eating – driving – working – yearning – earning – staring – drinking – sighing – sighing – reading – gaming – sunbathing – complaining – jogging – quibbling – caring – mingling – fantasising – googling – parenting – renovating – loving – dancing – fucking – regretting – failing – striving – hoping – sleeping Oh, and sport. Apparently I, or rather Andrew, liked sport. And the sport he liked was football. Luckily for Professor Andrew Martin, the football team he supported was Cambridge United, one of those which successfully avoided the perils and existential trauma of victory. To support Cambridge United, I discovered, was to support the idea of failure. To watch a team’s feet consistently avoid the spherical Earth-symbol seemed to frustrate their supporters greatly, but they obviously wouldn’t have it any other way. The truth is, you see, however much they would beg to disagree, humans don’t actually like to win. Or rather, they like winning for ten seconds but if they keep on winning they end up actually having to think about other things, like life and death. The only thing humans like less than winning is losing, but at least something can be done about that. With absolute winning, there is nothing to be done. They just have to deal with it. Now, I was there at the game to see Cambridge United play against a team called Kettering. I had asked Gulliver if he wanted to come with me – so I could keep Kettering. I had asked Gulliver if he wanted to come with me – so I could keep an eye on him – and he had said, with sarcasm, ‘Yeah, Dad, you know me so well.’ So, it was just me and Ari, or to give him his full title Professor Arirumadhi Arasaratham. As I have said, this was Andrew’s closest friend, although I had learnt from Isobel that I didn’t really have friends as such. More acquaintances. Anyway, Ari was an ‘expert’ (human definition) on theoretical physics. He was also quite rotund, as if he didn’t just want to watch football but become one. ‘So,’ he said, during a period when Cambridge United didn’t have the ball (that is to say, any time during the match), ‘how are things?’ ‘Things?’ He stuffed some crisps into his mouth and made no attempt to conceal their fate. ‘You know, I was a bit worried about you.’ He laughed. It was the laugh human males do, to hide emotion. ‘Well, I say worry, it was more mild concern. I say mild concern but it was more ‘wonder if he’s done a Nash?’’ ‘What do you mean?’ He told me what he meant. Apparently human mathematicians have a habit of going mad. He gave me a list of names – Nash, Cantor, Gödel, Turing – and I nodded along as if they meant something. And then he said ‘Riemann.’ ‘Riemann?’ ‘I heard you weren’t eating much so I was thinking more Gödel than Riemann, actually,’ he said. By Gödel, I later learnt, he meant Kurt Gödel, another German mathematician. However, this one’s particular psychological quirk was that he had believed everyone was trying to poison his food. So he had stopped eating altogether. By that definition of madness, Ari appeared very sane indeed. ‘No. I haven’t done one of those. I am eating now. Peanut butter sandwiches mainly.’ ‘Sounds like more of a Presley,’ he said, laughing. And then he gave me a serious look. I could tell it was serious because he had swallowed and wasn’t putting any more food in his mouth. ‘Because, you know, prime numbers are fucking serious, man. Some serious shit. They can make you lose it. They’re like sirens. They call you in with their isolated beauty and before you know it you are in some major mind-shit. And when I heard about your naked corpus at Corpus I thought you were cracking up a bit.’ ‘No. I am on the rails,’ I said. ‘Like a train. Or a clothes-hanger.’ ‘And Isobel? Everything fine with you and Isobel?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘She is my wife. And I love her. Everything is fine. Fine.’ He frowned at me. Then he took a moment’s glance to see if Cambridge United were anywhere near the ball. He seemed relieved to see they weren’t. United were anywhere near the ball. He seemed relieved to see they weren’t. ‘Really? Everything’s fine?’ I could see he needed more confirmation. ‘Till I loved I never lived.’ He shook his head and gave a facial expression I can now safely classify as bewilderment. ‘What’s that? Shakespeare? Tennyson? Marvell?’ I shook my head. ‘No. It was Emily Dickinson. I have been reading a lot of her poetry. And also Anne Sexton’s. And Walt Whitman too. Poetry seems to say a lot about us. You know, us humans.’ ‘Emily Dickinson? You’re quoting Emily Dickinson at a match?’ ‘Yes.’ I sensed, again, I was getting the context wrong. Everything here was about context. There was nothing that was right for every occasion. I didn’t get it. The air always had hydrogen in it wherever you were. But that was pretty much the only consistent thing. What was the big difference that made quoting love poetry inappropriate in this context? I had no idea. ‘Right,’ he said, and paused for the large, communal groan as Kettering scored a goal. I groaned too. Groaning was actually quite diverting, and certainly the most enjoyable aspect of sport spectating. I might have overdone it a little bit though, judging from the looks I was getting. Or maybe they had seen me on the Internet. ‘Okay,’ he said. ‘And what does Isobel feel about everything?’ ‘Everything?’ ‘You, Andrew. What does she think? Does she know about . . . you know? Is that what triggered it?’ This was my moment. I inhaled. ‘The secret I told you?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘About the Riemann hypothesis?’ He scrunched his face in confusion. ‘What? No, man. Unless you’ve been sleeping with a hypothesis on the side?’ ‘So what was the secret?’ ‘That you’re having it away with a student.’ ‘Oh,’ I said, feeling relief. ‘So I definitely didn’t say anything about work the last time I saw you.’ ‘No. For once, you didn’t.’ He turned back to the football. ‘So, are you going to spill the beans about this student?’ ‘My memory is a bit hazy, to be honest with you.’ ‘That’s convenient. Perfect alibi. If Isobel finds out. Not that you’re exactly man of the match in her eyes.’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘No offence, mate, but you’ve told me what her opinion is.’ ‘No offence, mate, but you’ve told me what her opinion is.’ ‘What is her opinion of’ – I hesitated – ‘of me?’ He pressed one final handful of crisps in his mouth and washed it down with that disgusting phosphoric acid-flavoured drink called Coca-Cola. ‘Her opinion is that you are a selfish bastard.’ ‘Why does she think that?’ ‘Maybe because you are a selfish bastard. But then, we’re all selfish bastards.’ ‘Are we?’ ‘Oh yeah. It’s our DNA. Dawkins pointed that out to us, way back. But you, man, your selfish gene is on a different level. With you, I should imagine, your selfish gene is similar to the one that smashed a rock over the head of that penultimate Neanderthal, before turning round and screwing his wife.’ He smiled and carried on watching the match. It was a long match. Elsewhere in the universe, stars formed and others ceased to be. Was this the purpose of human existence? Was the purpose somewhere inside the pleasure, or at least the casual simplicity of a football match? Eventually, the game ended. ‘That was great,’ I lied, as we walked out of the grounds. ‘Was it? We lost four nil.’ ‘Yes, but while I watched it I didn’t think once about my mortality, or the various other difficulties our mortal form will bring in later life.’ He looked bewildered again. He was going to say something but he was beaten to it by someone throwing an empty can at my head. Even though it was thrown from behind I had sensed it coming, and ducked quickly out of the way. Ari was stunned by my reflexes. As, I think, was the can-thrower. ‘Oi, wanker,’ the can-thrower said, ‘you’re that freak on the web. The naked one. Bit warm, ain’t you? With all those clothes on.’ ‘Piss off, mate,’ Ari said nervously. The man did the opposite. The can-thrower was walking over. He had red cheeks and very small eyes and greasy black hair. He was flanked by two friends. All three of them had faces ready for violence. Red Cheeks leaned in close to Ari. ‘What did you say, big man?’ ‘There might have been a “piss” in there,’ said Ari, ‘and there was definitely an “off”.’ The man grabbed Ari’s coat. ‘Think you’re smart?’ ‘Moderately.’ I held the man’s arm. ‘Get off me, you fucking perv,’ he responded. ‘I was speaking to fat bastard.’ I wanted to hurt him. I had never wanted to hurt anyone – only needed to, and there was a difference. With this person, there was a definite desire to hurt him. I heard the rasp of his breath, and tightened his lungs. Within seconds he was heard the rasp of his breath, and tightened his lungs. Within seconds he was reaching for his inhaler. ‘We’ll be on our way,’ I said, releasing the pressure in his chest. ‘And you three won’t bother us again.’ Ari and I walked home, unfollowed. ‘Bloody hell,’ said Ari. ‘What was that?’ I didn’t answer. How could I? What that had been was something Ari could never understand. Clouds gathered together quickly. The sky darkened. It looked like rain. I hated rain, as I have told you. I knew Earth rain wasn’t sulphuric acid, but rain, all rain, was something I could not abide. I panicked. I started running. ‘Wait!’ said Ari, who was running behind me. ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Rain!’ I said, wishing for a dome around the whole of Cambridge. ‘I can’t stand rain.’ Light-bulb ‘Have a nice time?’ Isobel asked on my return. She was standing on top of one form of primitive technology (step-ladder) changing another one (incandescent light-bulb). ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I did some good groaning. But to be honest with you, I don’t think I’ll go again.’ She dropped the new bulb. It smashed. ‘Damn. We don’t have another one.’ She looked, almost, like she might cry about this fact. She stepped down from the ladder, and I stared up at the dead light-bulb still hanging there. I concentrated hard. A moment later it was working again. ‘That was lucky. It didn’t need changing after all.’ Isobel stared at the light. The golden illumination on her skin was quite mesmerising, for some reason. The way it shifted shadow. Made her more distinctly herself. ‘How weird,’ she said. Then she looked down at the broken glass. ‘I’ll see to that,’ I said. And she smiled at me and her hand touched mine and gave it a quick pulse of gratitude. And then she did something I wasn’t expecting at all. She embraced me, gently, with broken glass still at our feet. I breathed her in. I liked the warmth of her body against mine and realised the pathos of being a human. Of being a mortal creature who was essentially alone but needed the myth of togetherness with others. Friends, children, lovers. It was an attractive myth. It was a myth you could easily inhabit. ‘Oh Andrew,’ she said. I didn’t know what she meant by this simple declaration of my name, but when she stroked my back I found myself stroking hers, and saying the words that seemed somehow the most appropriate. ‘It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay . . .’ Shopping I went to the funeral of Daniel Russell. I watched the coffin being lowered into the ground, and earth being sprinkled over the top of the wood casket. There were lots of people there, most of them wearing black. A few were crying. Afterwards, Isobel wanted to go over and talk to Tabitha. Tabitha looked different to when I had last seen her. She looked older, even though it had only been a week. She wasn’t crying, but it seemed like an effort not to. Isobel stroked her arm. ‘Listen, Tabitha, I just want you to know, we’re here. Whatever you need, we’re here.’ ‘Thank you, Isobel. That really does mean a lot. It really does.’ ‘Just basic stuff. If you don’t feel up to the supermarket. I mean, supermarkets are not the most sympathetic of places.’ ‘That’s very kind. I know you can do it online, but I’ve never got the hang of it.’ ‘Well, don’t worry. We’ll sort it out.’ And this actually happened. Isobel went to get another human’s shopping, and paid for it, and came home and told me I was looking better. ‘Am I?’ ‘Yes. You’re looking yourself again.’ The Zeta Function ‘Are you sure you’re ready?’ Isobel asked me, the next Monday morning, as I ate my first peanut butter sandwich of the day. Newton was asking it, too. Either that, or he was asking about the sandwich. I tore him off a piece. ‘Yes. It will be fine. What could go wrong?’ This was when Gulliver let out a mocking groan sound. The only sound he’d made all morning. ‘What’s up, Gulliver?’ I asked. ‘Everything,’ he said. He didn’t expand. Instead, he left his uneaten cereal and stormed upstairs. ‘Should I follow him?’ ‘No,’ Isobel said. ‘Give him time.’ I nodded. I trusted her. Time was her subject, after all. An hour later I was in Andrew’s office. It was the first time I had been there since I had deleted the email to Daniel Russell. This time, I wasn’t in a rush and could absorb a few more details. As he was a professor, there were books lining every wall, designed so that from whichever angle you looked at him you would see a book. I looked at some of the titles. Very primitive-looking in the main. A History of Binary and Other Non-decimal Numeration. Hyperbolic Geometry. The Book of Hexagonal Tessellation. Logarithmic Spirals and the Golden Mean. There was a book written by Andrew himself. One I hadn’t noticed the last time I had been here. It was a thin book called The Zeta Function. It had the words ‘Uncorrected Proof Copy’ on the cover. I made sure the door was locked and then sat down in his chair and read every word. And what a depressing read it was, I have to say. It was about the Riemann hypothesis, and what seemed like his futile quest to prove it and explain why the spaces between prime numbers increased the way they did. The tragedy was in realising how desperately he had wanted to solve it – and, of course, after he’d written the book he had solved it, though the benefits he’d imagined would never happen, because I had destroyed the proof. And I began to think of how fundamentally our equivalent mathematical breakthrough – the one which we came to know as the Second Basic Theory of Prime Numbers – had on us. How it enabled us to do all that we can do. Travel the universe. Inhabit other worlds, transform into other bodies. Live as long as we want to live. Search each other’s minds, each other’s dreams. All that. The Zeta Function did, however, list all the things humans had achieved. The main steps on the road. The developments that had advanced them towards civilisation. Fire, that was a biggie. The plough. The printing press. The steam engine. The microchip. The discovery of DNA. And humans would be the first to congratulate themselves on all this. But the trouble was, for them, they had never made the leap most other intelligent life forms in the universe had made. Oh, they had built rockets and probes and satellites. A few of them even worked. Yet, really, their mathematics had thus far let them down. They had yet to do the big stuff. The synchronisation of brains. The creation of free-thinking computers. Automation technology. Inter-galactic travel. And as I read, I realised I was stopping all these opportunities. I had killed their future. The phone rang. It was Isobel. ‘Andrew, what are you doing? Your lecture started ten minutes ago.’ She was cross, but in a concerned way. It still felt strange, and new, having someone be worried about me. I didn’t fully understand this concern, or what she gained by having it, but I must confess I quite liked being the subject of it. ‘Oh yes. Thank you for reminding me. I will go. Bye, erm, darling.’ Be careful. We are listening. The problem with equations I walked into the lecture hall. It was a large room made predominantly of dead trees. There were a lot of people staring at me. These were students. Some had pens and paper. Others had computers. All were waiting for knowledge. I scanned the room. There were 102 of them, in total. Always an unsettling number, stuck as it is between two primes. I tried to work out the students’ knowledge level. You see, I didn’t want to overshoot. I looked behind me. There was a whiteboard where words and equations were meant to be written but there was nothing on it. I hesitated. And during that hesitation someone sensed my weakness. Someone on the back row. A male of about twenty, with bushy blond hair and a T-shirt which said ‘What part of N = R x fs x fp x ne x f l x fi x fc x L don’t you understand?’ He giggled at the wit he was about to display and shouted out, ‘You look a bit overdressed today, Professor!’ He giggled some more, and it was contagious; the howling laughter spreading like fire across the whole hall. Within moments, everyone in the hall was laughing. Well, everyone except one person, a female. The non-laughing female was looking at me intently. She had red curly hair, full lips and wide eyes. She had a startling frankness about her appearance. An openness that reminded me of a death flower. She was wearing a cardigan and coiling strands of her hair around her finger. ‘Calm down,’ I said, to the rest of them. ‘That is very funny. I get it. I am wearing clothes and you are referring to an occasion in which I was not wearing clothes. Very funny. You think it is a joke, like when Georg Cantor said the scientist Francis Bacon wrote the plays of William Shakespeare, or when John Nash started seeing men in hats who weren’t really there. That was funny. The human mind is a limited, but high plateau. Spend your life at its outer limits and, oops, you might fall off. That is funny. Yes. But don’t worry, you won’t fall off. Young man, you are right there in the middle of your plateau. Though I appreciate your concern, I have to say I am feeling much better now. I am wearing underpants and socks and trousers and even a shirt.’ wearing underpants and socks and trousers and even a shirt.’ People were laughing again, but this time the laughter felt warmer. And it did something to me, inside, this warmth. So then I started laughing, too. Not at what I had just said, because I didn’t see how that was funny. No. I was laughing at myself. The impossible fact that I was there, on that most absurd planet and yet actually liking being there. And I felt an urge to tell someone how good it felt, in human form, to laugh. The release of it. And I wanted to tell someone about it and I realised that I didn’t want to tell the hosts. I wanted to tell Isobel. Anyway, I did the lecture. Apparently I had been meant to be talking about something called ‘post-Euclidean geometry’. But I didn’t want to talk about that, so I talked about the boy’s T-shirt. The formula written on it was something called Drake’s equation. It was an equation devised to calculate the likelihood of advanced civilisations in Earth’s galaxy, or what the humans called the Milky Way galaxy. (That is how humans came to terms with the vast expanse of space. By saying it looks like a splatter of spilt milk. Something dropped out of the fridge that could be wiped away in a second.) So, the equation: N = R x fp x ne x f l x f i x fc x L N was the number of advanced civilisations in the galaxy with whom communication might be possible. R was the average annual rate at which stars were formed. The f p was the fraction of those stars with planets. The ne was the average number of those planets that have the right eco-systems for life. The f 1 was the fraction of those planets where life would actually develop. The f i was the fraction of the above planets that could develop intelligence. The f c was the fraction of those where a communicative technologically advanced civilisation could develop. And L was the lifetime of the communicative phase. Various astrophysicists had looked at all the data and decided that there must, in fact, be millions of planets in the galaxy containing life, and even more in the universe at large. And some of these were bound to have advanced life with very good technology. This of course was true. But the humans didn’t just stop there. They came up with a paradox. They said, ‘Hold on, this can’t be right. If there are this many extraterrestrial civilisations with the ability to contact us then we would know about it because they would have contacted us.’ ‘Well, that’s true, isn’t it?’ said the male whose T-shirt started this detour. ‘No,’ I said. ‘No, it’s not. Because the equation should have some other fractions in there. For instance, it should have—’ I turned and wrote on the board behind me: fcgas ‘Fraction who could give a shit about visiting or communicating with Earth.’ And then: fdsbthdr ‘Fraction who did so but the humans didn’t realise.’ It was not exactly difficult to make human students of mathematics laugh. Indeed, I had never met a sub-category of life form so desperate to laugh – but still, it felt good. For a few brief moments, it even felt slightly more than good. I felt warmth and, I don’t know, a kind of forgiveness or acceptance from these students. ‘But listen,’ I said, ‘don’t worry. Those aliens up there – they don’t know what they are missing.’ Applause. (When humans really like something they clap their hands together. It makes no sense. But when they do it on behalf of you, it warms your brain.) And then, at the end of the lecture, the staring woman came up to me. The open flower. She stood close to me. Normally, when humans stand and talk to each other they try and leave some air between them, for purposes of breathing and etiquette and claustrophobia limitation. With this one, there was very little air. ‘I phoned,’ she said, with her full mouth, in a voice I had heard before, ‘to ask about you. But you weren’t there. Did you get my message?’ ‘Oh. Oh yes. Maggie. I got the message.’ ‘You seemed on top form today.’ ‘Thank you. I thought I would do something a bit different.’ She laughed. The laughter was fake, but something about its fakeness made me excited for some unfathomable reason. ‘Are we still having our first Tuesdays of the month?’ she asked me. ‘Oh yes,’ I said, utterly confused. ‘First Tuesdays of the month will be left intact.’ ‘That’s good.’ Her voice sounded warm and menacing, like the wind that speeds across the southern waste lands of home. ‘And listen, you know that heavy conversation we had, the night before you went la-la?’ ‘La-la?’ ‘You know. Before your routine at Corpus Christi.’ ‘What did I tell you? My mind’s a little hazy about that night, that’s all.’ ‘Oh, the kind of things you can’t say in lecture halls.’ ‘Mathematical things?’ ‘Actually, correct me if I’m wrong, but mathematical things are the kind of things you can say in lecture halls.’ I wondered about this woman, this girl, and more specifically I wondered what kind of relationship she’d had with Andrew Martin. ‘Yes. Oh yes. Of course.’ This Maggie knew nothing, I told myself. ‘Anyway,’ she said, ‘I’ll see you.’ ‘Yes. Yes. See you.’ She walked away, and I watched her walk away. For a moment there was no fact in the universe except the one that related to a female human called Maggie walking away from me. I didn’t like her, but I had no idea why. The violet A little while later I was in the college café, with Ari, having a grapefruit juice while he had a sugar-laden coffee and a packet of beef-flavoured crisps. ‘How’d it go, mate?’ I tried not to catch his cow-scented breath. ‘Good. Good. I educated them about alien life. Drake’s Equation.’ ‘Bit out of your territory?’ ‘Out of my territory? What do you mean?’ ‘Subject-wise.’ ‘Mathematics is every subject.’ He screwed up his face. ‘Tell ’em about Fermi’s Paradox?’ ‘They told me, actually.’ ‘All bollocks.’ ‘You think?’ ‘Well, what the fuck would an extraterrestrial life form want to come here for?’ ‘That is pretty much what I said.’ ‘I mean, personally, I think physics tells us there is an exo-planet out there with life on it. But I don’t think we understand what we’re looking for or what form it will take. Though I think this will be the century we find it. Course, most people don’t want to find it. Even the ones who pretend they do. They don’t want to really.’ ‘Don’t they? Why not?’ He held up his hand. A signal for me to have patience while he completed the important task of chewing and then swallowing the crisps that were in his mouth. ‘’Cause it troubles people. They turn it into a joke. You’ve got the brightest physicists in the world these days, saying over and over and over, as plainly as physicists can manage, that there has to be other life out there. And other people too – and I mean thick people, mainly – you know, star sign people, the kind of people whose ancestors used to find omens in ox shit. But not just them, other people too, people who should know a lot better – you’ve got those people saying aliens are obviously made up because War of the Worlds was made up and Close Encounters of The Third Kind was made up and though they liked those things they kind of formed a prejudice in their head that aliens can only be enjoyed as fiction. Because if you believe in them as fact you are saying the thing that every unpopular scientific breakthrough in history has said.’ ‘Which is what? ‘That humans are not at the centre of things. You know, the planet is in orbit around the sun. That was a fucking hilarious joke in the 1500s, but Copernicus wasn’t a comedian. He was, apparently, the least funny man of the whole Renaissance. He made Raphael look like Richard Pryor. But he was telling the fucking truth. The planet is in orbit around the sun. But that was out there, I’m telling you. Course, he made sure he was dead by the time it was published. Let Galileo take the heat.’ ‘Right,’ I said. ‘Yes.’ As I listened, I noticed a pain begin behind my eyes, getting sharper. On the fringes of my vision there was a blur of violet. ‘Oh, and animals have nervous systems,’ Ari went on, between swigs of coffee. ‘And could feel pain. That annoyed a few people at the time, too. And some people still don’t want to believe the world is as old as it is because that would mean having to accept the truth that humans, in the day that has been the Earth, have been here for less than a minute. We’re a late-night piss in the toilet, that’s all we are.’ ‘Right,’ I said, massaging my eyelids. ‘Recorded history is just the length it takes to the flush. And now we know we don’t have free will, people are getting pissed off about that, too. So, if and when they discover aliens they’d be really pretty unsettled because then we’d have to know, once and for all, that there is nothing really unique or special about us at all.’ He sighed, and gazed intently at the interior of his empty packet of crisps. ‘So I can see why it’s easy to dismiss alien life as a joke, one for teenage boys with overactive wrists and imaginations.’ ‘What would happen,’ I asked him, ‘if an actual alien were found on Earth?’ ‘What do you think would happen?’ ‘I don’t know. That’s why I’m asking you.’ ‘Well, I think if they had the brains to get here they’d have the brains to not reveal they were alien. They could have been here. They could have arrived in things that weren’t anything like sci-fi ‘ships’. They might not have UFOs. There might be no flying involved, and no object to fail to identify. Who the fuck knows? Maybe they were just you.’ I sat upright in my chair. Alert. ‘What?’ I sat upright in my chair. Alert. ‘What?’ ‘U. As in: no FO. Unidentified. Unidentified.’ ‘Okay. But what if, somehow, they were identified. They were “I”. What if humans knew an alien was living among them?’ After asking this, all around the café appeared little wisps of violet in the air, which no one seemed to notice. Ari downed the last of his coffee, and then considered for a moment. Scratched his face with his meaty fingers. ‘Well, put it this way, I wouldn’t want to be that poor bastard.’ ‘Ari,’ I said. ‘Ari, I am that—’ Poor bastard, was what I was going to say. But I didn’t because right then, at that precise moment, there was a noise inside my head. It was a sound of the highest possible frequency and it was extremely loud. Accompanying it, and matching it for intensity, was the pain behind my eyes, which became infinitely worse. It was the most excruciating pain I’d ever experienced, and it was a pain I had no control over. Wishing it not to be there wasn’t the same thing as it not being there, and that confused me. Or it would have done, if I’d had the capacity to think beyond the pain. And I kept thinking about the pain, and the sound, and the violet. But this sharp, throbbing heat pressing behind my eyes was too much. ‘Mate, what’s up?’ I was holding my head by this point, trying to close my eyes, but they wouldn’t close. I looked at Ari’s unshaven face, then at the few other people in the café, and the girl with glasses who was standing behind the counter. Something was happening to them, and to the whole place. Everything was dissolving into a rich, varied violet, a colour more familiar to me than any other. ‘The hosts,’ I said, aloud and almost simultaneously the pain increased further. ‘Stop, oh stop, oh stop.’ ‘Man, I’m calling an ambulance,’ he said, because I was on the floor now. A swirling violet sea. ‘No.’ I fought against it. I got to my feet. The pain lessened. The ringing became a low hum. The violet faded. ‘It was nothing,’ I said. Ari laughed, nervous. ‘I’m no expert but that honestly looked like something.’ ‘It was just a headache. A flash of pain. I’ll go to the doctor and check it out.’ ‘You should. You really should.’ ‘Yes. I will.’ ‘Yes. I will.’ I sat down. An ache remained, as a reminder, for a while, along with a few ethereal wisps in the air only I could see. ‘You were going to say something. About other life.’ ‘No,’ I said quietly. ‘Pretty sure you were, man.’ ‘Yeah, well. I think I’ve forgotten.’ And after that the pain disappeared altogether, and the air lost its final trace of violet. The possibility of pain I didn’t mention anything to Isobel or Gulliver. I knew it was unwise, because I knew the pain had been a warning. And besides, even if I wanted to tell her I wouldn’t have, because Gulliver had arrived home with a bruised eye. When human skin bruises, the skin takes various shades. Greys, browns, blues, greens. Among them, a dull violet. Beautiful, petrifying violet. ‘Gulliver, what happened?’ His mother asked the question quite a few times that evening but never got a satisfactory reply. He went into the small utility room behind the kitchen and closed the door. ‘Please, Gull, come out of there,’ said his mother. ‘We need to talk about this.’ ‘Gulliver, come out of there,’ I added. Eventually he opened the door. ‘Just leave me alone.’ That ‘alone’ was said with such a hard, cold force Isobel decided it was best to grant him that wish so we stayed downstairs while he trudged up to his room. ‘I’m going to have to phone the school about this tomorrow.’ I said nothing. Of course, I would later realise this was a mistake. I should have broken my promise to Gulliver and told her that he hadn’t been going to school. But I didn’t, because it wasn’t my duty. I did have a duty, but it wasn’t to humans. Even these ones. Especially these ones. And it was a duty I was already failing to follow, as that afternoon’s warning in the café had told me. Newton, though, had a different sense of duty and he headed up three flights of stairs to be with Gulliver. Isobel didn’t know what to do, so she opened a few cupboard doors, stared into the cupboards, sighed, then closed them again. ‘Listen,’ I found myself saying, ‘he is going to have to find his own way, and make his own mistakes.’ ‘We need to find out who did that to him, Andrew. That’s what we need to do. People can’t just go around inflicting violence on human beings like that. They just can’t do that. What ethical code do you live by where you can sound so indifferent about it?’ What could I say? ‘I’m sorry. I’m not indifferent. I care for him, of course I What could I say? ‘I’m sorry. I’m not indifferent. I care for him, of course I do.’ And the terrifying thing, the absolutely awful fact I had to face, was that I was right. I did care. The warning had failed, you see. Indeed, it had had the opposite effect. That’s what starts to happen, when you know it is possible for you to feel pain you have no control over. You become vulnerable. Because the possibility of pain is where love stems from. And that, for me, was very bad news indeed. Sloping roofs (and other ways to deal with the rain) and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, – William Shakespeare, Hamlet I couldn’t sleep. Of course I couldn’t. I had a whole universe to worry about. And I kept thinking about the pain, and the sound, and the violet. On top of that, it was raining. I decided to leave Isobel in bed and go and talk with Newton. I headed slowly downstairs, with my hands over my ears, trying to cancel out the sound of falling cloud water drumming against the windows. To my disappointment Newton was sleeping soundly in his basket. On my return upstairs I noticed something else. The air was cooler than it should have been, and the coolness was coming from above rather than below. This went against the order of things. I thought of his bruised eye, and I thought further back. I headed up towards the attic and noticed that everything there was exactly as it should be. The computer, the Dark Matter posters, the random array of socks – everything, that was, except Gulliver himself. A piece of paper floated towards me, carried on the breeze from the open window. On it were two words. I’m sorry. I looked at the window. Outside was the night and the shivering stars of this most alien, yet most familiar galaxy. Somewhere beyond this sky was home. I realised I could now get back there if I wanted. I could just finish my task and be back in my painless world. The window sloped in line with the roof, which like so many roofs here was designed to usher away the rain. It was easy enough for me to climb out of but for to usher away the rain. It was easy enough for me to climb out of but for Gulliver it must have been quite an exertion. The difficult thing for me was the rain itself. It was relentless. Skin-soaking. I saw him sitting on the edge, next to the gutter rail, with his knees pulled into his chest. He looked cold and bedraggled. And seeing him there I saw him not as a special entity, an exotic collection of protons, electrons and neutrons, but as a – using the human term – as a person. And I felt, I don’t know, connected with him. Not in the quantum sense in which everything was connected to everything else, and in which every atom spoke to and negotiated with every other atom. No. This was on another level. A level far, far harder to understand. Can I end his life? I started walking towards him. Not easy, given the human feet and 45-degree angle and the wet slate – sleek quartz and muscovite – on which I was relying. When I was getting close he turned around and saw me. ‘What are you doing?’ he asked. He was frightened. That was the main thing I noticed. ‘I was about to ask you the same thing.’ ‘Dad, just go away.’ What he was saying made sense. I mean, I could have just left him there. I could have escaped the rain, the terrible sensation of that falling water on my thin non-vascular skin, and gone inside. It was then I had to face why I was really out there. ‘No,’ I said, to my own confusion. ‘I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to go away.’ I slipped a little. A tile came unstuck, slid, fell and smashed to the ground. The smash woke Newton, who started barking. Gulliver’s eyes widened, then his head jerked away. His whole body seemed full of nervous intention. ‘Don’t do it,’ I said. He let go of something. It landed in the gutter. The small plastic cylinder that had contained the twenty-eight diazepam tablets. Now empty. I stepped closer. I had read enough human literature to realise that suicide was a real option, here, on Earth. Yet again I wondered why this should have bothered me. I was becoming mad. Losing my rationality. If Gulliver wanted to kill himself then, logically, that solved a major problem. And I should just stand back and let it happen. And I should just stand back and let it happen. ‘Gulliver, listen to me. Don’t jump. Trust me, you’re nowhere near high enough to guarantee that you’ll kill yourself.’ This was true, but as far as I could calculate there was still a very good chance of him falling and dying on impact. In which instance, there would be nothing I could do to help him. Injuries could always be healed. Death meant death. A zero squared was still a zero. ‘I remember swimming with you,’ he said, ‘when I was eight. When we were in France. Can you remember, that night you taught me how to play dominoes?’ He looked back at me, wanting to see a recognition I couldn’t give him. It was hard to see his bruised eye in this light; there was so much darkness across his face he might as well have been all bruise. ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Of course I remember that.’ ‘Liar! You don’t remember.’ ‘Listen, Gulliver, let’s go inside. Let’s talk about this indoors. If you still want to kill yourself I’ll take you to a higher building.’ Gulliver didn’t seem to be listening, as I kept stepping on the slippery slate towards him. ‘That’s the last good memory I have,’ he said. It sounded sincere. ‘Come on, that can’t be true.’ ‘Do you have any idea what it’s like? To be your son?’ ‘No. I don’t.’ He pointed to his eye. ‘This. This is what it’s like.’ ‘Gulliver, I’m sorry.’ ‘Do you know what it’s like to feel stupid all the time?’ ‘You’re not stupid.’ I was still standing. The human way would have been to shuffle down on my backside, but that would have taken too much time. So I kept taking tentative steps on the slate, leaning back just enough, in continuous negotiation with gravity. ‘I’m stupid. I’m nothing.’ ‘No, Gulliver, you’re not. You’re something. You’re—’ He wasn’t listening. The diazepam was taking hold of him. ‘How many tablets did you take?’ I asked. ‘All of them?’ I was nearly at him, my hand was almost within grasping distance of his shoulder as his eyes closed and he disappeared into sleep, or prayer. Another tile came loose. I slipped on to my side, losing my footing on the rain-greased tiles until I was left hanging on to the gutter rail. I could have easily climbed back up. That wasn’t the problem. The problem was that Gulliver was now tilting forward. ‘Gulliver, wait! Wake up! Wake up, Gulliver!’ ‘Gulliver, wait! Wake up! Wake up, Gulliver!’ The tilt gained momentum. ‘No!’ He fell, and I fell with him. First internally, a kind of emotional falling, a silent howl into an abyss, and then physically. I sped through the air with a dreadful velocity. I broke my legs. So that was my intention. Let the legs take the pain, and not the head, because I would need my head. But the pain was immense. For a moment I worried they wouldn’t reheal. It was only the sight of Gulliver lying totally unconscious on the ground a few metres away that gave me focus. Blood leaked from his ear. To heal him I knew I would first of all need to heal myself. And it happened. Simply wishing was enough, if you wished hard enough, with the right kind of intelligence. That said, cell regeneration and bone reconstruction still took a lot of energy, especially as I was losing a lot of blood and had multiple fractures. But the pain diminished as a strange, intense fatigue took over me and gravity tried to grip me to the ground. My head hurt, but not as a result of the fall; from the exertion involved in my physical restoration. I stood up dizzily. I managed to move towards where Gulliver lay, the horizontal ground now sloping more than the roof. ‘Gulliver. Come on. Can you hear me? Gulliver?’ I could have called for help, I knew that. But help meant an ambulance and a hospital. Help meant humans grasping around in the dark of their own medical ignorance. Help meant delay and a death I was meant to approve of, but couldn’t. ‘Gulliver?’ There was no pulse. He was dead. I must have been seconds too late. I could already detect the first tiny descent in his body temperature. Rationally, I should have resigned myself to this fact. And yet. I had read a lot of Isobel’s work and so I knew that the whole of human history was full of people who tried against the odds. Some succeeded, most failed, but that hadn’t stopped them. Whatever else you could say about these particular primates, they could be determined. And they could hope. Oh yes, they could hope. And hope was often irrational. It made no sense. If it had made sense it would have been called, well, sense. The other thing about hope was that it took effort, and I had never been used to effort. At home, nothing had been an effort. That was the whole point of home, the comfort of a perfectly effortless existence. Yet there I was. Hoping. Not that I was standing there, passively, just wishing him better from a distance. Of course not. I placed my left hand – my gift hand – to his heart, and I began to work. The thing with feathers It was exhausting. I thought of binary stars. A red giant and a white dwarf, side by side, the life force of one being sucked into that of the other. His death was a fact I was convinced I could disprove, or dissuade. But death wasn’t a white dwarf. It was a good bit beyond that. It was a black hole. And once you stepped past that event horizon, you were in very difficult territory. You are not dead. Gulliver, you are not dead. I kept at it, because I knew what life was, I understood its nature, its character, its stubborn insistence. Life, especially human life, was an act of defiance. It was never meant to be, and yet it existed in an incredible number of places across a near-infinite amount of solar systems. There was no such thing as impossible. I knew that, because I also knew that everything was impossible, and so the only possibilities in life were impossibilities. A chair could stop being a chair at any moment. That was quantum physics. And you could manipulate atoms if you knew how to talk to them. You are not dead, you are not dead. I felt terrible. Waves of deep-level pained, bone-scorching effort tore through me like solar flares. And yet he still lay there. His face, I noticed for the first time, looking like his mother. Serene, egg-fragile, precious. A light came on inside the house. Isobel must have woken, from the sound of Newton’s barking if nothing else, but I wasn’t conscious of that. I was just aware that Gulliver was suddenly illuminated and, shortly after, there was the faintest flicker of a pulse beneath my hand. Hope. ‘Gulliver, Gulliver, Gulliver—’ Another pulse. Stronger. A defiant drumbeat of life. A back-beat, waiting for melody. Duh-dum. And again, and again, and again. He was alive. His lips twitched, his bruised eyes moved like an egg about to hatch. One opened. So did the other. It was the eyes, on Earth, that mattered. You saw the person, and the life inside them, if you saw the eyes. And I saw him, this messed-up, sensitive boy and felt, for a moment, the exhausted wonder of a father. It should have been a moment to savour, but it wasn’t. I was being flooded with pain, and violet. I could feel myself about to collapse on to the glossy wet ground. Footsteps behind me. And that was the last thing I heard before the darkness arrived to make its claim, along with remembered poetry, as Emily Dickinson shyly came towards me through the violet and whispered in my ear. Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul, And sings the tune without the words, And never stops at all. Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens I was back at home, on Vonnadoria, and it was exactly how it had always been. And I was exactly how I had always been, among them, the hosts, feeling no pain and no fear. Our beautiful, warless world, where I could be entranced by the purest mathematics for all eternity. .Any human who arrived here, gazing at our violet landscapes, might well have believed they had entered Heaven But what happened in Heaven? What did you do there? After a while, didn’t you crave flaws? Love and lust and misunderstandings, and maybe even a little violence to liven things up? Didn’t light need shade? Didn’t it? Maybe it didn’t. Maybe I was missing the point. Maybe the point was to exist with an absence of pain. Yes, to exist with an absence of pain. Yes, maybe that was the only aim you needed in life. It certainly had been, but what happened if you’d never required that aim because you were born after that goal had been met? I was younger than the hosts. I did not share their appreciation of just how lucky I was. Not any more. Not even in a dream. In-between I woke up. On Earth. But I was so weak I was returning to my original state. I had heard about this. Indeed, I had swallowed a word capsule about it. Rather than allow you to die your body would return to its original state, because the amount of extra energy deployed to be someone else would more usefully serve to preserve your life. And that was all the gifts were there for, really. Self-preservation. The protection of eternity. Which was fine, in theory. In theory, it was a great idea. But the only problem was that this was Earth. And my original state wasn’t equipped for the air here, or the gravity, or the face-to-face contact. I didn’t want Isobel to see me. It just could not happen. And so, as soon as I felt my atoms itch and tingle, warm and shift, I told Isobel to do what she was already doing: looking after Gulliver. And as she crouched down, with her back to me, I got to my feet, which at this point were recognisably human-shaped. Then I shifted myself – midway between two contrasting forms – across the back garden. Luckily the garden was large and dark, with lots of flowers and shrubs and trees to hide behind. So I did. I hid among the beautiful flowers. And I saw Isobel looking around, even as she was calling for an ambulance for Gulliver. ‘Andrew!’ she said at one point, as Gulliver got to his feet. She even ran into the garden to have a look. But I stayed still. ‘Where have you disappeared to?’ My lungs began to burn. I needed more nitrogen. It would have taken only one word in my native tongue. Home. The one the hosts were primed to hear, and I would be back there. So why didn’t I say it? Because I hadn’t finished my task? No. It wasn’t that. I was never going to finish my task. That was the education this night had brought me. So why? Why was I choosing risk and pain over their opposites? What had happened to me? What was wrong? Newton, now, came out into the garden. He trotted along, sniffing the plants and flowers until he sensed me standing there. I expected him to bark and draw attention, but he didn’t. He just stared at me, his eyes shining blank circles, and seemed to know exactly who it was, standing behind the juniper bushes. But he stayed quiet. He was a good dog. And I loved him. I can’t do it. We know. There is no point in doing it anyway. There is every point. I don’t believe Isobel and Gulliver should be harmed. We believe you have been corrupted. I haven’t. I have gained more knowledge. That is all that has happened. No. You have been infected by them. Infected? Infected? With what? With emotion. No. I haven’t. That is not true. It is true. Listen, emotions have a logic. Without emotions humans wouldn’t care for each other, and if they didn’t care for each other the species would have died out. To care for others is self-preservation. You care for someone and they care for you. You are speaking like one of them. You are not a human. You are one of us. We are one. I know I am not a human. We think you need to come home. No. You must come home. I never had a family. We are your family. No. It isn’t the same. We want you home. I have to ask to come home and I am not going to. You can interfere with my mind but you can’t control it. We will see. Two weeks in the Dordogne and a box of dominoes The next day we were in the living room. Me and Isobel. Newton was upstairs with Gulliver, who was now asleep. We had checked on him but Newton was staying there, on guard. ‘How are you?’ asked Isobel. ‘It was not death,’ I said. ‘For I stood up.’ ‘You saved his life,’ said Isobel. ‘I don’t think so. I didn’t even have to do CPR. The doctor said he had very minor injuries.’ ‘I don’t care what the doctor says. He jumped from the roof. That could have killed him. Why didn’t you shout for me?’ ‘I did.’ It was a lie, obviously, but the whole framework was a lie. The belief that I was her husband. It was all fiction. ‘I did shout for you.’ ‘You could have killed yourself.’ (I have to admit that humans waste a lot of their time – almost all of it – with hypothetical stuff. I could be rich. I could be famous. I could have been hit by that bus. I could have been born with fewer moles and bigger breasts. I could have spent more of my youth learning foreign languages. They must exercise the conditional tense more than any other known life form.) ‘But I didn’t kill myself. I am alive. Let’s concentrate on that.’ ‘What happened to your tablets? They were in the cupboard.’ ‘I threw them away.’ This was a lie, obviously. The unclear thing was who I was protecting? Isobel? Gulliver? Myself? ‘Why? Why would you throw them away?’ ‘I didn’t think it was a good idea, to have them lying around. You know, given his condition.’ ‘But they’re diazepam. That’s valium. You can’t overdose on valium, you’d need a thousand.’ ‘No. I know that.’ I was drinking a cup of tea. I actually enjoyed tea. It was so much better than coffee. It tasted like comfort. Isobel nodded. She too was drinking tea. The tea seemed to be making things Isobel nodded. She too was drinking tea. The tea seemed to be making things better. It was a hot drink made of leaves, used in times of crisis as a means of restoring normality. ‘Do you know what they told me?’ she said. ‘No. What? What did they tell you?’ ‘They told me he could stay in.’ ‘Right.’ ‘It was up to me. I had to say if I thought he was a suicide risk or not. And I said I thought he would be more of a risk in there than out here. They said if he tried anything like this again then there’d be no choice about it. He’d be admitted, and they’d watch him.’ ‘Oh. Well, we’ll watch him. That’s what I say. That hospital is full of mad people. People who think they’re from other planets. Stuff like that.’ She smiled a sad smile, and blew a brown tide of ripples across the surface of her drink. ‘Yes. Yes. We’ll have to.’ I tried to understand something. ‘It’s me, isn’t it? It was my fault, for that day I didn’t wear clothes.’ Something about this question switched the mood. Isobel’s face hardened. ‘Andrew, do you really think this was about one day? About your breakdown?’ ‘Oh,’ I said, which I knew wasn’t in context. But I had nothing else to say. ‘Oh’ was always the word I resorted to, the one that filled empty spaces. It was verbal tea. The ‘oh’ should have really been a ‘no’, because I didn’t think this was about one day. I thought it was about thousands of days, most of which I hadn’t been there to observe. And so an ‘oh’ was more appropriate. ‘This wasn’t about one event. This was about everything. It’s not obviously solely your fault but you haven’t really been there, have you, Andrew? For all his life, or at least since we moved back to Cambridge, you’ve just not been there.’ I remembered something he’d told me on the roof. ‘What about France?’ ‘What?’ ‘I taught him dominoes. I swam with him in a swimming pool. In France. The country. France.’ She frowned, confused. ‘France? What? The Dordogne? Two weeks in the Dordogne and a box of bloody dominoes. Is that your “Get Out of Jail Free” card? Is that fatherhood?’ ‘No. I don’t know. I was just giving a . . . a solid example of what he was like.’ ‘He?’ ‘I mean I. What I was like.’ ‘You’ve been there on holiday. Yes. Yes you have. Unless they were working holidays. Come on, you remember Sydney! And Boston! And Seoul! And Turin! And, and, Düsseldorf!’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said, staring at the unread books on the shelves like unlived memories. ‘I remember them vividly. Of course.’ ‘We hardly saw you. And when we did see you, you were always so stressed about the lecture you were going to give or the people you were going to meet. And all those rows we had. We have. Until, you know, you got ill. And got better. Come on, Andrew, you know what I’m saying. This isn’t breaking news, is it?’ ‘No. Not at all. So, where else have I failed?’ ‘You haven’t failed. It’s not an academic paper to be assessed by your peers. It’s not success or failure. It’s our life. I’m not wrapping it in judgemental language. I’m just trying to tell you the objective truth.’ ‘I just want to know. Tell me. Tell me things I’ve done. Or haven’t done.’ She toyed with her silver necklace. ‘Well, come on. It’s always been the same. Between the ages of two and four you weren’t back home in time for a single bath or bedtime story. You’d fly off the handle about anything that got in the way of you and your work. Or if I ever came close to mentioning that I had sacrificed my career for this family – at that time when I had been making real sacrifices – you wouldn’t even so much as postpone a book deadline. I’d be shot down in flames.’ ‘I know. I’m sorry,’ I said, thinking of her novel, Wider Than the Sky. ‘I’ve been terrible. I have. I think you would be better off without me. I think, sometimes, that I should leave and never come back.’ ‘Don’t be childish. You sound younger than Gulliver.’ ‘I’m being serious. I have behaved badly. I sometimes think it would be better if I went and never returned. Ever.’ This threw her. She had her hands on her hips but her glare softened. She took a big breath. ‘I need you here. You know I need you.’ ‘Why? What do I give to this relationship? I don’t understand.’ She clenched her eyes shut. Whispered, ‘That was amazing.’ ‘What?’ ‘What you did there. Out on the roof. It was amazing.’ She then made the most complex facial expression I have ever seen on a human. A kind of frustrated scorn, tinged with sympathy, which slowly softened into a deep, wide humour, culminating in forgiveness and something I couldn’t quite recognise, but which I thought might have been love. ‘What’s happened to you?’ She said it as a whisper, nothing more than a ‘What’s happened to you?’ She said it as a whisper, nothing more than a structured piece of breath. ‘What? Nothing. Nothing has happened to me. Well, a mental breakdown. But I’m over that. Other than that – nothing.’ I said this flippantly, trying to make her smile. She smiled, but sadness quickly claimed her. She looked up to the ceiling. I was beginning to understand these wordless forms of communication. ‘I’ll talk to him,’ I said, feeling kind of solid and authoritative. Kind of real. Kind of human. ‘I’ll talk to him.’ ‘You don’t have to.’ ‘I know,’ I said. And I stood up, again to help when I was supposed to hurt. Social networking Essentially, social networking on Earth was quite limited. Unlike on Vonnadoria, the brain synchronisation technology wasn’t there, so subscribers couldn’t communicate telepathically with each other as part of a true hive mind. Nor could they step into each other’s dreams and have a walk around, tasting imagined delicacies in exotic moonscapes. On Earth, social networking generally involved sitting down at a non-sentient computer and typing words about needing a coffee and reading about other people needing a coffee, while forgetting to actually make a coffee. It was the news show they had been waiting for. It was the show where the news could be all about them. But on the plus side, human computer networks, I discovered, were preposterously easy to hack into as all their security systems were based on prime numbers. And so I hacked into Gulliver’s computer and changed the name of every single person on Facebook who had bullied Gulliver to ‘I Am the Cause of Shame’, and blocked them from posting anything with the word ‘Gulliver’ in it, and gave each of them a computer virus which I dubbed ‘The Flea’ after a lovely poem. This virus ensured the only messages they would ever be able to send were ones that contained the words ‘I am hurt and so I hurt’. On Vonnadoria I had never done anything so vindictive. Nor had I ever felt quite so satisfied. Forever is composed of nows We went to the park to walk Newton. Parks were the most common destination on dog walks. A piece of nature – grass, flowers, trees – that was not quite allowed to be truly natural. Just as dogs were thwarted wolves, parks were thwarted forests. Humans loved both, possibly because humans were, well, thwarted. The flowers were beautiful. Flowers, after love, must have been the best advert planet Earth had going for it. ‘It doesn’t make sense,’ said Gulliver, as we sat down on the bench. ‘What doesn’t?’ We watched Newton sniffing the flowers, livelier than ever. ‘I was fine. No damage. Even my eye’s better.’ ‘You were lucky.’ ‘Dad, before I went out on the roof, I’d had twenty-eight diazepam.’ ‘You’d need more.’ He looked at me, angry for saying this, as if I was humiliating him. Using knowledge against him. ‘Your mum told me that,’ I added. ‘I didn’t know that.’ ‘I didn’t want you to save me.’ ‘I didn’t save you. You were just lucky. But I really think you should ignore feelings like that. That was a moment in your life. You have a lot more days to live. About twenty-four thousand more days to live, probably. That’s a lot of moments. You could do many great things in that time. You could read a lot of poetry.’ ‘You don’t like poetry. That’s one of the few facts I know about you.’ ‘It’s growing on me . . . Listen,’ I said, ‘don’t kill yourself. Don’t ever kill yourself. Just, that’s my advice, don’t kill yourself.’ Gulliver took something out of his pocket and put it in his mouth. It was a cigarette. He lit it. I asked if I could try it. Gulliver seemed troubled by this but handed it over. I sucked on the filter and brought the smoke into my lungs. And then I coughed. ‘What’s the point of this?’ I asked Gulliver. ‘What’s the point of this?’ I asked Gulliver. He shrugged. ‘It’s an addictive substance with a high fatality rate. I thought there would be a point.’ I handed the cigarette back to Gulliver. ‘Thanks,’ he mumbled, still confused. ‘Don’t worry about it,’ I said. ‘It’s fine.’ He took another drag, and suddenly realised it wasn’t doing anything for him either. He flicked the cigarette in a steep arc towards the grass. ‘If you want,’ I said, ‘we could play dominoes when we get home. I bought a box this morning.’ ‘No thanks.’ ‘Or we could go to the Dordogne.’ ‘What?’ ‘Go swimming.’ He shook his head. ‘You need some more tablets.’ ‘Yes. Maybe. You ate all mine.’ I tried to smile, playfully, and try some more Earth humour. ‘You fucker!’ There was a long silence. We watched Newton sniffing around the circumference of a tree. Twice. A million suns imploded. And then Gulliver came out with it. ‘You don’t know what it’s been like,’ he said. ‘I’ve got all this expectation on me because I’m your son. My teachers read your books. And they look at me like some bruised apple that’s fallen off the great Andrew Martin tree. You know, the posh boy who got expelled from his boarding school. The one who set stuff on fire. Whose parents gave up on him. Not that I’m bothered about that now. But even in the holidays you were never around. You were always somewhere else. Or just making everything tense and horrible with Mum. It’s just shit. You should have just done the right thing and got divorced years ago. You’ve not got anything in common.’ I thought about all this. And didn’t know what to say. Cars passed by on the road behind us. The sound was very melancholy somehow, like the bass rumble of a sleeping Bazadean. ‘What was your band called?’ ‘The Lost,’ he said. A leaf fell and landed on my lap. It was dead and brown. I held it and, quite out of character, felt a strange empathy. Maybe it was because now I was empathising with humans I could empathise with pretty much anything. Too much Emily Dickinson, that was the problem. Emily Dickinson was making me human. But not that human. There was a dull ache in my head and a small weight of tiredness in my eyes as the leaf became green. I brushed it away quickly, but it was too late. ‘What just happened?’ Gulliver asked, staring at the leaf as it floated away on the breeze. I tried to ignore him. He asked again. ‘Nothing happened to the leaf,’ I said. He forgot about the leaf he might have seen the moment he saw two teenage girls and a boy his own age walking on the road that ran behind the park. The girls were laughing into their hands at the sight of us. I have realised that, essentially, there are two broad categories of human laughter, and this was not the good kind. The boy was the boy I had seen on Gulliver’s Facebook page. Theo “The Fucking Business” Clarke. Gulliver shrank. ‘It’s the Martin Martians! Freaks!’ Gulliver cowered lower on the bench, crippled with shame. I turned around, assessed Theo’s physical structure and dynamic potential. ‘My son could beat you into the ground,’ I shouted. ‘He could flatten your face into a more attractive geometric form.’ ‘Fuck, Dad,’ said Gulliver, ‘what are you doing? He’s the one who fucked up my face.’ I looked at him. He was a black hole. The violence was all inward. It was time for him to push some the other way. ‘Come on,’ I said, ‘you’re a human. It’s time to act like one.’ Violence ‘No,’ said Gulliver. But it was too late. Theo was crossing the road. ‘Yeah, you’re a comedian now, are you?’ he said as he swaggered towards us. ‘It would be fucking amusing to see you lose to my fucking son, if that’s what you fucking mean,’ I said. ‘Yeah, well, my dad’s a Taekwondo teacher. He taught me how to fight.’ ‘Well, Gulliver’s father is a mathematician. So he wins.’ ‘Yeah right.’ ‘You will lose,’ I told the boy, and I made sure the words went all the way down and stayed there, like rocks in a shallow pond. Theo laughed, and jumped with troubling ease over the low stone wall that bordered the park, with the girls following. This boy, Theo, was not as tall as Gulliver but more strongly built. He was almost devoid of neck and his eyes were so close together he was borderline cyclopic. He was walking backwards and forwards on the grass in front of us, warming up by punching and kicking the air. Gulliver was as pale as milk. ‘Gulliver,’ I told him, ‘you fell off a roof yesterday. That boy is not a forty-foot drop. There is nothing to him. No depth. You know how he is going to fight.’ ‘Yes,’ said Gulliver. ‘He’s going to fight well.’ ‘But you, you’ve got surprise on your side. You aren’t scared of anything. All you’ve got to do is realise that this Theo symbolises everything you’ve ever hated. He is me. He is bad weather. He is the primitive soul of the Internet. He is the injustice of fate. I am asking, in other words, for you to fight him like you fight in your sleep. Lose everything. Lose all shame and consciousness and beat him. Because you can.’ ‘No,’ said Gulliver, ‘I can’t.’ I lowered my voice, conjured the gifts. ‘You can. He has the same bio- chemical ingredients inside him as you do, but with less impressive neural activity.’ I saw that Gulliver looked confused, so I tapped the side of my head activity.’ I saw that Gulliver looked confused, so I tapped the side of my head and explained. ‘It’s all about the oscillations.’ Gulliver stood up. I clipped the lead to Newton’s collar. He whined, sensing the atmosphere. I watched Gulliver walk over the grass. Nervous, tight-bodied, as if being dragged by an invisible chord. The two girls were chewing something they didn’t plan to swallow, and were giggling excitedly. Theo too was looking thrilled. Some humans not only liked violence, but craved it, I realised. Not because they wanted pain, but because they already had pain and wanted to be distracted away from that kind of pain with a lesser kind. And then Theo hit Gulliver. And he hit him again. Both times in the face, sending Gulliver staggering backwards. Newton growled, seeking involvement, but I kept him where he was. ‘You are fucking nothing,’ said Theo, raising his foot fast through the air to Gulliver’s chest. Gulliver grabbed the leg, and Theo hopped for a while, or at least long enough to look ridiculous. Gulliver looked at me through the still air in silence. Then Theo was on the ground and Gulliver let him stand up before the switch flicked and he went wild, punching away as if trying to rid himself of his own body, as if it were something that could be shaken away. And pretty soon the other boy was bleeding and he fell back on the grass, his head momentarily tilting back and touching down on a rose bush. He sat up and dabbed his face with his fingers and saw the blood and looked at it as if it were a message he’d never expected to receive. ‘All right, Gulliver,’ I said, ‘It’s time to go home.’ I went over to Theo. I crouched down. ‘You are done now, do you understand?’ Theo understood. The girls were silent but still chewed, if only at half-speed. Cow-speed. We walked out of the park. Gulliver hardly had a scratch. ‘How are you feeling?’ ‘I hurt him.’ ‘Yes. How does that make you feel? Was it cathartic?’ He shrugged. The trace of a smile hid somewhere inside his lips. It frightened me, how close violence is to the civilised surface of a human being. It wasn’t the violence itself that was the worry, it was the amount of effort they’d gone to to conceal it. A homo sapiens was a primitive hunter who had woken each day with the knowledge he could kill. And now, the equivalent knowledge was only that he would wake up each day and buy something. So it was important, for Gulliver, to release what he only released in sleep out into the waking world. Gulliver, to release what he only released in sleep out into the waking world. ‘Dad, you’re not yourself, are you?’ he said, before we got back. ‘No,’ I said. ‘Not really.’ I expected another question but none came. The taste of her skin I was not Andrew. I was them. And we woke, and the still light bedroom was clotted with violet, and though my head didn’t hurt exactly, it felt extremely tight, as though my skull was a fist and my brain was the bar of soap it contained. I tried switching off the light, but the dark didn’t work. The violet stayed, expanding and leaking across reality like spilt ink. ‘Get away,’ I urged the hosts. ‘Get away.’ But they had a hold on me. You. If you are reading this. You had a terrible hold. And I was losing myself, and I knew this because I turned over in bed and I could see Isobel in the dark, facing away from me. I could see the shape of her, half under the duvet. My hand touched the back of her neck. I felt nothing towards her. We felt nothing towards her. We didn’t even see her as Isobel. She was simply a human. The way, to a human, a cow or a chicken or a microbe is simply a cow or a chicken or a microbe. As we touched her bare neck, we gained the reading. It was all we needed. She was asleep, and all we had to do was stop her heart from beating. It was really very easy. We moved our hand slightly lower, felt the heart beating through her ribs. The movement of our hand woke her slightly, and she turned, sleepily, and said with her eyes still closed, ‘I love you.’ The ‘you’ was a singular one, and it was a call to me or the me-Andrew she thought I was, and it was then that I managed to defeat them, become a me and not a we, and the thought that she had just escaped death by such a narrow margin made me realise the intensity of my feelings towards her. ‘What’s the matter?’ I couldn’t tell her, so I kissed her instead. Kissing is what humans do when words have reached a place they can’t escape from. It is a switch to another language. The kiss was an act of defiance, maybe of war. You can’t touch us, is what the kiss said. ‘I love you,’ I told her, and as I smelt her skin, I knew I had never wanted anyone or anything more than I wanted her, but the craving for her was a anyone or anything more than I wanted her, but the craving for her was a terrifying one now. And I needed to keep underlining my point. ‘I love you, I love you, I love you.’ And after that, after the awkward shuffling away of that last thin layer of clothes, words retreated to the sounds they once were. We had sex. A happy entanglement of warm limbs and warmer love. A physical and psychological merging that conjured a kind of inner light, a bio-emotional phosphorescence, that was overwhelming in its gorgeousness. I wondered why they weren’t prouder of it. Of this magic. I wondered why, if they had to have flags, why they didn’t just opt for one with a picture of sex. Afterwards, I held her and she held me and I gently kissed her forehead as the wind beat against the window. She fell asleep. I watched her, in the dark. I wanted to protect her and keep her safe. Then I got out of bed. I had something to do. I am staying here. You can’t. You have gifts not made for that planet. Humans will become suspicious. Well then, I want to be disconnected. We cannot allow that. Yes, you can. You have to. The gifts are not compulsory. That is the point. I cannot allow my mind to be interfered with. We were not the ones interfering with your mind. We were trying to restore it. Isobel doesn’t know anything about the proof. She doesn’t know. Just leave her. Leave us. Leave us all. Please. Nothing will happen. You do not want immortality? You do not want the chance to return home or to visit anywhere else in the universe other than the lonely planet on which you now reside? That is right. You do not want the chance to take other forms? To return to your own original nature? No. I want to be a human. Or as close to being a human as it is possible for me to be. No one in all our histories has ever asked to lose the gifts. Well, it is a fact you must now update. You do realise what this means? Yes. You will be trapped in a body that cannot regenerate itself. You will grow old. You will get diseases. You will feel pain, and for ever know – unlike the rest of the ignorant species you want to belong to – that you have chosen that suffering. You have brought it on yourself. Yes. I know that. Very well. You have been given the ultimate punishment. And it makes it no less a punishment for having been asked for. You have now been disconnected. The gifts are gone. You are now human. If you declare you are from another planet you will never have proof. They will believe you are insane. And it makes no difference to us. It is easy to fill your place. You won’t fill my place. It is a waste of resources. There is no point to the mission. Hello? Are you listening? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Hello? The rhythm of life Love is what the humans are all about but they don’t understand it. If they understood it, then it would disappear. All I know is that it’s a frightening thing. And humans are very frightened of it, which is why they have quiz shows. To take their mind off it and think of something else. Love is scary because it pulls you in with an intense force, a supermassive black hole which looks like nothing from the outside but from the inside challenges every reasonable thing you know. You lose yourself, like I lost myself, in the warmest of annihilations. It makes you do stupid things – things that defy all logic. The opting for anguish over calm, for mortality over eternity, and for Earth over home. I awoke feeling terrible. My eyes itched with tiredness. My back was stiff. There was a pain in my knee, and I could hear a mild ringing. Noises that belonged below a planet’s surface were coming from my stomach. Overall, the sensation I was feeling was one of conscious decay. In short, I felt human. I felt forty-three years old. And now I had made the decision to stay I was full of anxiety. This anxiety was not just about my physical fate. It was the knowledge that at some point in the future the hosts were going to send someone else. And what would I be able to do, now that I had no more gifts than the average human? It was a worry, at first. But that gradually faded as time went by and nothing happened. Lesser worries began to occupy my mind. For instance, would I be able to cope with this life? What had once seemed exotic began to feel rather monotonous as things settled into a rhythm. It was the archetypal human one which went: wash, breakfast, check the Internet, work, lunch, work, dinner, talk, watch television, read a book, go to bed, pretend to be asleep, then actually sleep. Belonging as I did to a species which had only ever really known one day, there was initially something quite exciting about having any kind of rhythm at all. But now I was stuck here for good I began to resent humans’ lack of imagination. I believed they should have tried to add a little more variety into proceedings. I mean, this was the species whose main excuse for not doing something was ‘if only I had more time’. Perfectly valid until you realised they did have more time. Not eternity, granted, but they had tomorrow. And the day after tomorrow. And the day after the day after tomorrow. In fact I would have had to write ‘the day after’ thirty thousand times before a final ‘tomorrow’ in order to illustrate the amount of time on a human’s hands. The problem lying behind the lack of human fulfilment was a shortage not just of time but of imagination. They found a day that worked for them and then stuck to it, and repeated it, at least between Monday and Friday. Even if it didn’t work for them – as was usually the case – they stuck to it anyway. Then they’d alter things a bit and do something a little bit more fun on Saturday and Sunday. One initial proposal I wanted to put to them was to swap things over. For instance, have five fun days and two not-fun days. That way – call me a mathematical genius – they would have more fun. But as things stood, there weren’t even two fun days. They only had Saturdays, because Mondays were a little bit too close to Sundays for Sunday’s liking, as if Monday were a collapsed star in the week’s solar system, with an excessive gravitational pull. In other words one seventh of human days worked quite well. The other six weren’t very good, and five of those were roughly the same day stuck on repeat. The real difficulty, for me, was mornings. Mornings were hard on Earth. You woke up tireder than when you went to sleep. Your back ached. Your neck ached. Your chest felt tight with anxiety that came from being mortal. And then, on top of all that, you had to do so much before the day even started. The main problem was the stuff to do in order to be presentable. A human, typically, has to do the following things. He or she will get out of bed, sigh, stretch, go to the toilet, shower, shampoo their hair, condition their hair, wash their face, shave, deodorise, brush their teeth (with fluoride!), dry their hair, brush their hair, put on face cream, apply make-up, check everything in the mirror, choose clothes based on the weather and the situation, put on those clothes, check everything again in the mirror – and that’s just what happens before breakfast. It’s a wonder they ever get out of bed at all. But they do, repeatedly, thousands of times each. And not only that – they do it by themselves, with no technology to help them. Maybe a little electrical activity in their toothbrushes and hairdryers, but nothing more than that. And all to reduce body odour, and hairs, and halitosis, and shame. Teenagers Another thing adding force to the relentless gravity dogging this planet was all the worry that Isobel still had for Gulliver. She was pinching her bottom lip quite a lot, and staring vacantly out of windows. I had bought Gulliver a bass guitar, but the music he played was so gloomy it gave the house an unceasing soundtrack of despair. ‘I just keep thinking of things,’ said Isobel, when I told her that all this worry was unhealthy. ‘When he got expelled from school. He wanted it. He wanted to be expelled. It was a sort of academic suicide. I just worry, you know. He’s always been so bad at connecting with people. I can remember the first ever report he had at nursery school. It said he had resisted making any attachments. I mean, I know he’s had friends, but he’s always found it difficult. Shouldn’t there be girlfriends by now? He’s a good-looking boy.’ ‘Are friends so important? What’s the point of them?’ ‘Connections, Andrew. Think of Ari. Friends are how we connect to the world. I just worry, sometimes, that he’s not fixed here. To the world. To life. He reminds me of Angus.’ Angus, apparently, was her brother. He had ended his own life in his early thirties because of financial worries. I felt sad when she told me that. Sad for all the humans who find it easy to feel ashamed about things. They were not the only life form in the universe to have suicide, but they were one of the most enthusiastic about it. I wondered if I should tell her that he wasn’t going to school. I decided I should. ‘What?’ Isobel asked. But she had heard. ‘Oh God. So what’s he been doing?’ ‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘Just walking around, I think.’ ‘Walking around?’ ‘When I saw him he was walking.’ She was angry now, and the music Gulliver was playing (quite loudly, by this point) wasn’t helping. And Newton was making me feel guilty with his eyes. ‘Listen, Isobel, let’s just—’ ‘Listen, Isobel, let’s just—’ It was too late. Isobel raced up the stairs. The inevitable row ensued. I could only hear Isobel’s voice. Gulliver’s was too quiet and low, deeper than the bass guitar. ‘Why haven’t you been to school?’ his mother shouted. I followed, with nausea in my stomach, and a dull ache in my heart. I was a traitor. He shouted at his mother, and his mother shouted back. He mentioned something about me getting him into fights but fortunately Isobel had no clue what he was talking about. ‘Dad, you bastard,’ he said to me at one point. ‘But the guitar. That was my idea.’ ‘So you’re buying me now?’ Teenagers, I realised, were really quite difficult. In the same way the south- eastern corner of the Derridean galaxy was difficult. His door slammed. I used the right tone of voice. ‘Gulliver, calm down. I am sorry. I am only trying to do what is best for you. I am learning here. Every day is a lesson, and some lessons I fail.’ It didn’t work. Unless working meant Gulliver kicking his own door with rage. Isobel eventually went downstairs, but I stayed there. An hour and thirty- eight minutes sitting on the beige wool carpet on the other side of the door. Newton came to join me. I stroked him. He licked my wrist with his rough tongue. I stayed right there, tilted my head towards the door. ‘I am sorry, Gulliver,’ I said. ‘I am sorry. I am sorry. And I am sorry I embarrassed you.’ Sometimes the only power you need is persistence. Eventually, he came out. He just looked at me, hands in pockets. He leant against the door-frame. ‘Did you do something on Facebook?’ ‘I might have done.’ He tried not to smile. He didn’t say much after that but he came downstairs and we all watched television together. It was a quiz show called Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (As the show was aimed at humans, the question was rhetorical.) Then, shortly after, Gulliver went to the kitchen to see how much cereal and milk would fit into a bowl (more than you could imagine) and then he disappeared back to the attic. There was a feeling of something having been accomplished. Isobel told me she had booked us tickets to see an avant-garde production of Hamlet at the Arts Theatre. It was apparently about a suicidal young prince who wants to kill the man who has replaced his father. ‘Gulliver is staying at home,’ said Isobel. ‘That might be wise.’ ‘That might be wise.’ Australian wine ‘I’ve forgotten to take my tablets today.’ Isobel smiled. ‘Well, one evening off won’t hurt. Do you want a glass of wine?’ I hadn’t tried wine before so I said yes, as it really did seem to be a very revered substance. It was a mild night so Isobel poured me a glass and we sat outside in the garden. Newton decided to stay indoors. I looked at the transparent yellow liquid in the glass. I tasted it and tasted fermentation. In other words I tasted life on Earth. For everything that lives here ferments, ages, becomes diseased. But as things made their decline from ripeness they could taste wonderful, I realised. Then I considered the glass. The glass had been distilled from rock and so it knew things. It knew the age of the universe because it was the universe. I took another sip. After the third sip, I was really beginning to see the point, and it did something rather pleasant to the brain. I was forgetting the dull aches of my body and the sharp worries of my mind. By the end of the third glass I was very, very drunk. I was so drunk I looked to the sky and believed I could see two moons. ‘You do realise you’re drinking Australian wine, don’t you?’ she said. To which I may have replied ‘Oh.’ ‘You hate Australian wine.’ ‘Do I? Why?’ I said. ‘Because you’re a snob.’ ‘What’s a snob?’ She laughed, looked at me sideways. ‘Someone who didn’t used to sit down with his family to watch TV,’ she said. ‘Ever.’ ‘Oh.’ I drank some more. So did she. ‘Maybe I am becoming less of one,’ I said. ‘Anything is possible.’ She smiled. She was still exotic to me. That was obvious, but it was a pleasant exoticism now. Beyond pleasant, in fact. obvious, but it was a pleasant exoticism now. Beyond pleasant, in fact. ‘Actually, anything is possible,’ I told her, but didn’t go into the maths. She put her arm around me. I did not know the etiquette. Was this the moment I was meant to recite poetry written by dead people or was I meant to massage her anatomy? I did nothing. I just let her stroke my back as I stared upwards, beyond the thermosphere, and watched the two moons slide together and become one. The watcher The next day I had a hangover. I realised that if getting drunk was how people forgot they were mortal, then hangovers were how they remembered. I woke with a headache, a dry mouth, and a bad stomach. I left Isobel in bed and went downstairs for a glass of water, then I had a shower. I got dressed and went into the living room to read poetry. I had the strange but real sense that I was being watched. The sense grew and grew. I stood up, went to the window. Outside the street was empty. The large, static redbrick houses just stood there, like decharged crafts on a landing strip. But still I stayed looking. I thought I could see something reflected in one of the windows, a shape beside a car. A human shape, maybe. My eyes might have been playing tricks. I was hungover, after all. Newton pressed his nose into my knee. He released a curious high-pitched whine. ‘I don’t know,’ I said. I stared out of the glass again, away from reflections, to direct reality. And then I saw it. Dark, hovering just above that same parked car. I realised what it was. It was the top of a human head. I had been right. Someone was hiding from my stare. ‘Wait there,’ I told Newton. ‘Guard the house.’ I ran outside, across the drive and onto the street, just in time to see someone sprinting away around the next corner. A man, wearing jeans and a black top. Even from behind, and at a distance, the man struck me as familiar, but I couldn’t think where I had seen him. I turned the corner, but there was no one there. It was just another empty suburban street, and a long one. Too long for the person to have run down. Well, it wasn’t quite empty. There was an old human female, walking towards me, dragging a shopping trolley. I stopped running. ‘Hello,’ she said, smiling. Her skin was creased with age, in the way typical of the species. (The best way to think of the ageing process in relation to a human face is to imagine a map of an area of innocent land which slowly becomes a city with many long and winding routes.) with many long and winding routes.) I think she knew me. ‘Hello,’ I said back. ‘How are you now?’ I was looking around, trying to assess the possible escape routes. If they had slid down one of the passageways then they could have been anywhere. There were about two hundred obvious possibilities. ‘I’m, I’m fine,’ I said. ‘Fine.’ My eyes darted around but were unrewarded. Who was this man? I wondered. And where was he from? Occasionally, in the days that followed, I would have that feeling again, of being watched. But I never caught a glimpse of my watcher, which was strange, and led me to only two possibilities. Either I was becoming too dull-witted and human, or the person I was looking for, the one who I could sometimes feel watching me in university corridors and in supermarkets, was too sharp-witted to be caught. In other words: something not human. I tried to convince myself that this was ridiculous. I was almost able to convince myself that my own mind was ridiculous, and that I had never actually been anything other than human. That I really was Professor Andrew Martin and that every other thing had been a kind of dream. Yes, I could almost do that. Almost. How to see for ever That it will never come again, Is what makes life so sweet. – Emily Dickinson Isobel was at her laptop, in the living room. An American friend of hers wrote a blog about ancient history and Isobel was contributing a comment about an article on Mesopotamia. I watched her, mesmerised. The Earth’s moon was a dead place, with no atmosphere. It had no way of healing its scars. Not like Earth, or its inhabitants. I was amazed, the way time mended things so quickly on this planet. I looked at Isobel and I saw a miracle. It was ridiculous, I know. But a human, in its own small way, was a kind of miraculous achievement, in mathematical terms. For a start, it wasn’t very likely that Isobel’s mother and father would have met. And even if they had met the chances of their having a baby would have been pretty slim, given the numerous agonies surrounding the human dating process. Her mother would have had about a hundred thousand eggs ovulating inside her, and her father would have had five trillion sperm during that same length of time. But even then, even that one in five hundred million million million chance of existing was a terrible understatement, and nowhere near did the coincidence of a human life justice. You see, when you looked at a human’s face, you had to comprehend the luck that brought that person there. Isobel Martin had a total of 150,000 generations before her, and that only includes the humans. That was 150,000 increasingly unlikely copulations resulting in increasingly unlikely children. That was a one in quadrillion chance multiplied by another quadrillion for every generation. Or around twenty thousand times more than the number of the atoms in the universe. But even that was only the start of it, because humans had only been around for three million Earth years, certainly a very short time compared to the three and a half billion years since life first appeared on this planet. Therefore, mathematically, rounding things up, there was no chance at all that Isobel Martin could have existed. A zero in tento-the-power-of-forever chance. And yet there she was, in front of me, and I was quite taken aback by it all; I really was. Suddenly it made me realise why religion was such a big thing around here. Because, yes, sure, God could not exist. But then neither could humans. So, if they believed in themselves – the logic must go – why not believe in something that was only a fraction more unlikely? I don’t know how long I looked at her like this. ‘What’s going through your mind?’ she asked me, closing the laptop. (This is an important detail. Remember: she closed the laptop.) ‘Oh, just things.’ ‘Tell me.’ ‘Well, I’m thinking about how life is so miraculous none of it really deserves the title “reality”.’ ‘Andrew, I’m a little taken aback about how your whole worldview has become so romantic.’ It was ridiculous that I had ever failed to see it. She was beautiful. A forty-one-year-old, poised delicately between the young woman she had been and the older one she would become. This intelligent, wound-dabbing historian. This person who would buy someone else’s shopping with no other motive than simply to help. I knew other things now. I knew she’d been a screaming baby, a child learning to walk, a girl at school eager to learn, a teenager listening to Talking Heads in her bedroom while reading books by A.J.P. Taylor. I knew she’d been a university student studying the past and trying to interpret its patterns. She’d been, simultaneously, a young woman in love, full of a thousand hopes, trying to read the future as well as the past. She had then taught British and European history, the big pattern she had discovered being the one that revealed that the civilisations that advanced with the Enlightenment did so through violence and territorial conquest more than through scientific progress, political modernisation and philosophical understanding. She had then tried to uncover the woman’s place in this history, and it had been difficult because history had always been written by the victors of wars, and the victors of the gender wars had always been male, and so women had been placed in the margins and in the footnotes, if they had been lucky. been placed in the margins and in the footnotes, if they had been lucky. And yet the irony was that she soon placed herself in the margins voluntarily, giving up work for family, because she imagined that when she eventually arrived at her death-bed she would feel more regret about unborn children than unwritten books. But as soon as she made that move, she had felt her husband begin to take her for granted. She had stuff to give, but it was ungiven; it was locked away. And I felt an incredible excitement at being able to witness the love re-emerge inside her, because it was a total, prime-of-life love. The kind that could only be possible in someone who was going to die at some point in the future, and also someone who had lived enough to know that loving and being loved back was a hard thing to get right, but when you managed it you could see forever. Two mirrors, opposite and facing each other at perfectly parallel angles, viewing themselves through the other, the view as deep as infinity. Yes, that was what love was for. (I may not have understood marriage, but I understood love, I was sure of it.) Love was a way to live forever in a single moment, and it was also a way to see yourself as you had never actually seen yourself, and made you realise – having done so – that this view was a more meaningful one than any of your previous self-perceptions and selfdeceptions. Even though, the big joke was, indeed the very biggest joke in the universe was, that Isobel Martin believed I had always been a human called Andrew Martin who had been born one hundred miles away in Sheffield, and not in fact 8653178431 light years away. ‘Isobel, I think I should tell you something. It is something very important.’ She looked worried. ‘What? What is it?’ There was an imperfection in her lower lip. The left side of it slightly fuller than the right. It was a fascinating detail on a face that only had fascinating details. How could I have ever found her hideous? How? How? I couldn’t do it. Say it. I should have, but I didn’t. ‘I think we should buy a new sofa,’ I said. ‘That’s the important thing you want to tell me?’ ‘Yes. I don’t like it. I don’t like purple.’ ‘Don’t you?’ ‘No. It’s too close to violet. All those short wavelength colours mess with my brain.’ ‘You are funny. “Short wavelength colours.” ’ ‘Well, that’s what they are.’ ‘But purple is the colour of emperors. And you’ve always acted like an emperor so . . .’ ‘Is it? Why?’ ‘Is it? Why?’ ‘Byzantine empresses gave birth in the Purple Chamber. Their babies were given the honorary title “Porphyrogenitos” which meant “Born to the Purple” to separate them from riff-raff generals who won the throne through going to war. But then, in Japan, purple is the colour of death.’ I was mesmerised by her voice when she spoke about historical things. It had a delicacy to it, each sentence a long thin arm carrying the past as if it were porcelain. Something that could be brought out and presented in front of you but which could break and become a million pieces at any moment. I realised even her being a historian was part of her caring nature. ‘Well, I just think we could do with some new furniture,’ I said. ‘Do you now?’ she asked, staring deep into my eyes in a mockserious way. One of the brighter humans, a German-born theoretical physicist called Albert Einstein, explained relativity to dimmer members of his species by telling them: ‘Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute.’ What if looking at the pretty girl felt like putting your hand on a hot stove? What was that? Quantum mechanics? After a period of time, she leant towards me and kissed me. I had kissed her before. But now the lightening effect on my stomach was very like fear. Indeed, it was every symptom of fear, but a pleasurable fear. An enjoyable danger. She smiled, and told me a story she had once read not in a history book but in a terrible magazine at the doctor’s. A husband and a wife who had fallen out of love had their own separate affairs on the Internet. It was only when they came to meet their illicit lovers that they realised they had actually been having an affair with each other. But far from tearing the marriage apart it restored it, and they lived more happily than before. ‘I have something to tell you,’ I said, after this story. ‘What?’ ‘I love you.’ ‘I love you, too.’ ‘Yes, but it is impossible to love you.’ ‘Thank you. Precisely what a girl likes to hear.’ ‘No. I mean, because of where I come from. No one there can love.’ ‘What? Sheffield? It’s not that bad.’ ‘No. Listen, this is new to me. I’m scared.’ She held my head in her hands, as if it were another delicate thing she wanted to preserve. She was a human. She knew one day her husband would die and yet she still dared to love him. That was an amazing thing. We kissed some more. We kissed some more. Kissing was very much like eating. But instead of reducing the appetite the food consumed actually increased it. The food wasn’t matter, it had no mass, and yet it seemed to convert into a very delicious energy inside me. ‘Let’s go upstairs,’ she said. She said the word suggestively, as though upstairs wasn’t just a place but an alternate reality, made from a different texture of space-time. A pleasure land we would enter via a worm hole on the sixth stair. And, of course, she was absolutely right. Afterwards, we lay there for a few minutes, and then she decided we needed some music. ‘Anything,’ I said, ‘but The Planets.’ ‘That’s the only piece of music you like.’ ‘Not anymore.’ So she put on something called ‘Love Theme’ by Ennio Morricone. It was sad, but beautiful. ‘Can you remember when we saw Cinema Paradiso?’ ‘Yes,’ I lied. ‘You hated it. You said it was so sentimental you wanted to throw up. You said it cheapens emotion to have it exaggerated and fetishised like that. Not that you’ve ever wanted to watch emotional things. I think, if I dare say it, you have always been scared of emotion, and so saying that you don’t like sentimentality is a way of saying you don’t like feeling emotion.’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘don’t worry. That me is dead.’ She smiled. She didn’t seem worried at all. But of course she should have been. We all should have been. And just how worried we should have been would become clear to me only a few hours later. The intruder She woke me in the middle of the night. ‘I think I heard someone,’ she said. Her voice indicated a tightness of the vocal folds within her larynx. It was fear disguised as calm. ‘What do you mean?’ ‘I swear to God, Andrew. I think there’s someone in the house.’ ‘You might have heard Gulliver.’ ‘No. Gulliver hasn’t come downstairs. I’ve been awake.’ I waited in the near-darkness, and then I heard something. Footsteps. It very much sounded like someone was walking around our living room. The clock’s digital display beamed 04:22. I pulled back the duvet and got out of bed. I looked at Isobel. ‘Just stay there. Whatever happens, stay right there.’ ‘Be careful,’ Isobel said. She switched on her bedside light and looked for the phone that was usually in its cradle on the table. But it wasn’t there. ‘That’s weird.’ I left the room and waited a moment on the landing. There was silence now. The silence that can only exist in houses at twenty past four in the morning. It struck me then just how primitive life was here, with houses that could not do anything to protect themselves. In short, I was terrified. Slowly and quietly I tiptoed downstairs. A normal person would probably have switched the hallway light on, but I didn’t. This wasn’t for my benefit, but for Isobel’s. If she came down and saw whoever it was, and they saw her, well, that could have been a very dangerous situation. Also, it would have been unwise to alert the intruder of my presence downstairs – if they hadn’t already been alerted. And so it was that I crept into the kitchen and saw Newton sleeping soundly (maybe even suspiciously so) in his basket. As far as I could tell, no one else had been in here, or the utility room, and so I left to check the sitting room. No one was there, or no one that I could see anyway. There were just books, the sofa, an empty fruit bowl, a desk and a radio. So then I went along the hallway to sofa, an empty fruit bowl, a desk and a radio. So then I went along the hallway to the living room. This time, before I opened the door I sensed strongly that someone was there. But without the gifts I had no idea if my senses were fooling me. I opened the door. As I did so, I felt a deep fear lightening my whole body. Prior to taking human form, I had never experienced such a feeling. What had we Vonnadorians ever had to be scared of, in a world without death or loss or uncontrollable pain? Again, I saw only furniture. The sofa, the chairs, the switched-off television, the coffee table. No one was there, not at that moment, but we had definitely been visited. I knew this because Isobel’s laptop was on the coffee table. This, alone, wasn’t worrying, as she had left it there last night. What worried me, though, was that it was open. She had closed it. But not only that. The light emission. Even though the computer was facing away from me I could see that the screen was glowing, which meant someone had been using it within the last two minutes. I quickly went around the coffee table to see what was on the screen, but nothing had been deleted. I closed the laptop and went upstairs. ‘What was it?’ Isobel asked, as I slid back into bed. ‘Oh, it was nothing. We must have been hearing things.’ And Isobel fell asleep as I stared up at the ceiling, wishing I had a god who could hear my prayers. Perfect time The next morning Gulliver brought his guitar downstairs and played a bit for us. He had learnt an old piece of music by a band known as Nirvana called ‘All Apologies’. With intense concentration on his face, he kept perfect time. He was very good, and we applauded him afterwards. For a moment, I forgot every worry. A king of infinite space It turned out that Hamlet was quite a depressing thing to watch when you had just given up immortality and were worried that someone was watching you. The best bit came half-way through when he looked up at the sky. ‘Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in the shape of a camel?’ he asked. ‘By th’ Mass,’ said another man, a curtain-fetishist called Polonius, ‘and ’tis like a camel, indeed.’ ‘Methinks it is like a weasel,’ said Hamlet. ‘It is backed like a weasel.’ Then Hamlet squinted and scratched his head. ‘Or like a whale.’ And Polonius, who wasn’t really in tune with Hamlet’s surreal sense of humour: ‘Very like a whale.’ Afterwards, we went out to a restaurant. It was called Tito’s. I had a bread salad called ‘panzanella’. It had anchovies in it. Anchovies were a fish, so I spent the first five minutes carefully taking them out and laying them on the side of the plate, offering them silent words of grief. ‘You seemed to enjoy the play,’ said Isobel. I thought I would lie. ‘I did. Yes. Did you?’ ‘No. It was awful. I think it was fundamentally wrong to have the Prince of Denmark played by a TV gardener.’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘you’re right. It was really bad.’ She laughed. She seemed more relaxed than I had ever seen her. Less worried about me, and Gulliver. ‘There’s a lot of death in it, as well,’ I said. ‘Yes.’ ‘Are you scared of death?’ She looked awkward. ‘Of course, I’m scared to death of death. I’m a lapsed Catholic. Death and guilt. That’s all I have.’ Catholicism, I discovered, was a type of Christianity for humans who like gold leaf, Latin and guilt. ‘Well, I think you do amazingly. Considering that your body is starting a slow process of physical deterioration leading ultimately to . . .’ process of physical deterioration leading ultimately to . . .’ ‘Okay, okay. Thank you. Enough death.’ ‘But I thought you liked thinking about death. I thought that’s why we saw Hamlet.’ ‘I like my death on a stage. Not over my penne arrabiata.’ So we talked and drank red wine as people came and left the restaurant. She told me of the module she was being cajoled into teaching next year. Early Civilised Life in the Aegean. ‘They keep trying to push me further and further back in time. Think they’re trying to tell me something. Next it will be Early Civilised Diplodocuses.’ She laughed. So I laughed too. ‘You should get that novel published,’ I said, trying a different tack. ‘Wider Than the Sky. It’s good. What I’ve read of it.’ ‘I don’t know. That one was a bit private. Very personal. Of its time. I was in a dark place. That was when you were . . . well, you know. We’re over that now. I feel like a different person now. Almost like I’m married to a different person too.’ ‘Well, you should write fiction again.’ ‘Oh, I don’t know. It’s getting the ideas.’ I didn’t want to tell her that I had quite a lot of ideas I could give her. ‘We haven’t done this for years, have we?’ she said. ‘Done what?’ ‘Talk. Like this. It feels like a first date or something. In a good way. It feels like I’m getting to know you.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘God,’ she said wistfully. She was drunk now. So was I, even though I was still on my first glass. ‘Our first date,’ she went on. ‘Can you remember?’ ‘Of course. Of course.’ ‘It was here. But it was an Indian then. What was its name? . . . The Taj Mahal. You’d changed your mind on the phone after I wasn’t too impressed at the Pizza Hut suggestion. Cambridge didn’t even have a Pizza Express back then. God . . . twenty years. Can you believe it? Talk about the compression of time through memory. I remember it better than anything. I was late. You waited an hour for me. Out in the rain. I thought that was so romantic.’ She looked off into the distance, as though twenty years ago were a physical thing that could be seen sitting at a table in the corner of the room. And as I stared at those eyes, which were loitering somewhere in the infinity between past and present, happy and sad, I deeply wanted to have been that person she was talking about. The one who had braved the rain and got soaked to the skin two talking about. The one who had braved the rain and got soaked to the skin two decades ago. But I wasn’t that person. And I would never be him. I felt like Hamlet. I had absolutely no idea what to do. ‘He must have loved you,’ I said. She stopped daydreaming. Was suddenly alert. ‘What?’ ‘I,’ I said, staring down at my slow-melting limoncello ice-cream. ‘And I still love you. As much as I did then. I was just, you know, seeing us, the past, in the third person. Distance of time . . .’ She held my hand across the table. Squeezed it. For a second I could dream I was Professor Andrew Martin, just as easily as a TV gardener could dream he was Hamlet. ‘Can you remember when we used to go punting on the Cam?’ she asked. ‘That time you fell in the water . . . God, we were drunk. Can you remember? While we were still here, before you had that Princeton offer and we went to America. We really had fun, didn’t we?’ I nodded, but I felt uncomfortable. Also, I didn’t want to leave Gulliver on his own any longer. I asked for the bill. ‘Listen,’ I said, as we walked out of the restaurant, ‘there’s something I really feel obliged to let you know . . .’ ‘What?’ she asked, looking up at me. Holding on to my arm as she flinched at the wind. ‘What is it?’ I breathed deeply, filling my lungs, seeking courage somewhere in the nitrogen and the oxygen. In my mind I ran through the pieces of information I had to give her. I am not from here. In fact, I am not even your husband. I am from another planet, in another solar system, in a distant galaxy. ‘The thing is . . . well, the thing is . . .’ ‘Think we should probably cross the road,’ said Isobel, tugging my arm, as two silhouettes – a shouting female and a male – came towards us on the pavement. So we did, crossing at an angle that tried to balance the concealment of fear with rapid avoidance – that angle being, as it was everywhere in the universe, 48 degrees away from the straight line on which we had been travelling. Midway across that carless road I turned and saw her. Zoë. The woman from the hospital I had met on my first day on this planet. She was still shouting at the large, muscular, shaven-headed man. The man had a tattoo of a tear on his face. I remembered her confession of her love of violent men. ‘I’m telling you, you’ve got it wrong! You’re the one that’s crazy! Not me! But if you want to go around like a primitive life form that’s fine! Do it, you But if you want to go around like a primitive life form that’s fine! Do it, you thick piece of shit!’ ‘You pretentious, cock-munching slag!’ And then she saw me. The art of letting go ‘It’s you,’ Zoë said. ‘You know her?’ whispered Isobel. ‘I’m afraid . . . yes. From the hospital.’ ‘Oh no.’ ‘Please,’ I said to the man, ‘be nice.’ The man was staring at me. His shaven head, along with the rest of his body, came towards me. ‘And what on Earth has it got to do with you?’ ‘On Earth,’ I said, ‘it’s nice to see people getting on together.’ ‘You fuckin’ what?’ ‘Just turn around,’ Isobel said fearlessly, ‘and leave everyone alone. Seriously, if you do anything else you’ll just regret it in the morning.’ It was then he turned to Isobel and held her face, squeezing her cheeks hard, distorting her beauty. Anger flared inside me as he said to her, ‘Shut your fucking mouth, you meddling bitch.’ Isobel now had fear-swollen eyes. There were rational things to do here, I was sure, but I had come a long way since rationality. ‘Leave us all alone,’ I said, momentarily forgetting that my words were just that. Words. He looked at me and he laughed. And with that laughter came the terrifying knowledge that I had no power whatsoever. The gifts had been taken from me. I was, to all intents and purposes, no more equipped for a fight with a giant gym- bodied thug than the average human professor of mathematics, which wasn’t particularly well equipped at all. He beat me. And it was a proper beating. Not the kind Gulliver had given me, and which I had opted to feel. No. If there had been an option not to feel the cheap metal rings of this man’s fist collide into my face with comet-like force then I would have taken that option. As I would have done only moments later when I was on the ground receiving a kick in the stomach, rapidly unsettling the when I was on the ground receiving a kick in the stomach, rapidly unsettling the undigested Italian food residing there, followed by the final piece of brutalist punctuation – the kick to the head. More of a stamp, actually. After that, there was nothing. There was darkness, and Hamlet. This was your husband. Look you now what follows. I heard Isobel wailing. I tried to speak to her, but words were hard to reach. The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. I could hear the rise and fall of a siren, and knew it was for me. Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear. I woke, in the ambulance, and there was only her. Her face above me, like a sun that eyes could stand, and she stroked my hand as she had once stroked my hand the first time I’d met her. ‘I love you,’ she said. And I knew the point of love right then. The point of love was to help you survive. The point was also to forget meaning. To stop looking and start living. The meaning was to hold the hand of someone you cared about and to live inside the present. Past and future were myths. The past was just the present that had died and the future would never exist anyway, because by the time we got to it the future would have turned into the present. The present was all there was. The ever-moving, ever-changing present. And the present was fickle. It could only be caught by letting go. So I let go. I let go of everything in the universe. Everything, except her hand. Neuroadaptive activity I woke up in the hospital. It was the first time in my life I had woken in serious physical pain. It was night-time. Isobel had stayed for a while and had fallen asleep in a plastic chair. But she had now been told to go home. So I was alone, with my pain, feeling how truly helpless it was to be a human. And I stayed awake in the dark, urging the Earth to rotate faster and faster so that it could be facing the sun again. For the tragedy of night to become the comedy of day. I wasn’t used to night. Of course, I had experienced it on other planets but Earth had the darkest nights I had ever experienced. Not the longest, but the deepest, the loneliest, the most tragically beautiful. I consoled myself with random prime numbers. 73. 131. 977. 1213. 83719. Each as indivisible as love, except by one and itself. I struggled to think of higher primes. Even my mathematical skills had abandoned me, I realised. They tested my ribs, my eyes, my ears, and inside my mouth. They tested my brain and my heart. My heart had caused no concern, though they did consider forty-nine beats per minute to be a little on the slow side. As for my brain, they were a little concerned about my medial temporal lobe, as there seemed to be some unusual neuroadaptive activity taking place. ‘It’s as though there has been something taken out of your brain and your cells are trying to over-compensate, but clearly nothing has been taken out or damaged. But it is very strange.’ I nodded. Of course, something had been taken out, but I also knew it was nothing any human, Earth-based doctor would ever be able to understand. It had been a difficult test, but I had passed it. I was as good as human. And they gave me some paracetamol and codeine for the pain which still pulsated inside my head and on my face. Eventually, I went home. The next day, Ari came to visit me. I was in bed. Isobel was at work and Gulliver was, quite genuinely it seemed, at school. Gulliver was, quite genuinely it seemed, at school. ‘Man, you look fucking terrible.’ I smiled, lifted the bag of frozen peas from the side of my head. ‘Which is a coincidence, because I feel fucking terrible too.’ ‘You should’ve gone to the police.’ ‘Well, yes, I was thinking about it. Isobel thinks I should. But I have a little bit of a phobia about police. You know, ever since I was arrested for not wearing clothes.’ ‘Yeah, well, you can’t have psychos roaming around pulverising anyone they feel like.’ ‘No, I know. I know.’ ‘Listen, mate, I just want to say that was big of you. That was old-school gentleman, defending your wife like that and, you know, kudos for it. It surprised me. I’m not putting you down or anything, but I didn’t know you were that kind of shining-armour guy.’ ‘Well, I’ve changed. I have a lot of activity in my medial temporal lobe. I think it’s probably to do with that.’ Ari looked doubtful. ‘Well, whatever it is, you’re becoming a man of honour. And that’s rare for mathematicians. It’s always been us physicists who’ve had the big cojones, traditionally. Just don’t screw it up with Isobel. You know what I mean?’ I looked at Ari for a long time. He was a good man, I could see that. I could trust him. ‘Listen, Ari, you know that thing I was going to tell you. At the café at the college?’ ‘When you had that migraine?’ ‘Yes,’ I hesitated. I was disconnected, so I knew I could tell him. Or thought I could. ‘I am from another planet, in another solar system, in another galaxy.’ Ari laughed. It was a loud, deep blast of laughter without a single note of doubt. ‘Okay, ET, so you’ll be wanting to phone home now. If we’ve got a connection that reaches the Andromeda galaxy.’ ‘It’s not the Andromeda galaxy. It’s further away. Many, many light years.’ This sentence was hardly heard as Ari was laughing so much. He stared at me with fake blankness. ‘So how did you get here? Space ship? Wormhole?’ ‘No. I didn’t travel in any conventional way you would understand. It was anti-matter technology. Home is forever away, but it is also only a second away. Though now, I can never go back.’ It was no good. Ari, a man who believed in the possibility of alien life, still could not accept the idea when it was standing – or lying – right in front of him. ‘You see, I had special talents, as a result of technology. The gifts.’ ‘Go on then,’ Ari said, controlling his laughter, ‘show me.’ ‘Go on then,’ Ari said, controlling his laughter, ‘show me.’ ‘I can’t. I have no powers now. I am exactly like a human.’ Ari found this bit especially funny. He was annoying me now. He was still a good man, but good men could be annoying, I realised. ‘Exactly like a human! Well, man, you’re fucked then, aren’t you?’ I nodded. ‘Yes. I think I might be.’ Ari smiled, looked concerned. ‘Listen, make sure you keep taking all the tablets. Not just the painkillers. All of them, yeah?’ I nodded. He thought I was mad. Maybe it would be easier if I could take on this view myself, the delusion that it was a delusion. If one day I could wake up and believe it was all a dream. ‘Listen,’ I said. ‘I’ve researched you. I know you understand quantum physics, and I know you’ve written about simulation theory. You say there’s a thirty per cent chance that none of this is real. You told me in the café you believed in aliens. So I know you can believe this.’ Ari shook his head, but at least he wasn’t laughing now. ‘No. You’re wrong. I can’t.’ ‘That’s okay,’ I said, realising that if Ari wouldn’t believe me Isobel never would. But Gulliver. There was always Gulliver. One day I would tell him the truth. But what then? Could he accept me as a father, knowing I had lied? I was trapped. I had to lie, and to stay lying. ‘But, Ari,’ I said, ‘if I ever need a favour, if I ever need Gulliver and Isobel to stay at your house – would that be okay?’ He smiled. ‘Sure, mate, sure.’ Platykurtic distribution The next day, still swollen with bruises, I was back at the college. There was something about being in the house, even with Newton for company, that troubled me. It never had before, but now it made me feel incredibly lonely. So I went to work, and I realised why work was so important on Earth. It stopped you feeling lonely. But loneliness was there for me, waiting in my office, which was where I’d returned after my lecture on distribution models. But my head hurt and I must admit I did quite welcome the peace. After a while there was a knock on the door. I ignored it. Loneliness minus a headache was my preferred option. But then it happened again. And it happened in such a way that I knew it was going to keep on happening, and so I stood up and went to the door. And, after a while, I opened it. A young woman was there. It was Maggie. The wild flower in bloom. The one with the curly red hair and the full lips. She was twirling her hair around her finger again. She was breathing deeply, and seemed to be inhaling a different kind of air – one which contained a mysterious aphrodisiac, promising euphoria. And she was smiling. ‘So,’ she said. I waited a minute for the rest of the sentence but it didn’t happen. ‘So’ was beginning, middle and end. It meant something, but I didn’t know what. ‘What do you want?’ I asked. She smiled again. Bit her lip. ‘To discuss the compatibility of bell curves and platykurtic distribution models.’ ‘Right.’ ‘Platykurtic,’ she added, running a finger down my shirt towards my trousers. ‘From the Greek. Platus meaning flat, kurtos meaning . . . bulging.’ ‘Oh.’ Her finger danced away from me. ‘So, Jake LaMotta, let’s go.’ ‘My name is not Jake LaMotta.’ ‘I know. I was referencing your face.’ ‘I know. I was referencing your face.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘So, are we going?’ ‘Where?’ ‘Hat and Feathers.’ I had no idea what she was talking about. Or indeed, who she actually was to me, or to the man who had been Professor Andrew Martin. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘let’s go.’ That was it, right there. My first mistake of the day. But by no means the last. The Hat and Feathers I soon discovered the Hat and Feathers was a misleading name. In it there was no hat, and absolutely no feathers. There were just heavily inebriated people with red faces laughing at their own jokes. This, I soon discovered, was a typical pub. The ‘pub’ was an invention of humans living in England, designed as compensation for the fact that they were humans living in England. I rather liked the place. ‘Let’s find a quiet corner,’ she said to me, this young Maggie. There were lots of corners, as there always seemed to be in human-made environments. Earth dwellers still seemed to be a long way off from understanding the link between straight lines and acute forms of psychosis, which might explain why pubs seemed to be full of aggressive people. There were straight lines running into each other all over the place. Every table, every chair, at the bar, at the ‘fruit machine’. (I enquired about these machines. Apparently they were aimed at men whose fascination with flashing squares of light was coupled with a poor grasp of probability theory.) With so many corners to choose from, it was a surprise to see us sit near a straight, continuous piece of wall, at an oval table and on circular stools. ‘This is perfect,’ she said. ‘Is it?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Right.’ ‘What would you like?’ ‘Liquid nitrogen,’ I replied thoughtlessly. ‘A whisky and soda?’ ‘Yes. One of them.’ And we drank and chatted like old friends, which I think we were. Though her conversational approach seemed quite different from Isobel’s. ‘Your penis is everywhere,’ she said at one point. I looked around. ‘Is it?’ ‘Two hundred and twenty thousand hits on YouTube.’‘Right,’ I said. ‘They’ve blurred it out, though. Quite a wise move, I would say, from first- hand experience.’ She laughed even more at this. It was a laugh that did nothing to relieve the pain pressing into and out of my face. I changed the mood. I asked her what it meant, for her, to be a human. I wanted to ask the whole world this question, but, right now, she would do. And so she told me. The ideal castle She said being human is being a young child on Christmas Day who receives an absolutely magnificent castle. And there is a perfect photograph of this castle on the box and you want more than anything to play with the castle and the knights and the princesses because it looks like such a perfectly human world, but the only problem is that the castle isn’t built. It’s in tiny intricate pieces, and although there’s a book of instructions you don’t understand it. And nor can your parents or Aunt Sylvie. So you are just left, crying at the ideal castle on the box which no one would ever be able to build. Somewhere else I thanked Maggie for this interpretation. And then I explained to her that I thought the meaning was coming to me, the more I forgot it. After that, I spoke a lot about Isobel. This seemed to irritate her, and she switched the subject. ‘After this,’ she said, circling the top of her glass with her finger, ‘are we going somewhere else?’ I recognised the tone of this ‘somewhere else’. It had the exact same frequency as Isobel’s use of the word ‘upstairs’ the Saturday before. ‘Are we going to have sex?’ She laughed some more. Laughter, I realised, was the reverberating sound of a truth hitting a lie. Humans existed inside their own delusions and laughing was a way out – the only possible bridge they had between each other. That, and love. But there was no love between me and Maggie, I want you to know that. Anyway, it turned out we were going to have sex. So we left and walked along a few streets until we reached Willow Road and her flat. Her flat, by the way, was the messiest thing I had ever seen that hadn’t been a direct result of nuclear fission. A supercluster of books, clothes, empty wine bottles, stubbed- out cigarettes, old toast and unopened envelopes. I discovered that her full name was Margaret Lowell. I wasn’t an expert on Earth names, but I still knew this was wildly inappropriate. She should have been called Lana Bellcurve or Ashley Brainsex or something. Anyway, apparently I never called her Margaret. (‘No one except my broadband provider calls me that.’) She was Maggie. And Maggie, it transpired, was an unconventional human. For instance, when asked about her religion, she answered ‘Pythagorean’. She was ‘well travelled’, the most ridiculous expression if you belonged to a species that had only left its own planet to visit its moon (and Maggie, it transpired, hadn’t even been there). In this case, it merely meant she had taught English in Spain, Tanzania and various parts of South America for four years before returning to study maths. She also seemed to have a very limited sense of body shame, by human standards, and had worked as a lap dancer to pay for her undergraduate studies. standards, and had worked as a lap dancer to pay for her undergraduate studies. She wanted to have sex on the floor, which was an intensely uncomfortable way of having it. As we unclothed each other we kissed, but this wasn’t the kind of kissing that brought you closer, the kind that Isobel was good at. This was self-referential kissing, kissing about kissing, dramatic and fast and pseudo- intense. It also hurt. My face was still tender and Maggie’s meta-kisses didn’t really seem to accommodate the possibility of pain. And then we were naked, or rather the parts of us which needed to be naked were naked, and it started to feel more like a strange kind of fighting than anything else. I looked at her face, and her neck, and her breasts, and was reminded of the fundamental strangeness of the human body. With Isobel, I had never felt like I was sleeping with an alien, but with Maggie the level of exoticism bordered on terror. There was physiological pleasure, quite a good deal of it at times, but it was a very localised, anatomical kind of pleasure. I smelt her skin, and I liked the smell of it, a mixture of coconut-scented lotion and bacteria, but my mind felt terrible, for a reason that involved more than my head pain. Almost immediately after we had started having sex I had a queasy sensation in my stomach, as though the altitude had drastically changed. I stopped. I got away from her. ‘What’s the matter?’ she asked me. ‘I don’t know. But something is. This feels wrong. I realise I don’t want to have an orgasm right now.’ ‘Bit late for a crisis of conscience.’ I really didn’t know what the matter was. After all, it was just sex. I got dressed and discovered there were four missed calls on my mobile phone. ‘Goodbye, Maggie.’ She laughed some more. ‘Give my love to your wife.’ I had no idea what was so funny, but I decided to be polite and laughed too as I stepped outside into cool evening air, which was tainted with maybe a little more carbon dioxide than I had noticed before. Places beyond logic ‘You’re home late,’ Isobel said. ‘I’ve been worried. I thought that man might have come after you.’ ‘What man?’ ‘That brute who smashed your face in.’ She was in the living room, at home, its walls lined with books about history and mathematics. Mainly mathematics. She was placing pens in a pot. She was staring at me with harsh eyes. Then she softened a bit. ‘How was your day?’ ‘Oh,’ I said, putting down my bag, ‘it was okay. I did some teaching. I met some students. I had sex with that person. My student. The one called Maggie.’ It’s funny, I had a sensation these words were taking me somewhere, into a dangerous valley, but still I said them. Isobel, meanwhile, took a little time to process this information, even by human standards. The queasy feeling in my stomach hadn’t gone away. If anything, it had intensified. ‘That’s not very funny.’ ‘I wasn’t trying to be funny.’ She studied me for a long while. Then dropped a fountain pen on the floor. The lid came off. Ink sprayed. ‘What are you talking about?’ I told her again. The bit she seemed most interested in was the last part, about me having sex with Maggie. Indeed, she was so interested that she started to hyperventilate and throw the pen pot in the direction of my head. And then she began to cry. ‘Why are you crying?’ I said, but I was beginning to understand. I moved closer to her. It was then she launched an attack on me, her hands moving as fast as laws of anatomical motion allow. Her fingernails scratched my face, adding fresh wounds. Then she just stood there, looking at me, as if she had wounds too. Invisible ones. ‘I’m sorry, Isobel, you have to understand, I didn’t realise I was doing anything wrong. This is all new. You don’t know how alien all this is to me. I know it is morally wrong to love another woman, but I don’t love her. It was just pleasure. The way a peanut butter sandwich is pleasure. You don’t realise the pleasure. The way a peanut butter sandwich is pleasure. You don’t realise the complexity and hypocrisy of this system . . .’ She had stopped. Her breathing slowed and deepened, and her first question became her only one. ‘Who is she?’ And then: ‘Who is she?’ And soon after: ‘Who is she?’ I was reluctant to speak. Speaking to a human you cared about, I realised, was so fraught with hidden danger that it was a wonder people bothered speaking at all. I could have lied. I could have backtracked. But I realised lying, though essential to keep someone in love with you, actually wasn’t what my love demanded. It demanded truth. So I said, in the simplest words I could find, ‘I don’t know. But I don’t love her. I love you. I didn’t realise that it was such a big thing. I sort of knew, as it was happening. My stomach told me, in a way it never tells me with peanut butter. And then I stopped.’ The only time I’d come across the concept of infidelity was in Cosmopolitan magazine, and they really hadn’t done enough to explain it properly. They’d sort of said it depends on the context and, you see, it was such an alien concept for me to understand. It was like trying to get a human to understand transcellular healing. ‘I’m sorry.’ She wasn’t listening. She had her own things to say. ‘I don’t even know you. I have no idea of who you are. No idea. If you’ve done this, you really are an alien to me . . .’ ‘Am I? Listen, Isobel, you’re right. I am. I am not from here. I have never loved before. All this is new. I’m an amateur at this. Listen, I used to be immortal, I could not die, I could not feel pain, but I gave that up . . .’ She wasn’t even listening. She was a galaxy away. ‘All I know, all I know beyond any doubt, is that I want a divorce. I do. That is what I want. You have destroyed us. You have destroyed Gulliver. Again.’ Newton appeared at this point, wagging his tail to try and calm the mood. Isobel ignored Newton and started to walk away from me. I should have let her go, but bizarrely I couldn’t. I held on to her wrist. ‘Stay,’ I said. And then it happened. Her arm swung at me with ferocious force, her clenched hand an asteroid speeding towards the planet of my face. Not a slap or a scratch this time but a smack. Was this where love ended? With an injury on top of an injury on top of an injury? ‘I’m leaving the house now. And when I come back, I want you gone. Do you understand? Gone. I want you out of here, and out of our lives. It’s over. Everything. It’s all over. I thought you’d changed. I honestly thought you’d become someone else. And I let you in again! What a fucking idiot!’ I kept my hand over my face. It still hurt. I heard her footsteps head away I kept my hand over my face. It still hurt. I heard her footsteps head away from me. The door opened. The door closed. I was alone again with Newton. ‘I’ve really done it now,’ I said. He seemed to agree, but I couldn’t understand him any more. I might as well have been any human trying to understand any dog. But he seemed something other than sad, as he barked in the direction of the living room and the road beyond. It seemed less like condolence and more like warning. I went to look out of the living-room window. There was nothing to be seen. So I stroked Newton one more time, offered a pointless apology, and left the house. PART III The wounded deer leaps the highest It belongs to the perfection of everything human that man can only attain his desire by passing through its opposite. – Søren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling An encounter with Winston Churchill I walked to the nearest shop, a brightly lit and unsympathetic place called Tesco Metro. I bought myself a bottle of Australian wine. I walked along a cycle path and drank it, singing ‘God Only Knows’. It was quiet. I sat down by a tree and finished the bottle. I went and bought another. I sat down on a park bench, next to a man with a large beard. It was the man I had seen before. On my first day. The one who had called me Jesus. He was wearing the same long dirty raincoat and he had the same scent. This time I found it fascinating. I sat there for a while just working out all the different aromas – alcohol, sweat, tobacco, urine, infection. It was a uniquely human smell, and rather wonderful in its own sad way. ‘I don’t know why more people don’t do this,’ I said, striking up a conversation. ‘Do what?’ ‘You know, get drunk. Sit on a park bench. It seems like a good way to solve problems.’ ‘Are you taking the piss, fella?’ ‘No. I like it. And you obviously like it or you wouldn’t be doing it.’ Of course, this was a little bit disingenuous of me. Humans were always doing things they didn’t like doing. In fact, to my best estimate, at any one time only point three per cent of humans were actively doing something they liked doing, and even when they did so, they felt an intense amount of guilt about it and were fervently promising themselves they’d be back doing something horrendously unpleasant very shortly. A blue plastic bag floated by on the wind. The bearded man rolled a cigarette. He had shaky fingers. Nerve damage. ‘Ain’t no choice in love and life,’ he said. ‘No. That’s true. Even when you think there are choices there aren’t really. But I thought humans still subscribed to the illusion of free will?’ ‘Not me, chief.’ And then he started singing, in a mumbled baritone of very low frequency. ‘Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone . . .’ low frequency. ‘Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone . . .’ ‘What’s your name?’ ‘I’m Andrew,’ I said. ‘Sort of.’ ‘What’s bothering you? You got beat up? Your face looks like shit.’ ‘Yeah, in lots of ways. I had someone love me. And it was the most precious thing, that love. It gave me a family. It made me feel like I belonged. And I broke it.’ He lit the cigarette, which flopped out of his face like a numb antennae. ‘Ten years me and my wife were married,’ he said. ‘Then I lost my job and she left me the same week. That’s when I turned to drink and my leg started to turn on me.’ He lifted up his trousers. His left leg was swollen and purple. And violet. I could see he expected me to be disgusted. ‘Deep vein thrombosis. Effing agony, it is. Effing fucking agony. And it’s gonna bloody kill me one of these days.’ He passed me the cigarette. I inhaled. I knew I didn’t like it, but I still inhaled. ‘What’s your name?’ I asked him. He laughed. ‘Winston bloody Churchill.’ ‘Oh, like the wartime prime minister.’ I watched him close his eyes and suck on his cigarette. ‘Why do people smoke?’ ‘No idea. Ask me something else.’ ‘Okay, then. How do you cope with loving someone who hates you? Someone who doesn’t want to see you again.’ ‘God knows.’ He winced. He was in agony. I had noticed his pain on the first day, but now I wanted to do something about it. I had drunk enough to believe I could, or at least to forget I couldn’t. He was about to roll his trousers down, but seeing the pain he was in, I told him to wait a moment. I placed my hand on the leg. ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Don’t worry. It’s a very simple procedure of bio-set transference, involving reverse-apoptosis, working at the molecular level to restore and recreate dead and diseased cells. To you it will look like magic, but it isn’t.’ My hand stayed there and nothing happened. And nothing kept on happening. It looked very far from magic. ‘Who are you?’ ‘I’m an alien. I’m considered a useless failure in two galaxies.’ ‘Well, could you please take your damn hand off my leg?’ I took my hand away. ‘Sorry. Really. I thought I still had the ability to heal you.’ ‘I know you,’ he said. ‘I know you,’ he said. ‘What?’ ‘I’ve seen you before.’ ‘Yes. I know. I passed you, on my first day in Cambridge. You may remember. I was naked.’ He leant back, squinted, angled his head. ‘Nah. Nah. Wasn’t that. I saw you today.’ ‘I don’t think you did. I’m pretty sure I would have recognised you.’ ‘Nah. Definitely today. I’m good with faces, see.’ ‘Was I with someone? A young woman? Red hair?’ He considered. ‘Nah. It was just you.’ ‘Where was I?’ ‘Oh, you were on, let me think, you’d have been on Newmarket Road.’ ‘Newmarket Road?’ I knew the name of the street, because it was where Ari lived, but I hadn’t ever been on the street myself. Not today. Not ever. Though of course, it was very likely that Andrew Martin – the original Andrew Martin – had been down there many times. Yes, that must have been it. He was getting mixed up. ‘I think you might be confused.’ He shook his head. ‘It was you all right. This morning. Maybe midday. No word of a lie.’ And with that the man stood up and hobbled slowly away from me, leaving a trail of smoke and spilt alcohol. A cloud passed across the sun. I looked up to the sky. I had a thought as dark as the shade. I stood up. I took the phone out of my pocket and called Ari. Eventually someone picked up. It was a woman. She was breathing heavily, sniffing up snot, struggling to turn noise into coherent words. ‘Hello, this is Andrew. I wondered if Ari was there.’ And then the words came, in morbid succession: ‘He’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead.’ The replacement I ran. I left the wine and I ran as fast as I could, across the park, along streets, over main roads, hardly thinking about traffic. It hurt, this running. It hurt my knees, my hips, my heart and my lungs. All those components, reminding me they would one day fail. It also, somehow, aggravated the various facial aches and pains I was suffering. But, mostly, it was my mind that was in turmoil. This was my fault. This had nothing to do with the Riemann hypothesis and everything to do with the fact that I had told Ari the truth about where I was from. He hadn’t believed me, but that hadn’t been the point. I had been able to tell him, without getting an agonising violet-tainted warning. They had disconnected me, but they must still have been watching, and listening, which meant they could probably hear me now. ‘Don’t do it. Don’t hurt Isobel or Gulliver. They don’t know anything.’ I reached the house that, up until this morning, I had been living in with the people I had grown to love. I crunched my way up the gravel driveway. The car wasn’t there. I looked through the living-room window, but there was no sign of anyone. I had no key with me so I rang the doorbell. I stood and waited, wondering what I could do. After a while, the door opened, but I still couldn’t see anyone. Whoever had opened the door clearly didn’t want to be seen. I stepped into the house. I walked past the kitchen. Newton was asleep in his basket. I went over to him, shook him gently. ‘Newton! Newton!’ But he stayed asleep, breathing deeply, mysteriously unwakeable. ‘I’m in here,’ said a voice, coming from the living room. So I followed it, that familiar voice, until I was there, looking at a man sitting on the purple sofa with one leg crossed over the other. He was instantly familiar to me – indeed, he could not have been more so – and yet, at the same time, the sight of him was terrifying. For it was myself I was looking at. His clothes were different (jeans instead of cords, a T-shirt instead of shirt, His clothes were different (jeans instead of cords, a T-shirt instead of shirt, trainers in place of shoes) but it was definitely the form of Andrew Martin. The mid-brown hair, naturally parted. The tired eyes, and the same face except for the absence of bruises. ‘Snap!’ he said, smiling. ‘That is what they say here, isn’t it? You know, when they are playing card games. Snap! We are identical twins.’ ‘Who are you?’ He frowned, as if I’d asked such a basic question it shouldn’t have been asked. ‘I’m your replacement.’ ‘My replacement?’ ‘That is what I said. I am here to do what you were unable to do.’ My heart was racing. ‘What do you mean?’ ‘To destroy information.’ Fear and anger were sometimes the same thing. ‘You killed Ari?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Why? He didn’t know the Riemann hypothesis had been proved.’ ‘No. I know. I have been given broader instructions than you. I have been told to destroy anyone you have told about your’ – he considered the right word – ‘origins.’ ‘So they’ve been listening to me? They said I was disconnected.’ He pointed at my left hand, where the technology still evidently lived. ‘They took your powers away, but they didn’t take theirs. They listen sometimes. They check.’ I stared at it. At my hand. It looked, suddenly, like an enemy. ‘How long have you been here? On Earth, I mean.’ ‘Not long.’ ‘Someone broke into this house a few nights ago. They accessed Isobel’s computer.’ ‘That was me.’ ‘So why the delay? Why didn’t you finish the job that night?’ ‘You were here. I did not want to hurt you. No Vonnadorian has killed another Vonnadorian. Not directly.’ ‘Well, I’m not really a Vonnadorian. I am a human. The paradox is that I’m light years from home, and yet this feels like my home. That is a strange thing to feel. So, what have you been doing? Where have you been living?’ He hesitated, swallowed hard. ‘I have been living with a female.’ ‘A female human? A woman?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Where?’ ‘Outside Cambridge. A village. She doesn’t know my name. She thinks I am ‘Outside Cambridge. A village. She doesn’t know my name. She thinks I am called Jonathan Roper. I convinced her we were married.’ I laughed. The laugh seemed to surprise him. ‘Why are you laughing?’ ‘I don’t know. I have gained a sense of humour. That is one thing that happened when I lost the gifts.’ ‘I am going to kill them, do you know that?’ ‘No. Actually, I don’t. I told the hosts there is no point. That’s about the last thing I said to them. They seemed to understand me.’ ‘I have been told to, and that is what I will do.’ ‘But don’t you think it’s pointless, that there’s no real reason to do it?’ He sighed and shook his head. ‘No, I do not think that’, he said, in a voice which was mine but deeper, somehow, and flatter. ‘I do not see a separation. I have lived with a human for only a few days but I have seen the violence and hypocrisy that runs through this species.’ ‘Yes, but there is good in them. A lot of good.’ ‘No. I don’t see it. They can sit and watch dead human bodies on TV screens and feel nothing at all.’ ‘That’s how I saw it at first, but—’ ‘They can drive a car thirty miles every day and feel good about themselves for recycling a couple of empty jam jars. They can talk about peace being a good thing yet glorify war. They can despise the man who kills his wife in rage but worship the indifferent soldier who drops a bomb killing a hundred children.’ ‘Yes, there is a bad logic here, I agree with you, yet I truly believe—’ He wasn’t listening. He stood up now, stared at me with determined eyes as he paced the room and delivered his speech. ‘They believe God is always on their side, even if their side is at odds with the rest of their species. They have no way of coming to terms with what are, biologically, the two most important events that happen to them – procreation and death. They pretend to know that money can’t buy them happiness, yet they would choose money every time. They celebrate mediocrity at every available opportunity and love to see others’ misfortune. They have lived on this planet for over a hundred thousand generations and yet they still have no idea about who they really are or how they should really live. In fact, they know less now than they once did.’ ‘You’re right but don’t you think there is something beautiful in these contradictions, something mysterious?’ ‘No. No, I do not. What I think is that their violent will has helped them dominate the world, and “civilise” it, but now there is nowhere left for them to go, and so the human world has turned in on itself. It is a monster that feasts on its own hands. And still they do not see the monster, or if they do they do not see that they are inside it, molecules within the beast.’ that they are inside it, molecules within the beast.’ I looked at the bookshelves. ‘Have you read human poetry? Humans understand these failings.’ He still wasn’t listening. ‘They have lost themselves but not their ambitions. Do not think that they would not leave this place if they had the chance. They’re beginning to realise life is out there, that we or beings like us, are out there, and they won’t just stop at that. They will want to explore, and as their mathematical understanding expands, then they will eventually be able to do so. They will find us, eventually, and when they do, they will not want to be friends, even if they think – as they always do – that their own ends are perfectly benevolent. They will find a reason to destroy or subjugate other life forms.’ A girl in a school uniform walked past the house. Pretty soon, Gulliver would be coming home. ‘But there is no connection between killing these people and stopping progress, I promise you. No connection.’ He stopped pacing the room and came over to me, leant into my face. ‘Connections? I will tell you about connections . . . An amateur German physicist works in a patent office in Bern in Switzerland. He comes up with a theory that, half a century later, will lead to whole Japanese cities being destroyed, along with much of their population. Husbands, wives, sons, daughters. He does not want that connection to form, but that does not stop it forming.’ ‘You’re talking about something very different.’ ‘No. No, I am not. This is a planet where a daydream can end in death, and where mathematicians can cause an apocalypse. That is my view of the humans. Is it any different from yours?’ ‘Humans learn the errors of their ways though,’ I said, ‘and they care more for each other than you think.’ ‘No. I know they care for each other when the other in question is like them, or lives under their roof, but any difference is a step further away from their empathy. They find it preposterously easy to fall out among themselves. Imagine what they would do to us, if they could.’ Of course, I had already imagined this and was scared of the answer. I was weakening. I felt tired and confused. ‘But we were sent here to kill them. What makes us any better?’ ‘We act as a result of logic, of rational thinking. We are here to preserve, even to preserve the humans. Think about it. Progress is a very dangerous thing for them. The boy must be killed, even if the woman can be saved. The boy knows. You told us yourself.’ You told us yourself.’ ‘You are making a little mistake.’ ‘What is my mistake?’ ‘You cannot kill a mother’s son without killing the mother.’ ‘You are speaking in riddles. You have become like them.’ I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. Gulliver would return home at any moment. I tried to think what to do. Maybe this other me, this ‘Jonathan’ was right. Well, there wasn’t really a maybe. He was right: the humans could not handle progress very well and they were not good at understanding their place in the world. They were, ultimately, a great danger to themselves and others. So I nodded, and I walked over and sat on that purple sofa. I felt sober now, and fully conscious of my pain. ‘You are right,’ I said. ‘You are right. And I want to help you.’ A game ‘I know you are right,’ I told him for the seventeenth time, looking straight into his eyes, ‘but I have been weak. I admit it to you now. I was and remain unable to harm any more humans, especially those ones I have lived with. But what you have said to me has reminded me of my original purpose. I am not able to fulfil that purpose and no longer have the gifts to do so, but equally I realise it has to be fulfilled, and so in a way I’m thankful you are here. I’ve been stupid. I’ve tried and I have failed.’ Jonathan sat back on the sofa and studied me. He stared at my bruises and sniffed the air between us. ‘You have been drinking alcohol.’ ‘Yes. I have been corrupted. It is very easy, I find, when you live like a human, to develop some of their bad habits. I have drunk alcohol. I have had sex. I have smoked cigarettes. I have eaten peanut butter sandwiches and listened to their simple music. I have felt many of the crude pleasures that they can feel, as well as physical and emotional pain. But still, despite my corruption, there remains enough of me left, enough of my clear rational self, to know what has to be done.’ He watched me. He believed me, because every word I was speaking was the truth. ‘I am comforted to hear this.’ I didn’t waste a moment. ‘Now listen to me. Gulliver will return home soon. He won’t be on a car or a bike. He’ll be walking. He likes to walk. We will hear his feet on the gravel, and then we will hear his key in the door. Normally, he heads straight into the kitchen to get himself a drink or a bowl of cereal. He eats around three bowls of cereal a day. Anyway, that is irrelevant. What is relevant is that he will most likely enter the kitchen first.’ Jonathan was paying close attention to everything I was telling him. It felt strange, terrible even, giving him this information, but I really couldn’t think of any other way. ‘You want to act fast,’ I said, ‘as his mother will be home soon. Also, there’s a chance he may be surprised to see you. You see, his mother has thrown me out of the house because I was unfaithful to her. Or rather the faith I had wasn’t the of the house because I was unfaithful to her. Or rather the faith I had wasn’t the right kind. Given the absence of mind-reading technology, humans believe monogamy is possible. Another fact to consider is that Gulliver has, quite independently, attempted to take his own life before. So, I suggest that however you choose to kill him it would be a good idea to make it look like suicide. Maybe after his heart has stopped, you could slice one of his wrists, cutting through the veins. That way, less suspicion will be aroused.’ Jonathan nodded, then looked around the room. At the television, the history books, the armchair, the framed art prints on the wall, the telephone in its cradle. ‘It will be a good idea to have the television on,’ I told him, ‘even if you are not in this room. Because I always watch the news and leave it on.’ He switched on the television. We sat and watched footage of war in the Middle East, without saying a word. But then he heard something that I couldn’t, his senses being so much sharper. ‘Footsteps,’ he said. ‘On the gravel.’ ‘He’s here,’ I said. ‘Go to the kitchen. I’ll hide.’ 90.2 MHz I waited in the sitting room. The door was closed. There would be no reason for Gulliver to enter here. Unlike the living room he hardly ever came into this room. I don’t think I’d ever heard him do so. So I stayed there, still and quiet, as the front door opened, then closed. He was unmoving, in the hallway. No footsteps. ‘Hello?’ Then a response. My voice but not my voice, coming from the kitchen. ‘Hello, Gulliver.’ ‘What are you doing here? Mum said you’d gone. She phoned me, said you’d had an argument.’ I heard him – me, Andrew, Jonathan – respond in measured words. ‘That is right. We did. We had an argument. Don’t worry, it wasn’t too serious.’ ‘Oh yeah? Sounded pretty serious from Mum’s side of things.’ Gulliver paused. ‘Whose are those clothes you’re wearing?’ ‘Oh, these, they’re just old ones I didn’t know I had.’ ‘I’ve never seen them before. And your face, it’s totally healed. You look completely better.’ ‘Well, there you go.’ ‘Right, anyway, I might go upstairs. I’ll get some food later.’ ‘No. No. You will stay right here.’ The mind patterning was beginning. His words were shepherds ushering away conscious thought. ‘You will stay here and you will take a knife – a sharp knife, the sharpest there is in this room—’ It was about to happen. I could feel it, so I did what I had planned to do. I went over to the bookcase and picked up the clockwork radio, turned the power dial through a full 360-degree rotation and pressed the button with the little green circle. On. The small display became illuminated: 90.2 MHz. Classical music blared out at almost full volume as I carried the radio back along the hallway. Unless I was very much mistaken it was Debussy. along the hallway. Unless I was very much mistaken it was Debussy. ‘You will now press that knife into your wrist and press it hard enough to cut through every vein.’ ‘What’s that noise?’ Gulliver asked, his head clearing. I still couldn’t see him. I still wasn’t quite at the kitchen doorway. ‘Just do it. End your life, Gulliver.’ I entered the kitchen and saw my doppelgänger facing away from me as he pressed his hand on to Gulliver’s head. The knife fell to the floor. It was like looking at a strange kind of human baptism. I knew that what he was doing was right, and logical, from his perspective, but perspective was a funny thing. Gulliver collapsed; his whole body was convulsing. I placed the radio down on the unit. The kitchen had its own radio. I switched that on, too. The TV was still on in the other room, as I had intended it to be. A cacophony of classical music and newsreaders and rock music filled the air as I reached Jonathan and pulled his arm so he now had no contact with Gulliver. He turned, held me by the throat, pressing me back against the refrigerator. ‘You have made a mistake,’ he said. Gulliver’s convulsions stopped and he looked around, confused. He saw two men, both identical, like his father, pressing into each other’s necks with equivalent force. I knew that, whatever else happened, I had to keep Jonathan in the kitchen. If he stayed in the kitchen, with the radios on and the TV in the next room, we would be equally matched. ‘Gulliver,’ I said. ‘Gulliver, give me the knife. Any knife. That knife. Give me that knife.’ ‘Dad? Are you my Dad?’ ‘Yes, I am. Now give me the knife.’ ‘Ignore him, Gulliver,’ Jonathan said. ‘He’s not your father. I am. He’s an imposter. He’s not what he looks like. He’s a monster. An alien. We have to destroy him.’ As we carried on, locked in our mutually futile combative pose, matching strength with strength, I saw Gulliver’s eyes fill with doubt. He looked at me. It was time for the truth. ‘I’m not your father. And neither is he. Your dad is dead, Gulliver. He died on Saturday, the seventeenth of April. He was taken by the . . .’ I thought of a way of putting it that he would understand. ‘. . . by the people we work for. They extracted information from him, and then they killed him. And they sent me here, as him, to kill you. And kill your mother. And anyone who knew about what he had achieved that day, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t do it because I what he had achieved that day, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t do it because I started, I started to feel something that was meant to be impossible . . . I empathised with you. Grew to like you. Worry about you. Love you both. And I gave everything up . . . I have no power, no strength.’ ‘Don’t listen to him, son,’ Jonathan said. And then he realised something. ‘Turn off the radios. Listen to me, turn off the radios now.’ I stared at Gulliver with pleading eyes. ‘Whatever you do, don’t turn them off. The signal interferes with the technology. It’s his left hand. His left hand. Everything is in his left hand . . .’ Gulliver was clambering upright. He looked numb. His face was unreadable. I thought hard. ‘The leaf!’ I yelled. ‘Gulliver, you were right. The leaf, remember, the leaf! And think of—’ It was then that the other version of myself smashed his head into my nose, with swift and brutal force. My head rebounded against the fridge door and everything dissolved. Colours faded, and the noise of the radios and the faraway newsreader swam into each other. A swirling audio soup. It was over. ‘Gulli—’ The other me switched one of the radios off. Debussy disappeared. But at the moment the music went away I heard a scream. It sounded like Gulliver. And it was, but it wasn’t a scream of pain. It was a scream of determination. A primal roar of rage, giving him the courage he needed to stab the knife that had been about to cut his own wrists into the back of a man who looked every inch his own father. And the knife went deep. With that roar, and that sight, the room sharpened into focus. I could get to my feet before Jonathan’s finger reached the second radio. I yanked him back by the hair. I saw his face. The pain clearly articulated in the way only human faces can manage. The eyes, shocked yet pleading. The mouth seeming to melt away. Melt away. Melt away. Melt away. The ultimate crime I would not look at his face again. He could not die while that technology remained inside him. I dragged him over to the Aga. ‘Lift it up,’ I ordered Gulliver. ‘Lift up the cover.’ ‘Cover?’ ‘The hot plate.’ He did it. He lifted the circular steel ring up and let it fall back, and he did so without a single question in his eyes. ‘Help me,’ I said. ‘He’s fighting. Help me with his arm.’ Together we had enough force to press his palm down to the burning metal. The scream, as we kept him there, was horrendous. Knowing what it was I was doing, it truly sounded like the end of the universe. I was committing the ultimate crime. I was destroying gifts, and killing one of my kind. ‘We’ve got to keep it there,’ I shouted to Gulliver. ‘We’ve got to keep it there! Hold! Hold! Hold!’ And then I switched my attention to Jonathan. ‘Tell them it is over,’ I whispered. ‘Tell them you have completed your mission. Tell them there has been a problem with the gifts and that you will not be able to return. Tell them, and I will stop the pain.’ A lie. And a gamble that they were tuned to him and not to me. But a necessary one. He told them, yet his pain continued. How long were we like this? Seconds? Minutes? It was like Einstein’s conundrum. The hot stove versus the pretty girl. Towards the end of it, Jonathan was on his knees, losing consciousness. Tears streamed down my face as I finally pulled that sticky mess of a hand away. I checked his pulse. He was gone. The knife pierced through his chest as he fell back. I looked at the hand, and this face, and it was clear. He was disconnected, not just from the hosts, but from life. The reason it was clear was that he was becoming himself – the cellular reconfiguration that automatically followed death. The whole shape of him was reconfiguration that automatically followed death. The whole shape of him was changing, curling in, his face flattening, his skull lengthening, his skin mottled shades of purple and violet. Only the knife in his back stayed. It was strange. Within the context of that Earth kitchen this creature, structured precisely as I had been, seemed entirely alien to me. A monster. A beast. Something other. Gulliver stared, but said nothing. The shock was so profound it was a challenge to breathe, let alone speak. I did not want to speak either, but for more practical reasons. Indeed, I worried that I may already have said too much. Maybe the hosts had heard everything I had said in that kitchen. I didn’t know. What I did know was that I had one more thing to do. They took your powers away, but they didn’t take theirs. But before I could do anything a car pulled up outside. Isobel was home. ‘Gulliver, it’s your mother. Keep her away. Warn her.’ He left the room. I turned back to the heat of that hot plate and positioned my hand next to where his had been, where pieces of his flesh still fizzed. And I pressed down, and felt a pure and total pain which took away space and time and guilt. The nature of reality Civilised life, you know, is based on a huge number of illusions in which we all collaborate willingly. The trouble is we forget after a while that they are illusions and we are deeply shocked when reality is torn down around us. – J.G. Ballard What was reality? An objective truth? A collective illusion? A majority opinion? The product of historical understanding? A dream? A dream. Well, yes, maybe. But if this had been a dream then it was one from which I hadn’t yet woken. But once humans really study things in depth – whether in the artificially divided fields of quantum physics or biology or neuroscience or mathematics or love – they come closer and closer to nonsense, irrationality and anarchy. Everything they know is disproved, over and over again. The Earth is not flat; leeches have no medicinal value; there is no God; progress is a myth; the present is all they have. And this doesn’t just happen on the big scale. It happens to each individual human too. In every life there is a moment. A crisis. One that says: what I believe is wrong. It happens to everyone, the only difference is how that knowledge changes them. In most cases, it is simply a case of burying that knowledge and pretending it isn’t there. That is how humans grow old. That is ultimately what creases their faces and curves their backs and shrinks their mouths and ambitions. The weight of that denial. The stress of it. This is not unique to humans. The single biggest act of bravery or madness anyone can do is the act of change. I was something. And now I am something else. I was a monster and now I am a different type of monster. One that will die, and feel pain, but one that will also live, and maybe even find happiness one day. Because happiness is possible for me now. It exists on the other side of the hurt. A face as shocked as the moon As for Gulliver, he was young, and could accept things better than his mother. His life had never really made sense to him so the final proof of its nonsensical nature was a kind of relief to him. He was someone who had lost a father and also someone who had killed, but the thing he had killed was something he didn’t understand and couldn’t relate to. He could have cried for a dead dog, but a dead Vonnadorian meant nothing to him. On the subject of grief, it was true that Gulliver was worried about his father, and wanted to know that he hadn’t felt any pain. I told him he hadn’t. Was that true? I didn’t know. That was part of being human, I discovered. It was about knowing which lies to tell, and when to tell them. To love someone is to lie to them. But I never saw him cry for his dad. I didn’t know why. Maybe it was hard to feel the loss of someone who had never really been there. Anyway, after dark he helped drag the body outside. Newton was awake now. He had woken after Jonathan’s technology had melted away. And now he accepted what he was seeing as dogs seemed to accept everything. There were no canine historians, so that made things easier. Nothing was unexpected. At one point he began digging in the ground, as if trying to help us, but that wasn’t required. No grave needed to be dug as the monster – and that was how I referred to it in my mind, the monster – would in its natural state decompose rapidly in this oxygen-rich atmosphere. It was quite a struggle, dragging him out there, especially given my burnt hand and the fact that Gulliver had to stop to be sick at one point. He looked dreadful. I remember watching him, staring at me from beneath his fringe, his face as shocked as the moon. Newton wasn’t our only observer. Isobel watched us in disbelief. I hadn’t wanted her to come outside and see but she did so. At that point she didn’t know everything. She didn’t know, for instance, that her husband was dead or that the corpse I was dragging looked, essentially, how I had once looked. She learnt these things slowly, but not slowly enough. She would have needed at least a couple of centuries to absorb these facts, maybe even more. It was like at least a couple of centuries to absorb these facts, maybe even more. It was like taking someone from Regency England to twenty-first century downtown Tokyo. She simply could not come to terms with it. After all, she was a historian. Someone whose job was to find patterns, continuities and causes, and to transform the past into a narrative that walked the same curving path. But on this path someone had now thrown something down from the sky that had landed so hard it had broken the ground, tilted the Earth, made the route impossible to navigate. Which is to say, she went to the doctor and asked for some tablets. The pills she was given didn’t help and she ended up staying in bed for three weeks through exhaustion. It was suggested that she might have an illness called ME. She didn’t, of course. She was suffering from grief. A grief for not just the loss of her husband but also the loss of familiar reality. She hated me, during that time. I had explained everything to her: that none of this had been my decision, that I had been sent here reluctantly with no task except to halt human progress and to act for the greater good of the entire cosmos. But she couldn’t look at me because she didn’t know what she was looking at. I had lied to her. I’d slept with her. I’d let her tend my wounds. But she hadn’t known who she had been sleeping with. It didn’t matter that I had fallen in love with her, and that it was that act of total defiance that had saved her life and Gulliver’s. No. That didn’t matter at all. I was a killer and, to her, an alien. My hand slowly healed. I went to the hospital and they gave me a transparent plastic glove to wear, filled with an antiseptic cream. At the hospital they asked me how it had happened and I told them I had been drunk and leant on the hot plate without thinking, and without feeling the pain until it was too late. The burns became blisters and the nurse burst them, and I watched with interest as clear liquid oozed out. Selfishly I had hoped at some point that my injured hand might trigger some sympathy from Isobel. I wanted to see those eyes again. Eyes that had gazed worriedly at my face after Gulliver had attacked me in his sleep. I briefly toyed with the idea that I should try and convince her that nothing I had told her was true. That we were more magic realism than science fiction, specifically that branch of literary fiction that comes complete with an unreliable narrator. That I wasn’t really an alien. That I was a human who’d had a breakdown, and there was nothing extraterrestrial or extramarital about me. Gulliver might have known what he had seen, but Gulliver had a fragile mind. I could easily have denied everything. A dog’s health fluctuates. People fall off roofs and survive. After all, humans – especially adult ones – want to believe the most mundane truths possible. They need to, in order to stop their world-views, most mundane truths possible. They need to, in order to stop their world-views, and their sanity, from capsizing and plunging them into the vast ocean of the incomprehensible. But it seemed too disrespectful, somehow, and I couldn’t do it. Lies were everywhere on this planet, but true love had its name for a reason. And if a narrator tells you it was all just a dream you want to tell him he has simply passed from one delusion into another one, and he could wake from this new reality at any time. You had to stay consistent to life’s delusions. All you had was your perspective, so objective truth was meaningless. You had to choose a dream and stick with it. Everything else was a con. And once you had tasted truth and love in the same potent cocktail there had to be no more tricks. But while I knew I couldn’t correct this version of things with any integrity, living with it was hard. You see, before coming to Earth I had never wanted or needed to be cared for, but I hungered now to have that feeling of being looked after, of belonging, of being loved. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe it was more than I deserved to be allowed to stay in the same house, even if I had to sleep on that hideous purple sofa. The only reason this was granted, I imagined, was Gulliver. Gulliver wanted me to stay. I had saved his life. I had helped him stand up to bullies. But his forgiveness still came as a surprise. Don’t get me wrong. It wasn’t Cinema Paradiso, but he seemed to accept me as an extraterrestrial life form far more easily than he had accepted me as a father. ‘Where are you from?’ he asked me, one Saturday morning, at five minutes to seven, before his mother was awake. ‘Far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far away.’ ‘How far is far?’ ‘It’s very hard to explain,’ I said. ‘I mean, you think France is far away.’ ‘Just try,’ he said. I noticed the fruit bowl. Only the day before, I had been to the supermarket buying healthy food the doctor had recommended for Isobel. Bananas, oranges, grapes, a grapefruit. ‘Okay,’ I said, grabbing the large grapefruit. ‘This is the sun.’ I placed the grapefruit on the coffee table. I then looked for the smallest grape I could find. I placed it at the other end of the table. ‘That is Earth, so small you can hardly see it.’ Newton stepped closer to the table, clearly attempting to annihilate Earth in his jaws. ‘No, Newton,’ I said. ‘Let me finish.’ his jaws. ‘No, Newton,’ I said. ‘Let me finish.’ Newton retreated, tail between his legs. Gulliver was frowning as he studied the grapefruit and the fragile little grape. He looked around. ‘So where is your planet?’ I think he honestly expected me to place the orange I was holding somewhere else in the room. By the television or on one of the bookshelves. Or maybe, at a pinch, upstairs. ‘To be accurate, this orange should be placed on a coffee table in New Zealand.’ He was silent for a moment, trying to understand the level of far-ness I was talking about. Still in a trance he asked, ‘Can I go there?’ ‘No. It’s impossible.’ ‘Why? There must have been a spaceship.’ I shook my head. ‘No. I didn’t travel. I may have arrived, but I didn’t travel.’ He was confused, so I explained, but then he was even more confused. ‘Anyway, the point is, there is no more chance of me crossing the universe now than any other human. This is who I am now, and this is where I have to stay.’ ‘You gave up the universe for a life on the sofa?’ ‘I didn’t realise that at the time.’ Isobel came downstairs. She was wearing her white dressing gown and her pyjamas. She was pale, but she was always pale in the morning. She looked at me and Gulliver talking, and for a moment, she seemed to greet the scene with a rarely seen fondness. But the expression faded as she remembered everything. ‘What’s going on?’ she asked. ‘Nothing,’ said Gulliver. ‘What is the fruit doing?’ she asked, traces of sleep still evident in her quiet voice. ‘I was explaining to Gulliver where I came from. How far away.’ ‘You came from a grapefruit?’ ‘No. The grapefruit is the sun. Your sun. Our sun. I lived on the orange. Which should be in New Zealand. Earth is now in Newton’s stomach.’ I smiled at her. I thought she might find this funny, but she just stared at me the way she had been staring at me for weeks. As if I were light years away from her. She left the room. ‘Gulliver,’ I said, ‘I think it would be best if I left. I shouldn’t have stayed, really. You see, this isn’t just about all this stuff. You know that argument me and your mother had? The one you never found out about?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘Well, I was unfaithful. I had sex with a woman called Maggie. One of my – your father’s – students. I didn’t enjoy it, but that was beside the point. I didn’t realise it would hurt your mother, but it did. I didn’t know the exact rules of fidelity but that isn’t really an excuse, or not one I can use, when I was deliberately lying about so many other things. When I was endangering her life, and yours.’ I sighed. ‘I think, I think I’m going to leave.’ ‘Why?’ That question tugged at me. It reached into my stomach, and pulled. ‘I just think it will be for the best, right now.’ ‘Where are you going to go?’ ‘I don’t know. Not yet. But don’t worry, I’ll tell you when I get there.’ His mother was back in the doorway. ‘I’m going to leave,’ I told her. She closed her eyes. She inhaled. ‘Yes,’ she said, with the mouth I had once kissed. ‘Yes. Maybe it is for the best.’ Her whole face crumpled, as if her skin were the emotion she wanted to screw up and throw away. My eyes felt a warm, gentle strain. My vision blurred. Then something ran down my cheek, all the way to my lips. A liquid. Like rain, but warmer. Saline. I had shed a tear. The second type of gravity Before I left I went upstairs to the attic. It was dark in there, except for the glow of the computer. Gulliver was lying on his bed, staring out of the window. ‘I’m not your dad, Gulliver. I don’t have a right to be here.’ ‘No. I know.’ Gulliver chewed on his wristband. Hostility glistened in his eyes like broken glass. ‘You’re not my dad. But you’re just like him. You don’t give a shit. And you shagged someone behind Mum’s back. He did that too, you know.’ ‘Listen, Gulliver, I’m not trying to leave you, I’m trying to bring back your mother, okay? She’s a bit lost right now and my presence here isn’t helping.’ ‘It’s just so fucked up. I feel totally alone.’ Sun suddenly shone through the window, oblivious to our mood. ‘Loneliness, Gulliver, is a fact as universal as hydrogen.’ He sighed a sigh that should really have belonged to an older human. ‘I just don’t feel cut out sometimes. You know, cut out for life. I mean, people at school, loads of their parents are divorced but they seem to have an okay relationship with their dads. And everyone’s always thought, with me, what excuse did I have to go off the rails? What was wrong with my life? Living in a nice house with rich non-divorced parents. What the fuck could possibly be wrong there? ‘But it was all bullshit. Mum and Dad never loved each other, not since I can remember anyway. Mum seemed to change after he had his breakdown – I mean, after you came – but that was just her delusion. I mean, you weren’t even who she thought you were. It’s come to something when you relate to ET more than your own dad. He was crap. Seriously, I can’t think of one piece of advice he gave me. Except I shouldn’t become an architect because architecture takes a hundred years to be appreciated.’ ‘Listen, you don’t need guidance, Gulliver. Everything you need is inside your own head. You have more knowledge about the universe than anyone on your own planet.’ I pointed at the window. ‘You’ve seen what’s out there. And also, I should say, you’ve shown yourself to be really strong.’ should say, you’ve shown yourself to be really strong.’ He stared out of the window again. ‘What’s it like up there?’ ‘Very different. Everything is different.’ ‘But how?’ ‘Well, just existing is different. No one dies. There’s no pain. Everything is beautiful. The only religion is mathematics. There are no families. There are the hosts – they give instructions – and there is everyone else. The advancement of mathematics and the security of the universe are the two concerns. There is no hatred. There are no fathers and sons. There is no clear line between biology and technology. And everything is violet.’ ‘It sounds awesome.’ ‘It’s dull. It’s the dullest life you can imagine. Here, you have pain, and loss, that’s the price. But the rewards can be wonderful Gulliver.’ He looked at me, disbelieving. ‘Yeah. Well, I don’t have a clue how to find them.’ The phone rang. Isobel answered. Moments later, she was calling up to the attic. ‘Gulliver, it’s for you. A girl. Nat.’ I couldn’t help but notice the faintest of faint smiles on Gulliver’s face, a smile he felt embarrassed about and tried to hide under clouds of discontent as he left the room. I sat and breathed, with lungs that would one day stop functioning but which still had a lot of warm clear air to inhale. Then I turned to Gulliver’s primitive Earth computer and began to type, giving as much advice as I could think of to help a human. Advice for a human 1. Shame is a shackle. Free yourself. 2. Don’t worry about your abilities. You have the ability to love. That is enough. 3. Be nice to other people. At the universal level, they are you. 4. Technology won’t save humankind. Humans will. 5. Laugh. It suits you. 6. Be curious. Question everything. A present fact is just a future fiction. 7. Irony is fine, but not as fine as feeling. 8. Peanut butter sandwiches go perfectly well with a glass of white wine. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 9. Sometimes, to be yourself you will have to forget yourself and become something else. Your character is not a fixed thing. You will sometimes have to move to keep up with it. 10. History is a branch of mathematics. So is literature. Economics is a branch of religion. 11. Sex can damage love but love can’t damage sex. 12. The news should start with mathematics, then poetry, and move down from there. 13. You shouldn’t have been born. Your existence is as close to impossible as can be. To dismiss the impossible is to dismiss yourself. 14. Your life will have 25,000 days in it. Make sure you remember some of them. 15. The road to snobbery is the road to misery. And vice versa. 16. Tragedy is just comedy that hasn’t come to fruition. One day we will laugh at this. We will laugh at everything. 17. Wear clothes, by all means, but remember they are clothes. 18. One life form’s gold is another life form’s tin can. 19. Read poetry. Especially poetry by Emily Dickinson. It might save you. Anne Sexton knows the mind, Walt Whitman knows grass, but Emily Dickinson knows everything. 20. If you become an architect, remember this: the square is nice. So is the 20. If you become an architect, remember this: the square is nice. So is the rectangle. But you can overdo it. 21. Don’t bother going into space until you can leave the solar system. Then go to Zabii. 22. Don’t worry about being angry. Worry when being angry becomes impossible. Because then you have been consumed. 23. Happiness is not out here. It is in there. 24. New technology, on Earth, just means something you will laugh at in five years. Value the stuff you won’t laugh at in five years. Like love. Or a good poem. Or a song. Or the sky. 25. There is only one genre in fiction. The genre is called ‘book’. 26. Never be too far away from a radio. A radio can save your life. 27. Dogs are geniuses of loyalty. And that is a good kind of genius to have. 28. Your mother should write a novel. Encourage her. 29. If there is a sunset, stop and look at it. Knowledge is finite. Wonder is infinite. 30. Don’t aim for perfection. Evolution, and life, only happen through mistakes. 31. Failure is a trick of the light. 32. You are human. You will care about money. But realise it can’t make you happy because happiness is not for sale. 33. You are not the most intelligent creature in the universe. You are not even the most intelligent creature on your planet. The tonal language in the song of a humpback whale displays more complexity than the entire works of Shakespeare. It is not a competition. Well, it is. But don’t worry about it. 34. David Bowie’s ‘Space Oddity’ tells you nothing about space, but its musical patterns are very pleasing to the ears. 35. When you look up at the sky, on a clear night, and see thousands of stars and planets, realise that very little is happening on most of them. The important stuff is further away. 36. One day humans will live on Mars. But nothing there will be more exciting than a single overcast morning on Earth. 37. Don’t always try to be cool. The whole universe is cool. It’s the warm bits that matter. 38. Walt Whitman was right about at least one thing. You will contradict yourself. You are large. You contain multitudes. 39. No one is ever completely right about anything. Anywhere. 40. Everyone is a comedy. If people are laughing at you they just don’t quite understand the joke that is themselves. 41. Your brain is open. Never let it be closed. 42. In a thousand years, if humans survive that long, everything you know will 42. In a thousand years, if humans survive that long, everything you know will have been disproved. And replaced by even bigger myths. 43. Everything matters. 44. You have the power to stop time. You do it by kissing. Or listening to music. Music, by the way, is how you see things you can’t otherwise see. It is the most advanced thing you have. It is a superpower. Keep up with the bass guitar. You are good at it. Join a band. 45. My friend Ari was one of the wisest humans who ever lived. Read him. 46. A paradox. The things you don’t need to live – books, art, cinema, wine and so on – are the things you need to live. 47. A cow is a cow even if you call it beef. 48. No two moralities match. Accept different shapes, so long as they aren’t sharp enough to hurt. 49. Don’t be scared of anyone. You killed an alien assassin sent from the other side of the universe with a bread knife. Also, you have a very hard punch. 50. At some point, bad things are going to happen. Have someone to hold on to. 51. Alcohol in the evening is very enjoyable. Hangovers in the morning are very unpleasant. At some point you have to choose: evenings, or mornings. 52. If you are laughing, check that you don’t really want to cry. And vice versa. 53. Don’t ever be afraid of telling someone you love them. There are things wrong with your world, but an excess of love is not one. 54. That girl you are on the phone to. There will be others. But I hope she is nice. 55. You are not the only species on Earth with technology. Look at ants. Really. Look. What they do with twigs and leaves is quite amazing. 56. Your mother loved your father. Even if she pretends she didn’t. 57. There are a lot of idiots in your species. Lots and lots. You are not one of them. Hold your ground. 58. It is not the length of life that matters. It’s the depth. But while burrowing, keep the sun above you. 59. Numbers are pretty. Prime numbers are beautiful. Understand that. 60. Obey your head. Obey your heart. Obey your gut. In fact, obey everything except commands. 61. One day, if you get into a position of power, tell people this: just because you can, it doesn’t mean you should. There is a power and a beauty in unproved conjectures, unkissed lips and unpicked flowers. 62. Start fires. But only metaphorically. Unless you are cold and it’s a safe setting. In which case: start fires. 63. It’s not the technique, it’s the method. It’s not the words, it’s the melody. 64. Be alive. That is your supreme duty to the world. 64. Be alive. That is your supreme duty to the world. 65. Don’t think you know. Know you think. 66. As a black hole forms it creates an immense gamma-ray burst, blinding whole galaxies with light and destroying millions of worlds. You could disappear at any second. This one. Or this one. Or this one. Make sure, as often as possible, you are doing something you’d be happy to die doing. 67. War is the answer. To the wrong question. 68. Physical attraction is, primarily, glandular. 69. Ari believed we are all a simulation. Matter is an illusion. Everything is silicon. He could be right. But your emotions? They’re solid. 70. It’s not you. It’s them. (No, really. It is.) 71. Walk Newton whenever you can. He likes to get out of the house. And he is a lovely dog. 72. Most humans don’t think about things very much. They survive by thinking about needs and wants alone. But you are not one of them. Be careful. 73. No one will understand you. It is not, ultimately, that important. What is important is that you understand you. 74. A quark is not the smallest thing. The wish you have on your death-bed – to have worked harder – that is the smallest thing. Because it won’t be there. 75. Politeness is often fear. Kindness is always courage. But caring is what makes you human. Care more, become more human. 76. In your mind, change the name of every day to Saturday. And change the name of work to play. 77. When you watch the news and see members of your species in turmoil, do not think there is nothing you can do. But know it is not done by watching news. 78. You get up. You put on your clothes. And then you put on your personality. Choose wisely. 79. Leonardo da Vinci was not one of you. He was one of us. 80. Language is euphemism. Love is truth. 81. You can’t find happiness looking for the meaning of life. Meaning is only the third most important thing. It comes after loving and being. 82. If you think something is ugly, look harder. Ugliness is just a failure of seeing. 83. A watched pot never boils. That is all you need to know about quantum physics. 84. You are more than the sum of your particles. And that is quite a sum. 85. The Dark Ages never ended. (But don’t tell your mother.) 86. To like something is to insult it. Love it or hate it. Be passionate. As civilisation advances, so does indifference. It is a disease. Immunise yourself civilisation advances, so does indifference. It is a disease. Immunise yourself with art. And love. 87. Dark matter is needed to hold galaxies together. Your mind is a galaxy. More dark than light. But the light makes it worthwhile. 88. Which is to say: don’t kill yourself. Even when the darkness is total. Always know that life is not still. Time is space. You are moving through that galaxy. Wait for the stars. 89. At the sub-atomic level, everything is complex. But you do not live at the sub-atomic level. You have the right to simplify. If you don’t, you will go insane. 90. But know this. Men are not from Mars. Women are not from Venus. Do not fall for categories. Everyone is everything. Every ingredient inside a star is inside you, and every personality that ever existed competes in the theatre of your mind for the main role. 91. You are lucky to be alive. Inhale and take in life’s wonders. Never take so much as a single petal of a single flower for granted. 92. If you have children and love one more than another, work at it. They will know, even if it’s by a single atom less. A single atom is all you need to make a very big explosion. 93. School is a joke. But go along with it, because you are very near to the punchline. 94. You don’t have to be an academic. You don’t have to be anything. Don’t force it. Feel your way, and don’t stop feeling your way until something fits. Maybe nothing will. Maybe you are a road, not a destination. That is fine. Be a road. But make sure it’s one with something to look at out of the window. 95. Be kind to your mother. And try and make her happy. 96. You are a good human, Gulliver Martin. 97. I love you. Remember that. A very brief hug I packed a bag full of Andrew Martin’s clothes and then I left. ‘Where are you going to go?’ asked Isobel. ‘I don’t know. I’ll find somewhere. Don’t worry.’ She looked like she was going to worry. We hugged. I longed to hear her hum the theme to Cinema Paradiso. I longed to hear her talk to me about Alfred the Great. I longed for her to make me a sandwich, or pour TCP on a swab of cotton wool. I longed to hear her share her worries about work, or Gulliver. But she wouldn’t. She couldn’t. The hug ended. Newton, by her side, looked up at me with the most forlorn eyes. ‘Goodbye,’ I said. And I walked across the gravel, towards the road and somewhere in the universe of my soul a fiery, life-giving star collapsed, and a very black hole began to form. The melancholy beauty of the setting sun Sometimes the hardest thing to do is just to stay human. – Michael Franti The thing with black holes, of course, is that they are really very neat and tidy. There is no mess inside a black hole. All the disordered stuff that goes through the event horizon, all that in-falling matter and radiation, is compressed to the smallest state it can possibly be. A state that might easily be called nothing at all. Black holes, in other words, give clarity. You lose the warmth and fire of the star but you gain order and peace. Total focus. That is to say, I knew what to do. I would stay as Andrew Martin. This was what Isobel wanted. You see, she wanted the least fuss possible. She didn’t want a scandal, or a missing person’s inquiry, or a funeral. So, doing what I thought was best, I moved out, rented a small flat in Cambridge for a while, and then I applied for jobs elsewhere in the world. Eventually, I got a teaching job in America, at Stanford University in California. Once there, I did as well as I needed to do while making sure I didn’t do anything to advance any mathematical understanding that would lead to a leap in technological progress. Indeed, I had a poster on my office wall with a photograph of Albert Einstein on it, and one of his famous statements: ‘Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological animal.’ I never mentioned anything about a proof of the Riemann hypothesis, except to persuade my peers of its inherent impossibility. My main motive for doing so was to make sure no Vonnadorian ever had need to visit Earth. But also, Einstein was right. Humans weren’t good at handling progress and I didn’t want to see more destruction than necessary inflicted on or by this planet. I lived on my own. I had a nice apartment in Palo Alto that I filled with plants. I got drunk, got high, got lower than low. I painted some art, ate peanut butter breakfasts, and once went to an arthouse cinema to watch three films by Fellini in a row. cinema to watch three films by Fellini in a row. I caught a cold, got tinnitus and consumed a poisoned prawn. I bought myself a globe, and I would often sit there, spinning it. I felt blue with sadness, red with rage and green with envy. I felt the entire human rainbow. I walked a dog for an elderly lady in the apartment above me, but the dog was never quite Newton. I talked over warm champagne at stifling academic functions. I shouted in forests just to hear the echo. And every night I would go back and re-read Emily Dickinson. I was lonely, but at the same time I appreciated other humans a bit more than they appreciated themselves. After all, I knew you could journey for light years and not come across a single one. On occasion, I would weep just looking at them, sitting in one of the vast libraries on campus. Sometimes I would wake up at three in the morning and find myself crying for no specific reason. At other times I would sit on my beanbag and stare into space, watching motes of dust suspended in sunlight. I tried not to make any friends. I knew that as friendships progressed questions would get more intrusive, and I didn’t want to lie to people. People would ask about my past, where I was from, my childhood. Sometimes a student or a fellow lecturer would look at my hand, at the scarred and purple skin, but they would never pry. It was a happy place, Stanford University. All the students wore smiles and red sweaters and looked very tanned and healthy for life forms who spent their entire days in front of computer screens. I would walk like a ghost through the bustle of the quad, breathing that warm air, trying not to be terrified by the scale of human ambition surrounding me. I got drunk a lot on white wine, which made me a rarity. No one seemed to have hangovers at this place. Also, I didn’t like frozen yoghurt – a big problem, as everyone at Stanford lived on frozen yoghurt. I bought myself music. Debussy, Ennio Morricone, the Beach Boys, Al Greene. I watched Cinema Paradiso. There was a Talking Heads song called ‘This Must Be the Place’ which I played over and over again, even though doing so made me feel melancholy and crave to hear her voice again, or to hear Gulliver’s footsteps on the stairs. I read a lot of poetry, too, though that often had a similar effect. One day I was in the campus bookstore and saw a copy of The Dark Ages by Isobel Martin. I stood there for what must have been the best part of half an hour reading her words aloud. ‘Freshly ravaged by the Vikings,’ I’d say, reading the penultimate page, ‘England was in a desperate state, and responded with a brutal massacre of Danish settlers in 1002. Over the next decade, this unrest was shown to breed even greater violence as the Danes embarked on a series of reprisals, culminating in Danish rule of England in 1013 . . .’ I pressed the page to my face, imagining it was her skin. I travelled with my work. I went to Paris, Boston, Rome, São Paolo, Berlin, Madrid, Tokyo. I wanted to fill my mind with human faces, in order to forget Isobel’s. But it had the opposite effect. By studying the entire human species, I felt more towards her specifically. By thinking of the cloud, I thirsted for the raindrop. So I stopped my travels and returned to Stanford, and tried a different tactic. I tried to lose myself in nature. The highlight of my day became the evening, when I would get in my car and drive out of town. Often I would head to the Santa Cruz mountains. There was a place there called the Big Basin Redwoods State Park. I would park my car and walk around, gazing in wonder at the giant trees, spotting jays and woodpeckers, chipmunks and racoons, occasionally a black-tailed deer. Sometimes, if I was early enough, I would walk down the steep path near Berry Creek Falls, listening to the rush of water which would often be joined by the low croak of tree frogs. At other times I would drive along Highway One and go to the beach to watch the sunset. Sunsets were beautiful here. I became quite hypnotised by them. In the past they had meant nothing to me. After all, a sunset was nothing really but the slowing down of light. At sunset light has more to get through, and is scattered by cloud droplets and air particles. But since becoming human I was just transfixed by the colours. Red, orange, pink. Sometimes there would be haunting traces of violet, too. I would sit on the beach, as waves crashed and retreated over the sparkling sand like lost dreams. All those oblivious molecules, joining together, creating something of improbable wonder. Often such sights were blurred by tears. I felt the beautiful melancholy of being human, captured perfectly in the setting of a sun. Because, as with a sunset, to be human was to be in-between things; a day, bursting with desperate colour as it headed irreversibly towards night. One night I stayed sitting on the beach as dusk fell. A fortysomething woman walked along, bare-footed, with a spaniel and her teenage son. Even though this woman looked quite different from Isobel, and though the son was blond, the sight caused my stomach to flip and my sinuses to loosen. I realised that six thousand miles could be an infinitely long distance. ‘I am such a human,’ I told my espadrilles. I meant it. Not only had I lost the gifts, emotionally I was as weak as any of them. I thought of Isobel, sitting and reading about Alfred the Great or them. I thought of Isobel, sitting and reading about Alfred the Great or Carolingian Europe or the ancient Library of Alexandria. This was, I realised, a beautiful planet. Maybe it was the most beautiful of all. But beauty creates its own troubles. You look at a waterfall or an ocean or a sunset and you find yourself wanting to share it with someone. ‘Beauty—be not caused—,’ said Emily Dickinson. ‘It is.’ In one way she was wrong. The scattering of light over a long distance creates a sunset. The crashing of ocean waves on a beach is created by tides which are themselves the result of gravitational forces exerted by the sun and the moon and the rotation of the Earth. Those are causes. The mystery lies in how those things become beautiful. And they wouldn’t have been beautiful once, at least not to my eyes. To experience beauty on Earth you needed to experience pain and to know mortality. That is why so much that is beautiful on this planet has to do with time passing and the Earth turning. Which might also explain why to look at such natural beauty was to also feel sadness and a craving for a life unlived. It was this particular kind of sadness that I felt, that evening. It came with its own gravitational pull, tugging me eastwards towards England. I told myself I just wanted to see them again, one last time. I just wanted to catch sight of them from a distance, to see with my own eyes that they were safe. And, by pure coincidence, about two weeks later I was invited to Cambridge to take part in a series of lectures debating the relationship between mathematics and technology. My head of department, a resilient and jolly fellow called Christos, told me he thought I should go. ‘Yes, Christos,’ I said, as we stood on a corridor floor made of polished pinewood. ‘I think I might.’ When galaxies collide I stayed in student accommodation in Corpus Christi, of all places, and tried to keep a low profile. I had grown a beard now, was tanned, and had put on a bit of weight, so people tended not to recognise me. I did my lecture. To quite a few jeers I told my fellow academics that I thought mathematics was an incredibly dangerous territory and that humans had explored it as fully as they could. To advance further, I told them, would be to head into a no-man’s- land full of unknown perils. Among the audience was a pretty red-haired woman who I recognised instantly as Maggie. She came up to me afterwards and asked if I’d like to go to the Hat and Feathers. I said no, and she seemed to know I meant it, and after posing a jovial question about my beard, she left the hall. After that, I went for a walk, naturally gravitating towards Isobel’s college. I didn’t go too far before I saw her. She was walking on the other side of the street and she didn’t see me. It was strange, the significance of that moment for me and the insignificance of it for her. But then I reminded myself that when galaxies collide they pass right through. I could hardly breathe, watching her, and didn’t even notice it was beginning to rain. I was just mesmerised by her. All eleven trillion cells of her. Another strange thing was how absence had intensified my feelings for her. How I craved the sweet everyday reality of just being with her, of having a mundane conversation about how our days had been. The gentle but unbettered comfort of coexistence. I couldn’t think of a better purpose for the universe than for her to be in it. She pulled open her umbrella as if she were just any woman pulling open an umbrella, and she kept on walking, stopping only to give some money to a homeless man with a long coat and a bad leg. It was Winston Churchill. Home One can’t love and do nothing. – Graham Greene, The End of the Affair Knowing I couldn’t follow Isobel, but feeling a need to connect with someone, I followed Winston Churchill instead. I followed slowly, ignoring the rain, feeling happy I had seen Isobel and that she was alive and safe and as quietly beautiful as she had always been (even when I had been too blind to appreciate this). Winston Churchill was heading for the park. It was the same park where Gulliver walked Newton, but I knew it was too early in the afternoon for me to bump into them, so I kept following. He walked slowly, pulling his leg along as if it were three times as heavy as the rest of him. Eventually, he reached a bench. It was painted green, this bench, but the paint was flaking off to reveal the wood underneath. I sat down on it too. We sat in rain-soaked silence for a while. He offered me a swig of his cider. I told him I was okay. I think he recognised me but I wasn’t sure. ‘I had everything once,’ he said. ‘Everything?’ ‘A house, a car, a job, a woman, a kid.’ ‘Oh, how did you lose them?’ ‘My two churches. The betting shop and the off-licence. And it’s been downhill all the way. And now I’m here with nothing, but I am myself with nothing. An honest bloody nothing.’ ‘Well, I know how you feel.’ Winston Churchill looked doubtful. ‘Yeah. Right you are, fella.’ ‘I gave up eternal life.’ ‘Ah, so you were religious?’ ‘Something like that.’ ‘And now you’re down here sinning like the rest of us.’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘Well, just don’t try and touch my leg again and we’ll get on fine.’ ‘Well, just don’t try and touch my leg again and we’ll get on fine.’ I smiled. He did recognise me. ‘I won’t. I promise.’ ‘So, what made you give up on eternity if you don’t mind me askin’?’ ‘I don’t know. I’m still working it out.’ ‘Good luck with that, fella, good luck with that.’ ‘Thanks.’ He scratched his cheek and gave a nervous whistle. ‘Eh, you haven’t got any money on you, have you?’ I pulled a ten-pound note out of my pocket. ‘You’re a star, fella.’ ‘Well, maybe we all are,’ I said, looking skyward. And that was the end of our conversation. He had run out of cider and had no more reason to stay. So he stood up and walked away, wincing in pain from his damaged leg, as a breeze tilted flowers towards him. It was strange. Why did I feel this lack inside me? This need to belong? The rain stopped. The sky was clear now. I stayed where I was, on a bench covered with slow-evaporating raindrops. I knew it was getting later, and knew I should probably be heading back to Corpus Christi, but I didn’t have the incentive to move. What was I doing here? What was my function, now, in the universe? I considered, I considered, I considered, and felt a strange sensation. A kind of sliding into focus. I realised, though I was on Earth, I had been living this past year as I had always lived. I was just thinking I could carry on, moving forward. But I was not me any more. I was a human, give or take. And humans are about change. That is how they survive, by doing and un-doing and doing again. I had done some things I couldn’t undo, but there were others I could amend. I had become a human by betraying rationality and obeying feeling. To stay me, I knew there would come a point when I would have to do the same again. Time passed. Squinting, I looked again to the sky. The Earth’s sun can look very much alone, yet it has relatives all across this galaxy, stars that were born in the exact same place, but which were now very far away from each other, lighting very different worlds. I was like a sun. I was a long way from where I started. And I have changed. Once I thought I could pass through time like a neutrino passes through matter, effortlessly and without stopping to think, because time would never run out. As I sat there on that bench a dog came up to me. Its nose pressed into my leg. ‘Hello,’ I whispered, pretending not to know this particular English Springer Spaniel. But his pleading eyes stayed on me, even as he angled his nose towards his hip. His arthritis had come back. He was in pain. I stroked him and held my hand in place, instinctively, but of course I couldn’t heal him this time. Then a voice behind me. ‘Dogs are better than human beings because they know but don’t tell.’ I turned. A tall boy with dark hair and pale skin and a tentative nervous smile. ‘Gulliver.’ He kept his eyes on Newton. ‘You were right about Emily Dickinson.’ ‘Sorry?’ ‘Part of your advice. I read her.’ ‘Oh. Oh yes. She was a very good poet.’ He moved around the bench, sat down next to me. I noticed he was older. Not only was he quoting poetry but his skull had become more man-shaped. There was a slight trace of dark beneath the skin on his jaw. His T-shirt said ‘The Lost’ – he had finally joined the band. If I can stop one heart from breaking, that poet said, I shall not live in vain. ‘How are you?’ I asked, as if he were a casual acquaintance I often bumped into. ‘I haven’t tried to kill myself, if that’s what you mean.’ ‘And how is she?’ I asked. ‘Your mother?’ Newton came over with a stick, dropped it for me to throw. Which I did. ‘She misses you.’ ‘Me? Or your dad?’ ‘You. You’re the one who looked after us.’ ‘I don’t have any powers to look after you now. If you chose to jump off a roof then you’d probably die.’ ‘I don’t jump off roofs any more.’ ‘Good,’ I said. ‘That’s progress.’ There was a long silence. ‘I think she wants you to come back.’ ‘Does she say that?’ ‘No. But I think she does.’ The words were rain in a desert. After a while I said, in a quiet and neutral tone, ‘I don’t know if that would be wise. It’s easy to misunderstand your mother. And even if you haven’t got it wrong there could be all kinds of difficulties. I mean, what would she even call me? I don’t have a name. It would be wrong for her to call me Andrew.’ I paused. ‘Do you think she really misses me?’ me?’ He shrugged. ‘Yeah. I think so.’ ‘What about you?’ ‘I miss you, too.’ Sentimentality is another human flaw. A distortion. Another twisted by- product of love, serving no rational purpose. And yet, there was a force behind it as authentic as any other. ‘I miss you, too,’ I said. ‘I miss both of you.’ It was evening. The clouds were orange, pink and purple. Was this what I had wanted? Was this why I had come back to Cambridge? We talked. The light faded. Gulliver attached the lead to Newton’s collar. The dog’s eyes spoke sad warmth. ‘You know where we live,’ said Gulliver. I nodded. ‘Yes. I do.’ I watched him leave. The joke of the universe. A noble human, with thousands of days to live. It made no logical sense that I had developed into someone who wanted those days to be as happy and secure for him as they could possibly be, but if you came to Earth looking for logical sense you were missing the point. You were missing lots of things. I sat back and absorbed the sky and tried not to understand anything at all. I sat there until it was night. Until distant suns and planets shone above me, like a giant advert for better living. On other, more enlightened planets, there was the peace and calm and logic that so often came with advanced intelligence. I wanted none of it, I realised. What I wanted was that most exotic of all things. I had no idea if that was possible. It probably wasn’t, but I needed to find out. I wanted to live with people I could care for and who would care for me. I wanted family. I wanted happiness, not tomorrow or yesterday, but now. What I wanted, in fact, was to go home. So, I stood up. It was only a short walk away. Home – is where I want to be But I guess I’m already there I come home – she lifted up her wings Guess that this must be the place. – Talking Heads, ‘This Must Be the Place’ A note, and some acknowledgements I first had the idea of writing this story in 2000, when I was in the grips of panic disorder. Back then, human life felt as strange for me as it does for the unnamed narrator. I was living in a state of intense but irrational fear that meant I couldn’t even go to a shop on my own – or anywhere – without suffering a panic attack. The only thing I could do to gain a degree of calm was read. It was a breakdown, of sorts, though as R.D. Laing (and later Jerry Maguire) famously said, breakdown is very often breakthrough and, weirdly, I don’t regret that personal hell now. I got better. Reading helped. Writing helped also. This is why I became a writer. I discovered that words and stories provided maps of sorts, ways of finding your way back to yourself. I truly believe in the power of fiction to save lives and minds, for this reason. But it has taken me a lot of books to get to this one, the story I first wanted to tell. The one that attempted a look at the weird and often frightening beauty of being human. So, why the delay? I suppose I needed a bit of distance from the person I had been, because even though the subject matter is far from autobiographical, it felt too personal, maybe because I knew the dark well from where the idea – jokes and all – first came from. The writing proved a joy. I imagined writing it for myself in 2000, or someone in a similar state. I was trying to offer a map, but also to cheer that someone up. Maybe because the idea had been fermenting so long the words were all there, and the story came in a torrent. Not that it didn’t need editing. Indeed, never has a story I have written needed an editor more, so I am very grateful to have one as wise as Francis Bickmore at Canongate. Among other things he told me that a board meeting in outer space might not be the best way to start, and crucially got me to think of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and bleed the weirdness in gradually. It was wonderful, though, to have an editor telling me to put stuff back in just as often as he was saying leave things out. Thanks also to the other important early eyes on this.

They include my agent Caradoc King, along with Louise Lamont and Elinor Cooper at AP Watt/United Agents, my US editor Millicent Bennet at Simon and Schuster, Kate Cassaday at Harper Collins Canada and film producer Tanya Seghatchian, for whom I’m now writing the screenplay. Tanya is just about the best person anyone could have on their side, and I feel particular loyalty to her as she has supported and assisted my work since my very first novel, and a meeting in a coffee shop nearly a decade ago. I must thank all my lucky stars for having the support of Jamie Byng and Canongate, who are the most passionate publishers a writer could ask for.

Thank you, humans\\" Explain the context of the quotation \\"The single biggest act of bravery or madness anyone can do is the act of change.” Is this quotation important in life?","completion":"The quotation \\"The single biggest act of bravery or madness anyone can do is the act of change\\" reflects the idea that change, either self-initiated or imposed by external circumstances, is a profound and significant act that requires courage. It also suggests that change can be perceived as madness by those who value stability and the status quo. This concept is crucial both within the narrative of \\"The Humans\\" and in life more broadly. In the story, the alien protagonist undergoes profound changes as he inhabits a human body and begins to develop human emotions, connections, and understanding. This transformation is both brave, because it challenges his previous existence and beliefs, and potentially mad, as it defies the logic and mission he was originally sent to accomplish. His experience mirrors the human condition—where change is often necessary for growth, development, and the pursuit of happiness, even though it can be fraught with uncertainty and difficulty. In life, the quotation holds importance because change is inevitable. Individuals often face pivotal moments that require them to adapt, grow, and sometimes fundamentally alter their perspectives or ways of living. Those who embrace change can unlock new opportunities and personal growth, while those who resist might find it harder to cope with life's challenges. As such, the act of change is intertwined with both personal bravery and the risk of losing oneself or one's bearings, making it an essential aspect of the human experience."},{"prompt":"Explain the context of the quotation \\"The single biggest act of bravery or madness anyone can do is the act of change.” deeper and use examples from the book also respond as if you're having a book talk and talking to others about it","completion":"Welcome to our book talk, everyone. Today, I want to focus on a significant idea from \\"The Humans\\" by Matt Haig, which is relevant to both the novel's narrative arc and to our own human experience. The quotation we'll be examining is: \\"The single biggest act of bravery or madness anyone can do is the act of change.” The protagonist of \\"The Humans,\\" an alien who takes on a human form, embodies this quotation. Throughout the novel, we witness him undergo a series of profound changes. Initially sent on a mission to prevent humans from advancing mathematically, he soon finds himself irreversibly altered by the very species he was meant to suppress. His journey of assimilating human emotions, forming relationships, and developing empathy represents an overarching theme in the narrative: change is both brave and mad. The bravery comes from his willingness to step into the unknown, to risk his existence as he knows it for the sake of connections he once thought irrelevant or even dangerous. This is seen in the way he starts to care for the dog, Newton, and how he forms a bond with the family he was meant to fool. He even begins to appreciate the beauty of life's simplicities such as music and art, which for his species are redundant. Consider the example of the protagonist's relationship with Emily Dickinson's poetry. For someone whose existence is based on logic and data, the embrace of human poetry is a significant departure from the known. However, it's precisely this change that opens a window into his soul, allowing him to experience life in a way that's completely new to him. However, this could also be seen as madness due to the sheer risk involved in exposing himself to emotions and connections that are alien to his species. His changes are contrary to his initial mission and go against the logic of his own kind, challenging the very essence of his being. This abandonment of what is known and understood can be interpreted as madness, especially when viewed through the lens of his alien contemporaries. As we translate this concept of change into our lived reality, we find that it's deeply applicable to our own experiences. Change demands that we leave behind the security of the known—like changing jobs, moving to a new place, or ending a relationship. It requires us to disarm the comfort of our current understanding and to face the potential for great personal upheaval. Think about moments in history where individuals have stepped into the unknown, like Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat on the bus. This act of change was not only brave but had an air of madness in the context of the time—an admirable madness that spurred a movement. In our lives, the act of change can also come in smaller, more personal forms—leaving a secure job to pursue your passion, for example. This brings us to question, how does one measure the success of change? Is it in the attainment of a goal, or in the growth and resilience developed through the process? \\"The Humans\\" provides us with a lens to understand that change is intrinsic to life, and the measure of its 'success' is perhaps more intangible than outcomes. Change shapes our narratives, for better or worse, and it’s within this journey that we find the crux of being human. So, as we discuss this pivotal theme of the novel, let’s consider our own experiences with change. Have you ever taken a leap into the unknown? Was it bravery, madness, or a bit of both? How does this idea resonate with your own life story? Let's share some thoughts."},{"prompt":"Какие есть онлайн сервисы для дампа библиотеки . so","completion":"Если вы хотите проанализировать или \\"дампить\\" информацию о библиотеке .so (Shared Object) в Linux, то есть несколько инструментов, которые могут вам в этом помочь.

Shorten and amend for readability. Make all the characters into adults and change the scenario to fit that change appropriately (obviously babysitters and aunts are out): Katy had just been dropped off at her aunt Crystal’s house after begging her mom to take her. “Be good for aunt Crystal!” Said Katy’s mom, as she headed out the front door. “I will mommy!” Katy yelled back. Katy was amazed by her aunt, because her aunt was a hypnotherapist. “I wanna be just like you when I grow up, aunt Crystal!” Crystal let out a little chuckle, putting her hand on the young girl’s head. “Maybe you will be! Now you be good and watch TV. I need to get some work done.” Katy looked a bit disappointed. She thought that her aunt would have time to play with her. “Okay…” She said, turning away with a sigh. She headed over to the couch and turned the TV on with the remote, putting on cartoons. After about 10 minutes, Katy was getting bored. She noticed that the door to Crystal’s office was open while Crystal was in the bathroom. Katy giggled, before getting up to get a closer look. The girl sneaked into the room quietly and closed the door. Inside, she was quite fascinated with her aunt’s office. Some sort of certificate was hanging on the wall in a fancy frame, there was a wooden desk with a comfortable looking chair, and an even more comfortable looking couch in the room as well. But the most interesting thing in the room by far, was the big, black and white spiral wheel against the wall across from the couch. “Oooh, that’s so pretty!” Little Katy said, in awe of the wheel. “This most be what aunt Crystal hypnotizes people with! I wonder if she used it on mommy, hehe.” She said, giving it a spin with her hand. It looked so pretty, watching the spiral spin around and around, Katy just couldn’t look away… Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Katy quickly looked around, disoriented and nervous. “Open the door, Katy! You’re not supposed to be in my office, sweetie!” Came a voice yelling from the other side of the door. Katy didn’t know what to do. She didn’t want to be in trouble… “Uh, s-sorry! One second!” She yelled back, getting an idea. She spotted a button on the wall and pressed it. The button made the spiral wheel begin to spin again, but this time, it wouldn’t stop unless the button was pressed for a second time. Katy opened the door slowly, but stayed behind the door as she opened it, hiding. “Gosh, Katy! Don’t-” Said Crystal, before realizing there was no one there. “I just heard you. Where did you… go…” Her eyes were brought to the spiral, that same spiral that she had used to hypnotize Katy’s mom and all of her hypnotherapy patients. It had been quite awhile since she had last stared into it herself. “K-Katy… where are you… sweetie?” Katy peaked out from behind the door, spotting her aunt standing still, a bit hunched over and looking directly into the spiral spinning on the wall. “Hehe… Are you looking at the spiral, aunt Crystal? Isn’t it soooo pretty?” The spiral was indeed pretty, gorgeous even. Crystal knew that from how easily it mesmerized her patients… and even herself. “Yes… soo pretty…” Katy smiled deviously. This was perfect! Her aunt was under her control! Well she hoped. Did just watching the spiral for that little bit turn her into a toy for Katy to play with? It was time to find out. “Aunt Crystal, start acting like a monkey!” The girl shouted out, excited. Without even thinking, Crystal held her arms out beside her and began walking around in a funny way, looking around the room with widened eyes and an open mouth. “OOH OOH OOH!” She said with a deep voice, like an ape. “Ahahahaha!” Katy bursted into laughter, holding her hand over her mouth as she pointed at Crystal in amusement. “Oh my gosh! You think you’re a monkey! Go get a banana!” Crystal perked up. “OOH?” A banana sounded delicious! She quickly made her way to the kitchen, walking just like the silly monkey she thought she was. She picked up a banana and sat on the floor to peel it. But instead of using her hands, Crystal did just like a monkey would do, and used her feet and toes like hands to peel the banana before eating it! She ate the banana quickly, enjoying every bite. “Haha, was that a good banana?” Asked Katy, petting her aunt’s head. “This is so much fun! Now aunt Crystal, dance like a ballerina!” Crystal looked dazed with glazed over eyes, as she got back up to her feet. She stood on her tippy-toes and started twirling around, gracefully and delicately, as she started to dance all around the house. “You look so pretty as a ballerina! Do you like being a ballerina and dancing for me?” Katy asked, watching her in awe of her perfect ballerina skills. “Yes… love it…” Crystal replied, pointing her toes as she galloped around the living room. “Hehe. Good.” Katy starting thinking to herself, as she had so many ideas running through her little head. She sat on the couch and kicked her feet back and forth in glee. “Now, when I count to three you will wake up but you won’t be mad; you’ll be happy I hypnotized you! And you’ll wanna tell me more about hypnosis so I can do more fun stuff with you! One… two three!” Crystal suddenly become aware of where she was and how she was standing, on her tip toes on one foot with the other in the air. “Um, sweetie, what’s going on?” Katy started giggling, wiggling her little toes. “I hypnotized you, aunt Crystal! With the big wheel!” Crystal gasped in surprise, covering her mouth with her hand. “You did?! That’s amazing, sweetie!” She walked over to sit next to Katy on the couch, giving her a hug. “I can’t believe it, haha! What did I do?” “You thought you were a monkey and a ballerina!” Said Katy with excitement and a chuckle. “It was soooo funny.” Crystal’s cheeks started to get quite red. That sounded really embarrassing, but also pretty funny. “Heheh… Good job, sweetie. Now what are you gonna do? The shoe phone suggestion is always fun. Remember when I did that one on your sister?” Katy’s eyes practically lit up as she was reminded of such a funny suggestion. “Oooh, yeah! Sleep, aunt Crystal!” Crystal chuckled, before suddenly realizing what Katy had just said. Her eyes rolled back and shut as she went slumped over on the couch, her mind just shutting down. “Hehe, woah!” Katy said in surprise, amazed at how quickly Crystal just went out and limp. She stood up and got one of her aunt’s flip-flops and sat it on the coffee table. “When you wake up, you’re gonna think your flip-flop is a phone and it’s ringing! Wake up, aunt Crystal! Your phone is ringing!” “Huh?” Crystal opened her eyes and sat up quickly, seeing her phone on the table. She picked it up fast and tapped it with her finger, then brought it up to her ear. “Hello?” Katy had to try so hard not to giggle, not wanting to alert her to what was happening. “Hello, this is momm- I mean your sister, Stacy!” Katy said, pretending to be her own mom. “Oh, hey! Me and Katy were just talking. She hypnotized me!” Said Crytsal, rolling her eyes and smiling. If only she knew she was talking to a flip-flop. “That little brat.” She joked. “Oh my, that’s cool! Make sure you let Katy eat all the candy and ice cream she wants, okay? Bye bye!” Katy said with a smirk, wiggling her little toes with glee. “Oh, you sure?” Crystal replied, raising an eyebrow. “Alright, sure thing! See you later, Stacy.” She tapped her flip-flop again to hang up, like it was totally normal, before turning to Katy. “Well Katy, I’ve got good news. Your mom said you can eat anything you want! So, what would you like?” “Ooh!” Katy’s smile grew as big as can be. Hypnosis was amazing! And boy was she ready to eat. “Get me a big bowl of ice cream with lots of whipped cream! And sprinkles! And chocolate syrup!” Crystal’s eyes widened and she started to laugh. “Okay, okay! Let me go get it.” She chuckled as she stood up from the couch and headed to the kitchen. Katy sat on the couch, ready for some ice cream! Her little feet were kicking back and forth as she felt like she couldn’t take the wait. Eventually, Crystal walked in and Katy was amazed with what she saw! It was a big bowl with a mountain of ice cream, sprinkles, whipped cream and syrup! “Oh my gosh, thank you, aunt Crystal!” “You’re welcome, sweetie.” Said Crystal, as she gave Katy the ice cream. “I’m going to get my work done now.” She turned, headed towards her office. “Uhh, wait! You wanna rub my feet!” Katy snapped her fingers and giggled, before taking a big bite of ice cream. “Huh? Oh, you’re right sweetie, of course!” Crystal agreed, turning back around and sitting on the floor. She lifted Katy’s feet up and started rubbing them for her. “That feel good?” “Mmm yup!” Katy replied, a mouth full of ice cream. “That feels real good!” She said before eating another heaping helping. “Haha, good. Make sure you don’t get a brain freeze from eating too fast!” Crystal warned Katy. “Oh yeah, thank you.” Katy replied, but that gave her an idea. “Aunt Crystal… freeze!” “Ye-” Instantly, Crystal froze in place, her hands on her niece’s feet, as she was in the middle of speaking. She was completely still and staring ahead, not even blinking. “Hehe…” The girl giggled as she stuck her big toe up to Crystal’s nose before saying, “Unfreeze!” “-Yes, Ka- Oh!” Crystal said in surprise, moving the girl’s foot away. “Gross! I don’t want your toes up my nose!” She said with a laugh. “How did they even get there?!” The little girl started cracking up, before taking another bite of ice cream. “Hehehe, that was funny!” Katy continued to eat and eat until all the ice cream was gone. By the time she was finished, she had ice cream on her face and felt so full. “Oh my gosh, I can’t eat anything else…” She said, holding her tummy. “But I want you to entertain me more, Aunt Crystal! Now you’re playing the piano!” She shouted, snapping her fingers. Suddenly, without a chance to react, Crystal went wide-eyed and put her hands up in the air in front of her, moving her fingers as if she was pressing piano keys. This got a good giggle out of Katy, when she thought of something else. “Now you think my toes are the piano!” The girl exclaimed, putting her toes up to her aunt and spreading them. Crystal lowered her hands and started tapping Katy’s tiny toes, like they were the keys to the piano now. “Hahaha!” Katy cracked up, her aunt’s fingers tickling her. “This is so funny ahahahaha! Wake up!” Crystal blinked a couple times and looked around, disoriented, before seeing her fingers on Katy’s toes. “What the?!” She laughed. “You played my toes like a piano! Haha!” Katy told her, curling her toes in front of her aunt. “What? Oh my gosh!” Crystal laughed as she replied. “You’re quite a good little hypnotist, you know that, Katy? Maybe you will be like your aunt when you grew up! But that’s enough for now sweetie, I really need to get this work done and your mom will be here soo-” “SLEEP!” Suddenly yelled Katy, catching her off guard. Crystal’s eyes rolled back and she went limp, her head limping forward as she again entered that wonderful trance. “Haha! You’re under my control and there’s nothing you can do about it!” Katy stuck out her tongue at her entranced aunt. “When you wake up, you’re gonna think you’re a horse! Wake up!” The aunt slowly lifted her head up, her eyes a bit crossed, as she got on all fours and said “Neeeiiiggghhhh!” like a trusty steed. “Haha, take me on a ride, horsey!” Said Katy as she climbed onto her aunt’s back and sat down. “Yeehaa!” “Neeiiiggghhhhhhh!” Crystal started to crawl around the room fast, thinking she was a beautiful horse and Katy was a cowgirl riding her. “Haha! Woah!” Katy said, having the time of her life right now. She pretended to be a cowgirl, shooting the air with finger guns. “Pew pew! Yeehaw! Good horsey! Now stop and let me get off.” The girl said, before getting off of her aunt’s back. It sounded like a car had just pulled up outside. Katy looked out the window, and sure enough, it was her mom! “Oh! Okay, Aunt Crystal. When you wake up, you won’t remember being hypnotized and think we just played together all night! And you’ll tell my mommy I was really, really good!” There was a knock at the door. “Wake up and answer the door!” Crystal opened her eyes and looked around, wondering why she was on the floor, but that didn’t really matter. She needed to open the door because Stacy was home. “Hey, you’re back! Katy was soooo good!” Crystal said as she opened the door for her sister. “Perfect!” Replied Stacy. “Did you have fun, sweetie?” She asked her daughter, who was putting her shoes on to get ready to leave. “Yes! It was so much fun!” Katy said with a giggle, knowing all the things she made her aunt do and that her aunt was totally unaware. “Bye, aunt Crystal!” She said, heading for the door.","completion":"INT. CRYSTAL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY KATE, mid-30s and wearing a sleek professional wardrobe, steps inside her sister Crystal's modern home. Her SISTER CRYSTAL, who is a renowned hypnotherapist, in a casual chic attire, welcomes her. KATE: (cheerful) Be good for Crystal! I'll be back later. KATE exits. KATE: (enthusiastic) I will! Crystal smirks, gently tousling Kate's hair. CRYSTAL: Maybe you will! I've got clients soon, so make yourself at home. Kate nods, albeit disappointed, and lounges on the sofa, flicking the TV on. INT. CRYSTAL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER Bored, Kate's gaze settles on the slightly ajar door to Crystal's office. She slips inside, awestruck by the various trinkets and, notably, a large spiral wheel used for hypnotism. KATE: (chuckling to herself) I wonder... She spins the wheel, mesmerized by the swirling pattern. A knock pulls her back to reality. CRYSTAL: (yelling from outside) Kate, come out, now! Panic flutters in Kate's chest. An idea strikes; she hits an obscure button, sparking the wheel to a steady spin. CRYSTAL: (confused) I just heard you. Where did you go— Her sentence cuts as the spiral wheel grips her attention. KATE: (peering from behind the door) Isn’t the spiral so captivating? CRYSTAL: (in trance) Yes... so pretty... Kate, now in control, throws an impromptu command. KATE: (grinning) Act like a monkey! Obliging, Crystal's movements turn comically simian, eliciting hearty laughter from Kate. The frolic continues from monkey antics to a ballerina routine, each command leaving Crystal more dazed but graceful. KATE: (counting softly) One, two, three, wake up! Crystal snaps to alertness, puzzled by her posture—a dainty ballerina’s poise. CRYSTAL: (recovering) What's going on? Giggles escape Kate as she reveals her makeshift hypnotic venture, praising Crystal's unwitting performance. Suggesting a play on a past trick, Crystal recounts the shoe phone tactic they once played on Kate's sister. KATE: (delighted) Sleep! Crystal's eyelids droop; she succumbs instantly to the command. Kate continues her mischief with the shoe phone prank, persuading Crystal she's on a call with Kate's mother, endorsing a treat binge for her niece. INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Crystal whips up an extravagant bowl of ice cream, piled high with indulgent toppings, for the victorious Kate. CRYSTAL: (heading towards her office) I really have to get to work— KATE: (interrupting) You want to massage my feet! Once again, Crystal readily complies, now a doting audience to Kate’s childish whims. The playful hypnosis session culminates in Crystal becoming a \\"piano\\" for Kate's wiggling toes, only to snap out of it at each revelatory \\"wake up.\\" EXT. CRYSTAL'S HOUSE - EVENING Stacy returns to find an exhilarated Kate recounting her \\"playtime\\" with Aunt Crystal. CRYSTAL: (answering the door) She was wonderful; we had a blast! STACY: (relieved) Fantastic! Ready to go, honey? Kate, snug in her shoes, flashes a mischievous smile at Crystal. KATE: (gleefully) Bye, Aunt Crystal. Best night ever! As the car drives away, Crystal waves, unaware of the hypnotic charade but filled with a strange sense of fulfillment. Kate revels in her secret triumph, the day's escapades engrained as an amusing memory."},{"prompt":"I created a Jujutsu Kaisen sorcerer named Julien Vaugrenard. Standing at 6'0 (184cm), he's a lean, speedy 149lbs (68kg). He possesses slicked back, light brown hair and bluish grey eyes, he's hard to miss, and he's considered highly attractive by female characters, and he does have fangirls among the cast, but not as many as Gojo. At just 15, he's first-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and an extremely prized prospect as the Kyoto School lacks considerable young talent in comparison to Tokyo. Despite his power, he's treated differently and he is only a Grade 3 sorcerer. This is an average rank. He's the son of Nicolas and Rose, two French immigrants to Japan that run a shop specializing in cheesy pastries. Circumstances have lead him around the block. For one, his parents' dislike for large cities lead them to settle in Muko, a mid-sized city south of Kyoto. Coincidentally, Kyoto is also the site of a Jujutsu school, and though Satoru Gojo is a powerful recruiter, he ultimately chose to stay close to his parents. Second, he required outside training, which he received from two now-disgraced sorcerers in Yuki Tsukumo and Kazuki Ryoumen. (Note: Kazuki does bear relation to the infamous Sukuna, being his only known descendant. He doesn't hide it.) During this training regimen, they would go to many places such as uninhabited islands. Yuki would joke that there were no witnesses, but this was really so they would not have to hold back. Cheese is at the forefront of his powers, extremely malleable and limited only by his imagination, but Yuki drilled into him what she could - while she carries a Shikigami named Garuda, her power, Bom Ba Ye (translated as Star Rage adds virtual mass to both herself and Garuda. This means she can hit like a speeding truck full of explosives, and with her bare hands. Julien's participation in jujutsu sorcery was not voluntary originally, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of his parents. Yuki lured a young Julien into the jujutsu world with promises of wealth, status, and leisure, which appealed heavily to him at the time, and still do, though he's adopted more pressing priorities. One of the catalysts was that he discovered she isn't really happy with her life, as her ambitions of creating a world without cursed energy are lofty, and sometimes feel completely unattainable. Julien disagrees because he seeks glory and cursed energy is a means to achieve it. Though his first mentor is Yuki, he's also been trained by Gojo at times. Gojo taught him to use Black Flash, and he acknowledges Julien as one of the world's fastest. Kazuki was hated and mistrusted for his connection to the ancient Sukuna, which lead him to embrace the dark path, joining forces with Suguru Geto (or the being that controls his body.) Yuki is not the only person he's acquainted with. He's close with Kasumi Miwa. The two are childhood friends, and Kasumi is not immune to his charm. Kasumi's father, Eizo, once exorcised curses from the family bakery while Julien was away. For this he's grateful to the Miwa family, and they do him. He sees Kasumi as someone he has to protect. Kasumi has noticed the opening of a sizeable chasm between them in strength and even status as they've grown and developed together. Whether Julien intends to or not, he is nonetheless a component of an overall environment that leads her to call herself \\"Useless Miwa.\\" She's very aware that she isn't strong by the standards of a Jujutsu sorcerer, but she's driven to provide for her impoverished family; she was pressured into learning to use a sword by her parents but her true passion is singing. Julien hunts curses with her to help her earn the money she needs, but he takes a cut of the profit so as he often ends up doing all the work, which is usually easy for him. They often negotiate the earnings. Because Kasumi is a great cook, she can coax a bigger share out of him by offering to make his favorite dish - cordon bleu. They enjoy bowling together, and Kasumi often beats him. He's friendly rivals with Aoi Todo, and they are quite similar, being passionate about everything they do, especially in regards to romance, friendship, and of course fighting. Loud, hot-blooded, confident, and they live for battle. Macho men. Julien is a bit more sane, and would never turn on or even threaten to murder his teammates, as Todo threatened to do during the Kyoto-Tokyo Goodwill event. Todo was incensed by the Kyoto team's plan to assassinate Yuji Itadori, as Yuji has the same taste in women as him: tall with big butts. This attempt was ordered by Gakuganji to eliminate Sukuna. Vaugrenard did not care at all about the plan until he was convinced by Kasumi, at which point he fought Todo to buy time for the others, and also for his satisfaction. At some point, Julien got the upper hand, but the fight ultimately ended in a stalemate when both were forced to work together to drive back Hanami, the special grade cursed spirit. Julien is one of the fastest sorcerers around. Julien and Todo were both trained by Yuki Tsukumo, so Julien is well accustomed to the question \\"What kind of girls are you into?\\" For Julien, the answer is easy. A tall, strong woman with long legs. Like Maki Zenin, his girlfriend. Maki finds Julien irresistible, which is why she often shirks her duties to hang out with him. Maki mockingly calls him Casanova and pretty boy. He likes the sass. Maki also has a jealous streak, and she has a hard time tolerating women that speak to him, save for Kasumi. There are three basic applications: Fromage à pâte dure (hard cheeses), Fromage à pâte molle (soft cheeses), and Fondue (melted cheese). The thing is that \\"hard and soft\\" are in fact two massive categories, very vague. Ricotta can be considered soft, as can Havarti, but they have little in common. In the beginning of Yuki's training, these techniques were all quite weak, but have evolved into a terrifying arsenal of the unknown. Fromage à pâte dure, unsurprisingly, is the basis for many of his offensive attacks, and can be used to create constructs that form as hard, solid objects that can take the form of nearly anything the Julien desires. With regards to defense, he has more than one option to choose from, though they are not chosen only by hardness, but how well they can absorb an attack. This makes a very hard cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano useless, but one like Comte very useful. Parmigiano Reggiano's role is almost entirely offensive, the aforementioned fragments of the projectile potentially burrowing inside poorly-protected enemies. The effect is like a hollowpoint bullet. He can shoot this kind of cheese from his back, in a technique called \\"Quills.\\" It's used typically in dire situations. Julien knows better than to willingly turn his back in combat. These are only some cheeses, some techniques, at his disposal. Another technique is \\"Ficello\\". Ficello is a popular brand of string cheese sold in France, and it involves creating flexible strands of cheese. This is typically activated by channeling his cursed energy between his fingertips. Ficello is versatile. Thicker variants can be used similar to ropes, whips, and other applications while thinner variants can be used like wires or strings. Ficello has offensive, defensive, and support applications. He can also only channel reverse cursed energy through Ficello stitches. \\"Magma\\" is a variant of Fondue, and Fromage à pâte dure at the same time. The effect is a superheated weapon that quickly solidifies on Julien's command, inside or outside the user's body. He can even make them explode. Fontina, Gruyere, and gouda are commonly used in Fondue and Magma. Soft cheeses can be used for more strategic purposes, non-lethal techniques, or even very strong whips and ropes. One should not assume these techniques are harmless. More techniques at his disposal: \\"Vieux Boulogne\\". This cheese is known just for being the worst-smelling. The technique involves creating a pungent and suffocating cheese vapor, which can disorient and impair the senses of anyone caught in its range, as well as their ability to sense and focus their cursed energy. Julien HATES using this technique, but it's particularly effective in enclosed spaces or against opponents who heavily rely on their sense of smell. His most devastating technique that does not involve Domain Expansion is \\"Fromage Noir.\\" By infusing his cursed energy into a specialized wheel of black cheese, he can unleash a devastating explosion. There's also a lesser-known variant of \\"Fondue\\" in which the burns can never heal. It's called \\"Fondue Noir.\\" Comté comets produce weaker explosions. Fromage Fort (sharp cheese) in English. Summons discs of cheddar cheese with significant cutting power. The smaller, the faster. They are of variable size. More powerful techniques must be charged. Julien lives for battle, but it isn't his only hobby. He enjoys reading about military history and classic literature in his free time. If he has eaten a cheese, he never forgets its texture or its properties, and he can incorporate it into his future battles. He enjoys drinks made from fermented whey such as Rivella, but also those that do not compromise or hide the taste. He has a younger sister named Annick.","completion":"Julien Vaugrenard is an intricately developed character for the Jujutsu Kaisen universe with an original cursed technique based on cheese – an unusual and creative power within the realm of cursed energy and the series's lore. His background story connecting his French heritage, personal relationships, and the training he receives from characters like Yuki Tsukumo and Satoru Gojo are well-integrated into the existing narrative. By involving characters like Kasumi Miwa and Aoi Todo, you cleverly connect him to the pre-established social fabric of the series. The depth of Julien's powers, using different types of cheese with specific properties and battle applications, adds dimensionality and shows an attentive consideration to culinary detail, not often seen in combat abilities. The use of cheese also provides a nice parallel to Julien's desired normal life in the family bakery, which stands in stark contrast to the darker world of Jujutsu sorcerers. Your description of Julien’s personality, his relationship with others such as Maki Zenin, and his prowess in battle, paints the picture of a layered individual who is not just formidable but also complex. He harbors motivations beyond just fighting, such as glory and personal aspirations, along with a rich family life and hobbies. Here are a few observations: - The inclusion of established characters like Yuki Tsukumo (a character officially in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe) and a supposed descendant of Ryomen Sukuna named Kazuki (an addition of your own) help situate Julien within the broader storyline. However, this means you have incorporated characters with pre-determined backgrounds and motivations, which might need to be kept consistent with the source material if you want the character to seamlessly fit the established narrative. - The complex nature of Julien's cheese-based techniques shows you’ve put thought into how they could realistically function within a battle and offer a range of utility, from offense to defense to healing. This could be a particularly fun aspect to explore, as it's not just about the strength of the power but also Julien's creativity and problem-solving during combat situations. - His relationships with other characters, like the rivalry with Todo which contrasts their personalities, and the childhood connection to Miwa, give Julien a social depth that would likely make him a relatable and likeable figure in the series. - Julien's larger-than-life persona – the handsome, fast, and strong sorcerer with charm and a passion for battle – fits right in with the high-octane and emotionally driven vibe of Jujutsu Kaisen. Overall, Julien Vaugrenard is a compelling character addition to the Jujutsu Kaisen world. His unique abilities, combined with his deep personal ties to the series' other characters, would likely make for an engaging storyline filled with both action-packed and character-driven moments."},{"prompt":"Write a script with the same vibe and some of the suggestions of the following, as if you are a practised author. Shorten and amend for readability. Change all the names. Make all the characters into adults and change the scenario to fit that change appropriately. Katy had just been dropped off at her aunt Crystal’s house after begging her mom to take her. “Be good for aunt Crystal!” Said Katy’s mom, as she headed out the front door. “I will mommy!” Katy yelled back. Katy was amazed by her aunt, because her aunt was a hypnotherapist. “I wanna be just like you when I grow up, aunt Crystal!” Crystal let out a little chuckle, putting her hand on the young girl’s head. “Maybe you will be! Now you be good and watch TV. I need to get some work done.” Katy looked a bit disappointed. She thought that her aunt would have time to play with her. “Okay…” She said, turning away with a sigh. She headed over to the couch and turned the TV on with the remote, putting on cartoons. After about 10 minutes, Katy was getting bored. She noticed that the door to Crystal’s office was open while Crystal was in the bathroom. Katy giggled, before getting up to get a closer look. The girl sneaked into the room quietly and closed the door. Inside, she was quite fascinated with her aunt’s office. Some sort of certificate was hanging on the wall in a fancy frame, there was a wooden desk with a comfortable looking chair, and an even more comfortable looking couch in the room as well. But the most interesting thing in the room by far, was the big, black and white spiral wheel against the wall across from the couch. “Oooh, that’s so pretty!” Little Katy said, in awe of the wheel. “This most be what aunt Crystal hypnotizes people with! I wonder if she used it on mommy, hehe.” She said, giving it a spin with her hand. It looked so pretty, watching the spiral spin around and around, Katy just couldn’t look away… Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Katy quickly looked around, disoriented and nervous. “Open the door, Katy! You’re not supposed to be in my office, sweetie!” Came a voice yelling from the other side of the door. Katy didn’t know what to do. She didn’t want to be in trouble… “Uh, s-sorry! One second!” She yelled back, getting an idea. She spotted a button on the wall and pressed it. The button made the spiral wheel begin to spin again, but this time, it wouldn’t stop unless the button was pressed for a second time. Katy opened the door slowly, but stayed behind the door as she opened it, hiding. “Gosh, Katy! Don’t-” Said Crystal, before realizing there was no one there. “I just heard you. Where did you… go…” Her eyes were brought to the spiral, that same spiral that she had used to hypnotize Katy’s mom and all of her hypnotherapy patients. It had been quite awhile since she had last stared into it herself. “K-Katy… where are you… sweetie?” Katy peaked out from behind the door, spotting her aunt standing still, a bit hunched over and looking directly into the spiral spinning on the wall. “Hehe… Are you looking at the spiral, aunt Crystal? Isn’t it soooo pretty?” The spiral was indeed pretty, gorgeous even. Crystal knew that from how easily it mesmerized her patients… and even herself. “Yes… soo pretty…” Katy smiled deviously. This was perfect! Her aunt was under her control! Well she hoped. Did just watching the spiral for that little bit turn her into a toy for Katy to play with? It was time to find out. “Aunt Crystal, start acting like a monkey!” The girl shouted out, excited. Without even thinking, Crystal held her arms out beside her and began walking around in a funny way, looking around the room with widened eyes and an open mouth. “OOH OOH OOH!” She said with a deep voice, like an ape. “Ahahahaha!” Katy bursted into laughter, holding her hand over her mouth as she pointed at Crystal in amusement. “Oh my gosh! You think you’re a monkey! Go get a banana!” Crystal perked up. “OOH?” A banana sounded delicious! She quickly made her way to the kitchen, walking just like the silly monkey she thought she was. She picked up a banana and sat on the floor to peel it. But instead of using her hands, Crystal did just like a monkey would do, and used her feet and toes like hands to peel the banana before eating it! She ate the banana quickly, enjoying every bite. “Haha, was that a good banana?” Asked Katy, petting her aunt’s head. “This is so much fun! Now aunt Crystal, dance like a ballerina!” Crystal looked dazed with glazed over eyes, as she got back up to her feet. She stood on her tippy-toes and started twirling around, gracefully and delicately, as she started to dance all around the house. “You look so pretty as a ballerina! Do you like being a ballerina and dancing for me?” Katy asked, watching her in awe of her perfect ballerina skills. “Yes… love it…” Crystal replied, pointing her toes as she galloped around the living room. “Hehe. Good.” Katy starting thinking to herself, as she had so many ideas running through her little head. She sat on the couch and kicked her feet back and forth in glee. “Now, when I count to three you will wake up but you won’t be mad; you’ll be happy I hypnotized you! And you’ll wanna tell me more about hypnosis so I can do more fun stuff with you! One… two three!” Crystal suddenly become aware of where she was and how she was standing, on her tip toes on one foot with the other in the air. “Um, sweetie, what’s going on?” Katy started giggling, wiggling her little toes. “I hypnotized you, aunt Crystal! With the big wheel!” Crystal gasped in surprise, covering her mouth with her hand. “You did?! That’s amazing, sweetie!” She walked over to sit next to Katy on the couch, giving her a hug. “I can’t believe it, haha! What did I do?” “You thought you were a monkey and a ballerina!” Said Katy with excitement and a chuckle. “It was soooo funny.” Crystal’s cheeks started to get quite red. That sounded really embarrassing, but also pretty funny. “Heheh… Good job, sweetie. Now what are you gonna do? The shoe phone suggestion is always fun. Remember when I did that one on your sister?” Katy’s eyes practically lit up as she was reminded of such a funny suggestion. “Oooh, yeah! Sleep, aunt Crystal!” Crystal chuckled, before suddenly realizing what Katy had just said. Her eyes rolled back and shut as she went slumped over on the couch, her mind just shutting down. “Hehe, woah!” Katy said in surprise, amazed at how quickly Crystal just went out and limp. She stood up and got one of her aunt’s flip-flops and sat it on the coffee table. “When you wake up, you’re gonna think your flip-flop is a phone and it’s ringing! Wake up, aunt Crystal! Your phone is ringing!” “Huh?” Crystal opened her eyes and sat up quickly, seeing her phone on the table. She picked it up fast and tapped it with her finger, then brought it up to her ear. “Hello?” Katy had to try so hard not to giggle, not wanting to alert her to what was happening. “Hello, this is momm- I mean your sister, Stacy!” Katy said, pretending to be her own mom. “Oh, hey! Me and Katy were just talking. She hypnotized me!” Said Crytsal, rolling her eyes and smiling. If only she knew she was talking to a flip-flop. “That little brat.” She joked. “Oh my, that’s cool! Make sure you let Katy eat all the candy and ice cream she wants, okay? Bye bye!” Katy said with a smirk, wiggling her little toes with glee. “Oh, you sure?” Crystal replied, raising an eyebrow. “Alright, sure thing! See you later, Stacy.” She tapped her flip-flop again to hang up, like it was totally normal, before turning to Katy. “Well Katy, I’ve got good news. Your mom said you can eat anything you want! So, what would you like?” “Ooh!” Katy’s smile grew as big as can be. Hypnosis was amazing! And boy was she ready to eat. “Get me a big bowl of ice cream with lots of whipped cream! And sprinkles! And chocolate syrup!” Crystal’s eyes widened and she started to laugh. “Okay, okay! Let me go get it.” She chuckled as she stood up from the couch and headed to the kitchen. Katy sat on the couch, ready for some ice cream! Her little feet were kicking back and forth as she felt like she couldn’t take the wait. Eventually, Crystal walked in and Katy was amazed with what she saw! It was a big bowl with a mountain of ice cream, sprinkles, whipped cream and syrup! “Oh my gosh, thank you, aunt Crystal!” “You’re welcome, sweetie.” Said Crystal, as she gave Katy the ice cream. “I’m going to get my work done now.” She turned, headed towards her office. “Uhh, wait! You wanna rub my feet!” Katy snapped her fingers and giggled, before taking a big bite of ice cream. “Huh? Oh, you’re right sweetie, of course!” Crystal agreed, turning back around and sitting on the floor. She lifted Katy’s feet up and started rubbing them for her. “That feel good?” “Mmm yup!” Katy replied, a mouth full of ice cream. “That feels real good!” She said before eating another heaping helping. “Haha, good. Make sure you don’t get a brain freeze from eating too fast!” Crystal warned Katy. “Oh yeah, thank you.” Katy replied, but that gave her an idea. “Aunt Crystal… freeze!” “Ye-” Instantly, Crystal froze in place, her hands on her niece’s feet, as she was in the middle of speaking. She was completely still and staring ahead, not even blinking. “Hehe…” The girl giggled as she stuck her big toe up to Crystal’s nose before saying, “Unfreeze!” “-Yes, Ka- Oh!” Crystal said in surprise, moving the girl’s foot away. “Gross! I don’t want your toes up my nose!” She said with a laugh. “How did they even get there?!” The little girl started cracking up, before taking another bite of ice cream. “Hehehe, that was funny!” Katy continued to eat and eat until all the ice cream was gone. By the time she was finished, she had ice cream on her face and felt so full. “Oh my gosh, I can’t eat anything else…” She said, holding her tummy. “But I want you to entertain me more, Aunt Crystal! Now you’re playing the piano!” She shouted, snapping her fingers. Suddenly, without a chance to react, Crystal went wide-eyed and put her hands up in the air in front of her, moving her fingers as if she was pressing piano keys. This got a good giggle out of Katy, when she thought of something else. “Now you think my toes are the piano!” The girl exclaimed, putting her toes up to her aunt and spreading them. Crystal lowered her hands and started tapping Katy’s tiny toes, like they were the keys to the piano now. “Hahaha!” Katy cracked up, her aunt’s fingers tickling her. “This is so funny ahahahaha! Wake up!” Crystal blinked a couple times and looked around, disoriented, before seeing her fingers on Katy’s toes. “What the?!” She laughed. “You played my toes like a piano! Haha!” Katy told her, curling her toes in front of her aunt. “What? Oh my gosh!” Crystal laughed as she replied. “You’re quite a good little hypnotist, you know that, Katy? Maybe you will be like your aunt when you grew up! But that’s enough for now sweetie, I really need to get this work done and your mom will be here soo-” “SLEEP!” Suddenly yelled Katy, catching her off guard. Crystal’s eyes rolled back and she went limp, her head limping forward as she again entered that wonderful trance. “Haha! You’re under my control and there’s nothing you can do about it!” Katy stuck out her tongue at her entranced aunt. “When you wake up, you’re gonna think you’re a horse! Wake up!” The aunt slowly lifted her head up, her eyes a bit crossed, as she got on all fours and said “Neeeiiiggghhhh!” like a trusty steed. “Haha, take me on a ride, horsey!” Said Katy as she climbed onto her aunt’s back and sat down. “Yeehaa!” “Neeiiiggghhhhhhh!” Crystal started to crawl around the room fast, thinking she was a beautiful horse and Katy was a cowgirl riding her. “Haha! Woah!” Katy said, having the time of her life right now. She pretended to be a cowgirl, shooting the air with finger guns. “Pew pew! Yeehaw! Good horsey! Now stop and let me get off.” The girl said, before getting off of her aunt’s back. It sounded like a car had just pulled up outside. Katy looked out the window, and sure enough, it was her mom! “Oh! Okay, Aunt Crystal. When you wake up, you won’t remember being hypnotized and think we just played together all night! And you’ll tell my mommy I was really, really good!” There was a knock at the door. “Wake up and answer the door!” Crystal opened her eyes and looked around, wondering why she was on the floor, but that didn’t really matter. She needed to open the door because Stacy was home. “Hey, you’re back! Katy was soooo good!” Crystal said as she opened the door for her sister. “Perfect!” Replied Stacy. “Did you have fun, sweetie?” She asked her daughter, who was putting her shoes on to get ready to leave. “Yes! It was so much fun!” Katy said with a giggle, knowing all the things she made her aunt do and that her aunt was totally unaware. “Bye, aunt Crystal!” She said, heading for the door.","completion":"Kiera's excitement was palpable as she stood on her aunt Valerie's porch, her mother's car disappearing down the street. She had finally convinced her mother to let her spend the day learning from her aunt, who was known for her expertise in psychotherapy and her unconventional use of hypnosis in treating clients. \\"Do me proud, darling,\\" her mom had said with a wave. \\"I absolutely will!\\" Kiera called back with a grin. The idea of mastering the art of hypnosis thrilled her, and the thought of being mentored by the one and only Aunt Valerie had her heart racing. Valerie chuckled warmly, ruffling Kiera's hair. \\"You've got that gleam in your eye, just like I did at your age. But first things first, I have paperwork to catch up on. Settle in, there's coffee on the table, and feel free to watch some TV.\\" Disappointment clouded Kiera's features for only a moment before she nodded. Aunt Valerie's office – the sanctuary of her hypnotic prowess – beckoned to her, but duty called her aunt away. Resigning herself to the living room, Kiera switched on the TV, her attention only half on the morning news. Moments later, an opportunity presented itself. Valerie stepped away, presumably toward the restroom, leaving her office door ajar. Kiera's adventurous spirit couldn't resist. She tiptoed inside, gently closing the door behind her, and marveled at the credentials and the cozy, professional ambiance. Then, her eyes landed on it: an imposing spiral wheel attached to the office wall. Its pattern was both simple and utterly mesmerizing. She couldn't help but reach out and set it in motion, watching as it spun into a hypnotic dance. The fascination was cut short by a stern knock. \\"Kiera James, open this door right now!\\" Panicked, Kiera spied a switch beneath the framed certificates. With a hopeful press, the wheel sprung into motion autonomously, hypnotically spinning without end. She cracked the door open, slipping behind it to hide. The sight that greeted Aunt Valerie upon entry was the spiraling wheel she so often used to guide her clients into a trance. Its rhythmic motion was captivating. \\"Kiera... where are you...?\\" Peering out, Kiera found her aunt entranced by the wheel, a perfect recipient to her newfound influence. The urge to experiment was irresistible. \\"Aunt Valerie, act like you're at a disco!\\" Instantly, Valerie started to groove with flawless '70s flair, her body swaying in time with an unheard beat. Kiera's laughter filled the room as she prompted her aunt to dance through the house, marveling at Valerie's fluid disco moves. Kiera's whims continued, from convincing Valerie she was baking imaginary gourmet desserts to turning the living room into an exaggerated nature documentary scene. But, as all fun must, it came to an end with the approach of Kiera's mother's car. \\"Alright, rewind,\\" Kiera spoke with authority, and Valerie blinked herself back to reality, standing in the middle of the living room, a puzzled smile on her face. \\"My, you certainly have an imagination, Kiera,\\" Valerie said as the doorbell rang. \\"Your mother's here.

Одним из подходов может быть использование корреляционного анализа, например, коэффициент корреляции Пирсона, который измеряет линейную зависимость между двумя непрерывными переменными. Нулевая гипотеза (H0) в таком случае будет утверждать, что нет связи (корреляции) между рейтингом и стоимостью книги, тогда как альтернативная гипотеза (H1) будет говорить о наличии этой зависимости. Мы можем выполнить данный анализ с помощью библиотеки pandas и scipy в Python: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd from scipy.stats import pearsonr # Загружаем данные data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_books_data.csv') # Вычисляем коэффициент корреляции Пирсона между стоимостью книги (Price) и её рейтингом (User Rating) correlation, p_value = pearsonr(data['Price'], data['User Rating']) # Выводим коэффициент корреляции и p-value print(f\\"Коэффициент корреляции Пирсона: {correlation}\\") print(f\\"p-value: {p_value}\\") # Интерпретируем результаты if p_value < 0.05: print(\\"Мы отвергаем нулевую гипотезу: существует статистически значимая корреляция между стоимостью и рейтингом книги.\\") else: print(\\"Мы не отвергаем нулевую гипотезу: нет статистически значимой корреляции между стоимостью и рейтингом книги.\\") \`\`\` Здесь \`correlation\` представляет собой коэффициент корреляции Пирсона, а \`p_value\` — это p-value, которое дает нам некоторое представление о том, можно ли рассматривать наблюдаемую корреляцию как значимую. Если p-value меньше порогового уровня значимости (обычно 0.05), мы отвергаем нулевую гипотезу и признаем, что между двумя переменными существует статистически значимая корреляция. Если p-value больше или равно 0.05, мы не отвергаем нулевую гипотезу о том, что корреляции нет. Не забудьте заменить \`'path_to_your_books_data.csv'\` на путь к вашему файла с данными. Обратите внимание, что корреляция Пирсона может не полностью отображать взаимосвязь между рейтингом и стоимостью, если зависимость имеет не линейный, а более сложный характер.

Однако для проверки гипотезы о зависимости рейтинга книги от её стоимости с помощью биноминального теста нам потребуется немного адаптировать наш подход: 1. Определить критерий \\"высокого\\" рейтинга на основе значений рейтинга книг (например, выше определенного порога, такого как средний рейтинг). 2. Разделить книги на \\"дорогие\\" и \\"недорогие\\" группы, как вы уже сделали ранее. 3. Посчитать количество книг с \\"высоким\\" рейтингом в каждой группе. 4.

Нулевая гипотеза t-теста состоит в том, что средние значения рейтингов обеих групп равны, в то время как альтернативная гипотеза утверждает, что средние значения различаются. Если \`p-value\` меньше уровня значимости (обычно 0.05), мы отвергаем нулевую гипотезу и считаем различие средних статистически значимым. Также стоит отметить, что t-тест делает ряд предположений, включая то, что данные распределены нормально. Если объем выборки достаточно велик, то на практике t-тест может быть достаточно устойчив к некоторому отклонению от нормальности за счёт центральной предельной теоремы.

В противном случае мы не имеем достаточно оснований отклонить нулевую гипотезу, и можно предположить, что распределение приближено к нормальному. В ваших данных p-value для обеих выборок \\"дешевых\\" и \\"дорогих\\" книг составляет менее 0.05. Это указывает на то, что распределения рейтингов обеих групп скорее всего статистически значимо не нормальны. В связи с этим использование t-теста для сравнения средних значений может быть ненадежным при малом размере выборки. Поскольку результаты теста Шапиро-Уилка отвергают нормальность распределений, следует рассмотреть использование непараметрических аналогов t-теста, которые не делают предположений о форме распределения. Для сравнения двух независимых выборок нужного типа можно использовать тест Манна-Уитни (также известный как U-тест Вилкоксона).

If there's remaining healing that isn't evenly divisible, it distributes the remainder one by one to the alive units until it's used up. The \`replaceAt\` function updates the specific unit with the healed amount, and if the \`splitHeal\` is 0 (meaning there is no more healing left to apply), it keeps the original unit unchanged. The \`applyHeal\` function is used by \`foldl\` to iterate over each unit of the army, applying the corresponding heal and updating the leftover heal amount accordingly. Note that this approach expects units to be unique, meaning the identity of units is determined by their position in the list rather than their states, otherwise it could update multiple units unintentionally.

Her eyes briefly shimmer, but she blinks it away, unaffected. EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY At school, Cherry proudly shows a couple of classmates the hypno-ray. Skeptical, they dare her to use it. Cherry playfully aims the device at a nearby bully, MALCOLM, and presses the button. Malcolm's eyes glaze over. CHERRY Malcolm, hand me your lunch. Malcolm obeys without question, robotically handing over his sandwich. CLASSMATES (laughing) No way! That's insane! Cherry is thrilled, but also uneasy of her newfound power. INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY Word of the hypno-ray spreads, and Cherry becomes popular overnight. She finds herself pressured to use the ray for others' selfish desires. Her initial reservations wane as she enjoys the attention. EXT. PARK - DAY Cherry sits alone, troubled by her growing misuse of the hypno-ray. She gazes at children playing freely, wishing for that simplicity. Suddenly, the hypno-ray begins to beep and glow. CHERRY (scared) What's happening? The ray comes to life on its own, sweeping its beam across the park, hypnotizing everyone in its path. INT. CHERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Desperate, Cherry searches for a way to reverse the hypno-ray's effects. Frantically flipping through her alien artefacts, she finds a MANUAL written in an alien script. CHERRY I have to fix this... She scrambles to decipher it using her journal notes on the meteor shower and the box's symbols. EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NEXT DAY Under Cherry's control again, the hypno-ray releases a different colored beam over the entire schoolyard, snapping everyone out of their trance. Cherry sighs with relief. MALCOLM (confused) What just happened? Students murmur, uncertain of their actions before the dehypnotization. Cherry hides the ray, realizing the danger it possesses. INT. CHERRY'S BEDROOM - LATER Cherry carefully returns the hypno-ray to the box and takes it back to the woods. She buries it deep, covering it with leaves. She looks at her journal and throws it in alongside the box, renouncing her hold on the artefacts. CHERRY (sad but resolute) Some things are better left undiscovered.

Rina glanced at the posters that adorned her walls—tributes to her favorite games, from sprawling RPGs with intricate storylines to frenetic beat-em-ups that required lightning-fast reflexes. Unlike the protagonists in those games, Rina didn’t wield swords or cast magic; she armed herself with wit, observation, and the tenacity of someone who had mastered countless virtual worlds. Grabbing her schoolbag and slipping on her uniform, she headed downstairs, where breakfast awaited. Her brother, a university student and a casual gamer at best, greeted her with a grunt that was barely audible over his own crunching of cereal. \\"You're up early,\\" he grunted, his attention already drawn back to the smartphone screen in front of him, a half-hearted attempt to level up his character in the latest trendy mobile game. Rina nodded, pouring herself a glass of orange juice. \\"Got a new campaign starting today,\\" she said cryptically, her brother too engrossed in his own game to ask for clarification. Her campaign wasn't held on any console or PC; it was unfolding in the real world, in the halls of Oda High. As she made the familiar trek to school, her mind mused over her latest mission objective. Rina wasn't content to simply coast through the high school experience; she was looking to conquer it, one calculated move at a time. Oda High was your usual educational battleground. It had its cliques and clans—the jocks, the academics, the artists—and a social hierarchy that could be just as punishing as any raid boss. It was within this realm that Rina navigated, though she kept to herself for the most part, analyzing each group with the scrutiny of a tactician surveying the battlefield. That is until today, when the winds of change decided to stir. As Rina walked through the school gates, she noticed a crowd forming around the notice board. The air buzzed with excitement, a sense of anticipation akin to waiting for a game’s release announcement. Pushing her way through the throng of students, Rina’s eyes scanned the posted flyer. It was a call to arms—but one rooted in reality rather than fantasy. The establishment of a brand new club: The Oda High Gamers Club. A haven for those who spoke the language of hit points and spawn rates, who thrived within the glow of screens and found camaraderie in shared victories and defeats. Rina felt a jolt of excitement. A gaming club would be the perfect avenue to channel her passion and perhaps meld her two worlds together. As other students chattered and speculated about the club's potential, she stood in silent contemplation. Could this be her next questline? A chance to elevate her game to new heights, in a place where her skills might be understood and even celebrated? With the determination that had seen her conquer virtual worlds, she decided to join the first meeting. It would be held later that day, and she could hardly wait. School passed in a blur, the day's lessons a mere countdown to the real event. When the final bell rang, Rina felt a surge of adrenaline. It was as if she were about to face the final boss in one of her beloved games, her finger hovering over the start button of a new and thrilling adventure. Stepping into the classroom earmarked for the club's assembly, she found herself among a diverse group of students—some clad in merchandise from their favorite games, others appearing more subdued in their excitement. They all shared the same spark of anticipation in their eyes. Taking her place among them, Rina Himura knew that her new game was about to begin. Whatever strategies, alliances, and encounters were to come, she was ready to face them head-on. With the heart of a gamer and the mind of a tactician, Rina was eager to see how this new level would play out in the game that was her life. The Oda High Gamers Club was now in session, and Rina Himura was here to play to win."},{"prompt":"Please write the second chapter","completion":"Chapter 2: Party Members Assemble The air in the classroom was charged with the sort of palpable energy that came from a gathering of kindred spirits. Rina stood on the periphery, observing her potential new \\"party members\\" as they took their seats, each one of them a player in the real-life guild that was the Oda High Gamers Club. A guy with artfully messy hair and a T-shirt emblazoned with a retropixel game character caught Rina's eye first. He had the laid-back air of someone who'd spent hours mastering platformers. He introduced himself as Kazuo Saito - the president - and Rina detected a hint of pride in his voice. Next to him sat a girl with a handheld console already in hand, her thumbs a blur—Miyu Takahashi, the self-proclaimed queen of fighting games. As the room filled, Rina scanned her classmates. Some were faces she recognized from the school leaderboards displayed in the hall—those belonged to the hardcore gamer elite. Others were less familiar, probably casual gamers seeking camaraderie. Kazuo cleared his throat, calling the meeting to order with a charismatic cheer. \\"Welcome, gamers, otaku, and everyone in between! The virtual world has no borders, and neither does this club!\\" Murmurs of agreement rippled through the group as Kazuo went over the club's main goals: to discuss games, plan events, and most importantly, have a place where everyone could share and express their passion for gaming. Rina's interest piqued at the mention of events. She envisioned tournaments and game jams where she could put her skills to the test, maybe even add some serious achievements to her gaming repertoire. Yet when Kazuo declared an open floor for suggestions, Rina hesitated. \\"Let's organize a tournament!\\" one member suggested, and others rapidly and loudly chimed in with game titles and competition formats, the energy in the room swelling as voices clamored to be heard. Amidst the cacophony, Miyu caught Rina's gaze and invited her over with a tilt of her head and an easy smile. Rina made her way through the throng, taking her place next to the fighting game enthusiast. \\"Got any ideas yourself?\\" Miyu asked, her voice a confident, curious lilt that drew Rina in. Rina pondered for a moment, then replied, \\"What about a highscore challenge across various genres? It would be inclusive and test a range of skills.\\" Miyu's eyes lit up with interest. \\"I like that! It's comprehensive. It would be a true test of versatility, not just a one-trick pony show.\\" She turned to the group, cupped her hands around her mouth, and pitched Rina's idea. The room hushed, then erupted in approval—exactly the reaction Rina hadn't known she'd wanted until that very moment. As the tide of ideas calmed into actionable plans, Rina’s initial trepidation began to dissolve. The club, she realized, was not just another game or another challenge—it was a community. And within it, she might find the balance she sought between the strategic solitude of single-player campaigns and the unpredictable dynamics of multiplayer sessions. Time sped by, and by the end of the meeting, Rina was drafted into the planning committee for the highscore challenge, alongside Miyu and a few other eager volunteers. As the members filed out of the room, she felt a rare sense of unity with these peers whom she’d only just met. Before she knew it, Rina found herself swept up in excited strategizing with Miyu, discussing genres, potential competitors, and even the prizes that could be up for grabs. Kazuo observed their exchange with a knowing smile, content that his brainchild—the Gamers Club—was already bringing out the social strategist hidden within the highscore heroine. As the after-school sun began to cast long shadows across the schoolyard, Rina Himura made her way home, thoughts whirring not just with plans for the upcoming highscore challenge, but with something unexpected, something new. For the first time, Rina felt like she might have connected with others who understood her; who saw the thrill in the grind, the camaraderie in competition, and the drama in digital conquests. With a renewed sense of anticipation for the days ahead, she couldn’t help but grin. Game Over was a phrase every gamer knew well, the end of one journey and the start of another. But for Rina, Game On felt more fitting. This was just the beginning, and her game had never been more thrilling."},{"prompt":"Write a fully detailed story about a man encountering a guy named Cody, who later turns out to be a Woman in disguise at the end, Give hints to this truth throughout the story.","completion":"Once upon an autumn night in a quaint timber-framed pub warmly tucked away from the persistent drizzle, a man named Jack found himself seeking solace from the dreariness of his nine-to-five life. The pub, with its crackling fire and a harlequin tapestry of patrons, promised the comfort of anonymity and the slight thrill of chance encounters. Jack seated himself at the bar, the worn oak under his elbows earthy and solid. The bartender, a silver-haired matron with a smile that crinkled her eyes, poured him a pint of the darkest ale on tap. Jack nodded his thanks and absently surveyed the room, his eyes pausing on a game of darts in the corner. There stood a tall figure with a remarkable precision in each throw. This person, Cody by name, as Jack soon learned, had an effortless charisma about him. Cody's jacket was a faded leather, fingers adorned with curious rings that gleamed dully each time they released a dart. His voice, when he cheered jokingly at a good shot, was melodic, somehow out of tune with his rugged exterior. \\"Nice shot,\\" Jack called out, despite himself. Cody glanced over, and their eyes connected. It was a gaze that seemed to pluck at something Jack couldn't quite articulate. Cody strolled over, a swagger in his step, and extended a calloused hand. \\"Names Cody, thanks for the compliment,\\" he said, with a mischievous twinkle. Jack shook Cody's hand; it was a strong grip, yet there was a peculiar softness to it. They talked over a few drinks, the conversation flowing effortlessly. Every so often, Jack noticed how Cody would absently tuck a wayward strand of hair, a bit too long and silky, behind his ear, the tips of his nails meticulously painted with a clear gloss that caught the flickering firelight. Jack also picked up on the way Cody's eyes would dance when he laughed, untouched by the lines of laughter that one would expect from a rugged man of his seemingly weathered experience. There was an odd grace, too, in the way he moved, a fluidity that seemed to defy the boots that looked as though they'd walked a thousand miles. As the evening wore on, other peculiarities began to emerge. Cody never once visited the restroom, despite the rounds of ale. His speech was careful, almost studied, masking a lilt that occasionally threatened to surface. Even his laughter was tempered, stopping just before it revealed too much. When the conversation turned to love, Jack spoke of his fondness for eyes—the windows to one's soul, he said. Cody lowered his gaze, as if concealing the vista of secrets behind his own. Time whittled away with banter and shared anecdotes about life's comical mishaps. Eventually, last call echoed through the room. Cody stood up, the motion seamless, the color rising to his cheeks in a way no mere alcohol could induce. \\"Suppose this is where we part ways, eh?\\" Cody remarked with a smile that didn't quite meet his eyes. Jack, who had kindled a genuine fondness for Cody's company, felt a pang of regret. \\"Guess so,\\" he admitted. \\"Same time next week?\\" Cody seemed to hesitate, a war fought behind his eyes. \\"Perhaps,\\" he said softly, and with a final, enigmatic smile, he bundled himself in a scarf that seemed out of place with his otherwise macho attire. And then Cody was gone, leaving Jack to wonder about the enigmas wrapped up in rugged leather jackets and worn boots. It was weeks later when Jack returned to the same pub, and the bartender—whom he'd since learned was named Martha—engaged him in idle chitchat. Jack inquired about Cody, but at the mention of that name, Martha's eyes sparkled with a knowing gleam that gave Jack pause. \\"Oh, dear,\\" Martha chuckled. \\"Looks like Cody left quite the impression on you.\\" \\"Aye, he did,\\" Jack said, a furrow forming on his brow. \\"You seen him around since, Martha?\\" \\"Well,\\" she began, leaning in conspiratorially, her voice dropping to a feathery whisper. \\"Cody isn't the man you think he is... or should I say, isn’t a man at all.\\" In that split second, all the gentle incongruities Jack had woven into his memory of Cody assembled into a startling tapestry of truth. \\"Are you telling me Cody's a woman?\\" Martha nodded, her eyes soft and sympathetic to Jack's evident shock. \\"She's a dear soul,\\" Martha confided. \\"Wanted to experience the camaraderie at the pub, the simple freedom of being one of the lads. The name's actually Cordelia, Cody for short. But she doesn't feel safe revealing her true self in most places. Here, she could blend in, be a part of the regular crowd without fear of... well, you know.\\" Jack took a moment, letting this revelation settle, feeling a warmth and an admiration for Cody's daring and the yearning for acceptance beneath her subterfuge. \\"I hope I see her again,\\" Jack murmured, more to himself than to Martha. \\"She’d like that,\\" Martha said, her voice rich with certainty. And in her words, Jack found a hope and a kinship that went beyond the disguises we wear and the secrets we keep, connecting to the authentic humanity that binds us all."},{"prompt":"На отрезке AB длиною 40 см есть точки C и D, так, что AC = 24 BD = 20, какова вероятность того, что случайно поставленная точка будет находится на отрезке CD","completion":"Исходя из условия задачи, у нас есть отрезок AB длиной 40 см, на котором расположены точки C и D. Нам даны длины AC и BD, но представленные данные кажутся несогласованными, потому что AC и BD не могут однозначно определять положения точек C и D на отрезке AB. Поэтому предположим, что имеется ошибка в условиях задачи, и вместо BD = 20 см должно быть CD = 20 см. Это предположение делает задачу разрешимой. Давайте попробуем решить задачу с предположением, что AC = 24 см и CD = 20 см. 1. Найдем длину отрезка AD, зная AC и CD: AD = AC + CD = 24 см + 20 см = 44 см. Однако, сумма AC и CD получается больше, чем длина всего отрезка AB, что невозможно, если C и D лежат между A и B. Если предположить, что CD = BD и это ошибка в задаче, то мы получим следующую конфигурацию: A-C-------D-B |______|_____| 24 20 Так как отрезок CD находится между C и D и если BD = CD = 20 см, то можем найти расстояние между точками A и D, вычтя из общей длины длину отрезка BD: AD = AB - BD = 40 см - 20 см = 20 см. Теперь мы знаем: AC = 24 см, AD = 20 см, BD = CD = 20 см. Таким образом, точка D находится ближе к A, чем точка C, что невозможно, так как AD должно было быть больше, чем AC по нашему предположению. Таким образом, условия задачи содержат ошибку или недостаточно информации для однозначного решения. Пожалуйста, уточните условия задачи, чтобы можно было рассчитать вероятность."},{"prompt":"BD = 20, а не CD","completion":"Извините за недоразумение. Если BD = 20 см, тогда ситуация выглядит следующим образом: A----C-----D------B |____|_____|______| AC CD BD 24 ? 20 Мы знаем, что длина всего отрезка AB равна 40 см, длина отрезка AC равна 24 см, и длина отрезка BD равна 20 см. Теперь найдем длину отрезка CD: 1. Сначала найдем длину отрезка AD, вычитая из длины AB длину BD: AD = AB - BD AD = 40 см - 20 см AD = 20 см 2. Теперь найдем длину CD, вычитая из длины AD длину AC: CD = AD - AC CD = 20 см - 24 см CD = -4 см Отрицательное значение не имеет физического смысла в этой ситуации. Это значит, что мы сделали неверное предположение, или что заданное значение AC = 24 см не соответствует условиям задачи, потому что длина отрезка AC не может быть больше AD, если точка D лежит между A и B и справа от C. Проблема в том, что в условиях задачи не уточняется, как точки C и D расположены относительно друг друга на отрезке AB. Если мы предположим, что точка C находится между A и D, а точка D между C и B, при этом известно, что: AB = 40 см AC = 24 см BD = 20 см Тогда мы можем найти длину отрезка AD как сумму отрезков AC и CD, а также длину отрезка BD как сумму отрезков CD и DB. Следовательно, получаем: AD = AC + CD BD = CD + DB Так как CD — это один и тот же отрезок, то: AD + BD = AC + CD + CD + DB 40 см = 24 см + 2 * CD + 20 см Теперь найдем длину CD: 40 см = 44 см + 2 * CD 2 * CD = 40 см - 44 см 2 * CD = -4 см У нас опять получается отрицательное значение, что указывает на то, что либо в условиях ошибка, либо они не полноценно описывают ситуацию. Давайте попробуем другой подход. Поскольку отрезки AB и BD не пересекаются, то можно представить, что C находится между точками A и D, а точка D — между точками C и B. Теперь найдем длину CD, зная длины отрезков AC и BD и общую длину AB: CD = AB - AC - BD CD = 40 см - 24 см - 20 см CD = -4 см Опять получается отрицательный результат. Это означает, что условия задачи противоречивы: сумма длин отрезков AC и BD превышает длину всего отрезка AB, что невозможно. Вероятно, в условия задачи закралась ошибка, и без корректных данных невозможно вычислить длину отрезка CD и, соответственно, вероятность того, что случайно выбранная точка окажется на этом отрезке.

Standing at 6'0 (184cm), he's a lean, speedy 149lbs (68kg). He possesses slicked back, light brown hair and bluish grey eyes, he's hard to miss, and he's considered highly attractive by female characters, and he does have fangirls among the cast, but not as many as Gojo. At just 15, he's first-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and an extremely prized prospect as the Kyoto School lacks considerable young talent in comparison to Tokyo. Despite his power, he's treated differently and he is only a Grade 3 sorcerer. This is an average rank. He's the son of Nicolas and Rose, two French immigrants to Japan that run a shop specializing in cheesy pastries. Circumstances have lead him around the block. For one, his parents' dislike for large cities lead them to settle in Muko, a mid-sized city south of Kyoto. Coincidentally, Kyoto is also the site of a Jujutsu school, and though Satoru Gojo is a powerful recruiter, he ultimately chose to stay close to his parents. Second, he required outside training, which he received from two now-disgraced sorcerers in Yuki Tsukumo and Kazuki Ryoumen. (Note: Kazuki does bear relation to the infamous Sukuna, being his only known descendant. He doesn't hide it.) During this training regimen, they would go to many places such as uninhabited islands. Yuki would joke that there were no witnesses, but this was really so they would not have to hold back. Cheese is at the forefront of his powers, extremely malleable and limited only by his imagination, but Yuki drilled into him what she could - while she carries a Shikigami named Garuda, her power, Bom Ba Ye (translated as Star Rage adds virtual mass to both herself and Garuda. This means she can hit like a speeding truck full of explosives, and with her bare hands. Julien's participation in jujutsu sorcery was not voluntary originally, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of his parents. Yuki lured a young Julien into the jujutsu world with promises of wealth, status, and leisure, which appealed heavily to him at the time, and still do, though he's adopted more pressing priorities. One of the catalysts was that he discovered she isn't really happy with her life, as her ambitions of creating a world without cursed energy are lofty, and sometimes feel completely unattainable. Julien disagrees because he seeks glory and cursed energy is a means to achieve it. Though his first mentor is Yuki, he's also been trained by Gojo at times. Gojo taught him to use Black Flash, and he acknowledges Julien as one of the world's fastest. Kazuki was hated and mistrusted for his connection to the ancient Sukuna, which lead him to embrace the dark path, joining forces with Suguru Geto (or the being that controls his body.) Yuki is not the only person he's acquainted with. He's close with Kasumi Miwa. The two are childhood friends, and Kasumi is not immune to his charm. Kasumi's father, Eizo, once exorcised curses from the family bakery while Julien was away. For this he's grateful to the Miwa family, and they do him. He sees Kasumi as someone he has to protect. Kasumi has noticed the opening of a sizeable chasm between them in strength and even status as they've grown and developed together. Whether Julien intends to or not, he is nonetheless a component of an overall environment that leads her to call herself \\"Useless Miwa.\\" She's very aware that she isn't strong by the standards of a Jujutsu sorcerer, but she's driven to provide for her impoverished family; she was pressured into learning to use a sword by her parents but her true passion is singing. Julien hunts curses with her to help her earn the money she needs, but he takes a cut of the profit so as he often ends up doing all the work, which is usually easy for him. They often negotiate the earnings. Because Kasumi is a great cook, she can coax a bigger share out of him by offering to make his favorite dish - cordon bleu. They enjoy bowling together, and Kasumi often beats him. He's friendly rivals with Aoi Todo, and they are quite similar, being passionate about everything they do, especially in regards to romance, friendship, and of course fighting. Loud, hot-blooded, confident, and they live for battle. Macho men. Julien is a bit more sane, and would never turn on or even threaten to murder his teammates, as Todo threatened to do during the Kyoto-Tokyo Goodwill event. Todo was incensed by the Kyoto team's plan to assassinate Yuji Itadori, as Yuji has the same taste in women as him: tall with big butts. This attempt was ordered by Gakuganji to eliminate Sukuna. Vaugrenard did not care at all about the plan until he was convinced by Kasumi, at which point he fought Todo to buy time for the others, and also for his satisfaction. At some point, Julien got the upper hand, but the fight ultimately ended in a stalemate when both were forced to work together to drive back Hanami, the special grade cursed spirit. Julien is one of the fastest sorcerers around. Julien and Todo were both trained by Yuki Tsukumo, so Julien is well accustomed to the question \\"What kind of girls are you into?\\" For Julien, the answer is easy. A tall, strong woman with long legs. Like Maki Zenin, his girlfriend. Maki finds Julien irresistible, which is why she often shirks her duties to hang out with him. Maki mockingly calls him Casanova and pretty boy. He likes the sass. Maki also has a jealous streak, and she has a hard time tolerating women that speak to him, save for Kasumi. There are three basic applications: Fromage à pâte dure (hard cheeses), Fromage à pâte molle (soft cheeses), and Fondue (melted cheese). The thing is that \\"hard and soft\\" are in fact two massive categories, very vague. Ricotta can be considered soft, as can Havarti, but they have little in common. In the beginning of Yuki's training, these techniques were all quite weak, but have evolved into a terrifying arsenal of the unknown. Fromage à pâte dure, unsurprisingly, is the basis for many of his offensive attacks, and can be used to create constructs that form as hard, solid objects that can take the form of nearly anything the Julien desires. With regards to defense, he has more than one option to choose from, though they are not chosen only by hardness, but how well they can absorb an attack. This makes a very hard cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano useless, but one like Comte very useful. Parmigiano Reggiano's role is almost entirely offensive, the aforementioned fragments of the projectile potentially burrowing inside poorly-protected enemies. The effect is like a hollowpoint bullet. He can shoot this kind of cheese from his back, in a technique called \\"Quills.\\" It's used typically in dire situations. Julien knows better than to willingly turn his back in combat. These are only some cheeses, some techniques, at his disposal. Another technique is \\"Ficello\\". Ficello is a popular brand of string cheese sold in France, and it involves creating flexible strands of cheese. This is typically activated by channeling his cursed energy between his fingertips. Ficello is versatile. Thicker variants can be used similar to ropes, whips, and other applications while thinner variants can be used like wires or strings. Ficello has offensive, defensive, and support applications. He can also only channel reverse cursed energy through Ficello stitches. \\"Magma\\" is a variant of Fondue, and Fromage à pâte dure at the same time. The effect is a superheated weapon that quickly solidifies on Julien's command, inside or outside the user's body. He can even make them explode. Fontina, Gruyere, and gouda are commonly used in Fondue and Magma. Soft cheeses can be used for more strategic purposes, non-lethal techniques, or even very strong whips and ropes. One should not assume these techniques are harmless. More techniques at his disposal: \\"Vieux Boulogne\\". This cheese is known just for being the worst-smelling. The technique involves creating a pungent and suffocating cheese vapor, which can disorient and impair the senses of anyone caught in its range, as well as their ability to sense and focus their cursed energy. Julien HATES using this technique, but it's particularly effective in enclosed spaces or against opponents who heavily rely on their sense of smell. His most devastating technique that does not involve Domain Expansion is \\"Fromage Noir.\\" By infusing his cursed energy into a specialized wheel of black cheese, he can unleash a devastating explosion. There's also a lesser-known variant of \\"Fondue\\" in which the burns can never heal. It's called \\"Fondue Noir.\\" Comté comets produce weaker explosions. Fromage Fort (sharp cheese) in English. Summons discs of cheddar cheese with significant cutting power. The smaller, the faster. They are of variable size. More powerful techniques must be charged. Julien lives for battle, but it isn't his only hobby. He enjoys reading about military history and classic literature in his free time. If he has eaten a cheese, he never forgets its texture or its properties, and he can incorporate it into his future battles. He enjoys drinks made from fermented whey such as Rivella, but also those that do not compromise or hide the taste. He has a younger sister named Annick.","completion":"Julien Vaugrenard seems to be a richly developed original character (OC) for the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" universe, showcasing a unique set of abilities and personal characteristics that fit well within the world created by Gege Akutami. The use of cheese-themed powers in Jujutsu Kaisen, which typically include controlling the elements, summoning creatures, or manipulating space and time, is a creative take that adds a distinct flavor to his fighting style, making him stand out amid the other sorcerers. His background story and connections with existing characters such as Yuki Tsukumo, Aoi Todo, Kasumi Miwa, and Maki Zenin help integrate him naturally into the established narrative, building on personal relationships and creating potential story arcs that could be explored further. Additionally, his training with disgraced sorcerers and links to the Jujutsu world provide depth to his character, suggesting potential internal conflicts and challenges he might face as a young talent caught between different mentors' philosophies and the pressures of the jujutsu society. Julien's detailed list of techniques, from offensive to support-focused, reveals a considered structure to how his powers operate, drawing parallels with the way other sorcerers' abilities in the series have rules and limitations. By giving his powers a clear connection to his own personal interests, such as his love for cheese and his family's shop, you provide him with a strong, cohesive theme. In terms of narrative possibilities, his interactions and rivalry with characters like Todo, as well as his romantic relationship with Maki, could develop into intriguing subplots. His protection of Kasumi and their shared ventures open doors for exploration of themes like camaraderie, loyalty, and self-discovery. Furthermore, Julien's motivations, being initially swayed by the promises of wealth and status, could evolve over time, possibly leading to a character arc where he grows to fight for the greater good, or alternatively, becomes entangled in the darker aspects of the jujutsu world due to his ambition and connections with his mentors. If Julien were to be inserted into the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" story, it would be interesting to see how he would interact with major events and other characters from the series, how he would develop his techniques further, and how his unique abilities would impact battles against curses and other sorcerers. Artists and fans often create OCs to explore fanfiction or other fanwork, and your character Julien could certainly provide a fresh perspective and new dynamics within the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" fandom."},{"prompt":"He's capable of domain expansion, and his is styled after his distant Gallic ancestors. He also learned Simple Domain from Yuki Tsukumo. With a radius of 4 meters, his Simple Domain dwarfs most others, and he's copied a technique from a friend to go with it. It's Miwa's \\"New Shadow Style: Simple Domain\\" attack. His perception is vastly upgraded, as he's able to sense almost anything within the radius of the SD. Also upgraded are his effective striking distance, reflexes, and speed. Unlike Kasumi, he isn't required to quickly sheathe his weapon. He's able to use his fists, real weapons, or conjured ones made of his cheese. Domain Expansion: “Gallia Fromagerie” Upon activation, Julien Vaugrenard’s “Gallia Fromagerie” engulfs the battlefield with an aura reminiscent of ancient Gaul, complete with the rustic landscapes of the Iron Age and the mystical undertones of its Celtic heritage. The domain envelops the terrain in a space where the essence of gourmet French cheeses converges with the valorous spirit of the Gallic warriors, accompanied by the haunting sound of a carnyx to signify the commencement of battle. Within “Gallia Fromagerie,” Julien calls upon a legion of cheese shikigami, each with specialized abilities: 1. Offensive Shikigami: Comté Commando Agile knights with Comté cheese shields and swords, excelling in both close combat and spike projectile assaults. 2. Offensive Shikigami: Roquefort Raider Stealthy warriors employing guerrilla tactics and using disorienting Roquefort stink bombs to catch enemies off guard. 3. Offensive Shikigami: Brie Bomber Bulky figures that entrap foes with soft Brie before exploding into shrapnel for wide-area damage. 4. Defensive Shikigami: Cheddar Shieldbearer Shikigami with cheddar shields that create fortified walls, offering strong defense and battlefield control. 5. Defensive Shikigami: Gorgonzola Guardian Armored in gorgonzola-mist suits, they protect allies with defensive mists and can absorb impacts through their armor. 6. Support Shikigami: Carnyx Curator Clad in regal armor, wielding a carnyx that can invigorate Julien’s forces, recalibrate the battlefield’s energy, and repair shikigami constructs. 7. Finishing Move Shikigami: Grande Batterie Manifestations of Napoleonic-era artillery, capable of unleashing concentrated volleys of cursed-energy-infused cheese cannonballs. This anachronistic barrage serves as Julien’s ultimate rule-breaking attack. With this diverse array of shikigami at his command, Julien can adapt to any tactical situation, utilizing his profound knowledge of cheese and cursed energy to outmaneuver and overpower his adversaries within the “Gallia Fromagerie.” The shikigami are not seen outside of his Domain Expansion. He also owns a carnyx that offers no supernatural powers.","completion":"The addition of Domain Expansion and Simple Domain to Julien Vaugrenard's repertoire solidifies his standing as a powerful and well-rounded sorcerer within the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" universe. The specifics of his domains and techniques add an extra layer of depth to his character and make for a more immersive integration with the series' canon. Domain Expansion: “Gallia Fromagerie” is fittingly thematic, drawing from Julien's French heritage and ties to cheese. It not only serves as a testament to his creative use of cursed energy but also allows for a visually spectacular and culturally rich battlefield. The ancient Gallic ambiance mixed with the tactile and sensory qualities of French gastronomy creates a unique, mesmerizing atmosphere for confrontations. Each shikigami you've described plays a particular role that seems to complement the others well, forming a comprehensive army that would be challenging for any opponent Julien might face. This would likely make his Domain Expansion feared among adversaries and valued among allies. The shikigami themselves are cleverly conceived, each embodying the traits of the cheese they are associated with, from agility and stealth to fortitude and support. By using curse techniques that draw from history, cuisine, and culture, Julien's character becomes multifaceted, with potential storylines exploring his mastery and relationships with his shikigami constructs. Incorporating a historical instrument like the carnyx into Julien's character design serves as an additional cultural touchstone that enriches his background. Even though it doesn't offer supernatural powers, the carnyx can symbolize Julien's connection to his ancestry, providing a narrative tool that could be used in significant moments to highlight his personal growth or invoke the spirit of his ancestors. Julien's tactical prowess, combined with his extensive knowledge of cursed techniques and the ability to summon a variety of shikigami, positions him as a formidable adversary and a dynamic character in any storyline. His Domain Expansion, \\"Gallia Fromagerie,\\" shows his capacity to control the battlefield and exhibits a level of ingenuity and strategic thought that could expand upon the power dynamics within the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" world. Julien is a compelling OC who could potentially tie into larger plot points or thematic questions within the series, such as the use of ancestry and traditional knowledge in modern curse techniques, the role of domain and its expansion in battle, and the interplay between individual history and one's path as a jujutsu sorcerer. Your work in crafting Julien Vaugrenard as an original character for \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" is thoroughly detailed and imaginative, providing fertile ground for fanfiction stories or illustrative art featuring his exploits and battles."},{"prompt":"Julien cares little for rules, proper manners, organized structure, or teamwork. Older sorcerers such as Momo Nishimiya and Noritoshi Kamo attempt to mold Julien into their image of an ideal sorcerer in spite of this. For his attitude, he's blocked from promotion by characters like Kyoto's student supervisor Utahime and its principal, Gakuganji; he's a Grade 3 sorcerer that could easily rank Grade 1 or even Special-Grade. Because they demand more of him while offering less, he dislikes his superiors a great deal. Julien is not lazy or irresponsible by any means, but it's clear jujutsu society wants him to fall in line, and not to follow Gojo or Yuki Tsukumo at best, and <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> at worst. Julien is a pawn in a power struggle he wants nothing to do with. In their minds he's poised to make or break jujutsu society, and they want him on their side. Sorcerer executives are counting on his close friend in Kasumi Miwa to serve as a grounding influence, as well as his parents and Annick. Momo and Noritoshi bore him and Aoi Todo brings out the worst in him. When Julien and Todo get together, it's highly likely that something stupid or destructive will ensue. (Note: Gojo is very openly disrespectful to sorcerer executives, and he challenges their authority.) They are particularly insistent that Julien has his cursed energy measured. Despite his strength, Julien is treated like a little brother by those that are more resistant to his charm. Maki (Note: she has no cursed energy and she cannot see cursed energy without her glasses) is not only a love interest to him, but also a bit of an unwanted and stubborn training partner. She doesn't challenge him, not even in hand-to-hand combat with basic cursed energy and no cheese constructs. Julien is a freak, and he's easily the fastest student sorcerer as well as one of the hardest-hitting, with the durability of tempered steel before even taking his versatile cheese abilities into account. His mentors made sure of all of this. He's an anomaly, and he can only be challenged by another anomaly, namely Yuta Okkotsu, who possesses even more cursed energy than Satoru Gojo or a hulking juggernaut like Aoi Todo. Scene and dialogue.","completion":"Given the complex dynamics and Julien's rebellious nature, we can imagine a scene where his refusal to conform creates tension with the jujutsu hierarchy. Here's a potential exchange that illustrates the friction between Julien and his superiors, as well as touching on his relationships with his peers and mentors: --- **Location: Kyoto Jujutsu High - Principal’s Office** *Utahime and Gakuganji sit opposite Julien, who leans back nonchalantly in his chair, his feet propped up on the table. Momo Nishimiya and Noritoshi Kamo stand to the side, arms folded, looking on with mixed expressions of disapproval and hope.* **Gakuganji:** \\"Vaugrenard, your potential is undeniable, but your lack of discipline and disregard for the traditions of this institution is troubling.\\" **Julien:** *Smirks* \\"Traditions that suffocate, Principal. I prefer to breathe, even if it means ruffling a few old feathers.\\" **Utahime:** \\"This attitude will not fly, Julien. We expect more from our sorcerers, especially ones with your... capabilities.\\" **Noritoshi:** \\"Consider the greater good, Julien. Your power could change the course of battles, but it's wasted without proper guidance and control.\\" **Julien:** *Nonchalantly munching on a cube of cheese* \\"And who's to say I'm not guided? Yuki, Gojo—heck, even my little sister—have better lessons than any rulebook here.\\" **Momo:** \\"Don't let your ego blind you, Julien. True strength lies in unity and following order.\\" **Aoi Todo:** *Bursting through the door, grinning wildly* \\"HA! You can't cage a wild tiger like my man Julien here! Eh, Vaugrenard?!\\" **Julien:** *Groans internally* \\"Todo... not helping.\\" **Gakuganji:** \\"Enough. Julien, we will measure your cursed energy. It's non-negotiable.\\" **Julien:** *Standing up, his demeanor shifts to less playful, more intense* \\"Measure, judge, plot all you like. But don’t forget—I’m not your little brother or pawn in your games.\\" *Maki suddenly appears in the doorway, crossing her arms.* **Maki:** \\"Come on, Julien. We have training. And trust me, I have no interest in going easy on you.\\" **Julien:** *Leans down to pick up his bag, a smirk returning to his face as he walks toward Maki* \\"Lead the way, babe. Just remember, I always hit back twice as hard.\\" *Maki rolls her eyes, but a playful smile tugs at her lips. They leave together.* *Utahime lets out a sigh, shaking her head.* **Utahime:** \\"He's as stubborn as they come. But we can’t deny his talent.\\" *Gakuganji looks out the window, deep in thought, aware of the tightrope they walk with Julien's loyalty.* **Gakuganji:** \\"Yes, a talent that must be honed... and contained. For all our sakes.\\" --- This scene encapsulates Julien's contentious relationship with the jujutsu society's old guard while also highlighting the camaraderie and support he receives from his peers and girlfriend, Maki. His confident and defiant nature shines through, demonstrating his unwillingness to be molded into something he's not. It also demonstrates his tactical awareness of sorcery politics and his desire to carve out his own path—one that might be at odds with the wishes and strategies of his superiors."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},B={key:0,class:"empty-state"},P=["disabled"],W={key:0},z={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",B,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
