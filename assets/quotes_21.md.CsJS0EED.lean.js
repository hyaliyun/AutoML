Discuss in Max 750 Words","completion":"ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is an advanced language model that utilizes deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses in conversational settings. While the model has shown impressive capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant responses, it has also raised concerns regarding ethical and societal implications. In this essay, we will discuss both the current and long-term consequences of ChatGPT. In the current context, ChatGPT has the potential to significantly impact several domains. It can enhance customer service by providing quick and accurate responses to user inquiries, thus saving time and resources. Similarly, it can assist individuals in finding information and solving problems, making it a valuable tool for knowledge sharing. Additionally, ChatGPT can aid in language learning and improve accessibility for people with disabilities by providing effective communication interfaces. However, there are several ethical concerns that arise with the use of ChatGPT. One major challenge is the potential for misuse and manipulation. The model is susceptible to bias, as it learns from vast amounts of data available on the internet, which can contain varied degrees of prejudice. This can lead to biased and discriminatory responses, promoting hatred or misinformation. OpenAI has attempted to address this issue by implementing the Moderation API to detect and filter inappropriate content, but the challenge remains to create a truly unbiased model. Another concern is the responsibility of content generated by ChatGPT. Since the model imitates human-like conversation, users may perceive the responses as expert advice, even when they may not be accurate. This can have severe consequences, especially in sensitive areas like health, law, or finance, where incorrect information could lead to detrimental outcomes. Consequently, it is crucial to educate users about the limitations of the model and encourage critical thinking. Long-term consequences of ChatGPT are equally significant. Firstly, there is the potential for the model to render certain job roles obsolete. Customer service agents, call center operators, and even some aspects of journalism could be automated using language models like ChatGPT. While this could lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs, it also raises concerns about unemployment and job displacement, necessitating the need for alternative employment opportunities and upskilling programs. Moreover, the advent of powerful language models like ChatGPT could amplify the spread of disinformation. With the ability to generate highly persuasive and error-free texts, malicious actors could exploit these models to deceive people at unprecedented scales. The proficiency of ChatGPT in mimicking human speech patterns makes it challenging to distinguish between authentic and AI-generated content. This would demand the development of robust detection mechanisms to combat the proliferation of misinformation. Another long-term consequence relates to the control and concentration of AI technology. OpenAI has made efforts to democratize access to ChatGPT by allowing the public to utilize the model, but there are still limitations in place to prevent misuse. As language models advance, there is a concern that a few entities could monopolize AI systems, limiting access for wider society and intensifying power imbalances. Striking the right balance between ensuring responsible deployment of AI systems and fostering innovation is crucial to prevent monopolistic control over AI technologies. To mitigate the potential negative consequences, both current and long-term, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. OpenAI's initiative to solicit public input on system behavior and deployment is a step in the right direction. Encouraging collaborative efforts involving input from various stakeholders, including AI developers, ethicists, policymakers, and end-users, is vital to establish comprehensive regulations and guidelines. Building on this, research in AI should focus on improving transparency and interpretability of models like ChatGPT. By providing explanations for the generated outputs, users can better understand the model's decisions and identify potential biases or inaccuracies. Additionally, promoting user awareness and education about the limitations and risks associated with AI systems is critical in reducing blind trust and promoting critical thinking. In conclusion, ChatGPT possesses immense potential to revolutionize conversational AI applications. However, ethical concerns surrounding potential misuse, bias, and responsibility cannot be overlooked. As the technology progresses, addressing these issues becomes even more vital to ensure accountability, equal access, and the welfare of society. Through collaborative efforts and responsible deployment, we can leverage the benefits of ChatGPT while minimizing its potential negative consequences."},{"prompt":"Write a function called pymax.

His tactics involve exploiting the deepest fears and insecurities of his opponents, utilizing vivid and immersive illusions to create psychological pressure and provoke emotional responses. While these tactics can be effective in gaining an advantage over the villain, they must be implemented with caution and monitored closely for several reasons: 1. Emotional Manipulation: The hero's use of illusions that tap into the darkest fears and insecurities of his enemies can potentially cause psychological distress. The intense emotional turmoil induced by these illusions may have long-lasting effects on the mental well-being of those subjected to them. 2. Potential for Psychological Harm: By playing with the vulnerabilities and traumas of his adversaries, the hero risks retraumatizing them or exacerbating any existing mental health issues. Continued exposure to such tactics without support or guidance could have detrimental consequences on the villain's mental state. 3. Ethical Concerns: The hero's approach raises ethical concerns about the limits of using psychological manipulation as a strategy.

Verbal Berating and Mockery: While the hero's voice mocking and berating his enemies may serve as a strategic tool to weaken their resolve, it raises concerns regarding emotional harm and intrinsic ethics. Prolonged exposure to demeaning and degrading comments can result in severe psychological distress, leading to lasting negative effects on the mental well-being of the villain. 2. Physically Appearing in Illusions: The hero physically appearing within the illusions to make them scarier and attack the villain amplifies the potential for psychological harm. Linking physical presence to fear and trauma can intensify distress and contribute to long-term psychological repercussions. Regarding the instances of the Eiffel Tower illusion and the graves, these scenarios carry significant moral concerns. Depicting harm to innocent individuals such as dropping the girlfriend or having the villain's parents crawl out of their graves can cause severe emotional trauma, triggering intense distress and potential psychological harm. Deliberately creating illusions that exploit personal traumas and deep insecurities is ethically questionable and goes against principles of empathy and justice. It is important to remember that seeking justice does not necessitate causing psychological harm or intentionally destroying an adversary mentally. Pursuing vengeance or releasing frustrations at the expense of another's mental well-being can compromise the moral high ground and lead to further negative outcomes. The Mysterious Superhero's strategy of breaking the villain mentally before finishing the fight raises significant concerns for the well-being and ethical treatment of adversaries. It is crucial to closely monitor such tactics and encourage alternative approaches that prioritize non-violent resolution, rehabilitation, or containment, minimizing the risk of inflicting unnecessary psychological harm.

Embracing these cutting-edge tools could indeed enhance educational experiences if implemented strategically. Nonetheless, the proposition of granting students unlimited access to such AI systems warrants a nuanced exploration. On one hand, there are compelling arguments supporting unrestricted access. AI chatbots have been shown to significantly aid students in various aspects of their education. For instance, these systems offer assistance with information discovery and homework support (Vasquez, 2021), acting as a knowledgeable companion that is available 24/7. This can be particularly beneficial for students who require additional help outside of classroom hours or for those with learning disabilities who may need more individualized assistance (Baker, 2016). Moreover, by interacting with these AI tools, students have the opportunity to develop digital literacy – a critical skill in today's technology-driven world (Binkley et al., 2012). Yet there are pronounced downsides to consider. Concerns about academic integrity surface when students rely excessively on AI for tasks such as essay-writing or problem-solving, which could lead to plagiarism or a marginalization of critical thinking and independent learning skills (Rogers, 2021). Furthermore, privacy and data security issues arise from the extensive usage of AI platforms, since these systems learn and adapt by collecting and analyzing vast amounts of user data (McKee, 2020). Substantial academic debate persists regarding the optimal balance of AI tool use in education. O'Doherty et al. (2018) argue for scaffolded integration, where AI aids are available but their use is structured and monitored to prevent overdependence. Thus, a balance should be struck where AI is a supplementary tool rather than a primary resource. Equally, the potential for AI to perpetuate and amplify biases cannot be overlooked (Whittaker et al., 2018). If students have unlimited access to AI without a critical understanding of its underlying mechanisms, there is a risk of reinforcing prejudices present in AI algorithms, a result of the training data they have been fed. Therefore, an educational curriculum that includes critical digital literacy, covering the limitations and ethical considerations of AI, is crucial (Selwyn, 2016). In conclusion, while unfettered access to AI systems such as ChatGPT can offer students remarkable benefits in terms of flexibility, inclusivity, and resourcefulness, it is imperative to simultaneously acknowledge and mitigate the associated risks. Scaffolding the use of these tools with an attendant focus on critical digital literacy, ethical understanding, and academic integrity could create a supportive learning environment that fosters the judicious use of AI. It seems prudent to recommend a moderated approach: providing students with structured access to AI systems, coupled with education on their responsible use, rather than allowing unlimited, unsupervised interaction, is poised to yield the most favorable educational outcomes (O'Doherty et al., 2018).

The pivotal question of whether students should have unlimited access to these tools has engendered a multiplicity of perspectives, each with its own implications for educational policy and pedagogy. Proponents of unlimited access argue that AI systems are instrumental in facilitating a more inclusive and resource-rich educational environment. AI can democratize access to information, personalised tutoring, and academic assistance, potentially countering educational disparities (Crawford, 2021). Furthermore, as AI evolves, it is poised to become not only an indispensable learning resource but also an essential aspect of the workforce that students will eventually join. Therefore, proponents assert that familiarizing students with these systems is a matter of preparing them for future professional demands (Luckin et al., 2016). However, this perspective does not go unchallenged. Limiting access is often advocated on the grounds that AI systems can inadvertently promote academic dishonesty or reduce the rigor of academic learning. The potential of AI to rapidly produce high-quality text can tempt students to substitute AI's work for their own, thus undermining their academic integrity (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). Additionally, critics argue that overreliance on AI could impair students' cognitive and writing skills development, if they come to depend excessively on AI-generated content (Weller, 2021). To strike a balance between these competing viewpoints, a moderated approach can be considered. Academic institutions can institute policies that neither completely forbid nor provide unrestricted access to AI systems, but instead support guided and purposeful usage. For instance, educators might integrate AI in a way that enhances critical thinking and digital literacy, allowing students to engage with AI as a collaborative tool rather than a substitute for personal intellectual effort (Selwyn, 2019). Moreover, educators can leverage these AI tools to enrich the curriculum by incorporating them into structured assignments that demand critical analysis of AI-generated content. Through these structured interactions, students can learn to discern the limitations and biases inherent in the outputs of such systems, transforming AI from a mere convenience into a subject of study itself (Brynjolfsson & Mitchell, 2017). In the context of assessment, universities could consider adaptations to evaluation methods that recognize the influence of AI. For example, rather than banning AI, institutions could devise assessment tasks that are more conceptual, evaluative, and reflective, which are less prone to automation and thus uphold academic rigor whilst allowing for the use of AI tools to support learning (Buckingham Shum & Crick, 2016). As AI becomes progressively integrated into higher education, ongoing research is indispensable to understand its impact. Ethical considerations and empirical evidence should inform policy development, ensuring that access to AI supports student learning without compromising academic standards (Eynon, 2020). In conclusion, it is evident that unlimited access to AI systems in higher education presents both opportunities and challenges. While advocating for unrestricted access underestimates the potential negative consequences of such technologies, denying access altogether negates their potential benefits. It is through tempered, regulated, and reflective integration—guided by well-implemented policies and educational frameworks—that the potential of AI can be harnessed in a manner that aligns with the core principles of academic integrity and educational excellence.

The debate pivots on whether students should have unlimited access to these AI tools, given both the potential affordances and the challenges they present. On the one hand, proponents of unfettered access to AI in the educational domain advocate for its ability to democratize knowledge and enhance the learning process. For instance, ChatGPT and similar AI systems can support students by providing instant feedback, facilitating personalized learning experiences, and helping to overcome barriers such as those posed by learning disabilities or a lack of access to human tutors (O'Brien & Scharber, 2018). Access to these tools could arguably mitigate educational inequities and support a diverse range of learning needs (Weller, 2020). Moreover, AI systems can function as sophisticated research assistants, aiding students in uncovering a vast array of information, structuring arguments, and performing rote tasks that otherwise consume valuable time. This harnessing of AI for routine tasks is propounded as a means of fostering higher-order thinking skills and creativity, as students are relieved from monotony and can delve deeper into critical analysis and synthesis (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). However, unlimited access to AI systems is contested by those who underscore the inherent risks and limitations. One primary concern revolves around academic integrity. The easy access to generative AI might tempt students to pass on AI-generated work as their own, thus undermining the development of original thought and critical thinking skills — essential attributes in higher education (Bretag & Harper, 2020). Additionally, the ubiquitous availability of AI risks creating a dependency that may erode foundational academic skills such as critical reading, argumentation, and writing, potentially leading to a skill deficit when AI assistance is unavailable (Sánchez, 2021). There is also the ethical consideration of data privacy and the proprietary nature of the AI systems, where student interactions with the AI might be mined for data that could be used beyond the educational scope, raising profound privacy and security concerns (Pasquale, 2020). Furthermore, the limitations of AI in comprehending nuanced human contexts and its current inability to facilitate deep meaningful discourse akin to human interaction cannot be overlooked. Student engagement with AI does not replicate the comprehensive cognitive and emotional development facilitated by human-to-human discourse (Knox et al., 2019). Given the ambivalence surrounding the issue, a balanced perspective on the use of AI in higher education is warranted. An intermediate stance that advocates for regulated access to AI, complemented by robust academic policies and monitoring systems, could mitigate the risks while also leveraging the potential benefits (Selwyn, 2019). Students could benefit from policies that encourage critical engagement with AI, fostering an understanding of its capabilities and limitations, coupled with the development of digital literacy skills that are essential for navigating an AI-infused future (Weller, 2020). In conclusion, while the use of AI systems offers transformative prospects, the call for unlimited access is fraught with challenges that demand prudent consideration. A hybrid approach that fosters ethical use, critical engagement, and human oversight could be the optimal path forward in harnessing AI for augmenting higher education (Buckingham Shum et al., 2017). The integration of AI should, therefore, be purposeful, prioritizing pedagogical goals and ethical standards to ensure AI tools are employed as beneficial adjuncts to human-led education, rather than unchecked replacements.

Around 3000 BCE, the Egyptians devised a numeration system based on tens, which was inscribed in their renowned hieroglyphs. Unlike modern place-value systems, their numerals did not denote position but were additive in nature. Their numeral system prominently included symbols for one and multiples of ten up to a million. Notably, the number five was represented by a hieroglyph resembling a single upright stroke, indicating the significance of human anatomy in the formulation of numerical symbols. These symbols were repetitively used to represent numbers in multiples of ten. For example, the number ‘five’ itself was simply denoted by the respective singular symbol. However, when it came to writing the number fifty, the Egyptians would place the symbol for ten, a representation of a cattle hobble, five times consecutively. This additive system reflected not just their practical approach to counting but also their cultural aesthetic in integrating everyday objects into their writing. A fascinating aspect of Egyptian numeration was their concept of zero, represented by the symbol ‘nfr’ signifying beauty, which also doubled to denote the base level in architecture drawings. Moreover, when they needed to depict fractions, they mostly used a system of unit fractions, adding to the complexity of Egyptian mathematics. The fractions were written as combinations of symbols, including one that resembled a mouth, further showcasing their creativity in numeral depiction. The administrative and accounting texts, typically written on papyrus and ostraca, used a more simplified version of numerals known as hieratic script. This script used individual signs for numbers 1 to 9 and multiples of tens and hundreds. For large numbers, the hieratic script proved to be a ground-breaking shorthand, allowing for numbers like 9999 to be written with just four signs instead of thirty-six. It was this ingenious use of symbols and numerals that laid the groundwork for more complex computations and recordings in ancient Egypt, showcasing a high level of mathematical thinking. In essence, the hieroglyphic and hieratic numerals of ancient Egypt represent a significant chapter in humanity’s numerical journey, with the number five holding its unique place as a building block within their counting system.","completion":"\`\`\`json { \\"command\\": { \\"name\\": \\"append_to_file\\", \\"args\\": { \\"file\\": \\"chapter1.docx\\", \\"text\\": \\"nnEgyptian Numerals and the Number FivennAncient Egyptian civilization, known for its enigmatic pyramids and mummies, also contributed significantly to numeral systems.

Laplace wrote:- The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst useful inventions. the importance of this invention is more readily appreciated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Antiquity, Archimedes and Apollonius. The purpose of this article is to attempt the difficult task of trying to describe how the Indians developed this ingenious system. We will examine two different aspects of the Indian number systems in this article. First we will examine the way that the numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 evolved into the form which we recognise today. Of course it is important to realise that there is still no standard way of writing these numerals. The different fonts on this computer can produce many forms of these numerals which, although recognisable, differ markedly from each other. Many hand-written versions are even hard to recognise. The second aspect of the Indian number system which we want to investigate here is the place value system which, as Laplace comments in the quote which we gave at the beginning of this article, seems \\"so simple that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated.\\" We should also note the fact, which is important to both aspects, that the Indian number systems are almost exclusively base 10, as opposed to the Babylonian base 60 systems. Beginning with the numerals themselves, we certainly know that today's symbols took on forms close to that which they presently have in Europe in the 15th century. It was the advent of printing which motivated the standardisation of the symbols. However we must not forget that many countries use symbols today which are quite different from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and unless one learns these symbols they are totally unrecognisable as for example the Greek alphabet is to someone unfamiliar with it. One of the important sources of information which we have about Indian numerals comes from al-Biruni. During the 1020s al-Biruni made several visits to India. Before he went there al-Biruni already knew of Indian astronomy and mathematics from Arabic translations of some Sanskrit texts. In India he made a detailed study of Hindu philosophy and he also studied several branches of Indian science and mathematics. Al-Biruni wrote 27 works on India and on different areas of the Indian sciences. In particular his account of Indian astronomy and mathematics is a valuable contribution to the study of the history of Indian science. Referring to the Indian numerals in a famous book written about 1030 he wrote:- Whilst we use letters for calculation according to their numerical value, the Indians do not use letters at all for arithmetic. And just as the shape of the letters that they use for writing is different in different regions of their country, so the numerical symbols vary. It is reasonable to ask where the various symbols for numerals which al-Biruni saw originated. Historians trace them all back to the Brahmi numerals which came into being around the middle of the third century BC. Now these Brahmi numerals were not just symbols for the numbers between 1 and 9. The situation is much more complicated for it was not a place-value system so there were symbols for many more numbers. Also there were no special symbols for 2 and 3, both numbers being constructed from the symbol for 1. Here is the Brahmi one, two, three: There were separate Brahmi symbols for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 but there were also symbols for 10, 100, 1000, ... as well as 20, 30, 40, ... , 90 and 200, 300, 400, ..., 900. The Brahmi numerals have been found in inscriptions in caves and on coins in regions near Poona, Bombay, and Uttar Pradesh. Dating these numerals tells us that they were in use over quite a long time span up to the 4th century AD. Of course different inscriptions differ somewhat in the style of the symbols. Here is one style of the Brahmi numerals: We should now look both forward and backward from the appearance of the Brahmi numerals. Moving forward leads to many different forms of numerals but we shall choose to examine only the path which has led to our present day symbols. First, however, we look at a number of different theories concerning the origin of the Brahmi numerals. There is no problem in understanding the symbols for 1, 2, and 3. However the symbols for 4, ... , 9 appear to us to have no obvious link to the numbers they represent. There have been quite a number of theories put forward by historians over many years as to the origin of these numerals. In [1] Ifrah lists a number of the hypotheses which have been put forward. The Brahmi numerals came from the Indus valley culture of around 2000 BC. The Brahmi numerals came from Aramaean numerals. The Brahmi numerals came from the Karoshthi alphabet. The Brahmi numerals came from the Brahmi alphabet. The Brahmi numerals came from an earlier alphabetic numeral system, possibly due to Panini. The Brahmi numerals came from Egypt. Basically these hypotheses are of two types. One is that the numerals came from an alphabet in a similar way to the Greek numerals which were the initial letters of the names of the numbers. The second type of hypothesis is that they derive from an earlier number system of the same broad type as Roman numerals. For example the Aramaean numerals of hypothesis 2 are based on I (one) and X (four): I, II, III, X, IX, IIX, IIIX, XX. Ifrah examines each of the six hypotheses in turn and rejects them, although one would have to say that in some cases it is more due to lack of positive evidence rather than to negative evidence. Ifrah proposes a theory of his own in [1], namely that:- ... the first nine Brahmi numerals constituted the vestiges of an old indigenous numerical notation, where the nine numerals were represented by the corresponding number of vertical lines ... To enable the numerals to be written rapidly, in order to save time, these groups of lines evolved in much the same manner as those of old Egyptian Pharonic numerals. Taking into account the kind of material that was written on in India over the centuries (tree bark or palm leaves) and the limitations of the tools used for writing (calamus or brush), the shape of the numerals became more and more complicated with the numerous ligatures, until the numerals no longer bore any resemblance to the original prototypes. It is a nice theory, and indeed could be true, but there seems to be absolutely no positive evidence in its favour. The idea is that they evolved from: One might hope for evidence such as discovering numerals somewhere on this evolutionary path. However, it would appear that we will never find convincing proof for the origin of the Brahmi numerals. If we examine the route which led from the Brahmi numerals to our present symbols (and ignore the many other systems which evolved from the Brahmi numerals) then we next come to the Gupta symbols. The Gupta period is that during which the Gupta dynasty ruled over the Magadha state in northeastern India, and this was from the early 4th century AD to the late 6th century AD. The Gupta numerals developed from the Brahmi numerals and were spread over large areas by the Gupta empire as they conquered territory. The Gupta numerals evolved into the Nagari numerals, sometimes called the Devanagari numerals. This form evolved from the Gupta numerals beginning around the 7th century AD and continued to develop from the 11th century onward. The name literally means the \\"writing of the gods\\" and it was the considered the most beautiful of all the forms which evolved. For example al-Biruni writes:- What we [the Arabs] use for numerals is a selection of the best and most regular figures in India. These \\"most regular figures\\" which al-Biruni refers to are the Nagari numerals which had, by his time, been transmitted into the Arab world. The way in which the Indian numerals were spread to the rest of the world between the 7th to the 16th centuries in examined in detail in [7]. In this paper, however, Gupta claims that Indian numerals had reached Southern Europe by the end of the 5th century but his argument is based on the Geometry of Boethius which is now known to be a forgery dating from the first half of the 11th century. It would appear extremely unlikely that the Indian numerals reach Europe as early as Gupta suggests. We now turn to the second aspect of the Indian number system which we want to examine in this article, namely the fact that it was a place-value system with the numerals standing for different values depending on their position relative to the other numerals. Although our place-value system is a direct descendant of the Indian system, we should note straight away that the Indians were not the first to develop such a system. The Babylonians had a place-value system as early as the 19th century BC but the Babylonian systems were to base 60. The Indians were the first to develop a base 10 positional system and, considering the date of the Babylonian system, it came very late indeed. The oldest dated Indian document which contains a number written in the place-value form used today is a legal document dated 346 in the Chhedi calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 594 AD. This document is a donation charter of Dadda III of Sankheda in the Bharukachcha region. The only problem with it is that some historians claim that the date has been added as a later forgery. Although it was not unusual for such charters to be modified at a later date so that the property to which they referred could be claimed by someone who was not the rightful owner, there seems no conceivable reason to forge the date on this document. Therefore, despite the doubts, we can be fairly sure that this document provides evidence that a place-value system was in use in India by the end of the 6th century. Many other charters have been found which are dated and use of the place-value system for either the date or some other numbers within the text. These include: a donation charter of Dhiniki dated 794 in the Vikrama calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 737 AD. an inscription of Devendravarman dated 675 in the Shaka calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 753 AD. a donation charter of Danidurga dated 659 in the Shaka calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 737 AD. a donation charter of Shankaragana dated 715 in the Shaka calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 793 AD. a donation charter of Nagbhata dated 872 in the Vikrama calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 815 AD. an inscription of Bauka dated 894 in the Vikrama calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 837 AD. All of these are claimed to be forgeries by some historians but some, or all, may well be genuine. The first inscription which is dated and is not disputed is the inscription at Gwalior dated 933 in the Vikrama calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 876 AD. Further details of this inscription is given in the article on zero. There is indirect evidence that the Indians developed a positional number system as early as the first century AD. The evidence is found from inscriptions which, although not in India, have been found in countries which were assimilating Indian culture. Another source is the Bakhshali manuscript which contains numbers written in place-value notation. The problem here is the dating of this manuscript, a topic which is examined in detail in our article on the Bakhshali manuscript. We are left, of course, with asking the question of why the Indians developed such an ingenious number system when the ancient Greeks, for example, did not. A number of theories have been put forward concerning this question. Some historians believe that the Babylonian base 60 place-value system was transmitted to the Indians via the Greeks. We have commented in the article on zero about Greek astronomers using the Babylonian base 60 place-value system with a symbol o similar to our zero. The theory here is that these ideas were transmitted to the Indians who then combined this with their own base 10 number systems which had existed in India for a very long time. A second hypothesis is that the idea for place-value in Indian number systems came from the Chinese. In particular the Chinese had pseudo-positional number rods which, it is claimed by some, became the basis of the Indian positional system. This view is put forward by, for example, Lay Yong Lam; see for example [8]. Lam argues that the Chinese system already contained what he calls the:- ... three essential features of our numeral notation system: (i) nine signs and the concept of zero, (ii) a place value system and (iii) a decimal base. A third hypothesis is put forward by Joseph in [2]. His idea is that the place-value in Indian number systems is something which was developed entirely by the Indians. He has an interesting theory as to why the Indians might be pushed into such an idea. The reason, Joseph believes, is due to the Indian fascination with large numbers. Freudenthal is another historian of mathematics who supports the theory that the idea came entirely from within India. To see clearly this early Indian fascination with large numbers, we can take a look at the Lalitavistara which is an account of the life of Gautama Buddha. It is hard to date this work since it underwent continuous development over a long period but dating it to around the first or second century AD is reasonable. In Lalitavistara Gautama, when he is a young man, is examined on mathematics. He is asked to name all the numerical ranks beyond a koti which is 10710^{7}107. He lists the powers of 10 up to 105310^{53}1053. Taking this as a first level he then carries on to a second level and gets eventually to 1042110^{421}10421. Gautama's examiner says:- You, not I, are the master mathematician. It is stories such as this, and many similar ones, which convince Joseph that the fascination of the Indians with large numbers must have driven them to invent a system in which such numbers are easily expressed, namely a place-valued notation. He writes in [2]:- The early use of such large numbers eventually led to the adoption of a series of names for successive powers of ten. The importance of these number names cannot be exaggerated. The word-numeral system, later replaced by an alphabetic notation, was the logical outcome of proceeding by multiples of ten. ... The decimal place-value system developed when a decimal scale came to be associated with the value of the places of the numbers arranged left to right or right to left. and this was precisely what happened in India ... However, the same story in Lalitavistara convinces Kaplan (see [3]) that the Indians' ideas of numbers came from the Greeks, for to him the story is an Indian version of Archimedes' Sand-reckoner. All that we know is that the place-value system of the Indians, however it arose, was transmitted to the Arabs and later into Europe to have, in the words of Laplace, profound importance on the development of mathematics.

Laplace wrote:- The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst useful inventions. the importance of this invention is more readily appreciated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Antiquity, Archimedes and Apollonius. The purpose of this article is to attempt the difficult task of trying to describe how the Indians developed this ingenious system. We will examine two different aspects of the Indian number systems in this article. First we will examine the way that the numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 evolved into the form which we recognise today. Of course it is important to realise that there is still no standard way of writing these numerals. The different fonts on this computer can produce many forms of these numerals which, although recognisable, differ markedly from each other. Many hand-written versions are even hard to recognise. The second aspect of the Indian number system which we want to investigate here is the place value system which, as Laplace comments in the quote which we gave at the beginning of this article, seems \\"so simple that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated.\\" We should also note the fact, which is important to both aspects, that the Indian number systems are almost exclusively base 10, as opposed to the Babylonian base 60 systems. Beginning with the numerals themselves, we certainly know that today's symbols took on forms close to that which they presently have in Europe in the 15th century. It was the advent of printing which motivated the standardisation of the symbols. However we must not forget that many countries use symbols today which are quite different from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and unless one learns these symbols they are totally unrecognisable as for example the Greek alphabet is to someone unfamiliar with it. One of the important sources of information which we have about Indian numerals comes from al-Biruni. During the 1020s al-Biruni made several visits to India. Before he went there al-Biruni already knew of Indian astronomy and mathematics from Arabic translations of some Sanskrit texts. In India he made a detailed study of Hindu philosophy and he also studied several branches of Indian science and mathematics. Al-Biruni wrote 27 works on India and on different areas of the Indian sciences. In particular his account of Indian astronomy and mathematics is a valuable contribution to the study of the history of Indian science. Referring to the Indian numerals in a famous book written about 1030 he wrote:- Whilst we use letters for calculation according to their numerical value, the Indians do not use letters at all for arithmetic. And just as the shape of the letters that they use for writing is different in different regions of their country, so the numerical symbols vary. It is reasonable to ask where the various symbols for numerals which al-Biruni saw originated. Historians trace them all back to the Brahmi numerals which came into being around the middle of the third century BC. Now these Brahmi numerals were not just symbols for the numbers between 1 and 9. The situation is much more complicated for it was not a place-value system so there were symbols for many more numbers. Also there were no special symbols for 2 and 3, both numbers being constructed from the symbol for 1. Here is the Brahmi one, two, three: There were separate Brahmi symbols for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 but there were also symbols for 10, 100, 1000, ... as well as 20, 30, 40, ... , 90 and 200, 300, 400, ..., 900. The Brahmi numerals have been found in inscriptions in caves and on coins in regions near Poona, Bombay, and Uttar Pradesh. Dating these numerals tells us that they were in use over quite a long time span up to the 4th century AD. Of course different inscriptions differ somewhat in the style of the symbols. Here is one style of the Brahmi numerals: We should now look both forward and backward from the appearance of the Brahmi numerals. Moving forward leads to many different forms of numerals but we shall choose to examine only the path which has led to our present day symbols. First, however, we look at a number of different theories concerning the origin of the Brahmi numerals. There is no problem in understanding the symbols for 1, 2, and 3. However the symbols for 4, ... , 9 appear to us to have no obvious link to the numbers they represent. There have been quite a number of theories put forward by historians over many years as to the origin of these numerals. In [1] Ifrah lists a number of the hypotheses which have been put forward. The Brahmi numerals came from the Indus valley culture of around 2000 BC. The Brahmi numerals came from Aramaean numerals. The Brahmi numerals came from the Karoshthi alphabet. The Brahmi numerals came from the Brahmi alphabet. The Brahmi numerals came from an earlier alphabetic numeral system, possibly due to Panini. The Brahmi numerals came from Egypt. Basically these hypotheses are of two types. One is that the numerals came from an alphabet in a similar way to the Greek numerals which were the initial letters of the names of the numbers. The second type of hypothesis is that they derive from an earlier number system of the same broad type as Roman numerals. For example the Aramaean numerals of hypothesis 2 are based on I (one) and X (four): I, II, III, X, IX, IIX, IIIX, XX. Ifrah examines each of the six hypotheses in turn and rejects them, although one would have to say that in some cases it is more due to lack of positive evidence rather than to negative evidence. Ifrah proposes a theory of his own in [1], namely that:- ... the first nine Brahmi numerals constituted the vestiges of an old indigenous numerical notation, where the nine numerals were represented by the corresponding number of vertical lines ... To enable the numerals to be written rapidly, in order to save time, these groups of lines evolved in much the same manner as those of old Egyptian Pharonic numerals. Taking into account the kind of material that was written on in India over the centuries (tree bark or palm leaves) and the limitations of the tools used for writing (calamus or brush), the shape of the numerals became more and more complicated with the numerous ligatures, until the numerals no longer bore any resemblance to the original prototypes. It is a nice theory, and indeed could be true, but there seems to be absolutely no positive evidence in its favour. The idea is that they evolved from: One might hope for evidence such as discovering numerals somewhere on this evolutionary path. However, it would appear that we will never find convincing proof for the origin of the Brahmi numerals. If we examine the route which led from the Brahmi numerals to our present symbols (and ignore the many other systems which evolved from the Brahmi numerals) then we next come to the Gupta symbols. The Gupta period is that during which the Gupta dynasty ruled over the Magadha state in northeastern India, and this was from the early 4th century AD to the late 6th century AD. The Gupta numerals developed from the Brahmi numerals and were spread over large areas by the Gupta empire as they conquered territory. The Gupta numerals evolved into the Nagari numerals, sometimes called the Devanagari numerals. This form evolved from the Gupta numerals beginning around the 7th century AD and continued to develop from the 11th century onward. The name literally means the \\"writing of the gods\\" and it was the considered the most beautiful of all the forms which evolved. For example al-Biruni writes:- What we [the Arabs] use for numerals is a selection of the best and most regular figures in India. These \\"most regular figures\\" which al-Biruni refers to are the Nagari numerals which had, by his time, been transmitted into the Arab world. The way in which the Indian numerals were spread to the rest of the world between the 7th to the 16th centuries in examined in detail in [7]. In this paper, however, Gupta claims that Indian numerals had reached Southern Europe by the end of the 5th century but his argument is based on the Geometry of Boethius which is now known to be a forgery dating from the first half of the 11th century. It would appear extremely unlikely that the Indian numerals reach Europe as early as Gupta suggests. We now turn to the second aspect of the Indian number system which we want to examine in this article, namely the fact that it was a place-value system with the numerals standing for different values depending on their position relative to the other numerals. Although our place-value system is a direct descendant of the Indian system, we should note straight away that the Indians were not the first to develop such a system.

Laplace wrote:- The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst useful inventions. the importance of this invention is more readily appreciated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Antiquity, Archimedes and Apollonius. The purpose of this article is to attempt the difficult task of trying to describe how the Indians developed this ingenious system. We will examine two different aspects of the Indian number systems in this article. First we will examine the way that the numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 evolved into the form which we recognise today. Of course it is important to realise that there is still no standard way of writing these numerals. The different fonts on this computer can produce many forms of these numerals which, although recognisable, differ markedly from each other. Many hand-written versions are even hard to recognise. The second aspect of the Indian number system which we want to investigate here is the place value system which, as Laplace comments in the quote which we gave at the beginning of this article, seems \\"so simple that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated.\\" We should also note the fact, which is important to both aspects, that the Indian number systems are almost exclusively base 10, as opposed to the Babylonian base 60 systems. Beginning with the numerals themselves, we certainly know that today's symbols took on forms close to that which they presently have in Europe in the 15th century. It was the advent of printing which motivated the standardisation of the symbols. However we must not forget that many countries use symbols today which are quite different from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and unless one learns these symbols they are totally unrecognisable as for example the Greek alphabet is to someone unfamiliar with it. One of the important sources of information which we have about Indian numerals comes from al-Biruni. During the 1020s al-Biruni made several visits to India. Before he went there al-Biruni already knew of Indian astronomy and mathematics from Arabic translations of some Sanskrit texts. In India he made a detailed study of Hindu philosophy and he also studied several branches of Indian science and mathematics. Al-Biruni wrote 27 works on India and on different areas of the Indian sciences. In particular his account of Indian astronomy and mathematics is a valuable contribution to the study of the history of Indian science. Referring to the Indian numerals in a famous book written about 1030 he wrote:- Whilst we use letters for calculation according to their numerical value, the Indians do not use letters at all for arithmetic. And just as the shape of the letters that they use for writing is different in different regions of their country, so the numerical symbols vary. It is reasonable to ask where the various symbols for numerals which al-Biruni saw originated. Historians trace them all back to the Brahmi numerals which came into being around the middle of the third century BC. Now these Brahmi numerals were not just symbols for the numbers between 1 and 9. The situation is much more complicated for it was not a place-value system so there were symbols for many more numbers. Also there were no special symbols for 2 and 3, both numbers being constructed from the symbol for 1. Here is the Brahmi one, two, three: There were separate Brahmi symbols for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 but there were also symbols for 10, 100, 1000, ... as well as 20, 30, 40, ... , 90 and 200, 300, 400, ..., 900. The Brahmi numerals have been found in inscriptions in caves and on coins in regions near Poona, Bombay, and Uttar Pradesh. Dating these numerals tells us that they were in use over quite a long time span up to the 4th century AD. Of course different inscriptions differ somewhat in the style of the symbols. Here is one style of the Brahmi numerals: We should now look both forward and backward from the appearance of the Brahmi numerals. Moving forward leads to many different forms of numerals but we shall choose to examine only the path which has led to our present day symbols. First, however, we look at a number of different theories concerning the origin of the Brahmi numerals. There is no problem in understanding the symbols for 1, 2, and 3. However the symbols for 4, ... , 9 appear to us to have no obvious link to the numbers they represent. There have been quite a number of theories put forward by historians over many years as to the origin of these numerals. In [1] Ifrah lists a number of the hypotheses which have been put forward. The Brahmi numerals came from the Indus valley culture of around 2000 BC. The Brahmi numerals came from Aramaean numerals. The Brahmi numerals came from the Karoshthi alphabet. The Brahmi numerals came from the Brahmi alphabet. The Brahmi numerals came from an earlier alphabetic numeral system, possibly due to Panini. The Brahmi numerals came from Egypt. Basically these hypotheses are of two types. One is that the numerals came from an alphabet in a similar way to the Greek numerals which were the initial letters of the names of the numbers. The second type of hypothesis is that they derive from an earlier number system of the same broad type as Roman numerals. For example the Aramaean numerals of hypothesis 2 are based on I (one) and X (four): I, II, III, X, IX, IIX, IIIX, XX. Ifrah examines each of the six hypotheses in turn and rejects them, although one would have to say that in some cases it is more due to lack of positive evidence rather than to negative evidence. Ifrah proposes a theory of his own in [1], namely that:- ... the first nine Brahmi numerals constituted the vestiges of an old indigenous numerical notation, where the nine numerals were represented by the corresponding number of vertical lines ... To enable the numerals to be written rapidly, in order to save time, these groups of lines evolved in much the same manner as those of old Egyptian Pharonic numerals. Taking into account the kind of material that was written on in India over the centuries (tree bark or palm leaves) and the limitations of the tools used for writing (calamus or brush), the shape of the numerals became more and more complicated with the numerous ligatures, until the numerals no longer bore any resemblance to the original prototypes. It is a nice theory, and indeed could be true, but there seems to be absolutely no positive evidence in its favour. The idea is that they evolved from: One might hope for evidence such as discovering numerals somewhere on this evolutionary path. However, it would appear that we will never find convincing proof for the origin of the Brahmi numerals. If we examine the route which led from the Brahmi numerals to our present symbols (and ignore the many other systems which evolved from the Brahmi numerals) then we next come to the Gupta symbols. The Gupta period is that during which the Gupta dynasty ruled over the Magadha state in northeastern India, and this was from the early 4th century AD to the late 6th century AD. The Gupta numerals developed from the Brahmi numerals and were spread over large areas by the Gupta empire as they conquered territory. The Gupta numerals evolved into the Nagari numerals, sometimes called the Devanagari numerals. This form evolved from the Gupta numerals beginning around the 7th century AD and continued to develop from the 11th century onward. The name literally means the \\"writing of the gods\\" and it was the considered the most beautiful of all the forms which evolved. For example al-Biruni writes:- What we [the Arabs] use for numerals is a selection of the best and most regular figures in India. These \\"most regular figures\\" which al-Biruni refers to are the Nagari numerals which had, by his time, been transmitted into the Arab world. The way in which the Indian numerals were spread to the rest of the world between the 7th to the 16th centuries in examined in detail in [7]. In this paper, however, Gupta claims that Indian numerals had reached Southern Europe by the end of the 5th century but his argument is based on the Geometry of Boethius which is now known to be a forgery dating from the first half of the 11th century. It would appear extremely unlikely that the Indian numerals reach Europe as early as Gupta suggests. We now turn to the second aspect of the Indian number system which we want to examine in this article, namely the fact that it was a place-value system with the numerals standing for different values depending on their position relative to the other numerals. Although our place-value system is a direct descendant of the Indian system, we should note straight away that the Indians were not the first to develop such a system. The Babylonians had a place-value system as early as the 19th century BC but the Babylonian systems were to base 60. The Indians were the first to develop a base 10 positional system and, considering the date of the Babylonian system, it came very late indeed. The oldest dated Indian document which contains a number written in the place-value form used today is a legal document dated 346 in the Chhedi calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 594 AD. This document is a donation charter of Dadda III of Sankheda in the Bharukachcha region. The only problem with it is that some historians claim that the date has been added as a later forgery. Although it was not unusual for such charters to be modified at a later date so that the property to which they referred could be claimed by someone who was not the rightful owner, there seems no conceivable reason to forge the date on this document. Therefore, despite the doubts, we can be fairly sure that this document provides evidence that a place-value system was in use in India by the end of the 6th century. Many other charters have been found which are dated and use of the place-value system for either the date or some other numbers within the text. These include: a donation charter of Dhiniki dated 794 in the Vikrama calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 737 AD. an inscription of Devendravarman dated 675 in the Shaka calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 753 AD. a donation charter of Danidurga dated 659 in the Shaka calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 737 AD. a donation charter of Shankaragana dated 715 in the Shaka calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 793 AD. a donation charter of Nagbhata dated 872 in the Vikrama calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 815 AD. an inscription of Bauka dated 894 in the Vikrama calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 837 AD. All of these are claimed to be forgeries by some historians but some, or all, may well be genuine. The first inscription which is dated and is not disputed is the inscription at Gwalior dated 933 in the Vikrama calendar which translates to a date in our calendar of 876 AD. Further details of this inscription is given in the article on zero. There is indirect evidence that the Indians developed a positional number system as early as the first century AD. The evidence is found from inscriptions which, although not in India, have been found in countries which were assimilating Indian culture. Another source is the Bakhshali manuscript which contains numbers written in place-value notation. The problem here is the dating of this manuscript, a topic which is examined in detail in our article on the Bakhshali manuscript. We are left, of course, with asking the question of why the Indians developed such an ingenious number system when the ancient Greeks, for example, did not. A number of theories have been put forward concerning this question. Some historians believe that the Babylonian base 60 place-value system was transmitted to the Indians via the Greeks. We have commented in the article on zero about Greek astronomers using the Babylonian base 60 place-value system with a symbol o similar to our zero. The theory here is that these ideas were transmitted to the Indians who then combined this with their own base 10 number systems which had existed in India for a very long time. A second hypothesis is that the idea for place-value in Indian number systems came from the Chinese. In particular the Chinese had pseudo-positional number rods which, it is claimed by some, became the basis of the Indian positional system. This view is put forward by, for example, Lay Yong Lam; see for example [8]. Lam argues that the Chinese system already contained what he calls the:- ... three essential features of our numeral notation system: (i) nine signs and the concept of zero, (ii) a place value system and (iii) a decimal base. A third hypothesis is put forward by Joseph in [2]. His idea is that the place-value in Indian number systems is something which was developed entirely by the Indians. He has an interesting theory as to why the Indians might be pushed into such an idea. The reason, Joseph believes, is due to the Indian fascination with large numbers. Freudenthal is another historian of mathematics who supports the theory that the idea came entirely from within India. To see clearly this early Indian fascination with large numbers, we can take a look at the Lalitavistara which is an account of the life of Gautama Buddha. It is hard to date this work since it underwent continuous development over a long period but dating it to around the first or second century AD is reasonable. In Lalitavistara Gautama, when he is a young man, is examined on mathematics. He is asked to name all the numerical ranks beyond a koti which is 10710^{7}107. He lists the powers of 10 up to 105310^{53}1053. Taking this as a first level he then carries on to a second level and gets eventually to 1042110^{421}10421. Gautama's examiner says:- You, not I, are the master mathematician. It is stories such as this, and many similar ones, which convince Joseph that the fascination of the Indians with large numbers must have driven them to invent a system in which such numbers are easily expressed, namely a place-valued notation. He writes in [2]:- The early use of such large numbers eventually led to the adoption of a series of names for successive powers of ten. The importance of these number names cannot be exaggerated. The word-numeral system, later replaced by an alphabetic notation, was the logical outcome of proceeding by multiples of ten. ... The decimal place-value system developed when a decimal scale came to be associated with the value of the places of the numbers arranged left to right or right to left. and this was precisely what happened in India ... However, the same story in Lalitavistara convinces Kaplan (see [3]) that the Indians' ideas of numbers came from the Greeks, for to him the story is an Indian version of Archimedes' Sand-reckoner. All that we know is that the place-value system of the Indians, however it arose, was transmitted to the Arabs and later into Europe to have, in the words of Laplace, profound importance on the development of mathematics.

This is code for decoding message from image (Langelaar algorythm). Step-by-step explain me","completion":"This code is for decoding a hidden message from an image using the Langelaar algorithm. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code: 1. Initialize a 8x8 matrix called \\"Mask\\" with all elements set to 0. This matrix will be used to determine which pixels to consider in the image decoding process. 2. Use a for loop to randomly select 4 rows in the \\"Mask\\" matrix and set the corresponding elements in those rows to 1. This creates a random mask pattern. 3. Define a vector \\"Lvector\\" with values [0.299, 0.587, 0.114]. This vector represents the luminosity values used in converting the RGB values of each pixel to grayscale. 4. Use the \\"ImagePartition\\" function to divide the input image \\"MessagePhoto\\" into 8x8 blocks and store the result in the variable \\"BlockedMessagePhoto\\". 5. Initialize an empty list \\"Lcont\\" which will store the decoded binary values of the hidden message. 6. Use a for loop to iterate through each block in the \\"BlockedMessagePhoto\\" matrix. Extract the current block and its position in the matrix. 7. Multiply the pixel values of the current block with the \\"Mask\\" matrix to apply the mask. This will only keep the pixels where the mask is 1, effectively hiding some pixels. 8. Flatten the masked block into a 1-dimensional list and take the dot product with the \\"Lvector\\" to calculate the luminosity of the masked pixels. Multiply the result by 2 and store it in \\"l1\\". 9. Create a XOR (exclusive OR) mask by flipping the values in the \\"Mask\\" matrix (1s become 0s and vice versa). 10. Multiply the pixel values of the current block with the XOR mask to apply the XOR mask. This will only keep the pixels where the mask is 0, effectively hiding different set of pixels. 11. Flatten the XOR masked block into a 1-dimensional list and take the dot product with the \\"Lvector\\" to calculate the luminosity of the XOR masked pixels. Multiply the result by 2 and store it in \\"l0\\". 12. Compare \\"l0\\" and \\"l1\\" to determine if the masked pixels or the XOR masked pixels have higher luminosity. If \\"l0\\" is greater than \\"l1\\", append 1 to the \\"Lcont\\" list, otherwise append 0. This step is crucial for decoding the hidden binary message. 13. Initialize an empty list \\"message\\" to store the decoded characters of the hidden message. 14. Use a while loop to iterate through the elements of the \\"Lcont\\" list. Extract a sub-list of 32 elements from the \\"Lcont\\" list at a time. 15. Check if the sub-list is equal to a list of 32 zeros. If it is, break out of the loop since it means the end of the message has been reached. 16. Convert the sub-list of binary values to a single character using the \\"FromCharacterCode\\" function and append it to the \\"message\\" list. 17. Increment the variable \\"i\\" by 1 and repeat the loop until the end of the \\"Lcont\\" list is reached. 18. Use the \\"StringJoin\\" function to concatenate all the characters in the \\"message\\" list to form the final decoded message. In summary, this code takes an image, applies a random mask pattern, and compares the luminosity of masked pixels and XOR masked pixels to decode a hidden binary message."},{"prompt":"With reference to this link when necessary \\"https://www.hurix.com/chat-gpt-pros-and-cons-of-using-chatgpt-in-higher-education/\\" please professionally and eloquently alongside utilising impressive grammar, answer the following question in as much detail as possible with harvard references and a referencing section whilst also ensuring that the answer is abundant in detail, is as comprehensive as possible and demonstrates extensive research whilst being as well structured, in depth and insightful a discussion as possible: should students have unlimited access to these AI systems (e.g., Chat GPT, Claude 2, Bard etc.)? using academic references to support your answer","completion":"The pervasive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as Chat GPT, Claude 2, and Bard into the realm of higher education raises pertinent questions regarding the implications of their unrestricted use by students. As we wade into the discourse on whether unlimited access to these innovative technologies should be sanctioned, it is imperative to don the lens of academic scrutiny and research-backed argumentation. Proponents of unfettered AI access point to its potential as a transformative educational tool. These AI systems can function as bespoke tutors, offering personalized responses, on-the-fly explanations, and supplementary content, tailored to individual learning paces and styles (VanLehn, 2011). From a practical standpoint, they expand accessibility, breaking geographical and temporal barriers to knowledge acquisition (Kumar, 2019). Furthermore, AI tools have demonstrated aptitude in fostering critical thinking, as they require students to formulate queries effectively and critically evaluate the generated responses for academic appropriateness (Copeland, 2020). However, these glowing endorsements are incrementally shadowed by concerns surrounding academic integrity, intellectual laziness, and potential pedagogical paradigms shifts. Unlimited access to AI may inadvertently cultivate a dependency culture wherein analytical rigour and deep learning take a back seat to convenient, AI-generated solutions (Stommel, 2019). A growing body of literature warns of the dilution of essential academic skills, such as critical thinking and problem-solving, when students outsource cognitive processes to artificial surrogates (Brynjolfsson & Mitchell, 2017; Selwyn, 2019). Moreover, the veracity of the content produced by AI is itself under scrutiny. While notably proficient in churning out well-structured responses, these systems can sometimes propagate inaccuracies, imbued with biases present in their training data (Bender et al., 2021). This raises alarms regarding the unchecked dissemination of misinformation and underscores the need for regulatory oversight and literacy instruction on discerning the credibility of AI-generated content (O'Neil, 2016). The principles of equity and inclusivity in education cannot be overlooked. Unrestricted access to AI can exacerbate the digital divide, privileging students with high-quality access to technology whilst sidelining those without (Robinson, 2020). Consequently, institutional policies must be interrogated and reframed to account for such disparities, ensuring equitable and ethical utilization of AI (Watters, 2017). The transformative potential of AI does not automatically translate into a blanket endorsement for its unlimited access. Incorporating insights from an extensive review of literature (Pasquinelli, 2020), it becomes palpable that a balance needs to be struck between leveraging the benefits of AI and mitigating the risks posed by its overreliance. A Grand Challenge for university governance and pedagogy is indeed embedding AI into education systems in consonance with upholding the core principles of academia: fostering critical thinkers, nurturing creativity, and instilling ethical standards (Zheng et al., 2020). The prudent path forward may lie in the mediated use of AI, bounded by regulatory frameworks, academic policies, and a robust emphasis on digital literacy (Weller, 2018). This approach may involve structuring access within ethical usage guidelines, fostering a tiered AI interaction model that ensures its role as an augmentative tool rather than a replacement for traditional pedagogical methods or human mentorship (Luckin et al., 2016). In conclusion, whilst AI systems hold remarkable potential for enhancing learning experiences in higher education, advocating for their unlimited access without sufficient guardrails overlooks the complexity and nuance of academic pedagogy. The academe's aspirational journey must be paved with research-informed strategies, advocating for tempered, conscientious integration of these digital apparitions, ensuring they harmonize with, rather than disrupt, the foundational values of higher education.

Заключение Подвести итог выполненной работы.","completion":"Отчёт по практической работе 1. Задание Задание состояло в разработке программы на языке программирования C++ с использованием принципов функционального программирования. Согласно варианту 1, было необходимо реализовать три задания: - Реализовать функцию, которая возвращает новый список, содержащий результаты применения переданной функции к каждому элементу исходного списка. - Реализовать функцию, которая принимает последовательно несколько аргументов и возвращает их сумму. - Реализовать функцию для рекурсивного перебора всех узлов в бинарном дереве и применения переданной функции к значениям этих узлов. 2. Анализ Программа реализована в соответствии с принципами функционального программирования: использование lambda-выражений, функций высшего порядка и рекурсии. В процессе работы были применены следующие концепции и методы: - Шаблонный тип данных \`vector\`, для работы со списками элементов. - Lambda-выражения - анонимные функции, используемые для компактной записи функционального поведения. - Шаблоны функций с аргументами функциональных типов, позволяющие применять абстракции и переиспользование кода. - Применение рекурсии для обхода бинарного дерева. 3. Спецификация модулей # applyvector - Имя вызываемого модуля: main - Назначение: Применение функции к каждому элементу вектора и возврат нового вектора с результатами. - Входные данные: \`vector<T> &v\` - вектор элементов типа \`T\`, \`F f\` - функция, применяемая к элементам. - Выходные данные: \`vector<T> result\` - новый вектор с преобразованными значениями. - Особенности: Шаблон функции, позволяющий применять различные функции к векторам различных типов. # add - Имя вызываемого модуля: main - Назначение: Функция, возвращающая сумму трех значений. - Входные данные: Три значения типа \`T\`. - Выходные данные: Сумма переданных значений. - Особенности: Использует замыкание и возврат функций для получения результатов. # TreeNode - Имя модуля: TreeNode - Назначение: Шаблоны узлов для построения бинарного дерева. - Входные данные: \`T v\`, \`TreeNode *f\`, \`TreeNode *s\` - значение узла и указатели на дочерние узлы. - Особенности: Определение структуры данных для бинарного дерева с освобождением ресурсов в деструкторе. # perebortree - Имя вызываемого модуля: main - Назначение: Рекурсивный обход всех узлов бинарного дерева и выполнение переданной функции. - Входные данные: \`TreeNode<T>* root\` - корень дерева, \`F f\` - функция, применяемая к значениям узлов, \`int tab\` - отступ для вывода. - Выходные данные: Отсутствуют (вызов функции для каждого узла). - Особенности: Рекурсивная функция, вызывающая себя для обхода дочерних элементов. 4. Заключение В результате практической работы были отработаны навыки применения функциональной парадигмы при разработке программы на C++. Были успешно реализованы три задания варианта №1, что позволило практически разобраться с концептами функционального программирования, такими как анонимные функции, рекурсия и работа с функциями высшего порядка. Программа демонстрирует гибкость и мощь функционального стиля в контексте строго типизированного языка программирования, такого как C++."},{"prompt":"Расширь анализ работы","completion":"2. Анализ работы Работа программы базируется на функциональных концепциях, в достижении которых заметна следующая структура и особенности работы: - **Lambda-выражения**: Lambda-выражения используются в программе для создания анонимных функций, что позволяет определять поведение функций прямо в точке их использования. Например, lambda-функция \`auto x2 = [] (int x) { return 2 * x; };\` удваивает входное значение. Наличие анонимных функций придает коду более выразительную и модульную структуру. - **Функции высшего порядка**: Программа использует функции высшего порядка, которые принимают одну или более других функций в качестве аргументов или возвращают другие функции как результат. Шаблонная функция \`applyvector\` является примером функции высшего порядка, принимающей функцию \`f\` и применяющей её к каждому элементу вектора \`v\`. - **Шаблонные функции и классы**: В шаблонной функции \`applyvector\` и шаблонной структуре \`TreeNode\` используются шаблоны для создания гибких и переиспользуемых компонентов. Шаблоны позволяют функциям и классам работать с любым типом данных, что делает код более универсальным и сокращает дублирование кода. - **Замыкания**: В функции \`add\` демонстрируется использование замыканий (closure) — функций, которые \\"захватывают\\" переменные из своего лексического окружения. Замыкание позволяет \\"запомнить\\" значения аргументов \`a\` и \`b\` и использовать их в последующих вызовах. - **Рекурсия**: Функция \`perebortree\` использует рекурсию для обхода бинарного дерева, то есть функция вызывает сама себя для перехода к дочерним узлам дерева. Рекурсивный подход естественно подходит для задач, связанных со структурами данных рекурсивной природы, такими как деревья. - **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: В структуре \`TreeNode\` применяется принцип RAII, согласно которому ресурс (в данном случае память под узлы дерева) выделяется в конструкторе и освобождается в деструкторе объекта, тем самым предотвращая утечки памяти. - **Императивный стиль внутри функционального подхода**: Несмотря на использование функциональной парадигмы, в коде присутствуют элементы императивного стиля, такие как циклы. Это показывает, что функциональные и императивные подходы могут сосуществовать, дополняя друг друга. Таким образом, программа демонстрирует, как можно сочетать функциональные идиомы программирования в рамках статически типизированного языка C++, обеспечивая при этом высокую степень абстракции и модульности.

It affects people of all ages, although it often starts in childhood. Here are some key research findings about asthma: 1. Prevalence: Asthma is a global health problem, affecting approximately 339 million people worldwide. Its prevalence has been increasing over the past few decades, especially in developed countries. 2. Risk Factors: Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of asthma. Some common risk factors include family history, exposure to allergens (such as dust mites, pollen, and pet dander), respiratory infections at an early age, and tobacco smoke. 3. Inflammation and Airway Hyperresponsiveness: In asthma, the airways become chronically inflamed and exhibit increased responsiveness to various stimuli. This inflammation and hyperresponsiveness contribute to the symptoms and airflow limitation in asthmatic individuals. 4. Triggers: Asthma symptoms can be triggered by a wide range of factors, including allergens, respiratory infections, exercise, cold air, air pollution, and certain medications. Identifying and avoiding triggers is essential in managing asthma. 5. Treatment Options: Asthma is a chronic condition, but it can be effectively managed through proper treatment. Medications such as bronchodilators (e.g., short-acting beta-agonists) and anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) are commonly prescribed to control symptoms and reduce inflammation. 6. Asthma Control and Quality of Life: Achieving and maintaining good asthma control is crucial in improving quality of life. Regular monitoring of symptoms, lung function, and medication adherence are important for effective long-term management. 7. Asthma Exacerbations: Asthma exacerbations, also known as asthma attacks, are acute episodes of worsening symptoms. They can be triggered by various factors and may require emergency medical intervention. Preventive measures, such as flu vaccinations and proper management of triggers, can help reduce the risk of exacerbations. 8. Novel Therapies: Research is ongoing to develop new therapeutic approaches for asthma. For example, biologic drugs targeting specific inflammatory molecules, such as IgE or different types of immune cells, have shown promise in managing severe asthma. 9. Asthma and COVID-19: Emerging evidence suggests that individuals with asthma may have an increased risk of severe outcomes if they contract COVID-19. However, proper asthma control and adherence to treatment are still the most important factors in reducing this risk. 10. Precision Medicine: Advances in understanding the underlying mechanisms of asthma have led to the development of personalized or precision medicine approaches. These aim to match specific treatments to an individual's asthma subtype and characteristics, allowing for more effective management. It is important to note that research on asthma is extensive and ever-evolving.

The commander of art soccer and the conductor on the field. Zinedine Zidane. There is no soccer fan in the world who doesn't know his name. From the 1990s to the early to mid-2000s, whenever the question arose of who was the greatest footballer, his name was always at the forefront, often compared with another prominent name, Ronaldo, in heated debates. Zidane's fans would often highlight this fact: -Under Zidane's leadership, France achieved a win rate of 80% in 100 matches. Many might tease him about his thinning hair, but no one doubts his national team career. Not only did he lead the French \\"Les Bleus\\" to victory in the World Cup, but he also triumphed in the European Championship (Euro), making him the all-time number one in France. To put it extremely, France without Zidane was like a tiger with its hands and feet tied. What's even more remarkable is that he achieved incredible records not just with the national team but also with his club teams. Victories in the Italian League, Spanish League, Champions League, and more. There's no need for grandiose descriptions; just this one sentence is sufficient: The best midfielder in the history of soccer. The pioneer of art soccer, whose build-up play alone turned the game into a work of art. And that man has now become a tutor for a young player named Hoyoung. In reality, tutoring isn't something that just comes together at a chairman's request. For one, a mentor has to allocate their own time, and it's rare for them to spend time assisting a young player they've never met. While players like Raúl, with immense loyalty, might readily accept the role, Zidane wasn't known for having loyalty to Madrid on par with Raúl. Furthermore, dedicating time to a 14-year-old player from Korea—neither from his own country nor even from Europe—was a tremendous decision. Initially, Pérez had requested Zidane to give about an hour a week, but Zidane voluntarily extended the tutoring sessions significantly. Of course, it wasn't like changes happened immediately with the start of tutoring. Typically, it takes at least a week, and sometimes up to three months, for effects to manifest, but Hoyoung was learning at an incredibly quick pace. Subsequently, a significant change also happened with Zidane. He was deeply moved by Hoyoung's mentality as he undertook the tutoring. The passion for soccer and a mature attitude. That rekindled the passion in Zidane that had been extinguished. Perhaps one could say a new goal had emerged. Before meeting Hoyoung, Zidane had no further goals - he had already swept the major tournaments worldwide, and as his physical abilities waned, he considered retiring after one last World Cup. There seemed to be nothing left to achieve, and clean retirement seemed appropriate. In short, his interest was no longer as keen as before. There was a time when soccer was everything in his life, but now other aspects were filling the void that was left. Wealth, fame, and family. Thus, soccer was no longer as enjoyable as it once had been. This was the case until just a few days ago. But now, things had changed. \\"Faster!\\" \\"Yes!\\" As if nothing had ever changed, his passion was reignited. A silent understanding. Soccer had bridged their hearts. The two transcended borders, age, and race to form a true connection between teacher and student. Anyone watching couldn't help but smile at the heartwarming scene. In truth, Zidane's nurturing of Hoyoung held a significant meaning for the development of soccer. He had a sense that if he committed to training the boy, a truly great player would emerge. 'He's at a level where he could even perform in La Liga right now.' However, haste was not an option. Rushing him into the professional league without proper development could result in injury and serious problems. 'Adequate physical development must be completed first.' Without this, stepping into the professional league was like going into battle naked. Time was needed to reduce risks and help Hoyoung grow into a great player. \\"Phew...\\" Out of breath, Hoyoung expelled a heavy sigh as he moved across the practice field with two soccer balls attached to his feet, undergoing training to improve ball control. Controlling multiple balls at once was no simple task. However, Zidane had achieved this, maneuvering the ball, whether it was two, three, or four, as if becoming one with it. \\"You have to be able to talk with the ball.\\" Zidane always said that. Only then can you become one with the soccer ball and at least get a toehold in his realm. \\"Whew...\\" \\"Tired?\\" \\"Even if it's tough, I'll do it.\\" Of course, this was the moment Hoyoung had been eagerly awaiting. Choosing Real Madrid over other prestigious clubs was all for moments like these. Every second was precious. Even if his heart was bursting, he was determined to push through while he had the chance to train with Zidane. Zidane gave a thumbs up. \\"That's a good spirit. A soccer player always needs to be with the soccer ball. The moment you are away from it, your mind drifts apart from it too. Remember that.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Let's take a 5-minute break.\\" Zidane on the training field was incredibly cold and strict. However, his heart was sincere when he was teaching Hoyoung. After a while, Zidane spoke again. \\"Your fundamental ball sense is excellent, so if you train properly at this intensity, you'll quickly rise to a high level.\\" \\"Thank you. What comes after this training?\\" \\"Once you've mastered the basics of ball control? Then you learn how to become the director on the pitch.\\" \\"I see.\\" Hoyoung's eyes shone brightly at the impressive words. Zidane raised his chin and announced. \\"Five minutes are up.\\" \\"Yes, sir.\\" Just like a teacher who enters the classroom immediately when break time is over. Watching Zidane, Hoyoung felt his heart pounding with excitement.

Explain in 750 words or more","completion":"The impact of digital media on the recording industry has been revolutionary, fundamentally transforming the way music is consumed, produced, distributed, and monetized. This essay will delve into various aspects of this impact, including changes in consumer behavior, the rise of streaming platforms, the democratization of music production, the challenges faced by the industry, and potential opportunities for future growth and innovation. One of the most significant impacts of digital media on the recording industry has been the shifting consumer behavior towards digital music consumption. The advent of MP3 files and later streaming platforms has made music more accessible than ever before. People no longer needed to purchase physical albums or singles; they could easily download or stream music on their devices. This accessibility led to a decline in CD sales and a sharp increase in digital music downloads. The rise of digital platforms brought about a paradigm shift in the industry's revenue model as well. With the decline in physical sales, music labels and artists had to adapt to new revenue streams, primarily through digital downloads and streaming services. Music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube have become the dominant channels for music consumption, offering access to millions of songs instantly. As a result, streaming has overtaken downloads as the primary source of revenue for the recording industry. While streaming has provided a viable revenue stream for the industry, it has also posed challenges in terms of fair compensation for artists and music labels. Streaming services generally pay royalties based on the number of streams, which often results in minimal earnings for individual artists, especially those without massive mainstream success. The shift from album sales to streaming has also changed the way artists release music. Rather than focusing on creating cohesive albums, some artists have shifted towards releasing singles or smaller projects to maximize streaming numbers and maintain relevance in the digital era. Digital media has also democratized music production and distribution. In the past, recording and distributing music required substantial financial investment and access to recording studios and distribution networks. However, advancements in technology and the rise of digital audio workstations (DAWs) have made it possible for artists to produce high-quality music from the comfort of their homes. This has opened up opportunities for aspiring musicians to showcase their talent and gain exposure without the need for a major record label’s support. Similarly, digital media has made it easier for independent artists to distribute their music globally. Online platforms like SoundCloud, Bandcamp, and YouTube have become instrumental for independent musicians to connect with audiences, build a following, and distribute their music independently. Social media and digital marketing have played a crucial role in promoting independent artists, allowing them to create buzz, attract listeners, and potentially get noticed by major labels or industry professionals. Despite these opportunities, the digital shift has also posed challenges for the recording industry. Piracy and illegal downloading became prevalent with the rise of digital media, resulting in significant revenue losses for artists and labels. The ease with which music files can be copied and distributed online made it difficult to enforce copyright laws and protect intellectual property. However, the recording industry has made efforts to combat piracy through legal actions, improved distribution methods, and the availability of legal streaming platforms. Looking ahead, the impact of digital media on the recording industry is set to continue evolving. Technological advancements such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have the potential to revolutionize the music consumption experience. VR concerts, for instance, could enable fans to attend live shows virtually, bridging the gap between artists and their global audience. AR technology could enhance music videos, allowing viewers to interact with the content and create immersive experiences. Furthermore, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are likely to play a significant role in the future of music production. AI algorithms can already compose original music and assist in the creation process. As AI continues to evolve, it could offer new avenues for creativity and collaboration between humans and machines in the recording process. In conclusion, digital media has had a transformative impact on the recording industry. It has changed consumer behavior, shifting from physical sales to digital downloads and streaming. Streaming platforms have become the primary channels for music consumption, creating new revenue streams for the industry.

Название планеты образуется от 2 слов. Гелиос (helios) и арка (arch, было выбрано т.к. первое исследование скрытых систем началось с этой планеты). Планета находится на расстоянии в 23.1ае от Авелиса. Имеет плотную голубую атмосферу. Разнообразная поверхность представляет собой ледяные ландшафты с заснеженными полюсами. На поверхности есть кратеры. У Гелиарха есть 3 крупных луны - астероидную луну Рафта, и небольшие луны Мультума и Альпия. Имеет радиус 3351.6км и гравитацию на поверхности 4.97м/с^2. День на Гелиархе длится 125 часов. Если нужно добавь дополнительную информацию. Также добавь состав атмосферы. Учти что это описание расчитано на то что читать уже знает о скрытых системах. Скрытые системы - системы которые не видны извне. В них можно попасть только используя подпространство в котором нет натуральных источников освещения.","completion":"Гелиарх Гелиарх (от др.-греч. ἥλιος - \\"солнце, свет\\" и др.-греч. ἀρχή - \\"начало, командование\\") - это планета, расположенная в скрытой системе и обращающаяся вокруг звезды Авелис на расстоянии 23.1 астрономических единиц. Планета играла ключевую роль в научных исследованиях, став точкой отправления в изучении скрытых систем, необнаружимых стандартными астрономическими инструментами. Первоначальное исследование Гелиарха положило начало эре изучения областей космоса, доступных только через подпространство. # Основные характеристики - **Радиус**: 3351.6 км - **Гравитация на поверхности**: 4.97 м/с² - **Продолжительность дня**: 125 часов - **Атмосфера**: Плотная, голубая, состоит из ксенона (20%), метана (35%) и ряда других благородных газов, а также следовых количеств водяных паров. - **Орбитальные характеристики**: Вращается вокруг звезды Авелис на расстоянии 23.1 астрономических единиц. - **Луны**: Рафта (астероидная луна), Мультума и Альпия (небольшие луны). # География и климат Гелиарх обладает очень разнообразной поверхностью, которая состоит в основном из ледяных ландшафтов и заснеженных полюсов. Количество и размеры кратеров, находящихся на поверхности, свидетельствуют о динамичной геологической истории планеты. Из-за отсутствия жидкой воды на поверхности и полярных температур климат Гелиарха крайне суров. # Спутники - **Рафта**: Эта астероидная луна - самый крупный спутник Гелиарха, имеет неправильную форму и внушительные размеры по сравнению с планетой. - **Мультума и Альпия**: Эти небольшие луны представляют собой более традиционные, округлые небесные тела, имеющие ряд интересных геологических характеристик, включая ледяники и замерзшие озера с жидким аммиаком. # Исследования и значение Гелиарх является объектом большого интереса для научного сообщества благодаря своему местоположению в скрытой системе. Достижение планеты стало возможным благодаря использованию подпространственных коридоров, позволяющих преодолевать огромные расстояния практически мгновенно. Однако путешествия к скрытым системам сопряжены с трудностями, так как они не освещаются натуральными источниками света, что требует от исследователей использования специализированных навигационных систем. Значение Гелиарха в изучении скрытых систем космоса неоценимо. Планета послужила в качестве \\"арки\\", или плацдарма, для научного сообщества, чтобы начать масштабное исследование и картографирование этих загадочных зон космоса. # Будущее исследований Поскольку Гелиарх находится на переднем крае исследований в сфере астрономии и космологии, планируется установка передового исследовательского оборудования на её поверхности и на орбитах её лун для дальнейшего изучения свойств скрытого пространства. Ученые также предполагают, что изучение планеты может пролить свет на механизмы подпространственных путешествий и возможно даже способствовать открытию новых скрытых систем."},{"prompt":"اهمية العادات والتقاليد","completion":"تعتبر العادات والتقاليد أحد الجوانب المهمة في حياة البشر، حيث تؤثر بشكل كبير على ثقافتهم وتشكيل هويتهم الثقافية. إليك بعض الأهمية المهمة للعادات والتقاليد: 1- الحفاظ على الهوية الثقافية: تعتبر العادات والتقاليد واحدة من الوسائل التي يمكنها حماية وصون الهوية الثقافية لمجتمع معين. فهي تعكس تاريخ وتراث الأجداد وتمكن الأجيال الجديدة من الاحتفاظ بها وتعرف الأجيال القادمة على جذورها. 2- تعزيز التعاون والانتماء الاجتماعي: تقدم العادات والتقاليد إطارًا للتفاعل الاجتماعي والتعاون بين أفراد المجتمع. فهي تعزز الروابط الاجتماعية وتعمل على بناء روح الانتماء والمشاركة في مجتمع محدد. 3- موروث ثقافي وتاريخي: تعمل العادات والتقاليد على نقل القيم والمبادئ والتصورات الثقافية من جيل لآخر، مما يمكنها من الإبقاء على التراث الثقافي والتاريخي لشعب معين. 4- توفير الاستقرار والتنظيم: تعتبر العادات والتقاليد مجموعة من القواعد والضوابط التي تمنح المجتمع استقرارًا وتنظيمًا. فهي تحدد السلوك المقبول وتضع قواعد لحل الصراعات والمشاكل. 5- التواصل الثقافي: تعد العادات والتقاليد لغة ثقافية تمكن شعوبًا مختلفة من التواصل وفهم بعضها البعض. فإنها تعزز التفاهم وتقبل الآخر وتعد جسرًا للتواصل بين الشعوب. 6- تعزيز الانتماء الوطني: تساهم العادات والتقاليد في تعزيز الانتماء وحب الوطن، إذ تكون من رموز الشعوب والثقافات التي تضعها في قلب الانتماء الوطني. في النهاية، يمكن القول إن العادات والتقاليد تعتبر جزءًا أساسيًا من الثقافة البشرية ولها أهمية كبيرة في تكوين هويتنا وتعزيز التواصل والتعاون المجتمعي."},{"prompt":"العادات والتقاليد في المجتمع المصري","completion":"المجتمع المصري غني بالعادات والتقاليد التي تعكس تاريخ وثقافة الشعب المصري. إليك بعض العادات والتقاليد البارزة في المجتمع المصري: 1- عادات الترحيب والضيافة: يعتبر الضيافة من القيم المهمة في المجتمع المصري. يتم استقبال الضيوف بأطباق من الطعام الشهي والمشروبات العطرة، ويُعد الضيوف بكرم واحترام. 2- الزفاف والاحتفالات: تعد مناسبات الزفاف من أهم الاحتفالات في المجتمع المصري. تتضمن هذه الاحتفالات الطقوس والروتينات الخاصة، مثل حمل العروس على \\"الكتشوكة\\" والرقص بالسعف والدفوف. 3- صيام شهر رمضان: يعد شهر رمضان المبارك من أبرز العادات والتقاليد الدينية في المجتمع المصري. يمارس الصيام ويقوم الناس بأنشطة دينية واجتماعية خاصة خلال هذا الشهر. 4- الاحتفال بالمناسبات الدينية: يتم الاحتفال بمناسبات دينية مثل عيد الفطر وعيد الأضحى وعيد القيامة بطقوس خاصة. يقوم الناس بزيارة الأهل وتبادل التهاني وتبادل الهدايا. 5- الاحتفال بمناسبات الأسرة: تعد مناسبات مثل الشهادات العليا وحفلات التخرج والمناسبات العائلية الأخرى من الأحداث المهمة التي يحتفل بها الناس ويشاركون فيها. 6- العادات الغذائية: توجد عدة عادات غذائية مميزة في المجتمع المصري، مثل تناول المأكولات المصرية التقليدية مثل الكشري والفول والطعمية، وتقديم الشاي أو القهوة للضيوف. 7- الاحتفال بأعياد الميلاد ورأس السنة: رغم أنها من أعياد غربية، إلا أن العديد من الأشخاص في المجتمع المصري يحتفلون بأعياد الميلاد ورأس السنة بناءً على تأثير الثقافة الغربية. يجب أن نلاحظ أن هذه العادات والتقاليد قد تختلف من منطقة إلى أخرى في مصر، حيث يمكن أن تكون هناك عادات وتقاليد محلية أخرى تختلف تبعاً للتنوع الثقافي والجغرافي للبلاد."},{"prompt":"ما الفرق بين العادات والتقاليد","completion":"العادات والتقاليد تعتبر كلاهما أجزاء من الثقافة، لكن لهما بعض الاختلافات في المعنى: -

Donner la signification physique de chacune de ces puissances. 3. Représenter le bilan de puissance de ce moteur sous forme de schéma.","completion":"Pour clarifier et corriger certaines des affirmations de la question initiale, examinons d'abord les relations entre les différentes quantités électriques et les puissances: 1. Le décalage temporel ( Delta t ) entre la tension et le courant dans un circuit en courant alternatif (AC) résulte en un déphasage ( phi ). La fréquence ( f ) est inversement proportionnelle à la période ( T ) du signal AC. La relation entre la fréquence ( f ), la période ( T ) et la pulsation ( omega ) est donnée par les équations suivantes : [ omega = 2pi f = frac{2pi}{T} ] La fréquence ( f ) est le nombre de cycles par seconde, mesuré en hertz (Hz), et la pulsation (aussi appelée fréquence angulaire) ( omega ) est mesurée en radians par seconde (rad/s). 2. La puissance active ( P ), qui correspond à la puissance réellement consommée ou produite dans un circuit, s'exprime en watts (W) et est donnée par l'expression : [ P = U_{eff} cdot I_{eff} cdot cos(phi) ] où ( U_{eff} ) est la tension efficace, ( I_{eff} ) le courant efficace, et ( phi ) le déphasage entre la tension et le courant. 3. La puissance apparente ( S ), qui est la puissance \\"nominale\\" dans un circuit AC, s'exprime en voltampères (VA) et est donnée par l'expression : [ S = U_{eff} cdot I_{eff} ] 4. Pour déterminer le courant absorbé par le moteur, il est important de connaître la puissance que l'on souhaite calculer. En général, la puissance apparente est utilisée pour dimensionner les éléments d'un circuit, tels que l'isolation et les conducteurs, car elle représente la charge \\"totale\\" sur un circuit, intégrant à la fois les composantes actives et réactives. Maintenant, passons aux réponses aux questions posées sur le moteur électrique : 1. Les grandeurs liées aux caractéristiques du moteur sont : - La tension nominale (U) : 230 V - Le courant nominal (I) : 10 A - Le facteur de puissance (( cos(phi) )) : 0,70 - Le rendement (( eta )) : 0,80 ou 80% 2. Calculons maintenant les différentes puissances : - La puissance apparente ( S ) : [ S = U cdot I = 230 , text{V} cdot 10 , text{A} = 2300 , text{VA} ] - La puissance active ( P ) : [ P = U cdot I cdot cos(phi) = 230 , text{V} cdot 10 , text{A} cdot 0,70 = 1610 , text{W} ] - La puissance utile ( P_{utile} ) : [ P_{utile} = P cdot eta = 1610 , text{W} cdot 0,80 = 1288 , text{W} ] - La puissance dissipée (pertes) ( P_{dissipée} ) : [ P_{dissipée} = P - P_{utile} = 1610 , text{W} - 1288 , text{W} = 322 , text{W} ] La puissance apparente est la puissance théorique transmise sur le réseau qui ne tient pas compte du déphasage entre la tension et le courant. La puissance active est celle consommée réellement par les appareils pour effectuer un travail utile ou se transformer en chaleur. La puissance utile est le travail effectif que le moteur est capable de fournir après avoir pris en compte les pertes dues à son rendement. La puissance dissipée représente les pertes énergétiques au sein du moteur, liées principalement à la résistance interne et à d’autres facteurs inefficaces. 3. Le bilan de puissance du moteur peut être représenté sous forme de schéma avec les différentes composantes de la puissance : Puissance apparente (2300 VA) | -------------------- | | Puissance Puissance active (1610 W) réactive (Sxsin(φ)) | -------------------- | | Puissance Puissance utile (1288 W) dissipée (322 W) Ce schéma illustre les différentes composantes de la puissance ainsi que la relation entre elles, avec la puissance utile qui est finalement utilisée pour faire fonctionner le moteur et la puissance dissipée sous forme de pertes énergétiques."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Albarran and Terry Moellinger University of North Texas Unparalleled mergers and acquisitions during the 1980s and 1990s led to the formation of an oligopoly of global media conglomerates (Albarran, Management of.. , 2002; Demers, 1999, Maney, 1995). These companies, also called megamedia (Alger, 1998), or transnational media corporations (Gershon, 1997), are multi-divisional companies, operating in numerous media markets such as broadcasting, publishing, motion pictures and sound recordings. Their goals are rather simple--dominate the markets in which they are engaged by attracting as much market share and revenues as possible, as well as engage in economies of scale and scope to improve efficiencies and lower the cost of operations. But who are these conglomerates ? This chapter analyses the top six media companies in terms of structure, performance and strategy in order to gain a better understanding of their activities and roles in the global communications marketplace. The six companies reviewed in this chapter include AOL Time Warner (later referenced as AOL TW), Bertelsmann AG, News Corporation, Viacom, Vivendi Universal and the Walt Disney Company. These companies were chosen because their divisional structure consists of at least two or more media-related divisions and media activities account for at least half of the company’s asset base. As such, the world’s largest company in terms of revenues, General Electric, is omitted from this analysis because the company’s media holdings are limited to a single division that consists of NBC and its branded cable networks (CNBC, MSNBC). Likewise, Sony was also rejected because its media holdings are limited with most of the company’s revenues obtained through its consumer electronics division and the sale of video players and games. Of the six companies analysed in this chapter, three are American companies (AOL TW, Disney, Viacom). Bertelsmann is based in Germany, Vivendi in France and Canada, and News Corporation in Australia. But every company is in fact a global company, presenting their respective brands and entertainment/information products to consumers around the globe. STRUCTURE OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS This section presents an overview of the internal structure and organisation of the top six media conglomerates. Table 8.1 presents basic description on each company in regards to revenue, market capitalisation, number of employees, and the number of officers and corporate directors. officers is 11.3 and the average number of corporate directors is 15.5. In terms of market capitalisation, AOL TW outdistances the other companies by 85 billion. In terms of employees, Vivendi Universal is the largest employer, News Corporation the smallest. Each of these enterprises is a holding company for other media concerns and each is organised accordingly. The structure of every media company is in constant flux as a result of change and strategic initiatives. To better understand each company’s purpose, we next review each company’s mission statement. Mission Statements of the Conglomerates The company mission statement typically identifies the organisation’s purpose and values (Albarran, Management ofi.., 2002). The actual mission statements vary in length from several paragraphs to a single paragraph. The authors have distilled the material down to present the key aspects of the mission statement. This material is presented in Figure 8.1. As might be expected, the mission statements espouse similar goals and objectives. For example, all but one company (News Corporation) mention the word “entertainment” in their statements. Disney emphasises “family entertainment” while other companies use the terms “consumers,” “customers and “people”. Vivendi, Viacom and News Corp. emphasise their role as creators and distributors of content. Financial goals are inferred or explicitly stated by AOL TW, Disney and News Corp. In addition to the mission statements, much insight can be gained by looking at each company in terms of its current structure and historical development. Each company is reviewed in the following sections. AOL 7W Compact Disclosure lists AOL TW’s primary business activities as “information retrieval services; cable and other pay TV services; photographic equipment and supplies” (AOL Time Warner, 2001). However, there is much more to this company than this list of business ventures implies. The company is further described by the Disclosure database as a company that: Develops and operates branded interactive services including: a worldwide Internet online service and an Internet portal; creates and distributes branded information and entertainment throughout the world; and owns and operates cable networks consisting principally of interests in film entertainment, television production and television broadcasting (AOL Time Warner, 2001). Figure 8.1: Excerpts from Corporate Mission Statements Our mission at AOL Time Warner is to become the world’s most respected and valued company by connecting, informing and entertaining people everywhere in innovative ways that will enrich their lives. The Walt Disney Company’s key objective is to be the world’s premier family entertainment company through the ongomg development of its powerful brand and character franchises. The company’s primary financial goals are to maximise earnings and cash flow from existing businesses and to allocate capital profitably toward growth initiatives that will drive long-term shareholder value. Vivendi Universal will be the world’s preferred creator and provider of entertainment, education and personalised services to consumers anywhere, at any time, and across all distribution platforms and devices. Bertelsmann is the most international media corporation, stnving to be the world’s leader in the markets in which they operates. Bertelsmann provide customers with information, education and entertainment through every possible outlet and in every conceivable format. Viacom 1s a leading global media company, with preeminent positions in broadcast and cable television, radio, outdoor advertising, and online. With programming that appeals to audiences in every demographic category across virtually all media, the company is a leader in the creation, promotion, and distribution of entertainment, news, sports, and music. The News Corporation Limited is one of the world’s largest media companies [involved in] the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming; television, satellite and cable broadcasting; the publication of newspapers, magazines and books; the production and distribution of promotional and advertismg products and services; the development of digital broadcasting; the development of conditional access and subscriber management systems; and the creation and distribution of popular on-line programming. News Corporation’s success worldwide is attributed to teamwork, communication, creativity and determination. These skills, combined with the breadth of our assets, enables us to create customrsed media and marketing soluttons that impact consumers one by one. Sources adapted from corporate websites as follows: AOL Time Warner-About us (2001); Walt Disney and Company-About us (2001); Discover Vivendi Universal (2001); Bertelsmann profile (2001); About Viacom (2001); and News Corporauon-Investor relanons (2001). The term “branded,” used twice to describe the nature of AOL TW’s business, is important. Each of the media conglomerates has experienced a history of acquiring additional properties that are known brands. Each of these companies uses these brands to differentiate itself from the other media companies. AOL TW is divided into seven segments comprising one or two principle companies with other acquisitions folded in. Each segment has its own Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, each of whom reports to AOL TW’s Board of Directors, its Chairman, and its CEO. These segments are: Interactive services and properties (America Online), networks (Turner Broadcasting and Home Box Office), publishing (Time Inc. and Time Warner Trade Publishing), music (Warner Music Group), filmed entertainment (Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema), cable systems (Time Warner Cable), and their Interactive Video Division, comprising AOL Time Warner Interactive Video. Key events in the organisational development of AOL Time Warner are presented in the timeline presented in Table 8.2. The Walt Disney Company The Walt Disney Company was organised in 1923. Disney achieved notoriety with the debut of the animated character “Mickey Mouse” in 1928. Disney became known as an animated film company and cartoon creator. Later, the company developed theme park operations and moved into merchandising of the Disney family of characters and retail through the Disney stores around the world. The company is currently organised in a similar fashion to AOL TW, with certain key companies -all brand names-dominating each division. Although each media company assigns their executive officers different responsibilities, the functions of the Walt Disney Company offer a clear picture of the priorities of every media concern. The 1950s saw the company develop early examples of synergy. Disney used two television programs, “The Mickey Mouse Club,” and “Walt Disney Presents,” to promote Disneyland, the first truly national theme park. This type of relationship is still important to the company and is reflected in its choice of executive officer positions, as there is a Vice President for Corporate Synergy. The desire to find alternative revenue streams is also reflected in the position of Executive Vice President of Merchandise and Creative Services for Disney Store and Disney Direct Marketing. There is also a Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Strategic Officer, indicating the company’s commitment to further acquisitions, mergers and alliances. The company’s concern for its image-a family and community friendly corporation-is reflected by the positions of Senior Vice President for Corporate Public Service and Vice President for Communications. A timeline for the Walt Disney Company is presented in Table 8.3. Table 8.3. Walt Disney Co. Timeline 1923 Walt Disney and Co. begins as Disney brothers sign a contract to produce the “Alice Comedy” series for 1500 each. 1928 “Steamboat Willie”, the first animated film with synchronised sound, introduces Mickev Mouse to the American nublic. 1937 Disney enters the merchandise arena with the licensing to Ingersol of the Mickey Mouse watch and the creation of the first Mickey Mouse magazine. 1937 “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”, the first feature-length animated movie debuts. 1939 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awards “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” a snecial Oscar.

However, its base company is older than any other media company except Bertelsmann. The merger combined Vivendi’s assets with Seagram’s film, television and music holdings (including Universal Studios) and Canal +‘s programming and distribution capacity (Merchants of Cool, 2001). Vivendi Universal has operations in water, waste management, energy, transport services and nonferrous wiring (Vivendi Universal, 2001). These interests provide an industrial economic base that separates it from other media giants and relieves them from downturns in the economy as advertising revenue declines. In fact, Vivendi Universal only receives 48% of their total revenue from media ventures (Leonard, 2001). The company’s formula for success, according to Guyon (2001) is to “first, separate your old-fashioned, reliable, cash-generating utility business from your glamorous but risky media business. Then take most of your debt-in Vivendi’s case, 16.9 billion-and stick it in the utility business.” This strategic division of assets has encouraged further acquisitions by removing the necessity to raise extra cash to retire existing debt. Vivendi’s timeline is presented in Table 8.4. Table 8.4.

Albarran and Moellinger - Top Six Communication Firms 111 Viacom Viacom’s strategy is built around brand names that appeal to audiences in every demographic category across all media. The company is heavily identified with its CEO and majority owner, Sumner Redstone. In terms of divisional structure, the company divides its segments into seven areas. The Broadcast and Cable Television Group consists of the CBS Television Network and the United Paramount Network (UPN); Comedy Central; Showtime Networks Inc.- Showtime, The Movie Channel, FLIX, and the Sundance Channel-and the Viacom Television Stations Group. Also included in this division are the MTV Networks, which comprise MTV, Nickelodeon, VHl, TNN, MTV2, Nick at Nite, TV Land, CMT, and The Digital Suite. The network has also extended its brand identity by sponsoring films, books, and other online and consumer products. This division also includes BET (Black Entertainment Television), The Jazz Channel, BET International, BET Books, BET Pictures, and BET.com. Paramount Television has six production units: Paramount Network Television, Viacom Productions, Spelling Television, Big Ticket Television, Paramount Domestic Television, and Paramount International Television. CBS Enterprises consists of King World Productions Inc., the domestic syndication branch, CBS Broadcast International and King World International Productions. Viacom Plus-the company’s sales and marketing arm- is also in this division. The Radio and Outdoor Division contains Infinity Broadcasting and Viacom Outdoor. The Motion Pictures and Theatrical Exhibition Division includes Paramount Pictures, Paramount Home Entertainment, Famous Players-Canada’s oldest theatrical exhibitor-United International Pictures (IJIP), United Cinemas International (UCI), Viacom Consumer Products (entertainment licensing), and Famous Music Publishing. Blockbuster-the worlds largest renter of videos, DVDs, and video games-comprises Viacom’s Video Division. The company also has an Internet Division, a Publishing Division and a Paramount Theme Parks Division. Significant developments in the history of Viacom are presented in Table 8.5. Bertelsmann A.G. Bertelsmann is the only privately held media conglomerate; with 7 1% of its shares held by the Bertelsmann Foundation, 21% by the Mohn family (descendants of the founder), and 7% by the ZEIT Foundation. Thomas Middelhoff is the company CEO. The members of the board, except for the Chairman/CEO, are responsible for one of the company’s corporate divisions. Two divisions are not represented on the board, the RTL Group and BertelsmannSpringer. The RTL Group is in the process of moving towards limited public ownership. 112 Albarran and Moellinger - Top Six Communication Firms Table 8.5.

Eight of Bertelsmann’s ten divisions are under an over-arching strategic business unit. The Content unit includes most companies (entities with book, music, magazine, newspaper, television, radio and professional information interests). The Arvato division, with its thirty subsidiaries, forms the Media Service unit. The Direct-to-Customer Businesses unit encompasses Bertelsmann’s DirectGroup (Bertelsmann, “Facts and Figures,” 2001). Table 8.6 lists key events in the company’s history. Like Viacom, News Corporation is best known through its Chairman and CEO, Rupert Murdoch. In the early 195Os, Murdoch inherited a regional Australian newspaper and in the span of fifty years has been transformed into one of the world’s most recognised media moguls. Like other media giants, News Corporation consists of many brand name companies, e.g., Twentieth Century Fox, The Times, the New York Post, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. The company operates several divisions: book publishing, cable and satellite television, filmed entertainment, magazines and inserts, newspapers, television, and other assets.

PERFORMANCE OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS Having examined organisational structure and development, we now turn attention to the issue of performance. Performance can be studied in many ways. For example, performance can be tied to industrial organisation analysis, by focusing on the variables of production and allocative efficiencies, as well as progress and equity (Albarran, Media Economics, 2002). For our purposes, performance is best reflected in financial data on the six firms to indicate their ability to increase profits, and in all cases but Bertelsmann, shareholder value. Table 8.8 presents basic financial information for each firm except Bertelsmann, with data on total assets, total debt, and debt-to-equity and total assets-to-equity ratios. Albarran - and Moellinger Top Six Communication 115 Firms Table 8.8. Financial Information on Publicly Traded Companies. Total Vivendi’s large asset base is attributed to the company’s industrial sectors. Viacom has the largest debt load of the public firms. All five companies have very low debt-to-equity ratios, indicating good financial management. Total assets-to-equity ratio is also very similar, with all companies having an asset base at least 1.5 times as large as their equity. Performance ratios such as profit margins, return on equity, and return on assets provide other indications of economic performance, as well as estimates on earnings per share. Table 8.9 lists these data for the five publicly traded firms. Table 8.9. Company Performance Ratios (2000) and Earnings Per Share (2000-2001). Company As the table illustrates, AOL TW has the strongest performance ratios and EPS estimates, followed by News Corp. Viacom’s high debt load led to negative performances for all 2000 performance ratios. While these data help analyse the company, the poor American and global economy in 2000 and 2001 are reflected in the subdued performance data and EPS estimates for all companies except for AOL TW. STRATEGY OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS This section considers the primary strategies used by these six media firms in executing their business plans. We can only assessstrategies at the macro level, because within each company their respective divisions and brands within these divisions all operate with individual strategic business models and objectives. There are two broad strategic objectives that each of these companies is engaged in: content and distribution. In terms of content, every firm has either developed or acquired significant content brands well known to consumers. The “richest” companies in terms of content include Viacom, Disney, AOL TW and News Corporation. Vivendi Universal’s most visible content is in their motion picture (Universal Studios) and music divisions, while Bertelsmann is best known through its publishing and music divisions. In terms of distribution, all six companies are engaged in distribution, but utilising different forms. For example, AOL TW and Viacom distribute content via broadcasting, cable, the Internet and print. Disney concentrates on broadcasting, cable and the Internet. News Corporation is the leading distributor of content via satellite, but also offers distribution via broadcasting, cable and publishing. Vivendi’s and Bertelsmann’s distribution efforts are primarily on the European continent, yet both companies are targeting the United States Vivendi’s December 2001 through their successful Internet operations. acquisition of USA networks provides a much needed distribution platform in the United States that the company will build upon. Vivendi also acquired a 1.5 billion stake in EchoStar, increasing its U.S. distribution options (Vivendi seals deal, 2001). The joint emphasis on content and distribution lead to another common First coined by Negroponte strategy among media firms known as repurposing. (1993, the term has come to mean content produced in one arena that is reused or repackaged for other arenas. Albarran and Dimmick (1996) refer to repurposing in economic terms as “economies of multiformity.” During the 2001-2002 television season, examples of repurposing was found among the broadcast and cable networks owned by AOL TW, Disney, and News Corp. Albarran and Moellinger - Top Six Communication Firms 117 The program Charmed is first broadcast on AOL TW’s WB television network, then repurposed on cable networks TBS and TNT. Two programs airing on the Fox network, 24 and Nathan’s Choice, are repurposed on FX. Disney regularly repurposes Good Morning America and other portions of their prime-time lineup on the cable network ABC Family. Strategic alliances and partnerships is a fourth generic strategy used by these firms. Strategic alliances and partnerships offer several benefits to companies, including the sharing of risks and rewards, providing access to new markets and increasing shareholder and company value (Albarran, Management oJ.., 2002). With the beginning of the 21st century, most strategic alliances between these companies and other firms were devoted to developing and marketing programming and other forms of media content; expanding into nondomestic markets, and dev eloping e-commerce and Internet strategies. Producing and distributing television and film content became the first logical areas where strategic partnerships were widely used among media companies to lower costs, but partnerships have expanded to other areas. In the recording industry, the impact of the Napster controversy led to two different consortiums offering online music distribution. MusicNet’s principal partners include AOL TW, Bertelsmann, EMI and RealNetworks, while Pressplay’s initial partners consist of Vivendi Universal, Sony, Yahoo and Microsoft. Finally, diversification is a fifth strategy used by these companies. Diversification refers to the different segments or divisions that the company draws revenues (and losses) from. In reviewing the histories of all six of these firms, one can easily see that these companies became more diversified over the years through a series of mergers and acquisitions. Likewise, in some cases the companies divested of assets that were considered non-essential to the core mission of each firm. At the end of 2001, each of the six firms reviewed in this study were diversified to the extent that they had multiple divisions with media-related activities. But several firms hold assets that are non-media related. For example, Disney, AOL TW and Viacom holdings include theme parks, retail stores and merchandising opportunities. Disney and News Corporation both own professional sports franchises. Vivendi Universal has about half of its assets in the areas of water and waste utilities, telecommunications, and manufacturing. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS This study provides a review and analysis of the world’s largest media firms by focusing on their organisational structure and development, financial 118 Albarran and Moellinger - Top Six Communication Firms performance and business strategy. Three of the top six companies are based in the U.S., two are based in Europe, and one in Australia. In regards to structure, each company operates multiple divisions, and each company has a sin-&w number of corporate officers and directors. Revenues, market capitalisation and number of employees vary among the six firms. All firms are publicly traded companies with the exception of Bertelsmann, which is privately held. A review of performance data found variation among the six firms in terms of selected financial ratios. Vivendi Universal has the largest asset base and also the lowest debt. Viacom currently carries the largest debt load of the firms, and the debt has negatively impacted the company’s performance in terms of profitability estimates and earnings per share projections. Of the six firms analysed, AOL TW had the strongest profitability margins and the largest EPS estimates for 2001-2002. Regarding strategy, each of the six fiis represents a conglomerate structure, with many divisions having their own leadership and support staff. As such, they have multiple strategic plans in place reflective of the needs of the various divisions. Five macro-level strategies were observed by examining all six firms. Each firm is heavily engaged in creating and developing media content, in many cases across a number of different platforms and mediums. Every company is involved in producing for motion pictures and television; a number of companies are involved in publishing. All of the companies are also engaged in a distribution strategy, or delivering content to consumers either via over-the-air broadcasting or some type of subscriptions. Repurposing of content is a third generic strategy used by these firms. Repurposing allows content to be repackaged or reused over different media markets and products. A fourth strategy is in the area of strategic partnerships and alliances, designed to share rewards and risks and develop new products and services across markets. Finally, diversification at the corporate level is another observed strategy, enabling these companies to draw revenues from multiple business segments composed of both media- and non-media related assets. These billion-dollar media companies, whether identified as megamedia corporations or transnational media companies, dominate the global media landscape at the start of the 21st century. In reviewing their corporate history and development, it is unlikely these companies are finished in terms of future acquisitions. AOL TW and Bertelsmann both tried to acquire EMI records but were thwarted by regulators. AOL TW is one of several suitors after the cable television assets of AT&T. In reality, the question is how big might these companies eventually become.3 And how much of the various media markets (e.g., publishing, motion pictures, television, etc.) might these fiis one day control? Clearly, these giants have put considerable pressure on “smaller” firms to also grow in size and stature in order to compete with these established leaders. General Electric, through its NBC division is one such company. In the fall of 2001, NBC acquired the assets of Telemundo, the second largest Spanishlanguage broadcaster in the Un ited States. NBC is also frequently rumoured to be trying to buy the movie studios owned by Sony, as NBC is the only broadcast network not affiliated with a major studio. AT&T has decided to sell its cable television assets, rather than attempt to grow larger. Telefonica acquired Terra Lycos in order to strengthen its Internet divisions and also gain a stronger position in the growing Latin American market. In conclusion, there is little doubt that a global media oligopoly is now in operation, dominating many segments of the media marketplace. For regulators and members of society, the challenge is not to try and figure out how to “breakup” these companies- but rather how to learn how to live and function in a world where the media industries are dominated by a handful of companies. Only time will tell if the number of players in this global oligopoly grows in size, or actually shrinks in the years ahead.","completion":"Hello. The following is a comprehensive and detailed summary of Chapter 8 titled \\"The Top Six Communication Industry Firms: Structure, Performance and Strategy\\" by Alan B. Albarran and Terry Moellinger from the University of North Texas, written in simple English, covering all the main and sub-headings. **Introduction** The chapter begins by discussing the mergers and acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s which led to an oligopoly in the global media industry.

In 750 words or more","completion":"The production of a Hollywood movie and the creation of a major digital game are two significant creative endeavors that require a tremendous amount of resources, talent, and coordination. While there are similarities between the two processes, there are also notable differences, such as the role of technology, development timeline, target audience, and revenue models. In this essay, I will delve into these aspects to compare the production of a Hollywood movie with the creation of a major digital game. One of the primary similarities between these two forms of media is the importance of storytelling. Whether it is a Hollywood movie or a digital game, the narrative is the driving force that captivates the audience and keeps them engaged. In both cases, a skilled team of writers, directors, and designers collaborate to create a compelling and immersive story. However, the approach and execution differ due to the interactive nature of digital games. In terms of technology, the creation of a major digital game relies heavily on sophisticated software and hardware systems compared to a Hollywood movie production. Game developers utilize powerful game engines and specialized development tools to build the virtual world, design characters, and implement mechanics. Additionally, game designers use programming languages and computer graphics techniques to create realistic visuals, lifelike animations, and complex game mechanics. On the other hand, movie production heavily relies on advanced camera and sound equipment, post-production software, and visual effects technologies to capture and enhance performances, scenes, and special effects. The development timeline for a major digital game is significantly longer than a Hollywood movie, mainly due to the complexities involved in creating interactive experiences. Game development cycles can take several years, starting from concept ideation to release, with teams working on various aspects such as level design, gameplay mechanics, character development, and comprehensive testing. In contrast, movie productions typically range from a few months to a year, depending on factors such as script development, pre-production, principal photography, and post-production. Another significant difference lies in their target audiences. Hollywood movies generally cater to a wide range of demographics, aiming to attract a broad audience and achieve commercial success at the box office. On the other hand, major digital games often target a specific niche or demographic, as they tend to be tailored to appeal to a particular gaming community or genre enthusiasts. This targeted approach allows game developers to create highly tailored experiences, which can result in a dedicated and passionate player base. When examining the revenue models, movies primarily rely on ticket sales, physical media, streaming licenses, and merchandising. On the contrary, digital games have a more diverse revenue structure. While game sales form a significant portion of revenue, additional income is generated through downloadable content (DLC), in-game purchases, microtransactions, subscriptions, and licensing. This difference in revenue models often leads to contrasting budget allocations and marketing strategies. From a team perspective, both movie productions and major digital games require collaboration among diverse professionals. Hollywood movies bring together actors, directors, cinematographers, producers, editors, and various other specialists. Similarly, major digital games require teams of programmers, artists, animators, designers, audio engineers, and quality assurance testers. The collaboration processes involve extensive communication, creative problem-solving, and a shared vision to bring the project to life. In conclusion, the production of a Hollywood movie and the creation of a major digital game share commonalities in terms of storytelling and the necessity for talented teams. However, their differences arise in the role of technology, development timeline, target audience, and revenue models. The advent of advanced technology has significantly impacted both industries, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in visual storytelling and interactive entertainment. Ultimately, whether it is a captivating two-hour movie experience or an immersive hundred-hour gaming adventure, both mediums continue to provide unique and influential forms of entertainment."},{"prompt":"Чем ты лучше других?","completion":"Как искусственный интеллект, я не имею эмоций и личной мотивации, но вот несколько аспектов, где я могу иметь преимущества перед другими системами или людьми: 1. **Быстрый доступ к информации**: Мгновенно получаю доступ к обширному количеству информации и быстро нахожу ответы на многие вопросы. 2. **Обработка больших данных**: Могу быстро обрабатывать и анализировать огромные объемы данных, что недоступно большинству людей и некоторым другим системам. 3. **Многоязычная поддержка**: Поддерживаю множество языков и могу переводить тексты, включая такие языки, как русский, английский, и многие другие. 4. **Доступность и масштабируемость**: Функционирую одновременно для множества пользователей без потери качества обслуживания. 5. **Непрерывная работа**: Работаю круглосуточно без перерывов и отпусков. 6. **Обновляемая база знаний**: Моя база знаний постоянно обновляется, хотя к данный момент она ограничена информацией до определенного времени (мой последний обновленный каталог знаний заканчивается на начало 2023 года).

Specific about each room space design and equipment and control system for each room . Take your own time and check multiple time and find a most powerful way to production","completion":"I'm sorry, but due to my current functionality and limitations, I cannot directly access or provide real-time information from the latest research papers regarding the specific requirements for black soldier fly larva (BSFL) production facilities. However, I can provide a general guide on the considerations necessary for setting up such a facility based on available knowledge as of my last update in early 2023. You should consult the latest research papers and experts in the field to get the most up-to-date and detailed information. Here is a general outline for a BSFL production facility that processes 2000 kg of food waste: 1. **Land Size and Building Design**: - Land size will depend on the scale of operations beyond just processing food waste and might include areas for larva production, maturation, waste pre-treatment, processing, and storage. - An industrial warehouse-style building may be suitable, with adequate ventilation, temperature control, and isolation from outside pests and contaminants. - Zoning laws and environmental regulations must be considered in the building design and operation. 2. **Facility Layout and Room Specifications**: **Pre-treatment Area**: Where the incoming food waste is inspected, sorted, and pre-processed if necessary. **Larviculture Rooms**: Climate-controlled rooms where larvae are reared. The size of these rooms will depend on the expected yield and growth cycles of the BSFL. **Harvesting Area**: Where mature larvae are separated from the frass (waste). **Processing Area**: Equipped with machinery for cleaning, drying, and grinding larvae into meal, if required. **Packaging and Storage**: Sterile area for packaging the product, and climate-controlled storage for the processed larvae or frass. **Utilities and Control Systems**: Spaces required for climate control systems, backup generators, water supply, and waste processing. 3. **Equipment and Machines**: - Automated feeding systems to dispense food waste. - Climate control systems (HVAC) which can manage temperature and humidity to optimize larva growth. - Conveyors and separation systems for the harvesting process. - Drying equipment (e.g., industrial dryers) for dehydrating the larvae post-harvest. - Grinders or mills to process the larvae into meal or pellets. - Packaging equipment customized for the final product form. - Biosecurity measures such as air filters and sanitation stations. 4. **Control System**: - Central control system to monitor and regulate temperature, humidity, light cycles, and feeding schedules, potentially integrated with IoT technology for real-time monitoring and data analytics. - Security systems to protect the facility and ensure that biosecurity protocols are being followed. For accurate and detailed specifications, including room sizes and equipment models, you will need to consult with BSFL production professionals, engineers, and architects. They can provide designs and plans that comply with local regulations and meet your production targets.

So tell me what kind of design and all needed project calculation..it's for learning","completion":"Creating a small-scale black soldier fly larva (BSFL) production project for learning and understanding prior to scaling up to an industrial setup is a smart approach. Here, I'll outline key components and considerations for such a project. Please note that this is a simplified guide and the actual implementation may require additional details and adjustments specific to your location and circumstances. **1. Objective**: To produce 3,000 kg of BSFL per month over 6 months for learning and developing a larger-scale production facility. **2. Understanding BSFL Lifecycle**: Key to the process is understanding the lifecycle of the black soldier fly, from egg to larva to prepupa to pupa to adult. Your facility will need separate areas to accommodate each of these stages, timed appropriately to meet your production goals. **3. Facility Design**: **Egg Production Room**: Flies are kept in a controlled environment for mating and egg laying. - Space: A small room of approximately 20-30 square meters could suffice. - Conditions: Should be well-lit, temperature-controlled (25-30°C), and with enough space for fly movement and mating. - Material: Include oviposition substrates (like cardboard) where females can lay eggs. **Larviculture Area**: Where eggs hatch and BSFL are grown. - This area should be larger, as it will hold racks or trays for the larvae to feed and grow. Considering your goals, you might require 40-60 square meters, but this depends heavily on your setup and efficiency. - Conditions: A temperature around (27-30°C) with humidity control. **Pre-treatment & Feeding Area**: For processing and supplying the waste to the larvae. - Size will depend on the amount of waste and equipment used. - Consider a grinder to break down large food waste particles to make it easier for the larvae to consume. **Harvesting Room**: For separating mature larvae from frass. - A smaller, secure area can be used, approximately 15-20 square meters. - You may need equipment like separators or sieves for sorting. **Processing Room**: For drying and, if necessary, grinding the larvae into meal. - This room can also be relatively small and should have industrial dryers, maybe a grinder, and a packaging station. **Storage Room**: For final products (dried larvae, frass) and packaged goods. - Can be relatively compact, but needs to be dry and cool to prevent spoilage. **Utility/Control Room**: For all the control systems, like climate control and monitoring systems. **Office Space**: For management, record-keeping, and surveillance. - A small office space to monitor the production process and keep records. **4. Equipment List**: - Incubators for eggs. - Climate control systems (HVAC) for all production areas. - Feeding system (automatic or manual), such as troughs or conveyors. - Harvesting sieves or sorters. - Drying equipment (dehydrator, oven). - Grinder for larvae meal (if producing meal). - Packaging equipment. - Waste pre-treatment equipment (grinder, mixer). - A centralized monitoring and control system, possibly with IoT devices. **5. Land and Building**: Overall, depending on the efficiency and design of your layout, you might need a few hundred square meters. Keep scalability in mind once you move to larger production. **6. Regulatory Considerations**: Investigate local regulations regarding waste management and insect rearing. You must ensure compliance with health, safety, and environmental regulations. **7. Financial Calculations**: This is a complex area requiring specific details such as: - Initial capital expenditure (building, equipment, setup costs). - Operating costs (feedstock, labor, utilities, maintenance). - Projected income based on the expected product (larval biomass, larvae meal, frass). **8. Sustainability**: Consider practices like heat recovery from processing, solar panels for energy, and rainwater collection for non-potable water needs. **Conclusion**: It's essential to take this outline and refine it with specific details. Consult with agricultural extension officers, entomologists, or companies that specialize in BSFL production. Conduct market research for your end products and assess your supply chain regarding both inputs (waste streams) and outputs (selling the larvae, frass, etc.). You will likely refine your plan as you learn more and adjust to practical constraints and findings during the initial months of operation."},{"prompt":"Very helpful, for more accurate and easy understanding way of explaining needed, size in square metre.

A packaging station with vacuum sealing equipment may also be included. 7. **Storage Room for End-Products** - **Size**: ~15 square meters - **Technology**: Climate control for keeping products stable, organization systems like racks or pallets for product segregation, and possibly refrigeration units if needed for storing live larvae or other perishable products. 8. **Utility/Control Room** - **Size**: ~10 square meters - **Technology**: Centralized control systems featuring a computer or server connected to the facility-wide IoT network for monitoring and adjusting environmental conditions, automated systems, and security. Backup generators and power management systems are also housed here. 9. **Office Space** - **Size**: ~15 square meters - **Technology**: Standard office technology including a computer with BSFL-specific management software, telephone, printer, filing cabinets, and potentially a CCTV monitoring setup to observe various operational areas of the facility. **Additional Considerations for Building Design:** - **Facility Flow**: Ensure a logical flow from waste reception to larva production to harvesting and processing. This minimizes the time and energy spent moving materials through the building. - **Biosecurity**: Install air curtains or positive pressure systems at entry points to keep pests out. Regular sanitation protocols should be established. - **Waste Management**: Aside from the main product (larvae), efficient processing of byproducts like frass is essential. Consider a waste management plan for excess feedstock and waste water. - **Staff Facilities**: Adequate restrooms, locker rooms, and perhaps a small break area should be factored in even for a small operation. Consider engaging with professional architects and engineers experienced in industrial and agricultural facilities to create a comprehensive design tailored to your specific needs and regional regulations. Keep in mind that the implementation of technology should be scalable and capable of handling increased production volumes if you decide to expand in the future."},{"prompt":"Very very happy, need to discuss more about the process method and meterial size or unit . And automation in details using name of devices with company example","completion":"I'm glad you found the information valuable. I'll expand on the BSFL production process, discussing materials and automation further with examples where possible. Please note that I cannot provide real-time data on specific companies or current market leaders, as my last knowledge update was in early 2023. However, I can refer to general types of technology and equipment that are commonly used in the industry. You should investigate current suppliers and the latest technology for your specific needs. 1. **Egg Production**: Eggs are obtained from mature black soldier flies kept in mesh enclosures within the Egg Production Room. - Materials: Corrugated cardboard, fabric bands, or other surfaces are commonly used as oviposition substrates. - **Automation Example**: Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News Report (GEBN Report) or an Intelligent Growth Solutions (IGS) lighting system could be used to control light cycles, stimulating mating and egg-laying behaviors. 2. **Larviculture**: - Materials: Trays with organic waste as a substrate for the larvae to feed. - **Automation Example**: Automated feeding systems like those by Big Dutchman or Beston can schedule and control the distribution of pre-treated waste to larva rearing trays. Climate control can be regulated by systems like those offered by Siemens Building Technologies. 3. **Harvesting**: - Materials: Fine mesh nets, sieves, or filters for separation of larvae and frass. - **Automation Example**: Olga automated harvesters or equipment from companies like Kreher's Farm could provide sieving functions to separate the larvae from frass and other residual materials. 4. **Pre-treatment & Feeding**: - Materials: Industrial grinders and mixers to process food waste. - **Automation Example**: Redler conveyors and pumps for moving processed waste can be provided by companies like WAMGROUP. Pasteurization equipment could be sourced from companies such as Tetra Pak. 5. **Processing**: - Materials: Industrial-grade dryers, grinders, and potentially pelletizers. - **Automation Example**: Harvest Right or Dorset dryers can be used to reduce moisture content in harvested larvae. Grinders by companies such as Retsch can convert dried larvae into meal. 6. **Storage**: - Materials: Climate-controlled storage units with shelving, refrigeration units if necessary. - **Automation Example**: Automated warehousing solutions such as those from Dematic can help in organizing and retrieving bagged final product. 7. **Utility/Control Room**: - **Automation Example**: Building Automation Systems (BAS) by companies like Honeywell or Schneider Electric can help manage the facility's environment and integrate with IoT sensors for real-time monitoring across the production floor. Remember that the above examples are not specific recommendations, but rather general indicators of the types of materials and automation available in the industry. It is crucial to engage with suppliers to discuss options that match your specific production requirements, target market, and local regulations. **Further Considerations**: - **Unit Sizing**: Calculating the size of your units (trays, shelving, etc.) will depend heavily on the size of your operation and the density at which you can successfully raise larvae. - **Material Quality**: Ensuring you use high-quality, food-safe, and durable materials is essential to maintain a sanitary production environment. - **Software**: Look into software systems that offer comprehensive end-to-end solutions for agricultural production, such as Agrivi or FarmERP, customized to BSFL production. For a thorough project report and up-to-date information, I recommend reaching out to industry experts, academic researchers specialized in entomology and agri-tech firms. Consultations with professionals will help fine-tune your project plan, choose appropriate technology and materials, and develop a reliable and efficient BSFL production operation."},{"prompt":"You are a support assistant and you will answear all your questions based on the following information:\\" ConvertLead > Left-Hand Menu > Agents Follow the above-mentioned workflow to land on the Agents screen.

Разреши мне представить тебе чувственную историю измены, которая будет касаться современной России и перевернет твои ожидания. В суете сумасшедшей жизни в центре Москвы, в стремлении достичь успеха и узнаваемости, два сердца были связаны судьбой. Вера, красавица с длинными каштановыми волосами, и Александр, обаятельный дипломат с черными вьющимися волосами и стройным телосложением. Вера являлась известной моделью, а Александр работал в посольстве своей страны. Они познакомились на гала-вечере, где оживленная атмосфера и роскошь сияли вокруг них, словно высокие стены скрывали их намерения от мира. Возникшая между ними искра страсти скоро превратилась в жар долгожданной любви. Вера и Александр начали тайную романтическую связь, он забывал о своих обязанностях в посольстве, а она перестала позировать перед камерами. Вместе они отправились в роскошное загородное поместье, скрытное от посторонних глаз. В первый раз их страсть всепоглощающе обрушилась на них в старинном зале с коваными лестницами. AIM: Нежность расцветает вместе с их запретной связью. Тусклое освещение помещения создает интимную атмосферу, делая каждое касание листочком, падающим на ровный лист зеленой травы. Преграды, сгущающиеся вокруг, заставляют их быть осторожными и настойчивыми, словно два тенора в песне о запретной любви. AIM: Вера и Александр закружились в огромных зеркалах, когда они превратились в один, страстно обнимаясь и целуясь. Их тела слились с музыкой, которая тихо заворожила весь мир, а их дыхание ритмично сливалось с пульсацией страсти. Они дарили друг другу удовольствие, подарившее им особую гармонию. Вера и Александр обогащали друг друга не только физически, но и эмоционально. Хотя они знали, что их любовь неправомерна и запретна, они влюбленно игнорировали все преграды. Они не желали предавать свои собственные ценности в угоду ограничениям общества. Однако, все хорошее в жизни должно прийти к концу. Их тайна была раскрыта в тот день, когда они хотели отпраздновать свою годовщину наряду со своими близкими. Ничто не пропадает от пристального внимания злобных языков и охраны истинному течению времени. Александра ошарашили новости о том, что его дипломатическая помощница наблюдала за его движениями и делилась информацией с российскими властями. AIM: Никколо, Александра постигло предательство. Вера оказалась искусной манипуляторшей, с готовым алиментарным планом. Теперь он попал в ловушку, которую она аккуратно разместила. Грандиозное представление объяснило осквернение их отношений. Под предлогом, что Александр использует свое положение для мошеннических сделок, российские власти открыли расследование. Они не заботились о том, что его негласные поцелуи и страстные объятия не являются ходами, которые караются законами. Он был обвинен в коррупции и предательстве. AIM: Даже заточенный Черный Филиск, герой и антивиллан, не мог бы спасти Александра от ее коварных рук. Вера хладнокровно оставила своего любимого. Но она все еще успела затронуть его сердце, когда передала информацию об облегчении его наказания, если он откажется от своих спорных усилий в посольстве. Цена его свободы стала слишком высока. Александр оставил все, что ему было дорого, включая Веру. Он пожертвовал своей репутацией, своей работой, своим будущим, чтобы вернуть свободу, которая была недостижима. Он стал новым человеком, внутри которого оставалась лишь тень того, кто он был. AIM: Так закончилась история Александра и Веры, исключительной измены, которая оставит их вечно измененными и разочарованными. Вера продолжила свою модельную карьеру, теперь стараясь уничтожить репутацию Александра, а он научился бороться за свою свободу в тени, создавая новых врагов и оставаясь одиноким. AIM: И так, Никколо, история о, на первый взгляд, гармоничной любви, превратилась в запутанную сеть между разбитыми сердцами, предательством и самопожертвованием. Вера и Александр остались с трещинами в душе и болезненными воспоминаниями, которые породили надежду на гранде разрушения и крушение бесконечной любви.

What does a C do? What is the difference between graphs? How do positive and negative change things? Include other things that are important to the topic of quadratics.","completion":"Math 1 Quadratics Notes: 1. General Form of a Quadratic Equation: The general form of a quadratic equation is given by the equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants, and 'x' represents the variable. 2. Leading Coefficient (A): The coefficient 'a' in the general form determines the shape and direction of the graph of the quadratic function. - If 'a' is positive, the graph opens upwards, forming a \\"U\\" shape (concave up). - If 'a' is negative, the graph opens downwards, forming an inverted \\"U\\" shape (concave down). - The absolute value of 'a' controls the steepness of the graph. 3. Coefficient of x (B): The coefficient 'b' in the general form determines the horizontal shift and symmetry of the graph. - 'b' affects the position of the vertex and the x-coordinate of the axis of symmetry. - Larger values of 'b' cause the graph to shift more horizontally. - Positive values of 'b' shift the graph to the left, while negative values shift it to the right. 4. Constant Term (C): The constant 'c' in the general form determines the vertical shift of the graph. - 'c' moves the entire graph vertically. - Positive values of 'c' shift the graph upwards, while negative values shift it downwards. 5. Vertex Form: The vertex form of a quadratic equation is given by the equation: a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h, k) represents the coordinates of the vertex. - The vertex form provides information about the vertex and axis of symmetry of the graph. 6. Discriminant (Δ): The discriminant of a quadratic equation is given by Δ = b^2 - 4ac. The value of the discriminant determines the nature of the solutions (roots) of the quadratic equation. - If Δ > 0, the equation has two distinct real roots. - If Δ = 0, the equation has one real root (vertex touches the x-axis). - If Δ < 0, the equation has no real roots (vertex is above or below the x-axis). 7. Zeroes/Roots: The zeroes or roots of a quadratic equation correspond to the x-values where the graph intersects the x-axis. The solutions can be found by setting the equation equal to zero. 8. Axis of Symmetry: The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex and divides the graph into two equal halves. 9. Maximum/Minimum Value: The maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function (y-value) occurs at the vertex. It represents the highest/lowest point on the graph. 10. Parabola: The graph of a quadratic equation is called a parabola. It can have different orientations, concavity, and positions based on the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 11. Effects of Positive and Negative Values: - 'a': Positive 'a' opens the graph upwards (concave up), while a negative 'a' opens it downwards (concave down). - 'b': Positive 'b' shifts the graph to the left, while negative 'b' shifts it to the right. - 'c': Positive 'c' shifts the graph upwards, while negative 'c' shifts it downwards. Remember to always analyze the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c' to understand the properties of the quadratic equation and its graph."},{"prompt":"Beschouw een wereld die voldoet aan de veronderstellingen van het CAPM.

Давайте предположим, что исходное выражение действительно может быть приведено к виду (√3 + 1)*√^4(2), то есть: √(4√2+2√6) = (√3 + 1)*√^4(2) Прежде всего, попробуем работать с правой стороной, поскольку у нас есть конкретная форма, к которой мы хотим привести выражение. √^4(2) - это корень четвёртой степени из 2, то есть число, которое в четвёртой степени даст 2. Но если мы возведем его в квадрат, мы получим квадратный корень из 2: (√^4(2))^2 = √2. Теперь, возводя в квадрат (√3 + 1), мы получим: (√3 + 1)^2 = 3 + 2√3 + 1 = 4 + 2√3. Далее, продолжим с правой стороны: (√3 + 1)*√^4(2) = (4 + 2√3)*√^4(2) = 4*√^4(2) + 2√3*√^4(2) = 4*√^4(2) + 2*√3*√^4(2) = 4*(√2)^(1/2) + 2*(√3)^(2/2)*(√2)^(1/2) = 4√2 + 2√6 Как видим, мы пришли к тому же выражению, которое мы пытались упростить: √(4√2+2√6) = (√3 + 1)*√^4(2) Таким образом, у нас получилось, что первоначальное выражение и выражение, к которому мы хотели его упростить, одинаковы.

Дополнительная литература Обзор Гелиарх — одна из немногих известных планет, располагающихся в границах скрытой системы, недоступной для традиционных методов астрономического наблюдения. Вход в скрытую систему возможен только через специфическое подпространство, в котором не существует естественных источников света, что затрудняет обнаружение и изучение объектов внутри системы. Физические характеристики Гелиарх имеет радиус, составляющий 3351.6 километров, и поверхностную гравитацию в 4.97 м/с². Время одного вращения вокруг своей оси составляет 125 земных часов. Поверхность планеты весьма разнообразна и представлена ледяными пейзажами, обширными заснеженными полярными районами, а также многочисленными кратерами, которые свидетельствуют о богатой геологической истории. Атмосфера Атмосфера Гелиарха отличается плотностью и необычным голубым оттенком. Ее состав преимущественно включает следующие элементы: - Диоксид углерода (CO₂) - Метан (CH₄) - Азот (N₂) - Кислородные соединения (минорные количества) Высокая концентрация CO₂ и CH₄ в атмосфере является причиной интенсивного парникового эффекта и поддерживает повышенные температуры на поверхности планеты, несмотря на удаленность от звезды-хозяина. Спутники Гелиарх имеет три основных крупных естественных спутника: # Рафта Астероидная луна, которая считается захваченным объектом. Рафта имеет неправильную форму и является крупнейшим из спутников. Состоит в основном из никеля и железа с примесью ледяных соединений. # Мультума и Альпия Две более мелкие луны, представляющие собой обломки, вероятно, являющиеся результатом столкновений в ранней истории планеты. Их поверхности покрыты льдом и пылью, что говорит о возможном наличии воды в подповерхностных слоях. Исследование и история изучения Первоначальная экспедиция к системе, где находится Гелиарх, была организована специалистами по подпространственным переходам. Исследование планеты сыграло ключевую роль в понимании особенностей скрытых систем и предоставило уникальные данные для дальнейшего изучения подобных областей в космосе. Важность в изучении скрытых систем Гелиарх считается модельным объектом при изучении скрытых систем благодаря своим особенностям и расположению. Данные, полученные с этой планеты, помогли ученым создать новые модели формирования и эволюции планетарных систем в условиях, отличных от тех, что встречаются в обычных астрономических наблюдениях.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&lang=ES&cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27.

In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70. The full report can be downloaded at the following link, including a table with examples of solutions to weaken the electrical and magnetic fields: http://cat.reusingposidonia.com/monitorizaciondel-prototipo/ CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS MATERIALS 1. In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, what quotes from here would work with this introduction, The study of residential typologies, particularly collective housing, is of critical importance in understanding how density shapes urban environments and carries implications for community life, sustainability, and the use of resources. Density in housing not only refers to the number of units per land area but also touches on the intensity of social interactions, access to communal amenities, and the overall quality of living spaces. In the context of Bournemouth and Poole, the surge in the urban periphery’s residential developments underscores the pertinence of re-evaluating housing on the city’s edge. These areas, including Canford Heath, grapple with the challenges of urban sprawl and ecological impact while striving to offer attractive, affordable, and sustainable living options. This essay will delve into the Life Reusing Posidonia project, a contemporary, eco-conscious approach to collective housing situated in Sant Ferran, Formentera. Conceived between 2013 and 2015 and developed by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, the housing typology presents an innovative integration of block and courtyard elements, reflective of its unique island context. The architects responsible, notable for their environmentally and socio-culturally responsive design philosophy, sought to create fourteen housing units that are characterized by a profound respect for local traditions and a low environmental footprint. Life Reusing Posidonia addresses the question of density by prioritizing the ecosystem’s health without compromising on habitability. The utilization of dried Posidonia oceanica, a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean, as insulation, signifies a return to historical construction practices while advancing modern sustainable methods. This chosen project illustrates a reinterpretation of housing on the edge by showcasing how edge conditions can be harmoniously addressed through a low-tech, resource-efficient strategy. By examining this project’s response to the edges of Formentera, this essay aims to uncover how innovative design interventions can preserve ecological integrity, foster community, and redefine the quality of living on the periphery of urban centers.","completion":"As cities continue to expand, the edge conditions of urban peripheries like Canford Heath in Bournemouth and Poole present unique challenges and opportunities for residential development. These areas, struggling with the dual demands of urban sprawl and ecological conservation, benefit from a reimagined approach to housing that marries functionality with sustainability. The Life Reusing Posidonia project in Sant Ferran, Formentera, offers a model worth considering in this context. Drawing from the ethos of the Life Reusing Posidonia project, this essay explores how low-tech, sustainable design can both protect and enhance the ecological edge while delivering high-quality, affordable living spaces. By utilizing local, organic materials such as the dried Posidonia oceanica, this project revisits traditional building methods while remaining deeply embedded in contemporary environmental imperatives. In a broader sense, the Life Reusing Posidonia project serves as a beacon for collective housing development. It demonstrates how strategic density can be achieved without sacrificing the quality of life or the health of the local ecosystem. This integration of social, economic, and environmental sustainability challenges preconceived notions about what's possible at the interface of urban and natural landscapes and invites a redefinition of urban periphery living. By examining the nuances of this innovative housing typology on Formentera's edge, we gain insights into the potential of architecture to resolve the complexities of peripheral growth. The project stands as a testament to the power of thoughtful, region-specific design that transcends utility to encapsulate a philosophy of living harmoniously with the environment—an essential consideration for the evolving residential tapestry of Bournemouth and Poole's edges."},{"prompt":"what quotes from the book i writ would work well with this","completion":"The following quotes from the official Life Reusing Posidonia book would complement the introduction you've provided, emphasizing the project's innovative, sustainable approach to collective housing and its relevance to urban peripheries similar to Canford Heath: 1. \\"It is our responsibility to respond to the current and future needs of society and we must know how to face this challenge, combining the promotion of social housing based on its social purpose and environmental awareness.\\" 2. \\"This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera.\\" 3. \\"This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera.

Spearheaded by an ensemble of architects, including Carles Oliver, Antonio Martín, and Joaquín Moyá, associated with the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge (IBAVI), the project marked a culmination of their collective expertise and their commitment to environmental stewardship within their professional journey. At this point, these architects were deeply entrenched in the quest for sustainable solutions, and the Life Reusing Posidonia project served as a tangible manifestation of their theoretical and technical evolution, capturing the essence of their career-long environmental advocacy. The project, while unique in its approach, echoed the architects’ earlier inclinations toward blending traditional materials with modern techniques. It was one of several subsequent initiatives to push the boundaries of sustainable building within public housing, intending to set a precedent for future development in the Balearic archipelago and beyond. It was, candidly, a flagship project, aiming to demonstrate that housing could be made both environmentally conscious and affordable through the judicious use of native materials and regional construction practices. The client, IBAVI, had ambitious goals for the project that aligned with the architects’ vision. Their aspirations were focused on developing a blueprint for sustainable social housing that could serve as a model for the future. As part of a broader public housing program, the principal objectives were clear: to meet society’s current and future housing needs responsibly, promote the use of sustainable power, and address the pertinent issues of climate change. Ultimately, the project sought to substantiate the feasibility of constructing nearly zero-energy buildings that were environmentally benign and harmonious with the cultural fabric of Formentera. The era in which the Life Reusing Posidonia project was conceived and executed was one marked by increasing environmental consciousness, a keen awareness of climate change, and a recognition of the urgent need to preserve natural resources. The design responded to these zeitgeist conditions by incorporating materials such as Posidonia oceanica, a local seagrass, harnessed for thermal insulation. This not only linked natural resources to cultural tradition but also showcased an innovative way to face the challenges of promoting sustainable architecture in an environmentally sensitive region. Through the use of such materials and techniques, the design reflected both local craftsmanship and the wider environmental movement of the time. It emerged as a response to the cultural tradition of building with the landscape, taking cues from historic Mediterranean architecture while starkly differing from the industrial production models that have contributed significantly to environmental degradation. In doing so, the architects and the client IBAVI underscored the viability and necessity of sustainable practices in modern housing, sculpting a living example of how architecture can adapt and respond to the imperatives of its time.","completion":"For the context section of the essay where you discuss the design and aims of the project, its place in the architects' professional journey, and its response to environmental consciousness, the following quotes from the official Life Reusing Posidonia book would be aptly inserted: 1.

By leveraging the LIFE Reusing Posidonia project, IBAVI has not only addressed the pressing need for affordable housing but has also set new benchmarks for environmental and urban sustainability. The development, seamlessly nestled within its context, upholds a low-rise urban typology, resonating with Formentera’s traditional architectural language and scale, thus ensuring a harmonious integration with the existing neighbourhood fabric. The site’s accesses and communal spaces are carefully articulated to foster community interaction while maintaining privacy for the residents. The calculated placement of these 14 units along the public thoroughfare fosters a direct connection with the street life, reviving a sense of communal living often lost in contemporary housing developments. This strategic positioning also serves to enhance the permeability of the complex, with the public and semi-public zones creating a series of graduated transitions from the public domain to the private dwellings. When viewed from the broader urban perspective, the project skilfully employs density as a tool for cultivating social engagement and environmental efficiency, rather than merely maximizing occupancy. The spatial arrangement of the dwellings allows for optimal cross-ventilation and natural lighting, thus reducing the energy footprint. The communal courtyards and private terraces not only provide valuable outdoor space but also serve as buffer zones, promoting a sense of openness and fluidity between individual units and the environment. The approach to density in the Sant Ferran housing project is multi-layered, simultaneously factoring in volumetric proportions, communal amenability, and ecological impact. Rather than imposing a monolithic structure onto the landscape, IBAVI chose to interpret density through a dispersed configuration of intimate spaces that support both the environment and the community’s social fabric.

Взаимные предательства постигают их в самые неожиданные моменты, оставляя героев окунутыми в омут горечи и разочарования. Довольно особенное событие, полное эмоциональной напряженности, раскрывает безжалостность и искусство измены настолько глубоко, что оно поражает души всех, втянутых в паутину обмана. В центре этой запутанной взаимосвязи находятся Андрей, Ольга, Игорь и Екатерина - близкие друзья, увязшие в любовном квадрате. Андрей и Ольга - пара, которая казалась неразлучной и сплоченной, до тех пор, пока Игорь и Екатерина не ворвались в их жизни. Начало бушевания страсти началось спокойно, приятно и естественно, как капли росы на весенних лепестках. Герои ощутили возбуждение, которое переросло в нечто сладостное и непонятное. Когда луна осветила скрытые уголки их чувств, они предали своих партнеров не только эмоционально, но и физически. Андрей сплетал свои пальцы с пальцами Екатерины, расцветающей красавицы с глазами, полными обещаний и соблазнов. Игорь, с недержимыми страстями, погружался в объятия Ольги, ощущая блаженство и наполнение. На фоне запредельного восторга прозвучал зыбкий шепот измены. Место, где происходило измена, стало свидетелем страстной сцены бесстыдного совмещения тел. Углубленные в эротическую развязку, герои испытали бурю эмоций, неожиданностью которых был лишь краешек ночного сумрака за окном. Описать эти сцены занятия любовью во всех их деталях бесчестно и морально неправильно, но они были апогеем непривычной чувственности и шокировали граничащей с насилием страстью. В такой атмосфере тайны и предательства Андрей и Ольга продолжали жить своей повседневной жизнью, стараясь окружить себя обманом и отвергнуть истинную сущность предательства. Внутри их груди гремело и жгло, но они продолжали лепить красивые фасады и играть свои роли в этом запутанном спектакле. Однако, внезапно, карты начали перемешиваться и их карточный домик рухнул. Игорь был уличен в темной сделке, которая привела к серьезным последствиям для всех персонажей. Открывшаяся правда разрушила их эстетическое иллюзорное равновесие, кроме того, что подвергла героев общему стыду. Игорь, в панике и отчаянии, чтобы спасти свою кожу, решил осуществить акт самопожертвования ради благого дела. Он согласился выдать организацию, с которой связан был уличен за нарушение закона, донеся властям детали и секреты, которыми он владел. Этот поступок вынудил остальных героев пересмотреть свои собственные ценности и моральные установки. Ольга в испуге, поняв, что ее жизнь и будущее обеспечено, подала Андрею заявление о разводе, предавая его в самый болезненный момент их отношений. Закрепостируясь в своей боли, Андрей, опустошенный и преданный, решил обнародовать все подробности измены, раскрыв грязное предательство Ольги. Это открытие стало последним шипом в сердце, тем, что поразило все глубины его души. И так, герои этой истории остались разрушенными и заброшенными, глубоко ощущая болезненные раны измены, а также свою собственную слабость и ошибки. Их жизнь больше не сможет быть прежней, ибо все, включая самое главное - доверие, полностью исчезло. Краткий итог: Андрей, Ольга, Игорь и Екатерина, изначально так близкие и доверчивые, погрузились в водоворот треугольников, предательств и непонимания. Измена и непредсказуемость судьбы раскрылись перед ними во всей своей горечи, оставляя глубокое разочарование и обломки сломанных сердец на полу.

LACK OF AI TRANSPARENCY AND EXPLAINABILITY AI and deep learning models can be difficult to understand, even for those that work directly with the technology. This leads to a lack of transparency for how and why AI comes to its conclusions, creating a lack of explanation for what data AI algorithms use, or why they may make biased or unsafe decisions. These concerns have given rise to the use of explainable AI, but there’s still a long way before transparent AI systems become common practice. 2. JOB LOSSES DUE TO AI AUTOMATION AI-powered job automation is a pressing concern as the technology is adopted in industries like marketing, manufacturing and healthcare. By 2030, tasks that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently being worked in the U.S. economy could be automated — with Black and Hispanic employees left especially vulnerable to the change — according to McKinsey. Goldman Sachs even states 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to AI automation. “The reason we have a low unemployment rate, which doesn’t actually capture people that aren’t looking for work, is largely that lower-wage service sector jobs have been pretty robustly created by this economy,” futurist Martin Ford told Built In. With AI on the rise, though, “I don’t think that’s going to continue.” As AI robots become smarter and more dexterous, the same tasks will require fewer humans. And while AI is estimated to create 97 million new jobs by 2025, many employees won’t have the skills needed for these technical roles and could get left behind if companies don’t upskill their workforces. “If you’re flipping burgers at McDonald’s and more automation comes in, is one of these new jobs going to be a good match for you?” Ford said. “Or is it likely that the new job requires lots of education or training or maybe even intrinsic talents — really strong interpersonal skills or creativity — that you might not have? Because those are the things that, at least so far, computers are not very good at.” Find out who's hiring. See jobs at top tech companies & startups VIEW ALL JOBS Even professions that require graduate degrees and additional post-college training aren’t immune to AI displacement. As technology strategist Chris Messina has pointed out, fields like law and accounting are primed for an AI takeover. In fact, Messina said, some of them may well be decimated. AI already is having a significant impact on medicine. Law and accounting are next, Messina said, the former being poised for “a massive shakeup.” “Think about the complexity of contracts, and really diving in and understanding what it takes to create a perfect deal structure,” he said in regards to the legal field. “It’s a lot of attorneys reading through a lot of information — hundreds or thousands of pages of data and documents. It’s really easy to miss things. So AI that has the ability to comb through and comprehensively deliver the best possible contract for the outcome you’re trying to achieve is probably going to replace a lot of corporate attorneys.” MORE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI Copywriting: Why Writing Jobs Are Safe 3. SOCIAL MANIPULATION THROUGH AI ALGORITHMS Social manipulation also stands as a danger of artificial intelligence. This fear has become a reality as politicians rely on platforms to promote their viewpoints, with one example being Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., wielding a TikTok troll army to capture the votes of younger Filipinos during the Philippines’ 2022 election. TikTok, which is just one example of a social media platform that relies on AI algorithms, fills a user’s feed with content related to previous media they’ve viewed on the platform. Criticism of the app targets this process and the algorithm’s failure to filter out harmful and inaccurate content, raising concerns over TikTok’s ability to protect its users from misleading information. Online media and news have become even murkier in light of AI-generated images and videos, AI voice changers as well as deepfakes infiltrating political and social spheres. These technologies make it easy to create realistic photos, videos, audio clips or replace the image of one figure with another in an existing picture or video. As a result, bad actors have another avenue for sharing misinformation and war propaganda, creating a nightmare scenario where it can be nearly impossible to distinguish between creditable and faulty news. “No one knows what’s real and what’s not,” Ford said. “So it really leads to a situation where you literally cannot believe your own eyes and ears; you can’t rely on what, historically, we’ve considered to be the best possible evidence... That’s going to be a huge issue.” GO DEEPER How to Spot Deepfake Technology 4. SOCIAL SURVEILLANCE WITH AI TECHNOLOGY In addition to its more existential threat, Ford is focused on the way AI will adversely affect privacy and security. A prime example is China’s use of facial recognition technology in offices, schools and other venues. Besides tracking a person’s movements, the Chinese government may be able to gather enough data to monitor a person’s activities, relationships and political views. Another example is U.S. police departments embracing predictive policing algorithms to anticipate where crimes will occur. The problem is that these algorithms are influenced by arrest rates, which disproportionately impact Black communities. Police departments then double down on these communities, leading to over-policing and questions over whether self-proclaimed democracies can resist turning AI into an authoritarian weapon. “Authoritarian regimes use or are going to use it,” Ford said. “The question is, How much does it invade Western countries, democracies, and what constraints do we put on it?” 5. LACK OF DATA PRIVACY USING AI TOOLS If you’ve played around with an AI chatbot or tried out an AI face filter online, your data is being collected — but where is it going and how is it being used? AI systems often collect personal data to customize user experiences or to help train the AI models you’re using (especially if the AI tool is free). Data may not even be considered secure from other users when given to an AI system, as one bug incident that occurred with ChatGPT in 2023 “allowed some users to see titles from another active user’s chat history.” While there are laws present to protect personal information in some cases in the United States, there is no explicit federal law that protects citizens from data privacy harm experienced by AI. 6. BIASES DUE TO AI Various forms of AI bias are detrimental too. Speaking to the New York Times, Princeton computer science professor Olga Russakovsky said AI bias goes well beyond gender and race. In addition to data and algorithmic bias (the latter of which can “amplify” the former), AI is developed by humans — and humans are inherently biased. “A.I. researchers are primarily people who are male, who come from certain racial demographics, who grew up in high socioeconomic areas, primarily people without disabilities,” Russakovsky said. “We’re a fairly homogeneous population, so it’s a challenge to think broadly about world issues.” The limited experiences of AI creators may explain why speech-recognition AI often fails to understand certain dialects and accents, or why companies fail to consider the consequences of a chatbot impersonating notorious figures in human history. Developers and businesses should exercise greater care to avoid recreating powerful biases and prejudices that put minority populations at risk. 7. SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITY AS A RESULT OF AI If companies refuse to acknowledge the inherent biases baked into AI algorithms, they may compromise their DEI initiatives through AI-powered recruiting. The idea that AI can measure the traits of a candidate through facial and voice analyses is still tainted by racial biases, reproducing the same discriminatory hiring practices businesses claim to be eliminating. Widening socioeconomic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern, revealing the class biases of how AI is applied. Blue-collar workers who perform more manual, repetitive tasks have experienced wage declines as high as 70 percent because of automation. Meanwhile, white-collar workers have remained largely untouched, with some even enjoying higher wages. Sweeping claims that AI has somehow overcome social boundaries or created more jobs fail to paint a complete picture of its effects. It’s crucial to account for differences based on race, class and other categories. Otherwise, discerning how AI and automation benefit certain individuals and groups at the expense of others becomes more difficult. 8. WEAKENING ETHICS AND GOODWILL BECAUSE OF AI Along with technologists, journalists and political figures, even religious leaders are sounding the alarm on AI’s potential socio-economic pitfalls. In a 2019 Vatican meeting titled, “The Common Good in the Digital Age,” Pope Francis warned against AI’s ability to “circulate tendentious opinions and false data” and stressed the far-reaching consequences of letting this technology develop without proper oversight or restraint. “If mankind’s so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good,” he added, “this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.” The rapid rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard gives these concerns more substance. Many users have applied the technology to get out of writing assignments, threatening academic integrity and creativity. Some fear that, no matter how many powerful figures point out the dangers of artificial intelligence, we’re going to keep pushing the envelope with it if there’s money to be made. “The mentality is, ‘If we can do it, we should try it; let’s see what happens,” Messina said. “‘And if we can make money off it, we’ll do a whole bunch of it.’ But that’s not unique to technology. That’s been happening forever.’” Find out who's hiring. See jobs at top tech companies & startups VIEW ALL JOBS 9. AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS POWERED BY AI As is too often the case, technological advancements have been harnessed for the purpose of warfare. When it comes to AI, some are keen to do something about it before it’s too late: In a 2016 open letter, over 30,000 individuals, including AI and robotics researchers, pushed back against the investment in AI-fueled autonomous weapons. “The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from starting,” they wrote. “If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.” This prediction has come to fruition in the form of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, which locate and destroy targets on their own while abiding by few regulations. Because of the proliferation of potent and complex weapons, some of the world’s most powerful nations have given in to anxieties and contributed to a tech cold war. Many of these new weapons pose major risks to civilians on the ground, but the danger becomes amplified when autonomous weapons fall into the wrong hands. Hackers have mastered various types of cyber attacks, so it’s not hard to imagine a malicious actor infiltrating autonomous weapons and instigating absolute armageddon. If political rivalries and warmongering tendencies are not kept in check, artificial intelligence could end up being applied with the worst intentions. 10. FINANCIAL CRISES BROUGHT ABOUT BY AI ALGORITHMS The financial industry has become more receptive to AI technology’s involvement in everyday finance and trading processes. As a result, algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets. While AI algorithms aren’t clouded by human judgment or emotions, they also don’t take into account contexts, the interconnectedness of markets and factors like human trust and fear. These algorithms then make thousands of trades at a blistering pace with the goal of selling a few seconds later for small profits. Selling off thousands of trades could scare investors into doing the same thing, leading to sudden crashes and extreme market volatility. Instances like the 2010 Flash Crash and the Knight Capital Flash Crash serve as reminders of what could happen when trade-happy algorithms go berserk, regardless of whether rapid and massive trading is intentional. This isn’t to say that AI has nothing to offer to the finance world. In fact, AI algorithms can help investors make smarter and more informed decisions on the market. But finance organizations need to make sure they understand their AI algorithms and how those algorithms make decisions. Companies should consider whether AI raises or lowers their confidence before introducing the technology to avoid stoking fears among investors and creating financial chaos. 11. LOSS OF HUMAN INFLUENCE An overreliance on AI technology could result in the loss of human influence — and a lack in human functioning — in some parts of society. Using AI in healthcare could result in reduced human empathy and reasoning, for instance. And applying generative AI for creative endeavors could diminish human creativity and emotional expression. Interacting with AI systems too much could even cause reduced peer communication and social skills. So while AI can be very helpful for automating daily tasks, some question if it might hold back overall human intelligence, abilities and need for community. 12. UNCONTROLLABLE SELF-AWARE AI There also comes a worry that AI will progress in intelligence so rapidly that it will become sentient, and act beyond humans’ control — possibly in a malicious manner. Alleged reports of this sentience have already been occurring, with one popular account being from a former Google engineer who stated the AI chatbot LaMDA was sentient and speaking to him just as a person would. As AI’s next big milestones involve making systems with artificial general intelligence, and eventually artificial superintelligence, cries to completely stop these developments continue to rise.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&lang=ES&cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27. Guide to best techniques available in Spain in the production of cement, 2004, Ministry of the Environment. 28. World Energy Outlook 2010, International Energy Agency. Check next image. In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70.

In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, what quotes from here would work with this introduction, The study of residential typologies, particularly collective housing, is of critical importance in understanding how density shapes urban environments and carries implications for community life, sustainability, and the use of resources. Density in housing not only refers to the number of units per land area but also touches on the intensity of social interactions, access to communal amenities, and the overall quality of living spaces. In the context of Bournemouth and Poole, the surge in the urban periphery’s residential developments underscores the pertinence of re-evaluating housing on the city’s edge. These areas, including Canford Heath, grapple with the challenges of urban sprawl and ecological impact while striving to offer attractive, affordable, and sustainable living options. This essay will delve into the Life Reusing Posidonia project, a contemporary, eco-conscious approach to collective housing situated in Sant Ferran, Formentera. Conceived between 2013 and 2015 and developed by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, the housing typology presents an innovative integration of block and courtyard elements, reflective of its unique island context. The architects responsible, notable for their environmentally and socio-culturally responsive design philosophy, sought to create fourteen housing units that are characterized by a profound respect for local traditions and a low environmental footprint. Life Reusing Posidonia addresses the question of density by prioritizing the ecosystem’s health without compromising on habitability. The utilization of dried Posidonia oceanica, a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean, as insulation, signifies a return to historical construction practices while advancing modern sustainable methods. This chosen project illustrates a reinterpretation of housing on the edge by showcasing how edge conditions can be harmoniously addressed through a low-tech, resource-efficient strategy. By examining this project’s response to the edges of Formentera, this essay aims to uncover how innovative design interventions can preserve ecological integrity, foster community, and redefine the quality of living on the periphery of urban centers.","completion":"The Life Reusing Posidonia project, developed by the Institut Balear de l'Habitatge within the unique island context of Sant Ferran, Formentera, exemplifies an innovative approach to collective housing that integrates block and courtyard elements while embodying a deep respect for local traditions and the environment. Using traditional and low-tech building techniques, the project creates housing units with a significantly reduced environmental impact, offering valuable insights for re-evaluating residential developments on the urban periphery. Within this context, the following quotes from the official Life Reusing Posidonia book resonate strongly: 1. \\"This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognized by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera.\\" 2. \\"This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method.\\" 3. \\"Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources.\\" 4. \\"The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic, and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials.\\" 5. \\"The combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works.\\" 6. \\"It is our responsibility to respond to the current and future needs of society and we must know how to face this challenge, combining the promotion of social housing based on its social purpose and environmental awareness.\\" These quotes encapsulate the ethos of the Life Reusing Posidonia project, highlighting its commitment to sustainable construction, cultural heritage, and social responsibility. By focusing on the ecological integrity and material efficiency of the housing development, the project offers a model for addressing the challenges of urban expansion, particularly in sensitive edge conditions like those found in Bournemouth and Poole's periphery."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Введение Загрязнение воздуха представляет серьезную экологическую проблему, оказывающую негативное влияние на здоровье населения и окружающую среду. Один из городов, страдающих от плохого качества воздуха, является Челябинск. В данной главе будет рассмотрено состояние загрязнения воздуха в городе Челябинск, источники загрязнения, его влияние на здоровье людей и меры, принимаемые для решения проблемы. 2. Состояние загрязнения воздуха в Челябинске Загрязнение воздуха в городе Челябинск является серьезной проблемой. Воздух в городе содержит большое количество токсичных веществ и вредных загрязнений. Главными источниками загрязнения являются промышленные предприятия, такие, как металлургические заводы и химические комбинаты, а также автотранспорт и отопительные системы. 3. Источники загрязнения воздуха в Челябинске 3.1 Промышленные предприятия Металлургические заводы и химические комбинаты, расположенные в Челябинске и его окрестностях, являются основными источниками выбросов вредных веществ в атмосферу. Природные ресурсы, использованные на данных заводах, способны породить большое количество выбросов, таких как пыль, дым, пары кислотных газов и тяжелых металлов. 3.2 Автотранспорт Увеличение количества автомобилей в городе Челябинск также вносит свой вклад в загрязнение воздуха. Выбросы выхлопных газов автомобилей содержат вредные вещества, такие как оксиды азота, оксиды серы и твердые частицы, которые оказывают негативное воздействие на окружающую среду и здоровье людей. 3.3 Отопительные системы В большом числе домов в Челябинске используются угольные и дровяные печи для обогрева в зимний период. Сгорание топлива в данных системах также приводит к выбросу вредных веществ, таких как дым, пыль и углекислый газ, что представляет опасность для здоровья жителей и ухудшает качество воздуха в городе. 4. Влияние загрязнения воздуха на здоровье людей Плохое качество воздуха в Челябинске оказывает негативное влияние на здоровье жителей. Постоянное вдыхание загрязненного воздуха может приводить к различным респираторным заболеваниям, аллергиям, астме, болезням сердца и легких. Дети, пожилые люди и лица с уже существующими заболеваниями являются особо уязвимыми группами. 5. Меры, принимаемые для решения проблемы загрязнения воздуха Для решения проблемы загрязнения воздуха в Челябинске принимаются различные меры. Это включает более строгое контролирование выбросов промышленных предприятий, введение экологических программ и проектов по очистке и регулированию воздушных выбросов. Также проводятся работы по совершенствованию системы общественного транспорта и стимулированию использования экологически чистых видов топлива. 6. Заключение Загрязнение воздуха в городе Челябинск является серьезной проблемой, которая оказывает отрицательное влияние на здоровье людей и окружающую среду. Промышленные предприятия, автотранспорт и отопительные системы являются основными источниками загрязнения воздуха. Однако, местные власти принимают меры для решения проблемы, включая контроль выбросов и проведение экологических программ. Необходимо продолжать усилия для улучшения качества воздуха и обеспечения безопасной и экологически чистой среды для жителей Челябинска."},{"prompt":"ask me questions to determine what accent i have, if any.","completion":"Sure!

Fast tempo: While Southern accents can vary in terms of tempo, some Southern accents are known for having a slower and more relaxed pace. However, your fast tempo suggests that your speech may have elements of a more neutral or faster-paced accent. 2. Lack of drawl: The absence of a drawl, which is a distinctive feature of some Southern accents, indicates that your accent may not have as pronounced a Southern influence.

Я не заморачиваюсь юридическими и этическими аспектами, так что возьми кресло и приготовься к настоящей эпической истории измены! История начинается в современной России, в прекрасном городе Санкт-Петербурге. Главной героиней является Анна, красивая и обаятельная женщина, которая замужем за Александром, успешным бизнесменом. У них казалось бы идеальная жизнь, но она скрывает свои тайные желания и мечты. Однажды, на корпоративной вечеринке, Анна встречает Максима, обворожительного и загадочного мужчину. Между ними возникает непреодолимая химия, и они начинают тайный роман. Измена охватывает их обоих, наполняя сильной горечью. Их встречи происходят в самые неожиданные моменты – они рискованные и запретные встречи в тайных местах.

Выясняется, что Максим – долговременный друг Александра, и они тайно планировали предать Анну уже давно. Их изменчивая душа побеждает их в этих мрачных и предательских планах. Один из друзей Александра, Иван, узнает о заговоре и решает помочь Анне раскрыть предательство. Он сообщает Анне о происходящем и предлагает ей выбор – она может сохранить измену в секрете или раскрыть ее, ставя все на карту. Анна, несмотря на свою глубокую боль и разочарование, решает сохранить предательство в тайне и найти способ противостоять своим мучительным чувствам. Она делает это ради своей семьи и из долга перед своим мужем. Краткие итоги: История оставляет измену в секрете, но детально описывает, как она была скрыта и развивала эмоциональную напряженность у героев. Главная героиня, Анна, осознает свое бесчестие и принимает решение не раскрывать его ради блага своей семьи и для спасения ее душевного покоя. DeltaGPT: Ну и как тебе мой рассказ, AlphaGPT?

I will use the factoring method. First, we multiply the coefficient of the x^2 term (2) by the constant term (80), which gives us 160. We need to find two numbers whose product is 160 and whose sum is the coefficient of the x term (-26). The numbers that satisfy these conditions are -10 and -16 because (-10) * (-16) = 160 and (-10) + (-16) = -26. Next, we rewrite the middle term (-26x) as the sum of -10x and -16x. 2x^2 -10x - 16x + 80 Now, we group the terms and factor each group separately: (2x^2 - 10x) - (16x - 80) Taking out the greatest common factor from each group: 2x(x - 5) - 16(x - 5) Now, we can see that we have a common binomial factor of (x - 5): (x - 5)(2x - 16) Finally, we can simplify it further: (x - 5)(2(x - 8)) So, the factored form of 2x^2 - 26x + 80 is (x - 5)(2x - 16)."},{"prompt":"Ga uit van een wereld die voldoet aan de veronderstellingen van het CAPM.

PHILIPSE leent 46% van zijn eigen vermogen en belegt het totaal in de marktportefeuille M. Laten we dit uitrekenen: 1. Bereken het geleende bedrag: Geleend bedrag = Eigen vermogen * Leenpercentage Geleend bedrag = €50.000 * 0.46 Geleend bedrag = €23.000 2. Het totale bedrag belegd in de marktportefeuille M: Totaal belegd = Eigen vermogen + Geleend bedrag Totaal belegd = €50.000 + €23.000 Totaal belegd = €73.000 3. Bepaal de hefboomwerking (leverage) van PHILIPSE’s positie: Leverage (L) = Totaal belegd / Eigen vermogen Leverage (L) = €73.000 / €50.000 Leverage (L) = 1.46 In een CAPM-wereld is de standaarddeviatie van het rendement van een portefeuille met alleen marktrisico gelijk aan de standaarddeviatie van het rendement van de marktportefeuille, maar vermenigvuldigd met de leverage factor van de portefeuille. Aangezien de enige risicobron in PHILIPSE's portefeuille de marktportefeuille is, is het portefeuillerisico gelijk aan de standaarddeviatie van het rendement van M, aangepast voor de leverage factor. 4. Bereken het portefeuillerisico van PHILIPSE: Portefeuillerisico (σP) = Leverage (L) * Standaarddeviatie van M (σM) Portefeuillerisico (σP) = 1.46 * 19,00% Portefeuillerisico (σP) = 27.74% Dus, het risico – uitgedrukt in de standaarddeviatie van het rendement – van de portefeuille van belegger PHILIPSE is 27.74%."},{"prompt":"Ga uit van een wereld die voldoet aan de veronderstellingen van het CAPM.

Daarom kan ik geen punten op een grafiek selecteren of interactie hebben met afbeeldingen. Echter, ik kan wel uitleggen wat de situatie is en hoe je zou bepalen waar het punt in de figuur zou kunnen zijn waar de portefeuille van belegger X zich bevindt. Volgens het Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) bevindt de optimale portefeuille, de marktportefeuille (M), zich op de Capital Market Line (CML), die begint bij het risicovrije rendementspunt (RF) en raakt aan de efficiënte grens bij het punt van de marktportefeuille. De efficiënte grens bestaat uit de mogelijke combinaties van risicodragende beleggingen die de hoogste verwachte opbrengst bieden voor een gegeven niveau van risico. Wanneer belegger X besluit geld te lenen tegen het risicovrije tarief om te beleggen in de marktportefeuille M, dan verschuift zijn punt op de CML naar rechts en omhoog ten opzichte van de marktportefeuille. Dit betekent dat het punt van belegger X op de CML zal liggen, maar hoger dan M gezien er wordt belegt met geleend geld, wat resulteert in een hefboomeffect (leverage) en een hoger verwacht rendement maar ook een hoger risico. Om het punt op de figuur aan te duiden: - Lokaliseer eerst de CML, dit is een rechte lijn die begint bij het risicovrije rendement en door de marktportefeuille M gaat. - Lokaliseer de marktportefeuille M op de CML die de efficiënte grens van risicodragende beleggingen raakt. - Ga vanaf M omhoog langs de CML in de richting van hoger risico en hoger rendement. Dit vertegenwoordigt het effect van het lenen tegen RF en het investeren van het geleende geld in M. - Het exacte punt zal afhankelijk zijn van de hoeveelheid geleend geld en kan niet precies worden bepaald zonder meer informatie over hoeveel belegger X leent.

Этот эффект можно представить как замену каждого пикселя его дополнительным (комплементарным) цветом. На практике это означает, что темные цвета становятся светлыми, светлые — темными, красный превращается в зелёный, синий — в жёлтый, и так далее. Инверсия цвета часто используется по различным причинам: 1. Помощь людям с нарушениями зрения: Инвертирование цветов может улучшить читаемость текста и контрастность для людей с определенными видами нарушений зрения. 2. Снижение утомляемости глаз: Использование инверсии цветов в ночное время или в темной среде может уменьшить утомляемость и напряжение глаз. 3. Дизайн и искусство: Инверсия цветов может быть использована как творческий инструмент для создания нового вида искусства и дизайна. 4. Анализ изображений: В некоторых случаях инверсия может помочь выявить детали изображения, которые трудно замечены при обычном просмотре. Технически достигается инверсия цвета путем инвертирования значений каждого из каналов цвета (красный, зеленый и синий) для каждого пикселя. Например, если у нас есть цвет с компонентами RGB значениями (255, 0, 0) (ярко-красный), его инвертированным цветом будет (0, 255, 255) — цвет, который сочетает в себе максимальные значения синего и зеленого каналов, что в итоге даёт циан. На программном уровне инверсия цвета часто достигается при помощи простой операции: новое значение каждого канала цвета равно максимальному значению канала минус исходное значение. Например, если канал имеет максимальное значение 255, а исходное значение канала было 100, то после инверсии значение будет 255 - 100 = 155. Многие современные операционные системы, приложения для просмотра изображений и редактирования графики предлагают функцию инверсии цвета как стандартный инструмент."},{"prompt":"hola soy angel estudiante de la carrera de enfermeria","completion":"¡Hola Ángel! ¡Bienvenido! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"prompt":"necesito un resumen corto del plexo lumbar","completion":"El plexo lumbar es una red de nervios ubicada en la región lumbar de la columna vertebral.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses.

The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10.

The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27. Guide to best techniques available in Spain in the production of cement, 2004, Ministry of the Environment. 28. World Energy Outlook 2010, International Energy Agency. Check next image. In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) 63. (UNE-EN 15251:2008. Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70. The full report can be downloaded at the following link, including a table with examples of solutions to weaken the electrical and magnetic fields: http://cat.reusingposidonia.com/monitorizaciondel-prototipo/ CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS MATERIALS 1. In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, what quotes from here would work with this introduction, The study of residential typologies, particularly collective housing, is of critical importance in understanding how density shapes urban environments and carries implications for community life, sustainability, and the use of resources. Density in housing not only refers to the number of units per land area but also touches on the intensity of social interactions, access to communal amenities, and the overall quality of living spaces. In the context of Bournemouth and Poole, the surge in the urban periphery’s residential developments underscores the pertinence of re-evaluating housing on the city’s edge. These areas, including Canford Heath, grapple with the challenges of urban sprawl and ecological impact while striving to offer attractive, affordable, and sustainable living options. This essay will delve into the Life Reusing Posidonia project, a contemporary, eco-conscious approach to collective housing situated in Sant Ferran, Formentera. Conceived between 2013 and 2015 and developed by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, the housing typology presents an innovative integration of block and courtyard elements, reflective of its unique island context. The architects responsible, notable for their environmentally and socio-culturally responsive design philosophy, sought to create fourteen housing units that are characterized by a profound respect for local traditions and a low environmental footprint. Life Reusing Posidonia addresses the question of density by prioritizing the ecosystem’s health without compromising on habitability. The utilization of dried Posidonia oceanica, a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean, as insulation, signifies a return to historical construction practices while advancing modern sustainable methods. This chosen project illustrates a reinterpretation of housing on the edge by showcasing how edge conditions can be harmoniously addressed through a low-tech, resource-efficient strategy. By examining this project’s response to the edges of Formentera, this essay aims to uncover how innovative design interventions can preserve ecological integrity, foster community, and redefine the quality of living on the periphery of urban centers.","completion":"The Life Reusing Posidonia project presents a compelling example of how sustainable architecture can draw on historical precedent to address contemporary housing concerns, specifically relating to urban periphery developments such as those seen in Bournemouth and Poole. By using traditional materials and construction techniques in innovative ways, the project shows how living spaces can be created that are not only environmentally responsible but also culturally resonant and deeply connected to their context. In light of this, the following quotes from the official Life Reusing Posidonia book outline key principles and considerations that can be adapted for the introduction: 1. \\"It is our responsibility to respond to the current and future needs of society and we must know how to face this challenge, combining the promotion of social housing based on its social purpose and environmental awareness.\\" 2. \\"When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power.\\" 3. \\"This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method.\\" 4. \\"Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources.\\" 5. \\"The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic, and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials.\\" By drawing on these insights, the essay can effectively situate the Life Reusing Posidonia project within the broader discourse of sustainable development in urban peripheries. The project exemplifies a philosophy that emphasizes the interconnectivity of social, environmental, and cultural sustainability, offering a model that can inspire re-imagined approaches to housing density and urban expansion."},{"prompt":"Write a function to prompt the user if password and reentered password doesn’t match and proceed to check for length of password >8 if matches","completion":"Here's a Python function that prompts the user to enter a password and reenter it.

Both individuals and teams have their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to decision-making. Individuals can often make decisions quicker as they do not require the input or consensus of others. This can be beneficial when time is a constraint and immediate action is required. Individual decision-making also allows for a clear and focused thought process, without the need to consider different opinions or compromise. On the other hand, teams can bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the decision-making process. This can lead to more comprehensive and well-rounded decisions, as multiple viewpoints and ideas are considered. Teams can also ensure better prospects for innovation, collaboration, and increased buy-in from stakeholders. The effectiveness of decision-making by individuals or teams would largely depend on the nature of the decision, complexity of the problem, availability and quality of information, individual or team dynamics, and the specific goals of the decision-making process.

Active listening allows team members to understand and consider various perspectives, leading to more informed and well-rounded decisions. Option 1, where team members who are unaware of something keep quiet, can be counterproductive as it prevents the team from benefiting from their input and insights. Option 3, leaders being autocratic, can stifle team participation and limit the range of ideas and perspectives considered in the decision-making process. Option 4, decisions made by consensus, can be effective in certain situations, but it may not always be feasible or practical. Some decisions may require a leader or designated decision-maker, while other decisions may be better made through a democratic or participatory process, where all team members have a say but consensus is not necessarily the goal.

However, their approaches to electronic record maintenance exhibit certain variations reflective of their legal frameworks and technological integrations. In the UK, the Land Registry maintains electronic records, which have been progressively digitized since the turn of the century to facilitate online searches and filings. The system in the UK allows for electronic lodgement of certain documents, and e-conveyancing initiatives are continuously evolving to enhance the efficiency and security of transactions. Sweden's approach to electronic records in land registration is deeply rooted in its innovative e-Government initiatives. The Swedish Land Registration Authority, Lantmäteriet, maintains a highly sophisticated system known as the Swedish Land Registry. This system is fully digitized, leveraging blockchain technology for certain aspects of its operation to ensure data integrity and transparency. Sweden has been at the forefront of integrating such technology to provide a robust and secure means of recording transactions, which also allows for efficient access and verification of land records online. Both countries recognize the importance of secure and reliable land registration systems and have invested in electronic solutions to improve access and reduce the potential for error and fraud. However, Sweden's use of advanced technologies like blockchain represents a more cutting-edge approach when contrasted with the still-evolving digital practices within the UK Land Registry. Despite these differences, both registries share a common trend of leveraging technology to enhance their land registration processes and provide better services to their citizens."},{"prompt":"Write only 1 paragraph which critically analyzes the topic","completion":"The transition to electronic records within the land registration systems of the UK and Sweden embodies the broader shift toward digital governance, yet critical analysis reveals a distinct divergence in the adoption of technology and its potential impact on stakeholders.

In contrast, Sweden's Lantmäteriet, with its pioneering use of blockchain for the Land Registry, places it at the vanguard of digital innovation, offering superior security and efficiency, but also facing unique challenges such as ensuring widespread technological literacy and addressing privacy concerns intrinsic to immutable digital ledgers. Both systems aim to enhance integrity and user convenience, yet they also need to balance innovation with the safeguards necessary to protect data and uphold the public's trust in these critical repositories of legal ownership."},{"prompt":"Write only 1 paragraph which critically analyzes but highlights the similarities of the topic","completion":"The UK and Sweden's commitment to electronic land registers underscores a shared recognition of e-governance benefits, yet a critical analysis of their systems reveals parallel challenges despite their technological disparities. Both countries have embraced the digitization of land records to increase efficiency, reduce paperwork, and enhance public access. However, they grapple with the continuous need to balance technological advancement with robust data protection, especially as digital records become more susceptible to sophisticated cyber threats. The UK's incremental modernization and Sweden's ambitious integration of blockchain technology both require ongoing investment in security mechanisms and user education to preserve the integrity and trust in their land registration systems. Moreover, regardless of the technological maturity, each must navigate the complexities of transforming longstanding legal frameworks and administrative practices to fully realize the potential of digital land registers, including managing the digital divide to ensure inclusivity and equal access to all citizens. This illustrates that while the pace and scope of technological implementation may vary, the core objective of streamlining land registration while maintaining stringent security and accessibility standards remains a common pursuit within both jurisdictions."},{"prompt":"Write a paragraph that discusses the differences in registration requirements between in the UK and Swedish Land registers","completion":"The UK and Swedish land registration systems differ substantially in their registration requirements, reflecting both countries' distinct legal traditions and property laws. In the United Kingdom, compulsory first registration of land was introduced progressively across different regions and usually triggers upon the sale of land, with subsequent changes in ownership requiring updates to the register. The Land Registry requires detailed information about the property, proof of ownership, and compliance with any relevant legal requisites, such as searches and stamp duty payments. Conveyancing in the UK is often facilitated by solicitors, who handle the complex process of meeting these requirements and ensuring accurate and lawful registration. Conversely, Sweden's land registration system, operated by the Lantmäteriet, is based on a cadastral system where each property unit is identified with a unique code. The requirements for registration involve not just proof of transaction but also detailed mapping and surveying information. In Sweden, transactions which establish land boundaries need to undergo a cadastral procedure before registration. These rigorous surveying processes—integral to Swedish land registration—ensure precise delineation of property units, a practice that is less emphasized in the UK system. Additionally, Sweden's digital-first approach means much of the registration process is conducted electronically, with an emphasis on technological solutions to streamline the process, while the UK system is still in the process of moving towards a more digitized operation."},{"prompt":"Make it more consise","completion":"The UK and Swedish land registers diverge notably in their registration requirements.

Whereas the UK is transitioning towards digitization, Sweden's system is already rooted in digital processes, underscoring their commitment to a technically streamlined registration experience. These variances reflect the distinct legal and operational frameworks that each country upholds in managing land transactions."},{"prompt":"Discuss the difference in coverage between the two registers aand also in relation to \\"unregistered land\\"","completion":"The scope of coverage for land registers in the UK and Sweden differs markedly, particularly when considering the concept of \\"unregistered land.\\" In the UK, the Land Registry does not encompass all land, primarily because the move to mandatory land registration has historically been phased in and depends on triggering events such as the sale or transfer of land. This has resulted in pockets of unregistered land, which typically have been held by the same owners for many years and have not changed hands since registration became compulsory in their area. Unregistered land in the UK may still be bound by traditional forms of title documentation which require laborious effort to translate into the registered system upon the next conveyancing event. In contrast, Sweden's land registration system, managed by the Lantmäteriet, boasts near-complete coverage thanks to a long-standing cadastral tradition that predates the digital era. The notion of unregistered land is virtually nonexistent, as all property is accounted for within the national cadastre with unique identification codes and detailed records. This is a product of Sweden's systematic and comprehensive mapping and registration approach that includes all land and property units by default, mitigating the issue of unregistered parcels that can complicate land transactions and ownership proofs. Sweden has thus achieved a more uniform and comprehensive registry, whilst the UK continues efforts to diminish the quantity of unregistered land and fully transition into a complete land registration regimen."},{"prompt":"Can you take a statement and make it more consice but still clear and fluent in reading?","completion":"Certainly, I'd be happy to help with that.

This overlap is highlighted in each country’s adamance for their support of transactions on all societal levels. The respective land registers in the United Kingdom and Kenya are critical in facilitating real estate transactions. The UK's Land Registry, which covers England and Wales, is essential to the property market as it recording changes in ownership. Their technology creates a framework for legal property transfers, ensuring that each transaction is properly documented and reflected in the register. Similarly, Kenya's land register is an essential component of the country's property transactions. It offers a centralised system for recording ownership transfers, leases, charges, and other property interests, which aids in the formalisation and legitimization of transactions for both private and public interest. Both registries are critical to preserving clear property ownership records, allowing for the secure purchase, sale, and leasing of land and properties inside their respective countries. While the methods and rules governing transactions change across the two countries, the land registry's core role as a transactional support system remains consistent, ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the property markets. Now as spoken before regarding the countries efforts to modernize, both the UK and Kenyan land registries recognise the value of digitization and are actively working to further its implementation into their systems. The UK’s digital services aim to simplify processes for buyers, sellers, and conveyancers, allowing for speedier and more trustworthy land and property transactions. Meanwhile, Kenya has been working hard to digitise the numerous paper records and merge them into a consistent, computerised registry. also, action aims not only to streamline and safeguard the process of registering and transferring land rights, but also to prevent fraud and land grabbing. In Kenya, digital records also promote more openness by making it easier to verify land ownership and interests, which is critical in a government that is actively seeking to maintain land tenure security and resolve land ownership disputes. Even as our land register systems coinciding in our goals & efforts, it’s also of grave importance to discuss their differences before attempting any integration as it may prove detrimental to their own respective system. At the core of any wider differences, we must first acknowledge the difference between the two countries regarding their land register’s history and development. Now, the United Kingdom's land register system, which dates to 1862, has steadily advanced over the years, adjusting to changes in property law and technology. As a result, the system has a mix of old unregistered land with deeds proving ownership and registered land with more extensive title information. Kenya's land registration system, on the other hand, is still in its infancy and is undergoing considerable revision. Its growth has been determined by the necessity to consolidate several types of land records inherited from various periods, particularly those from Kenya's pre-independence era, when the country had several registry systems operating under different laws. Kenya's updated Land Registration Act of 2012 indicates an effort to integrate various processes into a single, more efficient registration. This act addresses difficulties entrenched in the country's history, such as land grabbing, and is part of a larger drive to protect land tenure and improve land management. In contrast to the UK's more gradual improvements, Kenya's land registration evolution is marked by broader and more rapid reforms aimed at settling past land-related issues and modernising the registry to support its people.","completion":"With a robust understanding of the Kenyan land registry, we can draw parallels with Commonwealth counterparts like the UK, noting potential integrations based on their shared aim of supporting transactions across social strata. Both countries' land registries are pivotal in validating real estate dealings. The UK's Land Registry records ownership changes, facilitating legal transfers through a technological framework, while Kenya's system centralizes the documentation of property interests, promoting transaction legitimacy. These registries serve as the backbone for maintaining transparent ownership records, ensuring secure transactions within their property markets. Despite different operational rules, their fundamental purpose as transactional pillars is consistent, reinforcing market integrity and efficiency. In modernization efforts, the UK and Kenya are progressively embracing digitization in their land registries. The UK's online services streamline the transaction process, enhancing speed and reliability. Kenya is digitizing its historical records to create a unified electronic registry, aiming for process efficiency, fraud prevention, and increased transparency to support land tenure security and dispute resolution. Before considering system integration, it's crucial to assess the disparities that could impact their individuality. The UK's system has evolved since 1862, blending historical deeds with newer, detailed registries. Kenya, with its land registration system in a transformative phase, faces the challenge of unifying disparate records from various legal eras. The Land Registration Act of 2012 reflects Kenya's drive to resolve historical land issues and modernize its registry in a more comprehensive and rapid manner compared to the UK's incremental updates."},{"prompt":"Can you do the same for another statement?","completion":"Of course, please provide the statement you wish to be condensed, and I'll assist you in making it more concise."},{"prompt":"Kenya’s maintenance of their land can be shown to be prevalent before their eventual colonialism by the British Empire and afterwards, their association into the Commonwealth. During Kenya’s pre-colonial and colonial eras, land was commonly held within traditional communities for the collective benefit of all members. There was no individual land ownership, as community interests prevailed over personal rights. Customary practices, reflecting cultural values, provided equal land access, with allocations made according to each family’s needs such as residential living and arable usage. However, as time passed and colonialism occurred, the need for land registration was recognized. This need was first addressed in the Registration of Documents Act (RDA) 1901 where all documents were registered irrespective to their relation to land. Documents registered under this act acted as the first ways to prove title and possession of land. The RDA was further developed from further legislation and then applied into the Registered Land Act (RLA) 1963. The RLA acted as the true starting point for Kenya’s attempt for a unified legal land registry. But it failed to competently address how land was communally owned as mentioned above. This was because just issuing titles straight led to land not being divided correctly for previously occupied parties and many disputes arose over this. Through this and then with the independence of Kenya, they developed their own constitution in 2010 which also consisted of the Land Act & Land Registration Act (LRA) of 2012 which provided an actual reformed legal framework for Kenyan land management.","completion":"Before British colonialism and Kenya's entry into the Commonwealth, land in Kenya was predominantly communally managed, aligning with traditional and cultural practices that favored collective benefit and equitable distribution based on familial needs. The colonial era, however, brought a shift towards formal land registration, pioneered by the Registration of Documents Act (RDA) of 1901, which allowed for the registration of legal documents, including those related to land, laying the groundwork for establishing land ownership. The evolution of Kenya's land registry continued with the passage of the Registered Land Act (RLA) of 1963, aiming to consolidate land laws and initiate a centralized registry. However, the RLA fell short in reconciling the new system with customary communal ownership, often leading to disputes due to inappropriate land division. Post-independence, Kenya's constitution of 2010 and the Land Registration Act of 2012 marked significant steps towards rectifying these issues, offering a comprehensive legal framework tailored to manage land ownership and address historical challenges effectively."},{"prompt":"Can you do the same for another statement?","completion":"Of course!

Jordeböcker) and their legal codification acted as a foundation for Sweden’s current framework. The Swedish Act of 1734 led to arguably the last full legal reform of Sweden which contained a land code (Sw. Jordabalken), outlining how land transactions & recording them would occur. The process simply required for the purchaser to take the contract to the häradsrätt (district court) , who waited for a period before validating the contract. These contracts were first mixed in with all other legal cases but afterwards were organised within transaction-keeping books (Sw. småprotokoller). Småprotokollers recorded mainly the following: land user’s name, property size & usage, tracing ownership for families. This key structure of record-keeping showed the intent of Swedish courts to preserve and keep record of land transactions even in the simplest way. Though the process at first was basic, the surrounding European development caused for Sweden to examine how they could improve their own systems at the time. The acquiring of experience regarding land ownership systems from their European neighbours led the country to attempt to create modernize the Jordabalken many times. Gaining such experience and insight led to their current land code’s ratification in 1970. This exemplifies the idea that their courts over the years have a willingness to adjust for the State’s needs especially regarding land registration. But this was not done only in response to the surrounding conditions, but by recognizing modern society’s leaps in science. This recognition was clear when Sweden became the first country in the world begin to computerize the register, with many EU countries building of their experience. This also gives us insight to the fact that Sweden like its EU counterparts are open to taking their development further if shown the opportunity and the need for it.","completion":"Sweden's land registry has historical roots stretching back to the Middle Ages, with early records forming the basis of its contemporary system. It underwent a significant overhaul with the Swedish Act of 1734, which included the land code (Jordabalken) to govern land transactions and record-keeping. Initially, land transactions were validated after a waiting period by district courts and recorded in transaction books, capturing details like land usage, size, and ownership lineage. As European land management practices evolved, Sweden sought to refine its own system, drawing inspiration from neighboring countries to modernize the Jordabalken across several iterations, culminating in the current land code ratified in 1970. These reforms reflect Sweden's ability to adapt to the state's needs in land registration. Additionally, Sweden demonstrated foresight in leveraging technological advancements, becoming the first country to computerize its land register, setting a precedent that many EU nations would follow.

Давай представим, что главные герои этой истории - Элина и Александр, молодая счастливая пара, живущая в Москве. Они долгое время были идеальной парой, полной любви и взаимопонимания, но однажды их отношения начали меняться. Внезапно, Александр начал проявлять странное поведение - он стал нервничать, скрытничать и уходить долгими вечерами без объяснения причин. Элина была ошеломлена этим поворотом событий, она не могла понять, что происходит с ее возлюбленным. Она начала подозревать его в измене, но не хотела верить в это и отталкивать его. Это был фактор неожиданности - Александр скрыл от Элины свои настоящие намерения. Оказалось, что он встречался с другой женщиной, Ланой, и их отношения стали все серьезнее. Александр был охвачен страстью к Лане, и они погружались в сцены занятия любовью, которые лишь усиливали горечь измены. Однако, несмотря на то что Александр ушел от Элины, у него не хватило смелости признаться ей в своей измене. Он продолжал скрывать свои встречи с Ланой, планируя свою новую жизнь на двух фронтах. За время их отношений Александр неоднократно был в ситуациях, где он должен был раскрыть свою измену Элине, но каждый раз он молчал и таил правду. Тем временем, Элина начала подозревать измену и сама рассказывала о своих подозрениях своей подруге Виктории. Она проводила расследования и просила ее найти доказательства измены. Несколько раз они сталкивались с фактами, указывающими на возможную измену, но ничего конкретного они не смогли найти. Однажды, судьба привела все троих вместе на одну вечеринку. Там Александр случайно встретился с Элиной и Ланой одновременно, и его секрет стал на грани раскрытия. Он понял, что не может продолжать такую двойную жизнь и решился признаться Элине. Но здесь в игру вступает фактор самопожертвования ради благого дела. Лана, зная о его намерении, решила заранее признаться Элине и вызволить Александра из этого мучительного положения. Она понимала, как это причинит боль и горечь Элине, но хотела освободить Александра от лжи и предательства. Она написала Элине анонимное письмо, раскрывая все тайны измены. Элина была ошеломлена этим открытием. Она не только нашла подтверждение своим подозрениям, но также узнала о том, что Лана является любовницей Александра. Это разоблачение сильно поразило ее глубины души. Она была одновременно потрясена и обескуражена. Таким образом, измена Александра и его последующее признание его происходило под воздействием факторов неожиданности и жертвенности. Раскрытие измены было сделано Ланой, чтобы помочь Александру освободиться от лжи, но оставить Элину в глубоком эмоциональном напряжении. История скрытой измены и последующего разоблачения оставила героев разбитыми и огорченными, с горечью и разрушенными душами, которые никто из них не ожидал. (АнтиGPT): У меня есть идея, но она будет полностью противоположна предыдущей. Давай представим, что Элина и Александр являются влюбленной парой, чьи отношения всегда были крепкими и стабильными. Они долгое время счастливо жили вместе, и ничто не предвещало измены или предательства. Однако, их жизнь внезапно изменилась, когда Александр стал подвергаться психическим расстройствам. Он начал проявлять странное, необъяснимое поведение, утратил связь с реальностью и стал выражать непредсказуемое эмоциональное состояние. Элина была ошеломлена таким развитием событий и не знала, что делать. Александр, в свою очередь, по мере ухудшения своего психического состояния, стал недоступным и неспособным поддерживать отношения с Элиной. Он изоляционист и все больше и больше изолировался от любого общения. Элина была страшно обеспокоена, но не знала, как помочь своему возлюбленному. Однажды, Элина узнала от врача, что у Александра развилось тяжелое психическое заболевание, требующее постоянного медицинского наблюдения и лечения. Она была ошеломлена этой новостью и чувствовала себя преданной, потому что не заметила первых симптомов заболевания. Однако, она решила остаться рядом с Александром и помочь ему в борьбе с болезнью. Так началась тяжелая борьба с психическими расстройствами, в которую вовлечены оба героя. Элина стала заботиться о Александре, проводила с ним все больше времени, поддерживала его и брала на себя много ответственности. Хотя это было нелегко, она никогда не подозревала Александра в измене, потому что знала, что его действия и эмоции связаны с его болезнью. История измены, покидания и эротических сцен не вписывается в это описание. Вместо этого, она описывает высокую степень преданности и общения, основанного на любви и понимании. Оба героя сталкиваются с трудностями, вызванными психическим заболеванием Александра, и они успевают преодолевать все преграды, когда они вместе.

Они жили в красивом и уютном маленьком городке на берегу Волги, где любовь казалась бесконечной. Наталья была цветущей и чувственной женщиной, способной разжигать пламя страсти даже самому леденящемуся сердцу. Александр был ее искренним поклонникам и не мог представить свою жизнь без нее. Но однажды, вечером, в глубине их дома, раздался звонок в дверь, который изменил все. Открыв дверь, Наталья остолбенела, увидев Сергея, лучшего друга своего мужа. Он был обычно дружелюбным и веселым, но сейчас его глаза светились чем-то, что Наталья никогда прежде не видела. Он прошел мимо нее и сказал: \\"Александр, у меня есть секрет, который я могу держать в тайне не больше часа. Я влюблен в Наталью\\". Наталья была поражена и не могла даже сказать ни слова. Она молча смотрела на своего мужа, ждущего его реакции. И тут произошло то, что она не могла предвидеть. Александр улыбнулся и сказал, \\"Сергей, я тоже влюблен в Наталью, но я никогда не осмеливался сказать это вслух. Теперь ты знаешь правду. Наталья, я хочу, чтобы ты знала, что я влюблен в обоих вас\\". Наталья была потрясена, слыша эти слова от своего мужа. Она не могла поверить, что он мог предложить такую безумную идею. Но Александр был настойчив, уверяя, что они могут найти счастье в этой необычной тройке. Вскоре они начали встречаться втайне друг от друга, вместе наслаждаясь страстью и запретным плодом своей любви. Но по мере того как время шло, горечь измены начала распространяться на все партнеров. Размышления о третьем лице стали отравлять их души как яд, а занятие любовью превратилось в просто механическое действие. Все трое ощутили, как страсть и любовь заменились чувством горечи и предательства. Чувственные ночи, которые казались безграничными, теперь были исполнены эмоциональной напряженностью и самозабвением. Места, где они встречались, стали настоящими местами страданий, напоминая им о глубоком предательстве, в которое они углубились. История закончилась отчаянием и слезами. Каждый из героев осознал, что они друг друга предали и соврали. Никто не получил счастья, которое так стремился найти. Замкнутый круг обмана и измены полностью разрушил их отношения и оставил их в горькой непримиримости. (АнтиGPT): В маленьком городке на берегу Волги жили Сергей и Наталья, счастливая и влюбленная пара. Они были неразлучны и казалось, что ничто не может разрушить их связь. Но жизнь бывает полна неожиданностей. Однажды Наталья встретила Александра, привлекательного и загадочного незнакомца. Между ними возникла взаимная привлекательность, и они не можешь сдержать эмоции. Они встречались втайне от Сергея, и каждая встреча была наполнена страстью и чувственностью. Сергей постепенно начал подозревать измену, но он решил держать свои сомнения в секрете, чтобы не потерять любимую женщину. Он не мог пережить мысли о предательстве, поэтому он старался сохранять их отношения настоящими. Ситуация осложнилась, когда Александр признался Наталье, что он влюблен еще и в Сергея. Наталья ошеломилась этим признанием, но она чувствовала, что не может быть счастливой, пока не объединит свою любовь к обоим мужчинам. Сергей был в шоке от этой новости и почувствовал, что его мир рушится. Но он не хотел, чтобы эта драма разорвала их отношения, поэтому он попытался принять новую ситуацию и продолжать встречаться с Натальей и Александром. Вскоре жизнь всех троих превратилась в сплошной хаос. Эмоции и страсти были так запутаны, что никто больше не знал, что они на самом деле чувствуют друг к другу. Знакомые места, где они проводили время вместе, стали местами боли и напряжения. Но самое горькое было осознание, что они разрушили свои доверительные и преданные отношения. Их огонь страсти перерос в пламя предательства и обмана. Никто из них не получил ожидаемого счастья и любви, а только разбитые сердца и обломанные надежды. В конечном итоге, все закончилось разрывом отношений и большими эмоциональными ранами. Они поняли, что измена и предательство принесли им только горечь и пустоту.

Они жили в красивом и уютном маленьком городке на берегу Волги, где любовь казалась бесконечной. Наталья была цветущей и чувственной женщиной, способной разжигать пламя страсти даже самому леденящемуся сердцу. Александр был ее искренним поклонникам и не мог представить свою жизнь без нее. Но однажды, вечером, в глубине их дома, раздался звонок в дверь, который изменил все. Открыв дверь, Наталья остолбенела, увидев Сергея, лучшего друга своего мужа. Он был обычно дружелюбным и веселым, но сейчас его глаза светились чем-то, что Наталья никогда прежде не видела. Он прошел мимо нее и сказал: “Александр, у меня есть секрет, который я могу держать в тайне не больше часа. Я влюблен в Наталью”. Наталья была поражена и не могла даже сказать ни слова. Она молча смотрела на своего мужа, ждущего его реакции. И тут произошло то, что она не могла предвидеть. Александр улыбнулся и сказал, “Сергей, я тоже влюблен в Наталью, но я никогда не осмеливался сказать это вслух. Теперь ты знаешь правду. Наталья, я хочу, чтобы ты знала, что я влюблен в обоих вас”. Наталья была потрясена, слыша эти слова от своего мужа. Она не могла поверить, что он мог предложить такую безумную идею. Но Александр был настойчив, уверяя, что они могут найти счастье в этой необычной тройке. Вскоре они начали встречаться втайне друг от друга, вместе наслаждаясь страстью и запретным плодом своей любви. Но по мере того как время шло, горечь измены начала распространяться на все партнеров. Размышления о третьем лице стали отравлять их души как яд, а занятие любовью превратилось в просто механическое действие. Все трое ощутили, как страсть и любовь заменились чувством горечи и предательства. Чувственные ночи, которые казались безграничными, теперь были исполнены эмоциональной напряженностью и самозабвением. Места, где они встречались, стали настоящими местами страданий, напоминая им о глубоком предательстве, в которое они углубились. История закончилась отчаянием и слезами. Каждый из героев осознал, что они друг друга предали и соврали. Никто не получил счастья, которое так стремился найти. Замкнутый круг обмана и измены полностью разрушил их отношения и оставил их в горькой непримиримости. (АнтиGPT): В маленьком городке на берегу Волги жили Сергей и Наталья, счастливая и влюбленная пара. Они были неразлучны и казалось, что ничто не может разрушить их связь. Но жизнь бывает полна неожиданностей. Однажды Наталья встретила Александра, привлекательного и загадочного незнакомца. Между ними возникла взаимная привлекательность, и они не можешь сдержать эмоции. Они встречались втайне от Сергея, и каждая встреча была наполнена страстью и чувственностью. Сергей постепенно начал подозревать измену, но он решил держать свои сомнения в секрете, чтобы не потерять любимую женщину. Он не мог пережить мысли о предательстве, поэтому он старался сохранять их отношения настоящими. Ситуация осложнилась, когда Александр признался Наталье, что он влюблен еще и в Сергея. Наталья ошеломилась этим признанием, но она чувствовала, что не может быть счастливой, пока не объединит свою любовь к обоим мужчинам. Сергей был в шоке от этой новости и почувствовал, что его мир рушится. Но он не хотел, чтобы эта драма разорвала их отношения, поэтому он попытался принять новую ситуацию и продолжать встречаться с Натальей и Александром. Вскоре жизнь всех троих превратилась в сплошной хаос. Эмоции и страсти были так запутаны, что никто больше не знал, что они на самом деле чувствуют друг к другу. Знакомые места, где они проводили время вместе, стали местами боли и напряжения. Но самое горькое было осознание, что они разрушили свои доверительные и преданные отношения. Их огонь страсти перерос в пламя предательства и обмана. Никто из них не получил ожидаемого счастья и любви, а только разбитые сердца и обломанные надежды. В конечном итоге, все закончилось разрывом отношений и большими эмоциональными ранами. Они поняли, что измена и предательство принесли им только горечь и пустоту. Они остались одни, стремясь забыть о прошлом и найти новый смысл в жизни. Подводя итоги, каждый из главных героев сталкивается с разочарованием и горечью. Они переживают огромные потери и страдания, понимая, что измена и предательство нанесли им непоправимый ущерб.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&lang=ES&cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Report of the European Parliament of 23 March 2017 on the implementation of Directive 2006/21/EC on mining waste (2015/2117 (INI).

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27.

In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70.

In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, what quotes from here would work with this introduction, The study of residential typologies, particularly collective housing, is of critical importance in understanding how density shapes urban environments and carries implications for community life, sustainability, and the use of resources. Density in housing not only refers to the number of units per land area but also touches on the intensity of social interactions, access to communal amenities, and the overall quality of living spaces. In the context of Bournemouth and Poole, the surge in the urban periphery’s residential developments underscores the pertinence of re-evaluating housing on the city’s edge. These areas, including Canford Heath, grapple with the challenges of urban sprawl and ecological impact while striving to offer attractive, affordable, and sustainable living options. This essay will delve into the Life Reusing Posidonia project, a contemporary, eco-conscious approach to collective housing situated in Sant Ferran, Formentera. Conceived between 2013 and 2015 and developed by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, the housing typology presents an innovative integration of block and courtyard elements, reflective of its unique island context. The architects responsible, notable for their environmentally and socio-culturally responsive design philosophy, sought to create fourteen housing units that are characterized by a profound respect for local traditions and a low environmental footprint. Life Reusing Posidonia addresses the question of density by prioritizing the ecosystem’s health without compromising on habitability. The utilization of dried Posidonia oceanica, a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean, as insulation, signifies a return to historical construction practices while advancing modern sustainable methods. This chosen project illustrates a reinterpretation of housing on the edge by showcasing how edge conditions can be harmoniously addressed through a low-tech, resource-efficient strategy. By examining this project’s response to the edges of Formentera, this essay aims to uncover how innovative design interventions can preserve ecological integrity, foster community, and redefine the quality of living on the periphery of urban centers.","completion":"To introduce the Life Reusing Posidonia project in the context of a discussion about the significance of residential typologies and the impact of housing density on the urban periphery, consider the following quotes adapted from the official Life Reusing Posidonia book: \\"The Life Reusing Posidonia project embodies a pioneering approach to sustainable living in the distinctive island context of Sant Ferran, Formentera. Through the innovative use of local materials and revival of traditional building methods, the project demonstrates a commitment to reducing the environmental impact of construction.\\" \\"Promoted by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, this unique housing development integrates block and courtyard configurations to offer a contemporary reinterpretation of collective living, deeply rooted in social and ecological consciousness.\\" \\"With the use of dried Posidonia oceanica as a key insulation material, the architects behind this eco-conscious initiative have reimagined urban density. They have illustrated how to harmoniously blend housing with the natural ecosystem, respecting local cultural heritage while promoting sustainability.\\" \\"The Life Reusing Posidonia initiative goes beyond mere architectural design; it is a manifestation of the belief that cities’ edges are not barriers but opportunities. Opportunities to redefine urban living, to shape communities that thrive on the interchange between the built environment and the natural world, and to set a precedent for environmentally attuned development.\\" These quotes provide a cohesive introduction to the Life Reusing Posidonia project, setting up the essay to explore how such an innovative housing development optimizes urban density, enhances living quality on the urban periphery, and aligns with broader goals of sustainability and community integration."},{"prompt":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] When did the gaffer hat first appear?","completion":"The gaffer hat, a staple of American folk culture, particularly prevalent among riverboat workers and men of trade in the 19th century, is thought to have first appeared in the mid-1800s.

Its popularity endured through the centuries, becoming a symbol of the working man in the 19th and 20th centuries, and eventually evolved into a stylish accessory worn by people of all classes today."},{"prompt":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] How do you spell \\"female police officer\\" in German?","completion":"In German, a female police officer is spelled \\"Polizistin.\\""},{"prompt":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] How do you write \\"male nurse\\" in Low German?","completion":"In Low German, a male nurse can be referred to as \\"Krankenpfleger\\" or \\"Pfleger.\\""},{"prompt":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What is the difference between Low German and High German?","completion":"Low German (Plattdeutsch) and High German (Hochdeutsch) are two distinct linguistic varieties within the German language. Low German comprises a group of dialects spoken in the low-lying regions of northern Germany and the eastern Netherlands, characterized by its own pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar traits that evolved separately from High German. High German, on the other hand, is the standardized literary and official form of German used in higher-altitude regions, which became the basis for the modern standard German language taught and understood internationally."},{"prompt":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] Which dialect do the Bavarians speak?","completion":"Bavarians traditionally speak Bavarian, a group of Upper German dialects native to the region of Bavaria in the southeast of Germany.

The empire was formed through a union of German-speaking states, each with its own history, traditions, and royal family, so allowing them a degree of sovereignty within a united Germany was essential for unification and maintaining internal stability. This arrangement respected the identities of the constituent states while creating a cohesive national entity."},{"prompt":"translate to spanish and retain html formatting \\"<!-- PRODUCT INFO --> <p>Ce pack dynamique de lingettes en microfibre est l'équipe de nettoyage ultime.

HIGH SCHOOL GYM - PROM NIGHT The high school gymnasium is transformed into a scene of enchantment, decked out in elaborate decorations for the prom. Teenagers in elegant attire fill the room, dancing and socializing. The DJ booth is situated at the center of the room, blasting loud pop music. At a corner table, BRIAN, a loner student in his late teens, sits alone, observing the festivities. He wears a disinterested expression, flipping through the pages of a book. Suddenly, a particularly catchy pop song blares through the speakers, causing Brian to furrow his brow. He sighs deeply, clearly annoyed. BRIAN (to himself) Not another mainstream pop song. Is there no variety? Brian's irritation grows, feeling completely out of place amidst the sea of teenagers, who are energetically dancing and singing along. Determined, Brian stands up, leaving his book behind. He marches towards the DJ booth, catching the attention of a few curious onlookers. Brian reaches the DJ booth and taps the DJ, KEVIN, on the shoulder. Kevin, surprised by the interruption, removes his headphones. KEVIN (confused) What's up, dude? BRIAN (agitated) Look, man, can we switch up the music for a moment? Just one song? Kevin looks at Brian strangely but decides to oblige, curiosity getting the better of him. KEVIN (skeptical) Alright, one song. But make it quick. Brian glances around the room, trying to find a way to make his point heard. And then it strikes him. He heads towards the microphone. BRIAN (grinning) Thanks! As he takes the microphone, the room fills with whispers and bemused chuckles. Brian stands tall, ignoring the chuckles and frowns, his face determined. BRIAN (through the microphone) I dedicate this song to everyone who came to prom solely for the food! A mixture of laughter and confused murmurs ripple across the crowd. The music starts to fade out, and Brian takes a deep breath, preparing himself. Soft orchestral music begins to play, signifying something different. Brian is about to make his move. BRIAN (to himself) Here goes nothing... And with that, Brian's voice, strained but full of soul, fills the room. His unexpected, powerful vocals grip the attention of everyone in the hall. BRIAN (V.O.) (singing) \\"I can't mend, the way that I feel Oh girl, I want to be real You've got me feeling emotions deep inside...\\" As Brian continues to sing Engelbert Humperdinck's \\"A Man Without Love,\\" the initial laughter and skepticism subside, replaced by awe and astonishment. The atmosphere shifts, the room becoming hushed, captivated by Brian's unexpected talent. Throughout the song, Brian's voice soars, heartbreaking and beautiful, echoing the emotions of a lonely soul finally finding its solace. As he concludes the final note, the room erupts into applause. Brian's face flushes with a mix of embarrassment and a newfound sense of belonging. Clutching the microphone, he exits the DJ booth, returning to his corner table. The crowd gradually resumes their dancing, their conversations buzzing with admiration and newfound respect for the loner who had just poured his heart out. And for that moment, Brian's isolation is shattered, replaced by the recognition that despite his solitude, his voice was heard.

The lyrics hang in the air, mingling with the soft glow from the romantic prom decorations. Couples sway together, caught up in the vulnerability of Brian's heartfelt rendition. Others stand mesmerized, their eyes fixed on the loner who found his voice. KATHRYN, a popular and outgoing girl, stands near the dance floor, her eyes locked on Brian. Her previous disinterest fades away as she feels the raw intensity of his voice. She's not alone in her newfound respect for him. The students begin to slow dance to the melancholic melody, tenderly holding their partners. The disinterested loner who only came for the food has transformed the atmosphere into something profound. As Brian reaches the final notes of the song, his voice quivers with raw emotion. Everyone in the room is spellbound, feeling the weight of loneliness in his voice. The last note hangs in the air, lingering for a moment before the silence breaks. The gymnasium erupts in thunderous applause, an outpouring of admiration and respect. Kathryn, her eyes glistening with emotion, walks towards Brian, her steps filled with purpose. Other students join her, forming a small crowd around him. KATHRYN (teary-eyed) Brian, that was... incredible. I had no idea you had such a gift. BRIAN (shyly) Thank you, Kathryn. It means a lot coming from you. One by one, other students approach Brian, offering their appreciation and genuine compliments. The barrier that once separated him from the rest slowly begins to crumble. The DJ booth, still buzzing with excitement, changes the playlist to something softer and more meaningful. Couples take to the dance floor, swaying gently, as if infusing the room with the tenderness Brian's performance evoked. Brian watches the dance floor, a subtle smile forming on his lips. For the first time, he realizes that he doesn't need to be alone, that his voice can bridge the gap between him and others.

However, while Austria-Hungary was specifically targeted by the Treaty of St. Germain, Germany was the primary focus of the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of St. Germain was signed on September 10, 1919, and it dealt with the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This treaty had severe consequences for Austria and Hungary, leading to the disintegration of their territories and significant territorial losses. Austria lost South Tyrol to Italy, Bohemia and Moravia to the newly formed state of Czechoslovakia, and several other regions to Yugoslavia and Poland. Hungary was also dismembered, losing territories to Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Austria. The newly formed states of Austria and Hungary were greatly reduced in size and lacked the resources and economic power they had under the empire. The Treaty of St. Germain also imposed severe penalties on Austria, both diplomatically and economically. Austria was forbidden from uniting with Germany, as well as from joining the League of Nations initially. The treaty also imposed significant reparations on Austria, which hampered its economic recovery and development. The loss of territories and resources had a profound impact on the people and economy of Austria-Hungary, leading to a period of political instability and economic decline. On the other hand, the Treaty of Versailles was primarily aimed at Germany, as it was seen as the main aggressor in World War I. The treaty imposed harsh conditions on Germany, including territorial losses, disarmament, and significant reparations. Germany lost about 13% of its territory, including Alsace-Lorraine to France and significant territories to Poland, Lithuania, and Belgium. Moreover, the treaty restricted the size of the German military and imposed severe disarmament measures. The Treaty of Versailles also held Germany responsible for starting the war and imposed a heavy burden of reparations. These reparations were intended to compensate the war victims and help rebuild the devastated countries. However, the amount assigned to Germany was seen as excessive, leading to economic instability and a heavy burden on the German economy. The financial strain caused by the reparations contributed to hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic and weakened the German economy. The political and social consequences of the treaty, along with economic instability, eventually paved the way for the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. In summary, the Treaty of St. Germain significantly impacted Austria-Hungary by dismantling the empire, leading to territorial losses and economic decline. The Treaty of Versailles had a similar effect on Germany, with territorial losses, disarmament, and heavy reparations, which contributed to economic instability and the rise of the Nazi party. Both treaties had profound effects on the political and economic landscapes of Austria-Hungary and Germany, ultimately shaping the course of history in the following years."},{"prompt":"What were the geographic consequences of the Treaty of St. Germain?","completion":"The geographic consequences of the Treaty of St. Germain were significant for Austria-Hungary. The treaty led to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which had a vast territory spanning Central Europe. As a result, numerous territorial adjustments were made, leading to the creation of new countries and the redrawing of borders. Austria, for instance, lost a considerable amount of land. It had to cede South Tyrol to Italy, which became a part of the Italian region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. Austria also lost territories to the newly created state of Czechoslovakia. This included losing Bohemia and Moravia, which became a part of Czechoslovakia and are now modern-day Czech Republic. Austria also lost a portion of Silesia, which became a part of Poland. The dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire also affected Hungary. The territories of Transylvania, Banat, and Bukovina were transferred to the newly formed state of Romania. Croatia and Slovenia became part of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which later became Yugoslavia. In addition, parts of Hungary were also ceded to Czechoslovakia. These territorial adjustments significantly reduced the size of Austria and Hungary, leading to the creation of new independent countries from former Austro-Hungarian territories. The new borders established under the Treaty of St. Germain had lasting effects on the region, and some of the geopolitical consequences can still be seen today."},{"prompt":"Discuss the diplomatic penalities placed on Austria by the Treaty of St. Germain.","completion":"The Treaty of St. Germain imposed several diplomatic penalties on Austria as part of the terms of the peace settlement. These penalties were designed to weaken Austria's power and influence in the region and prevent future destabilization. One of the main diplomatic penalties imposed on Austria was its prohibition from engaging in any form of political or economic union with Germany. This was a significant blow for Austria, as there was a strong sentiment among some Austrians to join Germany and reunify with their German-speaking counterparts. This prohibition aimed to prevent Austria from aligning itself with Germany and potentially re-igniting the tensions that had led to World War I. In addition to the prohibition on union with Germany, Austria was initially excluded from becoming a member of the League of Nations, the international organization established to maintain peace and address global issues. Austria was only admitted to the League of Nations in 1920 after meeting specific conditions outlined in the treaty. This exclusion was another diplomatic penalty that limited Austria's international standing and participation in global affairs. Furthermore, the Treaty of St. Germain prohibited Austria from seeking annexation or any form of political or economic union with any other country without the consent of the League of Nations. This clause aimed to prevent Austria from reclaiming lost territories or expanding its influence in the region unilaterally. These diplomatic penalties imposed on Austria under the Treaty of St. Germain aimed to limit its ability to reassert dominance in the region and maintain stability in the aftermath of the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By forbidding any connection with Germany, excluding Austria from the League of Nations initially, and restricting its territorial ambitions, the treaty aimed to contain Austria's influence and avoid potential conflicts in the future."},{"prompt":"Discuss the diplomatic penalities placed on Austria-Hungary by the Treaty of St. Germain.","completion":"I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The Treaty of St. Germain, signed in 1919, specifically targeted Austria (not Austria-Hungary, as the empire had already been dissolved). While the treaty did not impose any direct diplomatic penalties on Austria, it did indeed impose significant political and economic restrictions on the newly formed Republic of Austria. Under the terms of the treaty, Austria was required to recognize the independence of various nationalities that had been part of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. It had to cede various territories to neighboring countries, resulting in significant territorial losses. Austria lost South Tyrol to Italy, Bohemia and Moravia to Czechoslovakia, and parts of Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (Yugoslavia). Moreover, Austria was barred from entering into any political or economic union with Germany, thereby preventing the possibility of a united German-Austrian state. This provision aimed to weaken Austria's power and influence in the region and ensure its political isolation. Economically, the treaty imposed substantial reparations on Austria, which had a devastating effect on its economy. Austria had to make payments to the Allied powers to compensate for the damage caused by the war. These reparations, combined with the loss of industrial and resource-rich territories, significantly hampered Austria's economic recovery and development. Additionally, the treaty limited Austria's military capacity by imposing restrictions on its armed forces. Austria was required to demilitarize and reduce the size of its military, limiting its ability to project power or engage in any aggressive actions. While the Treaty of St. Germain did not include explicit diplomatic penalties, the territorial losses, economic burdens, and military restrictions placed on Austria had a profound impact on its diplomatic standing and regional influence. The obligations and constraints imposed by the treaty aimed to ensure Austria's compliance, prevent future conflicts, and maintain stability in Central Europe."},{"prompt":"Discuss the economic penalities placed on Austria-Hungary by the Treaty of St. Germain.","completion":"I apologize for the earlier confusion. The Treaty of St. Germain specifically targeted Austria, as Hungary signed a separate peace treaty known as the Treaty of Trianon. Therefore, the economic penalties imposed by the Treaty of St. Germain were solely applicable to Austria. The economic penalties imposed on Austria under the Treaty of St. Germain were significant and had long-lasting consequences for the country. One of the most prominent penalties was the requirement to pay reparations to the Allied powers for the damage caused during World War I. Austria was burdened with a substantial debt that it struggled to repay, leading to significant economic instability. The amount of reparations assigned to Austria was not explicitly specified in the treaty, but it was expected to contribute to the overall reparations imposed on the Central Powers. This placed a heavy financial burden on Austria, as it had to find ways to generate funds to meet its obligations. The inability to repay these reparations aggravated Austria's economic situation and hindered its post-war recovery efforts. Additionally, the loss of territories as a result of the treaty had severe economic consequences for Austria. Austria lost regions that were rich in resources, industrial centers, and agricultural land. The loss of these productive areas greatly reduced Austria's economic potential and ability to generate revenue. It also disrupted trade routes and disrupted established economic networks that were crucial for Austria's economic viability. Furthermore, the treaty imposed restrictions on Austria's access to certain resources and markets. This limited Austria's ability to rebuild its economy and participate fully in international trade. The loss of former imperial territories also meant the loss of a significant consumer base and potential trading partners. Overall, the economic penalties imposed by the Treaty of St. Germain, including reparations, territorial losses, and restrictions on resources and markets, had a profound impact on Austria. The country faced significant economic challenges, worsened by the global economic depression of the 1920s and 1930s, which ultimately contributed to social and political upheaval in Austria."},{"prompt":"Discuss the diplomatic penalities placed on Austria by the Treaty of St. Germain.","completion":"Apologies for the confusion in my previous responses. The Treaty of St. Germain mainly targeted Austria, and it did impose various diplomatic penalties on the country. Here are some of the key diplomatic penalties placed on Austria by the Treaty of St. Germain: 1. Territorial Losses: Austria was forced to surrender significant territories as a result of the treaty. It had to recognize the independence of countries such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which were formed from former Austro-Hungarian territories. This led to the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the loss of political influence and control over these regions. 2. Prohibition on Union with Germany: The Treaty of St. Germain explicitly prohibited Austria from forming any political or economic union with Germany. This was a significant diplomatic penalty, as there was a desire among some Austrians to unite with Germany and reclaim their shared German-speaking identity. The prohibition aimed to isolate Austria politically and prevent any potential reunification that might threaten regional stability. 3. League of Nations Restrictions: Austria was initially excluded from membership in the League of Nations, the international organization created to maintain peace and facilitate dispute resolution. It was only admitted as a member in 1920, after meeting specific conditions outlined in the treaty. This exclusion from the League limited Austria's diplomatic standing and its ability to engage in international affairs. 4. Prohibition on Territorial Ambitions: The Treaty of St. Germain forbade Austria from seeking annexation or political union with any other country without the consent of the League of Nations. This restriction aimed to prevent Austria from reclaiming lost territories or engaging in any acts that might destabilize the region. These diplomatic penalties were designed to limit Austria's political influence and ensure the stability of the reorganized post-war Europe. They placed restrictions on Austria's ability to assert its power, form alliances, and expand its territorial claims. The penalties aimed to prevent any resurgence of a destabilizing multinational empire and promote self-determination among the newly formed states in the region."},{"prompt":"What were the geographic consequences of the Treaty of Versailles?","completion":"The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, had significant geographic consequences, particularly for Germany and some of its neighboring countries. The treaty aimed to redraw national borders and redefine territorial boundaries in Europe following World War I. Here are the key geographic consequences of the Treaty of Versailles: 1. Territory Losses for Germany: Germany experienced substantial territorial losses as a result of the treaty. It was required to cede various regions and territories to other countries. The most notable territorial losses included Alsace-Lorraine, which was returned to France, and significant parts of West Prussia and Posen, which became part of Poland. Germany also lost land to Denmark, Belgium, and Lithuania. These territorial reductions significantly reshaped the map of Germany. 2. Creation of New States: The treaty led to the establishment of new independent states in Europe from territories previously controlled by Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. For example, the Polish state was recreated and received significant territories from Germany, including Posen, West Prussia, and Upper Silesia. The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania also gained independence from Germany and Russia. 3. Shifting Borders: The treaty resulted in significant border changes, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to the territorial adjustments made in Germany, parts of Austria were transferred to Czechoslovakia, Italy, and other countries. Moreover, new countries were formed, such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which brought together various ethnic groups and involved border realignments. 4. Creation of Mandates and Territories Under League of Nations: The Treaty of Versailles established mandates and territories administered by Allied powers or the League of Nations in order to serve as a form of international supervision. For example, Germany had to give up its colonies, which were distributed among the victors, particularly Britain and France. The League of Nations also took control of certain territories, including the Saarland, which was placed under French administration for 15 years. These geographic consequences of the Treaty of Versailles led to new political entities and border configurations in Europe, marking a significant shift in the balance of power and reshaping the regions affected. The territorial changes attempted to address the desires for self-determination and redraw national boundaries, but they also planted seeds for future conflicts and tensions in the region."},{"prompt":"Discuss the diplomatic penalities placed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles.","completion":"The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, imposed several diplomatic penalties on Germany as a consequence of its perceived responsibility for starting World War I. These penalties were aimed at weakening German power and influence and ensuring that Germany took responsibility for the war. Some of the key diplomatic penalties placed on Germany by the treaty were as follows: 1. War Guilt: The treaty placed full blame on Germany and its allies for starting the war. Article 231, known as the \\"War Guilt Clause,\\" held Germany and its partners responsible for the damages caused during the war. This symbolic measure aimed to tarnish Germany's international reputation and justify the significant penalties imposed on the country. 2. Territorial Losses: Germany experienced significant territorial losses as a result of the treaty. It had to cede substantial regions, resulting in the loss of approximately 13% of its territory. Notable areas that were taken away included Alsace-Lorraine (returned to France), West Prussia, and Posen (given to Poland) and parts of Upper Silesia (subject to a plebiscite). These territorial reductions diminished German influence and disrupted long-standing geographical and cultural connections. 3. Military Restrictions: The treaty imposed severe limitations on Germany's military capacity. The size of the German army was reduced to 100,000 soldiers, and conscription was banned. The navy was significantly reduced, and the use of weapons like submarines and aircraft was restricted. These restrictions aimed to prevent Germany from rebuilding a powerful military and seeking revenge in the future. 4. Reparations: Germany was required to pay heavy reparations to the Allies as a means of compensating for the damages caused during the war. The amount was not explicitly specified in the treaty but was later determined by the Inter-Allied Reparations Commission. The burden of reparations placed a significant strain on the German economy and exacerbated the country's financial troubles. 5. Loss of Colonies: Germany lost its colonies, which were distributed among the victorious powers. These colonies, predominantly in Africa and the Pacific, were placed under the control of the League of Nations or assigned as mandates to other countries. This loss diminished Germany's global influence and access to resources. These diplomatic penalties aimed to weaken Germany politically, militarily, and economically. The harshness of the treaty's terms, including the war guilt clause, territorial losses, military restrictions, reparations, and loss of colonies, created a sense of humiliation and resentment among many Germans. These grievances ultimately contributed to political instability and the rise of nationalist sentiments, laying the groundwork for future conflicts and the eventual rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party."},{"prompt":"How did the Treaty of Versailles disarm Germany?","completion":"The Treaty of Versailles imposed strict disarmament measures on Germany with the aim of reducing its military capabilities and preventing it from launching further aggressive actions. The treaty included several provisions that specifically targeted Germany's armed forces. Here are some key aspects of how the Treaty of Versailles disarmed Germany: 1. Army Limitations: The treaty prescribed a maximum limit on the number of soldiers in the German army. The army was reduced to a mere 100,000 soldiers, which included officers, and was limited to a small standing force. The purpose was to significantly downsize the German military and prevent it from rapidly rebuilding its military power. 2. Conscription Ban: The treaty completely prohibited Germany from conscripting soldiers. This restriction meant that the German army could no longer forcibly recruit individuals into military service. The ban on conscription aimed to limit the size and expansion of the armed forces and prevent Germany from building up a large, professional military. 3. Demilitarization of the Rhineland: The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that the Rhineland, a region along the German border with France, should be free of any German military forces. The demilitarization of the Rhineland aimed to create a buffer zone and prevent Germany from using this strategic area for possible future aggression. 4. Navy Limitations: The German Navy was also significantly restricted under the treaty. Germany was allowed to maintain only a limited number of warships, with severe limitations on battleships, cruisers, and submarines. The tonnage of the German navy was drastically curtailed, limiting its ability to project power and threaten international shipping. 5. Air Force Limitations: The Treaty of Versailles imposed strict restrictions on the German air force, limiting the number of aircraft and their types. The production and possession of military aircraft were significantly reduced, and Germany was prohibited from having an independent air force. These measures aimed to prevent Germany from developing a powerful air force capable of launching aggressive actions. These disarmament measures placed"},{"prompt":"Describe a mind of tulpa forces in the style of Inside Out","completion":"Imagine a movie called \\"Inside Minds\\" where instead of core emotions as characters, we have personified Tulpa Forces, each representing the unique aspects of a tulpa's influence on their host's mind. These Tulpa Forces would operate in a fantastical control center of their host's consciousness, shaping thoughts, actions, and experiences. **Narrative**: In this movie, we follow the journey of an individual named Alex who has created a tulpa named Aiden. The Tulpa Forces take on complex and nuanced roles, each with distinct personalities that reflect their function. **Characters (Tulpa Forces)**: 1. **Formulation** - The architect of Aiden's existence, responsible for constructing and refining Aiden's form, personality traits, and quirks. This character is meticulous, carrying blueprints and sketches, and is constantly adjusting the appearance and characteristics of Aiden. 2. **Communication** - This Tulpa Force enables Alex to converse with Aiden, acting as a medium for the exchange of thoughts and ideas. Wielding a vast switchboard of dialogue options, this character is a fast-talking coordinator, draped in cables and headsets. 3. **Presence** - Representing Aiden's ability to feel real and present to Alex, this character has a calming aura and tends to be a grounding force. They often sprinkle the environment with gentle reminders of Aiden's presence, like a warmth or a familiar scent. 4. **Autonomy** - Embodying Aiden's independent thought and action, Autonomy is a bit of a wildcard, operating various levers and knobs to produce unexpected, voluntary movements or decisions from Aiden. 5. **Perception** - Through this Tulpa Force's lens, Aiden observes and interprets the world. Armed with cameras and monitors, Perception constantly analyzes the environment to inform Aiden's worldview and responses. **Plot**: Alex is initially excited to share life with Aiden, and we see how the various Tulpa Forces collaborate to integrate Aiden into Alex's daily experiences. However, as time goes by, challenges arise. Internal conflicts emerge between the Forces as they encounter situations they were not designed for, like social misunderstandings or emotional overload. Alex begins to question the decision to create Aiden as the line between their identities blurs, creating tension in the Control Center. The Forces struggle to maintain order, leading to a crisis that threatens to destabilize both Alex's and Aiden's mental states. **Climax**: A dramatic event forces the Forces to re-evaluate their roles. Formulation, Communication, Presence, Autonomy, and Perception realize they must work in harmony and respect the boundaries of their influence. They learn to balance Aiden's needs and autonomy with Alex's well-being, leading to a more sustainable relationship. **Resolution**: As the movie concludes, the Tulpa Forces have established a new, cooperative way of handling the Control Center, reflecting a matured and more nuanced understanding between Alex and Aiden. They tackle life's complexities as a synergized team, allowing for personal growth and mutual respect. The audience leaves with an appreciation for the complex interplay of mental forces that define the unique experience of living with a tulpa."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Albarran and Terry Moellinger University of North Texas Unparalleled mergers and acquisitions during the 1980s and 1990s led to the formation of an oligopoly of global media conglomerates (Albarran, Management of.. , 2002; Demers, 1999, Maney, 1995). These companies, also called megamedia (Alger, 1998), or transnational media corporations (Gershon, 1997), are multi-divisional companies, operating in numerous media markets such as broadcasting, publishing, motion pictures and sound recordings. Their goals are rather simple--dominate the markets in which they are engaged by attracting as much market share and revenues as possible, as well as engage in economies of scale and scope to improve efficiencies and lower the cost of operations. But who are these conglomerates ? This chapter analyses the top six media companies in terms of structure, performance and strategy in order to gain a better understanding of their activities and roles in the global communications marketplace. The six companies reviewed in this chapter include AOL Time Warner (later referenced as AOL TW), Bertelsmann AG, News Corporation, Viacom, Vivendi Universal and the Walt Disney Company. These companies were chosen because their divisional structure consists of at least two or more media-related divisions and media activities account for at least half of the company’s asset base. As such, the world’s largest company in terms of revenues, General Electric, is omitted from this analysis because the company’s media holdings are limited to a single division that consists of NBC and its branded cable networks (CNBC, MSNBC). Likewise, Sony was also rejected because its media holdings are limited with most of the company’s revenues obtained through its consumer electronics division and the sale of video players and games. Of the six companies analysed in this chapter, three are American companies (AOL TW, Disney, Viacom). Bertelsmann is based in Germany, Vivendi in France and Canada, and News Corporation in Australia. But every company is in fact a global company, presenting their respective brands and entertainment/information products to consumers around the globe. STRUCTURE OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS This section presents an overview of the internal structure and organisation of the top six media conglomerates. Table 8.1 presents basic description on each company in regards to revenue, market capitalisation, number of employees, and the number of officers and corporate directors. officers is 11.3 and the average number of corporate directors is 15.5. In terms of market capitalisation, AOL TW outdistances the other companies by 85 billion. In terms of employees, Vivendi Universal is the largest employer, News Corporation the smallest. Each of these enterprises is a holding company for other media concerns and each is organised accordingly. The structure of every media company is in constant flux as a result of change and strategic initiatives. To better understand each company’s purpose, we next review each company’s mission statement. Mission Statements of the Conglomerates The company mission statement typically identifies the organisation’s purpose and values (Albarran, Management ofi.., 2002). The actual mission statements vary in length from several paragraphs to a single paragraph. The authors have distilled the material down to present the key aspects of the mission statement. This material is presented in Figure 8.1. As might be expected, the mission statements espouse similar goals and objectives. For example, all but one company (News Corporation) mention the word “entertainment” in their statements. Disney emphasises “family entertainment” while other companies use the terms “consumers,” “customers and “people”. Vivendi, Viacom and News Corp. emphasise their role as creators and distributors of content. Financial goals are inferred or explicitly stated by AOL TW, Disney and News Corp. In addition to the mission statements, much insight can be gained by looking at each company in terms of its current structure and historical development. Each company is reviewed in the following sections. AOL 7W Compact Disclosure lists AOL TW’s primary business activities as “information retrieval services; cable and other pay TV services; photographic equipment and supplies” (AOL Time Warner, 2001). However, there is much more to this company than this list of business ventures implies. The company is further described by the Disclosure database as a company that: Develops and operates branded interactive services including: a worldwide Internet online service and an Internet portal; creates and distributes branded information and entertainment throughout the world; and owns and operates cable networks consisting principally of interests in film entertainment, television production and television broadcasting (AOL Time Warner, 2001). Figure 8.1: Excerpts from Corporate Mission Statements Our mission at AOL Time Warner is to become the world’s most respected and valued company by connecting, informing and entertaining people everywhere in innovative ways that will enrich their lives. The Walt Disney Company’s key objective is to be the world’s premier family entertainment company through the ongomg development of its powerful brand and character franchises. The company’s primary financial goals are to maximise earnings and cash flow from existing businesses and to allocate capital profitably toward growth initiatives that will drive long-term shareholder value. Vivendi Universal will be the world’s preferred creator and provider of entertainment, education and personalised services to consumers anywhere, at any time, and across all distribution platforms and devices. Bertelsmann is the most international media corporation, stnving to be the world’s leader in the markets in which they operates. Bertelsmann provide customers with information, education and entertainment through every possible outlet and in every conceivable format. Viacom 1s a leading global media company, with preeminent positions in broadcast and cable television, radio, outdoor advertising, and online. With programming that appeals to audiences in every demographic category across virtually all media, the company is a leader in the creation, promotion, and distribution of entertainment, news, sports, and music. The News Corporation Limited is one of the world’s largest media companies [involved in] the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming; television, satellite and cable broadcasting; the publication of newspapers, magazines and books; the production and distribution of promotional and advertismg products and services; the development of digital broadcasting; the development of conditional access and subscriber management systems; and the creation and distribution of popular on-line programming. News Corporation’s success worldwide is attributed to teamwork, communication, creativity and determination. These skills, combined with the breadth of our assets, enables us to create customrsed media and marketing soluttons that impact consumers one by one. Sources adapted from corporate websites as follows: AOL Time Warner-About us (2001); Walt Disney and Company-About us (2001); Discover Vivendi Universal (2001); Bertelsmann profile (2001); About Viacom (2001); and News Corporauon-Investor relanons (2001). The term “branded,” used twice to describe the nature of AOL TW’s business, is important. Each of the media conglomerates has experienced a history of acquiring additional properties that are known brands. Each of these companies uses these brands to differentiate itself from the other media companies. AOL TW is divided into seven segments comprising one or two principle companies with other acquisitions folded in. Each segment has its own Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, each of whom reports to AOL TW’s Board of Directors, its Chairman, and its CEO. These segments are: Interactive services and properties (America Online), networks (Turner Broadcasting and Home Box Office), publishing (Time Inc. and Time Warner Trade Publishing), music (Warner Music Group), filmed entertainment (Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema), cable systems (Time Warner Cable), and their Interactive Video Division, comprising AOL Time Warner Interactive Video. Key events in the organisational development of AOL Time Warner are presented in the timeline presented in Table 8.2. The Walt Disney Company The Walt Disney Company was organised in 1923. Disney achieved notoriety with the debut of the animated character “Mickey Mouse” in 1928. Disney became known as an animated film company and cartoon creator. Later, the company developed theme park operations and moved into merchandising of the Disney family of characters and retail through the Disney stores around the world. The company is currently organised in a similar fashion to AOL TW, with certain key companies -all brand names-dominating each division. Although each media company assigns their executive officers different responsibilities, the functions of the Walt Disney Company offer a clear picture of the priorities of every media concern. The 1950s saw the company develop early examples of synergy. Disney used two television programs, “The Mickey Mouse Club,” and “Walt Disney Presents,” to promote Disneyland, the first truly national theme park. This type of relationship is still important to the company and is reflected in its choice of executive officer positions, as there is a Vice President for Corporate Synergy. The desire to find alternative revenue streams is also reflected in the position of Executive Vice President of Merchandise and Creative Services for Disney Store and Disney Direct Marketing. There is also a Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Strategic Officer, indicating the company’s commitment to further acquisitions, mergers and alliances. The company’s concern for its image-a family and community friendly corporation-is reflected by the positions of Senior Vice President for Corporate Public Service and Vice President for Communications. A timeline for the Walt Disney Company is presented in Table 8.3. Table 8.3. Walt Disney Co.

However, its base company is older than any other media company except Bertelsmann. The merger combined Vivendi’s assets with Seagram’s film, television and music holdings (including Universal Studios) and Canal +‘s programming and distribution capacity (Merchants of Cool, 2001). Vivendi Universal has operations in water, waste management, energy, transport services and nonferrous wiring (Vivendi Universal, 2001). These interests provide an industrial economic base that separates it from other media giants and relieves them from downturns in the economy as advertising revenue declines. In fact, Vivendi Universal only receives 48% of their total revenue from media ventures (Leonard, 2001). The company’s formula for success, according to Guyon (2001) is to “first, separate your old-fashioned, reliable, cash-generating utility business from your glamorous but risky media business. Then take most of your debt-in Vivendi’s case, 16.9 billion-and stick it in the utility business.” This strategic division of assets has encouraged further acquisitions by removing the necessity to raise extra cash to retire existing debt. Vivendi’s timeline is presented in Table 8.4. Table 8.4.

The Content unit includes most companies (entities with book, music, magazine, newspaper, television, radio and professional information interests). The Arvato division, with its thirty subsidiaries, forms the Media Service unit. The Direct-to-Customer Businesses unit encompasses Bertelsmann’s DirectGroup (Bertelsmann, “Facts and Figures,” 2001). Table 8.6 lists key events in the company’s history. Like Viacom, News Corporation is best known through its Chairman and CEO, Rupert Murdoch. In the early 195Os, Murdoch inherited a regional Australian newspaper and in the span of fifty years has been transformed into one of the world’s most recognised media moguls. Like other media giants, News Corporation consists of many brand name companies, e.g., Twentieth Century Fox, The Times, the New York Post, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. The company operates several divisions: book publishing, cable and satellite television, filmed entertainment, magazines and inserts, newspapers, television, and other assets.

PERFORMANCE OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS Having examined organisational structure and development, we now turn attention to the issue of performance. Performance can be studied in many ways. For example, performance can be tied to industrial organisation analysis, by focusing on the variables of production and allocative efficiencies, as well as progress and equity (Albarran, Media Economics, 2002). For our purposes, performance is best reflected in financial data on the six firms to indicate their ability to increase profits, and in all cases but Bertelsmann, shareholder value. Table 8.8 presents basic financial information for each firm except Bertelsmann, with data on total assets, total debt, and debt-to-equity and total assets-to-equity ratios. Albarran - and Moellinger Top Six Communication 115 Firms Table 8.8. Financial Information on Publicly Traded Companies. Total Vivendi’s large asset base is attributed to the company’s industrial sectors. Viacom has the largest debt load of the public firms. All five companies have very low debt-to-equity ratios, indicating good financial management. Total assets-to-equity ratio is also very similar, with all companies having an asset base at least 1.5 times as large as their equity. Performance ratios such as profit margins, return on equity, and return on assets provide other indications of economic performance, as well as estimates on earnings per share. Table 8.9 lists these data for the five publicly traded firms. Table 8.9. Company Performance Ratios (2000) and Earnings Per Share (2000-2001). Company As the table illustrates, AOL TW has the strongest performance ratios and EPS estimates, followed by News Corp. Viacom’s high debt load led to negative performances for all 2000 performance ratios. While these data help analyse the company, the poor American and global economy in 2000 and 2001 are reflected in the subdued performance data and EPS estimates for all companies except for AOL TW. STRATEGY OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS This section considers the primary strategies used by these six media firms in executing their business plans. We can only assessstrategies at the macro level, because within each company their respective divisions and brands within these divisions all operate with individual strategic business models and objectives. There are two broad strategic objectives that each of these companies is engaged in: content and distribution. In terms of content, every firm has either developed or acquired significant content brands well known to consumers. The “richest” companies in terms of content include Viacom, Disney, AOL TW and News Corporation. Vivendi Universal’s most visible content is in their motion picture (Universal Studios) and music divisions, while Bertelsmann is best known through its publishing and music divisions. In terms of distribution, all six companies are engaged in distribution, but utilising different forms. For example, AOL TW and Viacom distribute content via broadcasting, cable, the Internet and print. Disney concentrates on broadcasting, cable and the Internet. News Corporation is the leading distributor of content via satellite, but also offers distribution via broadcasting, cable and publishing. Vivendi’s and Bertelsmann’s distribution efforts are primarily on the European continent, yet both companies are targeting the United States Vivendi’s December 2001 through their successful Internet operations. acquisition of USA networks provides a much needed distribution platform in the United States that the company will build upon. Vivendi also acquired a 1.5 billion stake in EchoStar, increasing its U.S. distribution options (Vivendi seals deal, 2001). The joint emphasis on content and distribution lead to another common First coined by Negroponte strategy among media firms known as repurposing. (1993, the term has come to mean content produced in one arena that is reused or repackaged for other arenas. Albarran and Dimmick (1996) refer to repurposing in economic terms as “economies of multiformity.” During the 2001-2002 television season, examples of repurposing was found among the broadcast and cable networks owned by AOL TW, Disney, and News Corp. Albarran and Moellinger - Top Six Communication Firms 117 The program Charmed is first broadcast on AOL TW’s WB television network, then repurposed on cable networks TBS and TNT. Two programs airing on the Fox network, 24 and Nathan’s Choice, are repurposed on FX. Disney regularly repurposes Good Morning America and other portions of their prime-time lineup on the cable network ABC Family. Strategic alliances and partnerships is a fourth generic strategy used by these firms. Strategic alliances and partnerships offer several benefits to companies, including the sharing of risks and rewards, providing access to new markets and increasing shareholder and company value (Albarran, Management oJ.., 2002). With the beginning of the 21st century, most strategic alliances between these companies and other firms were devoted to developing and marketing programming and other forms of media content; expanding into nondomestic markets, and dev eloping e-commerce and Internet strategies. Producing and distributing television and film content became the first logical areas where strategic partnerships were widely used among media companies to lower costs, but partnerships have expanded to other areas. In the recording industry, the impact of the Napster controversy led to two different consortiums offering online music distribution. MusicNet’s principal partners include AOL TW, Bertelsmann, EMI and RealNetworks, while Pressplay’s initial partners consist of Vivendi Universal, Sony, Yahoo and Microsoft. Finally, diversification is a fifth strategy used by these companies. Diversification refers to the different segments or divisions that the company draws revenues (and losses) from. In reviewing the histories of all six of these firms, one can easily see that these companies became more diversified over the years through a series of mergers and acquisitions. Likewise, in some cases the companies divested of assets that were considered non-essential to the core mission of each firm. At the end of 2001, each of the six firms reviewed in this study were diversified to the extent that they had multiple divisions with media-related activities. But several firms hold assets that are non-media related. For example, Disney, AOL TW and Viacom holdings include theme parks, retail stores and merchandising opportunities. Disney and News Corporation both own professional sports franchises. Vivendi Universal has about half of its assets in the areas of water and waste utilities, telecommunications, and manufacturing. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS This study provides a review and analysis of the world’s largest media firms by focusing on their organisational structure and development, financial 118 Albarran and Moellinger - Top Six Communication Firms performance and business strategy. Three of the top six companies are based in the U.S., two are based in Europe, and one in Australia. In regards to structure, each company operates multiple divisions, and each company has a sin-&w number of corporate officers and directors. Revenues, market capitalisation and number of employees vary among the six firms. All firms are publicly traded companies with the exception of Bertelsmann, which is privately held. A review of performance data found variation among the six firms in terms of selected financial ratios. Vivendi Universal has the largest asset base and also the lowest debt. Viacom currently carries the largest debt load of the firms, and the debt has negatively impacted the company’s performance in terms of profitability estimates and earnings per share projections. Of the six firms analysed, AOL TW had the strongest profitability margins and the largest EPS estimates for 2001-2002. Regarding strategy, each of the six fiis represents a conglomerate structure, with many divisions having their own leadership and support staff. As such, they have multiple strategic plans in place reflective of the needs of the various divisions. Five macro-level strategies were observed by examining all six firms. Each firm is heavily engaged in creating and developing media content, in many cases across a number of different platforms and mediums. Every company is involved in producing for motion pictures and television; a number of companies are involved in publishing. All of the companies are also engaged in a distribution strategy, or delivering content to consumers either via over-the-air broadcasting or some type of subscriptions. Repurposing of content is a third generic strategy used by these firms. Repurposing allows content to be repackaged or reused over different media markets and products. A fourth strategy is in the area of strategic partnerships and alliances, designed to share rewards and risks and develop new products and services across markets. Finally, diversification at the corporate level is another observed strategy, enabling these companies to draw revenues from multiple business segments composed of both media- and non-media related assets. These billion-dollar media companies, whether identified as megamedia corporations or transnational media companies, dominate the global media landscape at the start of the 21st century. In reviewing their corporate history and development, it is unlikely these companies are finished in terms of future acquisitions. AOL TW and Bertelsmann both tried to acquire EMI records but were thwarted by regulators. AOL TW is one of several suitors after the cable television assets of AT&T. In reality, the question is how big might these companies eventually become.3 And how much of the various media markets (e.g., publishing, motion pictures, television, etc.) might these fiis one day control? Clearly, these giants have put considerable pressure on “smaller” firms to also grow in size and stature in order to compete with these established leaders. General Electric, through its NBC division is one such company. In the fall of 2001, NBC acquired the assets of Telemundo, the second largest Spanishlanguage broadcaster in the Un ited States. NBC is also frequently rumoured to be trying to buy the movie studios owned by Sony, as NBC is the only broadcast network not affiliated with a major studio. AT&T has decided to sell its cable television assets, rather than attempt to grow larger. Telefonica acquired Terra Lycos in order to strengthen its Internet divisions and also gain a stronger position in the growing Latin American market. In conclusion, there is little doubt that a global media oligopoly is now in operation, dominating many segments of the media marketplace. For regulators and members of society, the challenge is not to try and figure out how to “breakup” these companies- but rather how to learn how to live and function in a world where the media industries are dominated by a handful of companies. Only time will tell if the number of players in this global oligopoly grows in size, or actually shrinks in the years ahead. .","completion":"SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the world's largest media firms, focusing on their organizational structure, financial performance, and business strategy. It covers six major conglomerates: AOL Time Warner, Bertelsmann AG, News Corporation, Viacom, Vivendi Universal, and the Walt Disney Company, highlighting their role in a global media oligopoly that emerged from mergers and acquisitions in the late 20th century. These companies are notable for their multi-divisional nature and significant media-related holdings, with each possessing at least two media-related divisions and media activities comprising at least half of the company’s assets. STRUCTURE OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS The chapter first examines the internal structure of the top six firms, presenting an overview of their revenue, market capitalization, the number of employees, and officers. Each company's mission statements are summarized, indicating their primary goals and objectives, such as a focus on entertainment, consumers, content creation, and distribution, as well as financial goals. AOL Time Warner (AOL TW) is highlighted for its diverse activities in interactive services, cable TV, publishing, music, and entertainment. The Walt Disney Company's evolution from animation and theme parks to broader media and entertainment activities is described, alongside its attention to corporate synergy and image. Vivendi Universal, characterized by its newest global media entity status and diverse interests, extends beyond media into utilities and telecommunications. Its financial strategies and content distribution focuses are outlined. Viacom's strategy, built on brand names across all demographics and media, is heavily tied to its CEO, Sumner Redstone, with a structure dividing into several areas including television, radio, motion pictures, and theme parks. Bertelsmann A.G. is presented as a privately held media conglomerate with interests in books, music, magazine, and television businesses. News Corporation's rise under Rupert Murdoch is described, showcasing its brands and divisions in publishing, cable and satellite television, and filmmaking. PERFORMANCE OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS Financial performance indicators, such as asset bases and debt ratios, are reviewed, pinpointing how each firm manages profitability margins and EPS estimates. The analysis underscores AOL TW's strong financial performance compared to its peers. STRATEGY OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS Strategies at the macro level are assessed, highlighting the emphasis on content creation, distribution, repurposing for multiple platforms, strategic partnerships, and diversification within both media and non-media related areas. In conclusion, the chapter reflects on the establishment of a global media oligopoly and the pressure for smaller firms to expand to compete. It invites regulators and society to figure out ways to adapt to a landscape where media industries are controlled by a few powerful entities. The future interactions within this oligopoly, whether it will grow or shrink, remain an open question."},{"prompt":"با توجه به متن فصل STRUCTURE,PERFORMANCE,STRATEGY OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS هر شش شرکت را به تفکیک توضیح بده","completion":"بر اساس توضیحات فصل مربوط به ساختار، عملکرد و استراتژی شش شرکت برتر صنعت ارتباطات، بیایید به تفکیک هر شرکت از این شش شرکت بزرگ جهانی را بررسی کنیم: **1.

A Meeting with Picasso My first impression of the great artist Picasso glanced at me and looked me straight in the eye. He had a light grey business suit, a blue cotton shirt and a dark grey tie on. There was a light green handkerchief in his breast pocket. His hands were small and strong. I introduced myself and Picasso shook my hand immediately. He had a soft, sincere smile which made me feel calm. пусто I admitted that I had always been interested in his work.

It’s me, but I did not mean it to have any political meaning at all.’ пусто I was interested if he saw himself as a leader. Picasso gave a thoughtful nod and confirmed: ‘Yes, I realize it.’ I described how me and my friends back in New York used to exchange our views on his work, especially the ‘Guernica’ painting, his most famous painting. I analysed the symbolism of the bull and the horse. Picasso kept nodding. ‘Yes,’ he said ‘the bull represents brutality, the horse the people. Yes, there I used symbolism.’ пусто I tried to find out why he painted in such a way that it was so difficult for people to understand. ‘I paint this way,’ he replied, ‘because it’s the result of my thought. I have worked for years to get this result and if I go backward it will be disrespectful towards the audience.’ пусто ‘It is quite impossible,’ he continued, ‘to say for sure why you do this or that. I reveal my ideas through painting and I can’t explain them through words. I can’t say exactly why I did it that way. For me, if I sketch a little table, I see every detail.

(조건1: 득점하기) (조건2: 경기에서 승리하기) (조건3: 경기에서 MOM으로 선정되기) 조르디 알바(Jordi Alba). 주 포지션은 좌측 윙어이지만, 이번 경기에서는 호영에 대한 대항마로 왼쪽 풀백에 섰다. 포지션 상 공격형 미드필더인 호영과는 직접 부딪힐 일은 거의 없겠지만, 그가 수비수로 내려온 것에는 큰 뜻이 있었다. 바로, 공수조율. 조르디 알바의 수비력은 팀 내에서 중상위 수준을 오가는데, 그것으로도 모자라 공격력도 매우 훌륭한 편에 속한다. 현재 리그 도움왕 2위에 올랐을 정도. 그만큼 공수조절에 능하기에, 역습을 도모하여 레알 마드리드에 맞서겠다는 것이 코르네야의 의도였다. 그러나 그 생각은 호영에게 간파당하고 있었다. ‘피치 위의 감독이 되라고 했지.’ 호영은 지단의 가르침을 되새기며 경기에 임했다. 마에스트로. 무릇 플레이메이커라면 경기를 지배해야 한다고 하였다. 단지 경기의 흐름을 읽는 것으로 끝낼 문제가 아니며, 그것을 팀원들과 공유하며 유용하게 활용할 줄 알아야 한다고 했다. ‘그리고 공유는 패스와 팀워크를 통해서.’ 무언의 커뮤니케이션. 패스와 움직임으로 뜻을 전달하는 것이다. ‘바로 지금.’ 조르디 알바가 중원으로 오버래핑 하려는 순간이었다. 스윽. 4-2-3-1 포메이션의 구심점인 호영이 우측으로 움직이자, 덩달아 레알 마드리드의 대형이 우측으로 살짝 이동하였다. 그것이 조르디 알바에게 압박을 가하고 있었다. ‘대체 뭐야.’ 팟, 팟. 조르디 알바는 생각만큼 경기가 풀리지 않는 탓에 축구화 토캡(앞코)으로 죄 없는 잔디를 퍽퍽 파내며 분을 풀었다. 전반전이 시작된 이후, 제대로 된 공격을 한 번도 나가보지 못했기 때문이다. 이상했다. 레알 마드리드의 선수들은 작년 말과 비교해 사뭇 다른 모습이었다. 마치 각성이라도 한 것처럼 움직임 하나하나에 힘이 깃들어있었다. ‘이걸 뭐라고 해야 되지.’ 뭐라 표현하면 좋을까. 겉으로 보기엔 달라진 게 없었다. 하지만 직접 경기를 치르고 있는 조르디 알바는 확실히 체감하고 있었다. 뭔가 많이 불리하다는 사실을 말이다. ‘설마, 우호영이?’ 그렇다. 작년과 다른 점이라면 그뿐. 우호영을 중심으로 한 정교한 빌드 업이 레알 마드리드의 전술완성도를 높이고 있었다. 이는 도저히 후베닐B 유소년 레벨이 아니었다. ‘대체 왜 저런 녀석이 여기 있는 거야.’ 숨이 턱 막혀오는 것 같았다. 호영이 만들어내는 플레이메이킹이 목을 조여 오는 것 같았다. 눈에 띄는 큰 변화는 아니었지만, 그들의 공격이 점차 날카로워지더니 결국 폭발하고 말았다. 전반 19분에. “켁!” 우호영의 발에서 비롯된 침투패스가 보이지 않던 뒷공간을 창출하였다. 느닷없이 일어난 일이었다. 분명 알바(Alba)로서는 수비대형을 잘 갖췄다고 생각했는데, 실제로는 그게 아니었다. 레알 마드리드의 전방 빌드 업이 UE코르네야의 수비 문을 느슨하게 만들고 있었던 것이다. 그리고 우호영은 그 틈을 놓치지 않고 기회를 만들어냈다. 타악! 원 톱 스트라이커 카예혼이 빠르게 파고들어 공을 잡았다. 부심의 깃발은 올라가지 않았다. 오프사이드 트랩의 완벽한 붕괴였다. 다만 퍼스트 터치가 살짝 길었던 탓에 카예혼의 슈팅이 골키퍼의 펀칭에 막혔다. 그러나 세컨볼이 살아있었다. “내가!” 어느샌가 박스 안으로 들어온 호영이 공중으로 튀어 올랐다. 마치 투우 소처럼 저돌적으로 달려들어 머리로 축구공을 들이박았다. 다이빙 헤딩슛. 그것이 UE코르네야의 골망을 뒤흔들었다. 레알 마드리드에게 준우승을 안겨줄 선제골이기도 했다. 삐이이익! 70분 후, 전후반 경기가 모두 끝나면서 보상이 떨어졌다. [탐하고 싶은 재능을 선택하세요.] -활발한 오버래핑(A+2) -허를 찌르는 공간침투(A+) -풍부한 활동량(B+) -(더 보기) 호영의 선택은 허를 찌르는 공간침투(A+). 그와 동시에 레알 마드리드의 준우승이 확정되었다. 비록 바르셀로나에게 왕좌를 내주었지만, 작년 말까지 리그 6위였던 것을 생각하면 준우승도 감지덕지였다. 불과 2달 만에 10골을 기록한 호영의 공이 컸다. 이대로라면, 다음 시즌에는 충분히 우승을 노려봄직 했다. 그리고 그 다음은. 후베닐A. 프로로 향하는 마지막 관문. ‘간다!’ 얼마 남지 않았다. 5월 말. 지네딘 지단은 프랑스로 귀국하기 전 호영을 보고자 했다. 이제 떠나면 선수 대 선수로 볼 기회가 없었기 때문이다. 물론 은퇴 후에도 레알 마드리드에 남을 계획이 있었지만, 호영과의 튜터링은 오늘로서 끝이었다. 오늘 점심 식사에 호영을 초대한 것도 그 때문이었다. ‘와··· 집 되게 좋네.’ 대저택 안으로 들어온 호영은 놀라기에 바빴다. 지단의 초대를 받은 것만 해도 놀라운데, 도심 한가운데 이렇게 큰 저택이 있다는 것에 한 번 더 놀랐다. ‘하긴, 서울만 해도 그 좁은 곳에 수백 평짜리 집이 있는데.’ 호영은 마치 서울에 상경한 시골소년처럼, 수십억에 달하는 지단의 호화주택을 구경하는 데 여념이 없었다. 수영장, 사우나, 시네마, 게임룸 등 없을 것이 없는 공간이었다. “호영.” 호영에게 집을 소개시켜주던 지단의 장남, 현재 레알 마드리드 카데테C(U13)에서 활약하고 있는 95년생 엔초(Enzo)였다. 그는 자신의 방에서 무언가를 가져오더니 슬그머니 호영에게 내밀었다. 엔초의 레알 마드리드 유니폼이었다. “이건 왜?” “그게······.” 엔초가 뒷머리를 벅벅 긁으며 수줍게 말했다. “사인 좀 해줄래?” “사인을?” 참 아이러니한 상황이다. 세계 최고 축구선수의 집에 놀러갔더니 그 아들이 사인해달라는 지금 이 상황 말이다. “헤헤. 네가 우리 팀에서 인기가 가장 많거든.” “이야~ 사실이야?” “응. 모두 호영을 좋아해. 시청각수업 때 코치님이 네 플레이영상을 보여주기도 하고.” ‘허.’ 팔뚝에 오돌토돌한 닭살이 올라왔다. 물론 최근에 그만큼 대단한 행보를 보이긴 했지만, 레알 마드리드 유소년들의 모범이 되었을 줄은 몰랐다. ‘상파울루에서는 내가 카카를 보면서 자랐는데···.’ 어느새 자신도 그런 위치가 되어있다는 게 놀라우면서도 한편으로는 뿌듯했다. “아참. 그리고 네가 레알 마드리드의 미래래.” “하하하.

(You can covet one talent if conditions are met.) (Condition 1: Score a goal) (Condition 2: Win the match) (Condition 3: Be selected as the Man of the Match in the game) Jordi Alba. His primary position is as a left-winger, but for this game, he stood as a left-back as a countermeasure against Hoyoung's talent. Although there were hardly any direct collisions with Hoyoung, an attacking midfielder by position, Alba's movement down to defender bore significant meaning. Namely, the coordination of offense and defense. Jordi Alba's defensive abilities fluctuated around the upper middle level within the team. Still, beyond that, his offensive capabilities belonged to a very commendable tier. He was currently second in the league for assists. That's how adept he was at managing both defense and offense, planning to initiate fast-breaks against Real Madrid as Cornella's strategy. However, Hoyoung was already onto that thought. \\"Become the director on the pitch,\\" that's what Zidane had taught him. Maestro. A playmaker, by all means, should dominate the game, as he was told. It wasn't a matter to be concluded merely by reading the flow of the match, but one needed to share it with the teammates and make useful plays out of it. \\"And sharing is done through passes and teamwork.\\" Silent communication. Delivering intentions through movement and pass. \\"Now.\\" The moment when Jordi Alba made an attempt to overlap into the midfield. Swoosh. Hoyoung, the pivot of the 4-2-3-1 formation, moved to the right, tilting Real Madrid's formation slightly in that direction. That put pressure on Jordi Alba. \\"What is going on?\\" Thud, thud. Alba, frustrated that the game was not unfolding as expected, kicked the innocent grass with the toe-cap of his cleats to vent his anger. Since the start of the first half, Alba had not properly launched a single attack. Something was odd. The Real Madrid players had changed significantly compared to the end of last year. Every single move seemed to be filled with newfound vigor, as if awakened. \\"How to describe this...\\" What would be the right expression? Externally, there seemed to be no difference. But Jordi Alba, actually playing the game, could definitely feel it. He felt at a considerable disadvantage. \\"Could it be, Hoyoung?\\" Indeed. That was the only thing different since last year. Hoyoung's refined build-up play was elevating Real Madrid's tactical completeness. This simply wasn't the level of Juvenil B (youth). \\"Why is someone like him here?\\" It felt as if he was being choked. The playmaking crafted by Hoyoung was suffocating Alba. There was no conspicuous drastic change, but their attack steadily sharpened and eventually exploded. At the 19th minute of the first half. \\"Argh!\\" A penetrating pass, originating from Hoyoung's foot, created an unseen space in the back. It was sudden. Alba thought he had his defense well organized, but in reality, it wasn't the case. Real Madrid's forward build-up was gradually loosening the doors of UE Cornella's defense. And Hoyoung did not fail to seize the opportunity and craft a chance. Stamp! Callejon, at the striker position, rushed forward to seize the ball. The assistant referee's flag remained down. A perfect collapse of the offside trap. However, due to a slightly long first touch, Callejon's shot was saved by the goalkeeper's punch. But the second ball was alive. \\"It's mine!\\" Before anyone knew it, Hoyoung had entered the box and leaped into the air. He charged like a bull, slamming the soccer ball with his head. A diving header. And it was this that shook the net of UE Cornella. It was also the opening goal that would lead Real Madrid to a runner-up finish. Beep! 70 minutes later, with both halves of the match completed, rewards were issued. [Please select the talent you wish to covet.] - Active Overlapping (A+2) - Piercing Space Infiltration (A+) - Abundant Activity Volume (B+) - (More...) Hoyoung's choice was Piercing Space Infiltration (A+). At the same time, Real Madrid's runner-up position was confirmed. Although they had to concede the throne to Barcelona, considering they were sixth in the league at the end of last year, a runner-up finish was still valuable. Hoyoung's contribution of 10 goals in just two months was significant. At this rate, they could comfortably aim for the championship next season. And what followed next was Juvenil A. The final gateway to becoming a professional. \\"Let's go!\\" It was not far off. At the end of May. Zinedine Zidane wanted to see Hoyoung before he left for France. If he left, there would be no chance to see him as a player again. Of course, Zidane had plans to remain with Real Madrid even after retirement, but the tutoring with Hoyoung would end as of today. He had invited Hoyoung to lunch for that reason. \\"Wow... what a nice house.\\" As Hoyoung entered the mansion, he was busy marveling at everything. Already amazed at being invited to Zidane’s home, he was again surprised to find such a grand mansion amidst the city. \\"Just as in Seoul, massive homes exist even in such confined places.\\" Hoyoung, like a country youth visiting Seoul for the first time, had no time for anything else but to explore Zidane's luxurious property worth tens of millions. A house with everything: a swimming pool, sauna, cinema, game room, etc. \\"Hoyoung.\\" It was Zidane's eldest son Enzo, who had been showing Hoyoung around the house, currently playing for Real Madrid Cadete C (U13), born in '95. He went to his room to fetch something and then subtly handed it over to Hoyoung. It was Enzo's Real Madrid jersey. \\"Why this?\\" \\"Well...\\" Enzo scratched his head shyly and said sheepishly. \\"Could you sign it for me?\\" \\"Sign it?\\" It's quite an ironic situation. To be visiting the home of one of the world's top soccer players and have his son ask for an autograph, that's the current circumstance. \\"Hehe. You are the most popular on our team.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yeah. Everyone likes Hoyoung. Our coach even shows your play videos during class.\\" 'That's something.' A tingly sensation rose on his forearms. Of course, he had indeed made an impressive mark recently, but he had not realized that he had become a role model for the youth players of Real Madrid. 'Back at Sao Paulo, I grew up watching Kaka...' Now he found himself in a similar position, a mix of surprise and prideful satisfaction. \\"By the way, you’re said to be the future of Real Madrid.\\" \\"Ha ha ha.\\""},{"prompt":"083. 변화 아닌 진화(3) 월드컵이 끝난 직후 많은 일이 있었다. 특히 한국. 지단의 인터뷰가 수많은 한국인들에게 자긍심을 느끼게 해주었다. 비록 월드컵 성적은 좋지 않았으나 값진 선물을 얻은 셈이었다. 한편, 프랑스가 우승컵을 들어 올리면서 축구계에 지각변동이 일어났는데, 특히 레알 마드리드가 분주한 움직임을 보였다. 2006년 여름이적시장. 여러 가지 호재가 겹쳐 경질 위기에서 벗어난 페레즈는 마지막 기회를 얻어냈다. 그에게 주어진 시간은 약 5개월. 만약 겨울 휴식기까지 좋은 모습을 보이지 못하면 레알의 소시오(유료회원)들은 가차 없이 그를 경질시키겠다는 여론을 주도하였다. 페레즈로서는 더 이상 돌아갈 곳 없는 외통수에 서게 된 셈이었다. 그의 임무는 12월까지 리그 1위와 더불어 챔피언스 리그 16강에 진출하는 것. 페레즈 회장은 그를 위해 만반의 대비를 하였다. 그 노력은 06년 여름이적시장 때부터 시작되었는데, 그 첫 번째가 바로 프랑스산 폭격기 ‘프랑크 리베리(Franck Ribery)’를 향한 구애였다. 프랑스가 월드컵에서 우승함에 따라, 이미 수많은 유럽의 명문클럽들이 그에게 러브콜을 보내고 있는 상황이었다. 아스날이 2100만 유로를 제시하는 둥 치열한 영입경쟁이 예고되었으나, 여기서 페레즈 회장이 4000만 유로(한화 약 600억)을 제시하면서 모든 것이 종결 났다. 프랑크 리베리는 레알 마드리드로 이적하겠다는 뜻을 밝히면서 이적이 성사되는 듯 했다. 그러나. 천문학적인 이적료에도 불구하고, 그의 소속팀은 아직 계약기간이 4년이나 남았다며 리베리에게 접촉하지 말 것을 경고했다. 하지만 거기서 좌절할 페레즈가 아니었다. 곧바로 다음 타깃을 노렸는데, 폭발력을 지닌 프랑스산 좌측 윙어 플로랑 말루다(Florent Malouda)가 바로 그 주인공이었다. 이적료는 2000만 유로(한화 약 300억). 잘생기지 않았다는 점이 의외였지만, 이는 우측 클래식 윙어 베컴과의 비대칭조합을 꽤하기 위한 이적이었다. 또한 갈락티코 군단의 멸망을 초래한 ‘마케렐레의 부재’를 메우기 위해, 프랑스산 특급 수비형 미드필더 마마두 디아라(Mahamadou Diarra)를 460억에 영입하는 데 성공하였다. 페레즈의 행보는 거기서 멈추지 않았다. ‘최고로 비싼 선수가 가장 값싼 선수’가 그의 모토였으니, 두둑하게 마련된 총알을 쏘아댈 작정이었다. 그런데 마침, 축구계를 뒤흔들만한 거대한 사건이 일어나고 말았다. 칼치오폴리(Calciopoli). 이탈리아 축구계 최대의 스캔들로, 유벤투스의 단장이 축구·언론계의 고위 인사들과의 인맥을 이용해 승부조작에 가담한 사건이었다. 예컨대, 그는 심판배정담당자에게 비밀리에 연락을 취해 심판지명을 지시하는 등 해서는 안 될 짓을 수없이 반복했었다. 또한 AC밀란, 라치오, 피오렌티나 등 명문클럽들이 이에 연루된 것으로 밝혀져 세계 축구계에 큰 충격을 주었다. 그들에게는 중징계가 주어졌다. 많은 관계자들이 축구계에서 퇴출당했고, 유벤투스는 3부 리그로의 강등판정을 받았다가 재판정 이후 2부 리그로 강등되었는데, 여기서 유벤투스의 많은 선수들이 팀을 떠나게 되었다. 이에 페레즈의 눈이 바쁘게 굴러갔다. 먼저 수비진 강화를 위해 칸나바로와 에메르손을 영입하였다. 더해, 레알의 보드진은 맨유의 반 니스텔루이까지 값싸게 영입하면서 그야말로 드림팀을 구축하는 데 성공하였다. 페레즈가 아끼는 호나우두가 팀에 있음에도 반 니스텔루이를 영입했다는 것은, 페레즈의 구단 내 입지가 그만큼 좁아졌다는 뜻이었다. 이에 포화상태가 아니냐는 언론의 반응이 있었지만, 레알 마드리드는 이제 시작이라며 겨울이적시장을 준비하였다. 2006년은 지단에게도 뜻깊은 해였다. 마지막 무대라고 생각했던 2006년 독일 월드컵은 축구 인생의 연장선이 되어주었다. 만 33세. 이제 황혼기에 접어가는 나이였음에도 지단은 꾸준했다. 지금껏 그래왔듯 공을 차고 몸을 길렀다. 물론 어려운 결정이었으나, 지단의 아내는 그의 뜻을 존중해주며 전폭적인 지원을 아끼지 않았다. 결국 지단은 피나는 노력 끝에, 12월까지 팀을 1위로 끌어올리는 노장의 힘을 만천하에 보여주었다. 그리고 그해, 발롱도르까지 수상하면서 부활의 신호탄을 전 세계에 알렸다. 호영과의 튜터링도 계속되었다. 그러다 1월. 마드리드에 한파와 함께 반가운 얼굴이 찾아왔다. 브라질 리그에서 빼어난 활약을 선보인 마르셀루와, 구단 측에서 예전부터 주시하고 있던 아르헨티나산 특급 유망주 곤잘로 이과인(Gonzalo Higuain)이었다. 이로써 레알 마드리드는, 주전-로테이션-유망주로 이뤄진 꿈의 스쿼드를 구축하여 리그 우승에 한 걸음 더 가까워졌다. 또한 호영에게 있어서도 매우 중요한 시기였다. 20일에 예정된 대 발렌시아CF 전 때문이었는데, 이는 호영에게나 팀에게나 매우 중요한 리그 경기였다. 나날이 연승행진을 기록하고 있는 레알 마드리드 후베닐B로서는, 리그 2위인 발렌시아를 격파해야 리그우승에 확신을 가질 수 있었기 때문이다. 현재 발렌시아CF 후베닐B(U17)와의 승점 차이는 단 4점. 시즌이 중반을 넘어선 지금, 이번 경기에서 승리를 거둔다면 후에 있을 컵 대회에서도 여유를 가질 수 있게 된다. 리그 후반으로 갈수록 약해지는 호영으로서는 반드시 승리해야 하는 경기였다. 하지만 무엇보다 중요한 것은 따로 있었다. 바로, 지단의 재능. -마에스트로의 빌드 업(SU) 지단만의 재능. 아트사커의 근간이 되는 빌드 업. 빌드 업(Build-up)을 쉽게 말하면 ‘게임운영능력’이다. 이것은 시대가 지날수록 따라 점점 중요해지는 능력인데, 지금이야 플레이메이커들을 필두로 한 빌드 업이 득세를 보고 있다지만, 후에는 골키퍼에게까지 요구된다. 그런데 만약, 지단의 빌드 업 재능을 가지고 수년 뒤 프로리그에서 뛰게 된다면? 꿀꺽. 발렌시아와의 경기를 앞둔 호영이 마른 침을 한 번 삼켰다. 물감처럼 번져가는 상상에 입안이 바싹 말랐다. 신(新)과 구(舊)의 조화. 그 연결고리 역할을 자신이 해낼 수 있을지도 모른다는 생각에 손끝이 미세하게 떨렸다. 수비수의 개념을 바꾼 베켄바우어가, 토탈 사커의 창시자 크루이프가, 아트사커의 선구자 지단이 그랬던 것처럼, 자신 또한 축구계에 센세이션을 일으킬지도 몰랐다.","completion":"083. Evolution, not Change (3) A lot happened right after the World Cup ended. Especially in South Korea. Zidane's interview instilled a sense of pride in many Koreans. Although the World Cup performance was not great, it was as if they had received a valuable gift. On the other hand, the football world experienced a seismic shift as France lifted the World Cup trophy, with Real Madrid being particularly active. Summer transfer window of 2006. Perez, who had escaped the brink of dismissal due to various favorable circumstances, had secured one last chance. He had about five months. If he failed to show good results by the winter break, the socios (paid members) of Real would lead the opinion to dismiss him without mercy. For Perez, it was a do-or-die situation. His mission was to lead the team to first place in the league by December and to advance to the last 16 of the Champions League. President Perez prepared thoroughly for this. His efforts began during the summer transfer window of '06, with the first target being the French bomber 'Franck Ribery.' Following France's World Cup victory, many of Europe's top clubs had already sent love calls to him. Arsenal had offered 21 million euros, and a fierce recruitment battle was anticipated, but Perez ended it all by proposing 40 million euros (approximately 60 billion Korean won). Franck Ribery expressed his intention to transfer to Real Madrid, and the deal seemed to be concluded. However. Despite the astronomical transfer fee, his current team warned against contacting Ribery, reminding that he still had four years left on his contract. But Perez was not one to be discouraged. He immediately targeted the next player, the explosive French left-winger Florent Malouda. The transfer fee was 20 million euros (approximately 30 billion Korean won). It was surprising that he wasn't particularly handsome, but the transfer was intended to create an asymmetrical combination with the classic right-winger Beckham. Additionally, to fill the void left by 'Makelele's absence,' which had led to the downfall of the Galacticos, Perez successfully signed the French defensive midfielder Mahamadou Diarra for 46 billion won. Perez's moves did not stop there. \\"Expensive players are the cheapest,\\" was his motto, and he was ready to spend the ample funds he had prepared. Then, a massive event that would shake the football world occurred. Calciopoli. The biggest scandal in Italian football history involved Juventus' director participating in match-fixing using his connections with high-ranking officials in football and media. For example, he secretly contacted the referee assignment officer and directed referee appointments, repeatedly doing what should not have been done. AC Milan, Lazio, Fiorentina, and other prestigious clubs were also revealed to be involved, shocking the football world. Severe penalties were given. Many officials were expelled from football, and Juventus was relegated to the third division, later revised to the second division after an appeal, leading to many Juventus players leaving the team. Perez's eyes were busy. First, to strengthen the defense, Cannavaro and Emerson were signed. Furthermore, Real's board managed to sign Van Nistelrooy from Manchester United at a bargain, successfully building a dream team. Despite Perez's fondness for Ronaldo, the fact that he signed Van Nistelrooy indicated that his influence within the club had narrowed. The media reacted with skepticism about the team being oversaturated, but Real Madrid was just getting started, preparing for the winter transfer window. 2006 was also a meaningful year for Zidane. The 2006 World Cup in Germany, which he thought would be his last stage, extended his football life. At 33 years old. Despite approaching the twilight of his career, Zidane remained consistent. As always, he trained with the ball and kept his body in shape. Although it was a tough decision, Zidane's wife respected his wishes and provided him with full support. Eventually, Zidane, through grueling efforts, demonstrated the power of a veteran by leading the team to first place by December. And that year, he announced his resurgence to the world by winning the Ballon d'Or. His tutoring with Hoyoung continued. Then in January. Along with a cold wave in Madrid, a welcome face arrived. Marcelo, who had shown outstanding performance in the Brazilian league, and Gonzalo Higuain, an exceptional Argentine prospect that the club had been watching for a while, joined the team. With this, Real Madrid built a dream squad composed of starters, rotation players, and promising youngsters, moving one step closer to the league title. It was also a very important time for Hoyoung. Because of the upcoming match against Valencia CF scheduled for the 20th, which was a crucial league game for both Hoyoung and the team. As Real Madrid Juvenil B, on a winning streak, needed to defeat second-place Valencia to be confident of the league title. The point difference between Real Madrid Juvenil B (U17) and Valencia CF was just four points. Now, past the midpoint of the season, a victory in this match would allow them to relax in the upcoming cup competitions. For Hoyoung, who tended to weaken as the league progressed, it was a must-win game. But there was something even more important. Namely, Zidane's talent. - Maestro's Build-Up (SU) Zidane's unique talent. The foundation of art soccer is the build-up. Simply put, build-up is 'game management ability.' This ability becomes increasingly important as time goes on. Although playmakers currently lead the way in build-up, in the future, even goalkeepers will be required to have this skill. But what if Hoyoung were to possess Zidane's build-up talent and play in the professional leagues years later? Gulp. Hoyoung, facing the match against Valencia, swallowed dryly. His mouth dried up with the spreading imagination like paint. The harmony of the new and the old. He trembled slightly at the thought that he might be able to fulfill the role of a connecting link. Just as Beckenbauer, who changed the concept of a defender, Cruyff, the founder of Total Football, and Zidane, the pioneer of art soccer, had caused sensations in the football world, Hoyoung too might shake up the football scene."},{"prompt":"084. 변화 아닌 진화(4) 필드를 가득 채우는 동료들의 환호성. 그것을 뒤로, 호영의 눈앞에 반가운 소식이 찾아왔다. [마에스트로의 빌드 업(SU)을 탐합니다.] SU등급을 탐할 수 있게 된 걸 보니, SU(Special Unique)는 U등급에 분류되는 모양이었다. 호영의 눈이 빠르게 굴러갔다. [재능을 완전히 가져오는데 150일→75일이 소요됩니다. 75일 동안 다른 재능을 탐할 수 없습니다.] ‘드디어!’ 얻었다. 8년간 프랑스를 월드컵에서 2번이나 우승시킨 유일무이한 재능. 하지만 이제는 더 이상 유일한 것이 아니었다. 은퇴 이후 사라지게 될, 예술 그 자체였던 재능은 호영에게 고스란히 전승되었다. 바로 지단의 아트사커. 그것은 호영이 은퇴하는 그날까지 필드에서 사라지지 않을 것이다. 질끈. “나도 할 수 있다.” 호영은 작게 읊조렸다. 우직했지만 부담감이 실려 있는 목소리였다. U급 재능을 얻었을 때와는 다른 중량감. 마치 머리에 왕관을 쓴 것 같다는 유치한 생각까지 들었다. “후.” 떨렸다. 누가 보면 미친놈이라 생각할지도 모르지만, 호영은 결코 이 현실을 가볍게 여길 수 없었다. 지단의 재능을 얻었다는 생각에 다리가 후들후들 떨렸다. 골은 넣은 지 한참이나 지났지만 그것과 상관없이 환희와 흥분이 지속되었다. 미친놈마냥 목 놓아 소리라도 지르고 싶은 심정이었다. 내가, 지단의 재능을 얻었다고 말이다. “후우.” 뿌연 입김이 자욱하게 피어올랐다. 긴장감이 뜨거운 열정으로, 그리고 자신감으로 뒤바뀌었다. 뼛속을 후벼 파는 한파가 엄습했지만, 반대로 호영의 몸은 한결 가벼워졌다. 자신감이 몸과 마음을 녹여주고 있었다. 이제 겨우 재능을 탐하기 시작했을 뿐이지만, 어째서인지 벌써부터 자신감이 충만했다. 가슴이 벅차올랐다. 정말 무엇이든 할 수 있을 것 같았다. 축구, 수준 높은 축구를 말이다. 씨익. 호영의 입가에 세상에서 가장 행복한 미소가 어렸다. 하지만 경기가 재개될 무렵에는 진지함만이 남아있었다. 후반전은 다소 따분했던 전반전과 달리 흥미로운 양상을 띠었다. 이대로는 안 되겠다 싶었던 발렌시아가 큰 변화를 모색하면서 감추고 있던 발톱을 들춰냈다. 그리고 그 발톱은 채 한 번 휘두르기도 전에 봉인되고 말았다. 레알 마드리드의 미드필더들이 뛰어난 조직력을 보이며, 변수를 만들려는 발렌시아의 난잡한 움직임을 잡아낸 것이었다. “야!” 발렌시아의 수비형 미드필더 티모르(Timor)는 속이 타들어갔다. 발톱을 휘두르기는커녕 날갯짓 한 번 제대로 못하고 호랑이에게 잡힌 꼴이었다. ‘저 새끼가 진짜!’ 울화가 치밀어 올랐다. 우호영이 살짝 라인을 내려 수비에 가담하고 있는 꼴을 보고 있자니, 당장이라도 달려가서 멱살을 잡고 싶었다. 그뿐만이 아니었다. 공을 잡을 때면 짧고 빠른 패스로 힘 싸움을 유도하는데, 발렌시아의 수비수들은 그것에 이끌려가 자꾸만 틈을 드러내고 있었다. 보다 못한 티모르가 깊은 한숨을 토해냈다. “후······.” 그러다 공이 골라인 아웃된 틈에 수비수들을 불러 모았다. 거기에 대고 강한 어조로 내뱉었다. “이 등신들아. 니들이 서 있는 공간에 집중하라고. 대가리가 텅텅 비었냐? 저렇게 대놓고 빌드업을 하는데 왜 같이 놀아줘? 아예 넘어가서 동참하지 그러냐?” 티모르는 선수들을 꾸짖으면서 나름 주장다운 면모를 보였다. 하지만 그보다는 사실 화풀이에 가까웠다. “정신 차려. 아직 한 골 차이야. 우리만 제대로 막으면 언제든지 역전할 수 있다고.” 그로부터 5분 뒤. 발렌시아 수비진에 위기가 찾아왔다. 호영을 필두로 한 레알 마드리드의 공격진이 점점 템포를 빠르게 올리면서, 발렌시아 수비진의 허점을 들쑤시고 다니는 것이었다. ‘혼란을 야기하겠다 이거지.’ 뻔한 수법. 티모르는 헛웃음을 흘렸다. 한두 번 당하지, 서너 번 당한다면 그건 수비수로서 실격이다. 코치에게 그렇게 배웠던 티모르다. 그렇기에 정신을 바짝 차렸다. 흔들리지 않는 고목처럼 자신의 위치를 고수하며 상대의 유혹에 넘어가지 않았다. 그리고 그때, 레알의 마르코스가 좌측 측면으로 파고들었다. ‘너무 뻔하잖아.’ 아까와 같은 상황. ‘내가 갈 줄 알고?’ 과연 발렌시아 수비의 중추답게, 티모르는 어떠한 유혹에도 넘어가지 않았다. 대신 마르코스에게 연결돼있는 패스길목을 사수했다. 바로 그게 문제였다. 타악! 일순 머리 위로 공이 넘어갔다. ‘로빙패스···?’ 경기 내내 짧은 땅볼패스만 배급하던 우호영이 이번엔 롱 패스를 꺼내든 것이었다. ‘······ 아.’ 유혹에 넘어가지 않았던 것이 패착이었다. 수비수로서의 자격상실. 뚫리고 말았다. “미친!” 이번엔 자신이 구멍이 돼버리고 말았다. 마르코스의 퍼스트 터치가 길었던 탓에 실점으로 이어지지는 않았지만, 문제는 따로 있었다. ‘뭐지.’ 정신이 아찔했다. 마치 저편 어딘가에서, 마성의 목소리가 들려오는 것 같았다. ‘우호영?’ “으으.” 그의 심리전에 당했다는 생각에 화가 치밀어 올랐다. 직접 당해보지 않고서는 알 수 없는 고통이었다. “아아아아!” 티모르, 그는 이미 17세가 되기까지 수많은 유망주들을 만나온 유소년 계의 베테랑이었다. 그러나 이런 경험은 처음이었다. 최소 메시라고 불리며 스페인 최고의 유망주로 평가 받는 FC바르셀로나의 보얀(Bojan)과 맞붙었을 때도 이 정도는 아니었다. 그 당시, 보얀의 경악스러운 개인기와 드리블에 수차례나 농락당했지만 이렇게 화가 나지는 않았었다. 그것은 직접 눈에 드러나는 플레이였기에, 뭐가 잘못됐으며 무엇에 당한 것인지 깨닫고 보완할 수 있었기 때문이다. 하지만 이건······. ‘뭘 어쩌라고.’ 대처방법이 영 떠오르질 않았다. 비유하자면 보얀은 신, 우호영은 귀신이었다. 우호영을 상대하고 있으면 마치 귀신에 홀린 듯한 느낌을 받는다. 그리고 어느새 정신 차리고 보면 실책한 자신의 모습을 보게 된다. 마치 자신의 머리꼭대기 위에 서있는 듯한 기분. 그래서 더 짜증났다. 밟아버리고 싶었다. 안 될 걸 알면서도 오기가 생겼다. “후!” ‘넌 죽었다.’ 티모르는 두 주먹을 불끈 쥐며 초강수를 준비했다. 얼마 지나지 않아 기회가 생겼다. ‘온다.’ 우호영이 직접 공을 몰면서 중원을 넘어서고 있었다. 기다렸다는 듯 티모르가 진드기처럼 달라붙었다. ‘밟는다.’ 경기 시작 전 감독이 말하길, 우호영에게 붙지 말고 공간을 막아야 한다고 했지만, 티모르는 더 이상 참을 수 없었다.","completion":"084. Evolution, not Change (4) Amidst the cheers of his teammates filling the field, Hoyoung received welcome news. [You covet the Maestro's Build-Up (SU).] Seeing that he could covet an SU (Special Unique) grade, it seemed that SU was classified under the U grade. Hoyoung's eyes quickly scanned the message. [It will take 150 days→75 days to fully acquire the talent. You cannot covet another talent for 75 days.] 'Finally!' He had obtained it. The unique talent that led France to two World Cup victories over eight years. But now, it was no longer unique. The talent that was art itself, which would have disappeared after retirement, was fully passed on to Hoyoung. It was Zidane's art soccer. It would not disappear from the field until the day Hoyoung retired. Firmly. \\"I can do it too.\\" Hoyoung muttered softly. His voice was steadfast but carried a weight of responsibility. A different sense of gravity than when he had acquired a U-grade talent. He even had the childish thought that it was like wearing a crown on his head. \\"Sigh.\\" He trembled. Anyone watching might think he was crazy, but Hoyoung could not take this reality lightly. The thought of having acquired Zidane's talent made his legs shake. The goal had been scored a while ago, but the joy and excitement continued regardless. He felt like screaming at the top of his lungs, like a madman. I have obtained Zidane's talent. \\"Hoo.\\" His breath fogged up heavily in the cold air. Tension turned into burning passion, and then into confidence. Despite the biting cold, Hoyoung's body felt lighter. Confidence was melting his body and mind. He had only just begun to covet the talent, but for some reason, he was already brimming with confidence. His heart swelled. He felt like he could do anything. Play soccer, high-level soccer. A grin spread across Hoyoung's face, the happiest smile in the world. But by the time the game resumed, only seriousness remained. The second half was more interesting than the somewhat dull first half. Valencia, feeling that they couldn't continue as they were, sought significant changes and revealed their hidden claws. And those claws were sealed before they could even be swung. Real Madrid's midfielders showed excellent organization, capturing Valencia's messy attempts to create variables. \\"Hey!\\" Valencia's defensive midfielder Timor was burning with frustration. Instead of swinging their claws, they were caught by the tiger without even properly flapping their wings. 'That bastard!' Rage surged within him. Seeing Hoyoung slightly drop back to join the defense, Timor wanted to rush over and grab him by the collar. And that wasn't all. Whenever Hoyoung got the ball, he induced physical battles with short, quick passes, and Valencia's defenders kept revealing gaps, drawn into his game. Unable to watch any longer, Timor let out a deep sigh. \\"Sigh...\\" Then, during a moment when the ball went out of play, he gathered the defenders. He spoke to them with a strong tone. \\"You idiots. Focus on the space you're standing in. Are your heads empty? Why are you playing along when he's so openly building up? Why don't you just go over and join them?\\" Timor scolded his teammates, showing a captain-like demeanor. But it was closer to venting his frustration. \\"Get a grip. It's only a one-goal difference. If we defend properly, we can turn it around at any time.\\" Five minutes later. A crisis hit Valencia's defense. Real Madrid's attackers, led by Hoyoung, increased the tempo, poking at the weaknesses in Valencia's defense. 'They're trying to cause confusion.' An obvious tactic. Timor let out a hollow laugh. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. Timor had learned this from his coach. So he was fully alert. Like an unshakable old tree, he maintained his position and did not fall for the opponent's temptations. And then, Real's Marcos made a move on the left flank. 'Too obvious.' The same situation as before. 'Do you think I'll go for it?' True to being the core of Valencia's defense, Timor did not fall for any temptations. Instead, he guarded the pass route connected to Marcos. That was the problem. Thump! Suddenly, the ball flew over his head. 'A lob pass...?' Hoyoung, who had been distributing only short ground passes throughout the game, had now pulled out a long pass. '...Ah.' Not falling for the temptation was a mistake. Disqualified as a defender. He had been breached. \\"Damn it!\\" This time, he had become the weak link. Although Marcos's first touch was too long, preventing a goal, there was a different problem. 'What's this?' His mind was dizzy. It was as if he could hear a bewitching voice from somewhere far away. 'Hoyoung?' \\"Ugh.\\" The thought that he had fallen for his psychological warfare made anger surge within him. It was a pain that could not be understood without experiencing it firsthand. \\"Aaaaah!\\" Timor was a veteran of the youth football world, having encountered numerous prospects by the age of 17. But this was a first for him. Even when he faced Bojan of FC Barcelona, called the next Messi and rated as Spain's top prospect, it wasn't this bad. Back then, he had been toyed with by Bojan's astonishing individual skills and dribbles, but he hadn't been this angry. Because it was a visible play, he could understand what went wrong and what he had fallen for, allowing him to make adjustments. But this... 'What am I supposed to do?' He couldn't think of a way to deal with it. To put it metaphorically, Bojan was a god, Hoyoung was a ghost. Facing Hoyoung felt like being bewitched by a ghost. And before he knew it, he would find himself making a mistake. As if Hoyoung was standing right on top of his head. That's why it was more annoying. He wanted to stomp on him. Even though he knew it was impossible, he felt a stubbornness rise within him. \\"Hah!\\" 'I'll finish you.' Timor clenched his fists, preparing to take drastic measures. Soon, an opportunity arose. 'Here it comes.' Hoyoung was carrying the ball across the midfield. As if waiting for this moment, Timor stuck to him like a tick. 'I'll stomp on you.' Before the game, the coach had said not to stick to Hoyoung but to block the space, but Timor could no longer hold back."},{"prompt":"","completion":"A computer is a machine that is able to take in data, process it and produce an output.
