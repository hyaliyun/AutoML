By substituting (x = x_0) into the functional equation, we get: [ (y+1) f(x_0) + f(x_0 f(y) + f(x_0 + y)) = y ] Rearranging gives: [ f(x_0 f(y) + f(x_0 + y)) = y - (y+1) f(x_0) = y (1 - f(x_0)) - f(x_0) ] This equation shows that for any (y in mathbb{R}), the left-hand side can be adjusted to hit any value by choosing appropriate (y). Therefore, (f) is surjective (because the right-hand side of the above equation is a linear function of (y), and a non-constant linear function is surjective on (mathbb{R})). **Step 2: Show injectivity of (f).** Since (f) is surjective, there exists some (a) such that (f(a) = 0). Now, by substituting (x = 0) and (y = a) into the functional equation: [ (a+1) f(0) + f(f(0) + f(a)) = a ] Since (f(a) = 0), it simplifies to: [ (a+1) f(0) + f(f(0)) = a ] Examining the above reveals that (f(0) neq 1), otherwise: [ (a+1) cdot 1 + f(1) = a implies a + 1 + f(1) = a implies f(1) = -1 ] Thus, if (f(0) = 1), we would get a contradiction as if: [ y(1 - f(0)) - f(0) = y(1-1) - 1 = -1 text{ for all } y, ] which makes (f) not well-defined everywhere. To show injectivity, substitute (x = 0) in the equation to get: [ (y+1) f(0) + f(f(y)) = y ] Simplifies to: [ f(f(y)) = y(1 - f(0)) - f(0) ] Suppose (f(u) = f(v)), then: [ u (1 - f(0)) - f(0) = f(f(u)) = f(f(v)) = v (1 - f(0)) - f(0) ] Which simplifies to: [ (u - v) (1 - f(0)) = 0 ] Since (f(0) neq 1), it must be that (u = v). Therefore, (f) is injective. 2. **Find all functions (f) satisfying the equation.** We now know that (f) is bijective. Use the surjectivity previously established to find (f(0)) such that (f(a) = 0). Substitute (x = a) and (y = 0) in the original equation. If (f(a) = 0): [ (0+1) f(a) + f(a f(0) + f(a)) = 0 implies f(a f(0)) = 0 ] Since (f) is injective and (f(a) = 0), it implies (a f(0) = a), meaning either (a neq 0) which simplifies (f(0) = 1) contradicts above or (a = 0) Thus: [ x = 0 implies f(0) = 0. ] Substitute back (f(0)) into simplified functional equation: [ f(f(y)) = y (1-0) - 0 = y ] Thus proving, (f(f(x)) = x).

The key idea is that if we avoid using the digit '2' in the base 3 representation, we can avoid having three numbers in an arithmetic progression. 3. **Claim:** If we put any three consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence with a positive difference in base 3, there will be at least one occurrence of each digit 0, 1, and 2 in all of these numbers. 4. **Verification of the Claim:** - Let the first term be (a) and the common difference be (d). - Consider three terms: (a), (a+d), and (a+2d). - If (d) is not a multiple of 3, then the final digits of these numbers in base 3 will cycle through 0, 1, and 2. - If (d) is a multiple of 3, then (a), (a+d), and (a+2d) will not be distinct. 5. **Constructing the Sequence:** - We construct a sequence of numbers that only contains the digits 0 and 1 in their base 3 representation. - This ensures that no three numbers in the sequence can form an arithmetic progression. 6. **Counting the Numbers:** - The number of such numbers is equivalent to the number of binary numbers with up to 11 digits (since (3^{11} > 10^5)). - The number of binary numbers with up to 11 digits is (2^{11} = 2048). 7. **Ensuring the Sequence Length:** - We need 1983 numbers, and we have 2048 possible numbers, which is sufficient. 8. **Largest Number in the Sequence:** - The largest number in this sequence is the base 10 representation of (11110111111_3). - Converting (11110111111_3) to base 10: [ 1 cdot 3^{10} + 1 cdot 3^9 + 1 cdot 3^8 + 1 cdot 3^7 + 0 cdot 3^6 + 1 cdot 3^5 + 1 cdot 3^4 + 1 cdot 3^3 + 1 cdot 3^2 + 1 cdot 3^1 + 1 cdot 3^0 ] [ = 59049 + 19683 + 6561 + 2187 + 243 + 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 87844 ] 9. **Conclusion:** - Since 87844 is less than (10^5), and we can choose 1983 numbers from this sequence, it is possible to choose 1983 distinct positive integers, all less than or equal to (10^5), such that no three of them form an arithmetic progression.

However, the driver cannot distinguish unlit bulbs and the traffic light's frame. Therefore, if only one bulb is lit, it is impossible to determine which of the six bulbs it is. How many different signals from the Martian traffic light can the rover driver distinguish in the fog? If none of the bulbs are lit, the driver cannot see the traffic light.","completion":"**Step 1:** Determine the Nature of the Problem An analysis of the Marsian traffic light signals is needed.

We'll break down the solution in a series of logical steps, including detailed calculation and reasoning. 1. **Perimeter of a Rectangle**: Let's recall that the perimeter ( P ) of a rectangle with sides ( a ) and ( b ) is given by the formula: [ P = 2a + 2b = 2(a + b) ] For a given perimeter ( P ), the equation simplifies to: [ a + b = frac{P}{2} ] Hence, ( P ) must be an even number for ( a ) and ( b ) to be integers. 2. **Counting Possible Rectangles**: For a given even ( P ), since ( a ) and ( b ) must be positive integers, we can denote ( k = frac{P}{2} ). Thus, we are now solving: [ a + b = k ] where both ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers. The pairs ((a, b)) are directly linked to the number of ways we can partition ( k ) into two positive integers. The solution combinations ((a,b)) are: - ((1, k-1)) - ((2, k-2)) - ((3, k-3)) - (ldots) - ((k-1, 1)) Since rectangular pairs ((a, b)) and ((b, a)) are considered identical, each unique pair should be counted only once. Therefore, the total number of unique pairs equals (leftlfloor frac{k-1}{2} rightrfloor). 3. **Maximizing the Count:** To maximize the count of unique rectangles, we need to maximize (leftlfloor frac{k-1}{2} rightrfloor). This is effectively maximizing ( k = frac{P}{2} ) as ( P ) increases, provided ( P leq 97 ) (since neither player can choose a number greater than 97).

Now, let ellipse C have its foci on the yaxis, with the center at the origin. A light ray emitted from the lower focus F_{1} of the ellipse reflects off the elliptical mirror surface to the upper focus F_{2}. The total length of this light ray is 4, and the maximum area of the triangle formed by the reflection point and the focus is sqrt{3}.

If so, find this point; if not, explain why.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Standard Equation of Ellipse C Given that the ellipse C has its foci on the y-axis and the center at the origin, we can write its standard equation as frac{y^2}{a^2} + frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1 where a > b > 0. 1. **Total Length of Light Ray**: The total length of the light ray reflecting between the foci is 2a. Given that this length is 4, we have 2a = 4 Rightarrow a = 2. 2. **Maximum Area of Triangle**: The maximum area of the triangle formed by the reflection point and the foci is given when the reflection point is at the vertex of the minor axis. This area is frac{1}{2} cdot 2c cdot b = bc, which equals sqrt{3}. 3. **Relation Between a, b, and c**: We know that a^2 = b^2 + c^2. Given that a = 2, we substitute and solve for b and c considering the area bc = sqrt{3}. 4. **Eccentricity Condition**: The eccentricity e < frac{sqrt{2}}{2} implies a specific relationship between a, b, and c, but with a = 2, b = sqrt{3}, and c = 1, this condition is satisfied. Therefore, the standard equation of ellipse C is boxed{frac{y^2}{4} + frac{x^2}{3} = 1}. Part 2: Intersection of Lines BM and AN 1. **Equation of Line AB**: Assuming the equation of line AB is y = kx + 1. 2. **Solving the System of Equations**: Solving the system left{begin{array}{l}frac{y^2}{4} + frac{x^2}{3} = 1, y = kx + 1,end{array}right., we eliminate y to get (3k^2 + 4)x^2 + 6kx - 9 = 0. 3. **Discriminant Delta**: Calculating the discriminant, Delta = (6k)^2 + 36(3k^2 + 4) = 144k^2 + 144 > 0, ensures that the equation has real solutions, meaning line AB intersects the ellipse at two points. 4. **Coordinates of A and B**: For points A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2), we have {x_1} + {x_2} = frac{-6k}{3k^2 + 4} and {x_1}{x_2} = frac{-9}{3k^2 + 4}. 5. **Intersection Point on the y-axis**: By symmetry, lines BM and AN must intersect at a point on the y-axis. 6. **Equation of Line BM**: Deriving the equation for line BM and setting x = 0, we find y = 4 + frac{4x_1(4 - y_2)}{x_2y_1 - 4x_1} = 4left(1 + frac{3x_1 - kx_1x_2}{x_2 - 4x_1 + kx_1x_2}right) = frac{4(x_2 - x_1)}{x_2 - 4x_1 + frac{3}{2}(x_1 + x_2)} = frac{8}{5}. 7. **Conclusion**: Since the calculation shows that both lines BM and AN pass through the point (0, frac{8}{5}), we conclude that they intersect at this point.

When these numbers are divided by M, the remainder is crucial. - When dividing 10^k by M, the remainder can be at most 220 digits long (since M has 221 digits). Hence, the remainder will be a number of the form (10^k mod M ). - Note that there are only 221 possible remainders, since each remainder can be a number between 0 and M-1. - Therefore, there are only 221 distinct values that (10^k mod M ) can take. 3. **Consider ( N ) formed by any natural number with at most 1988 ones**: Let N be a natural number such that its decimal representation consists of only 0s and a maximum of 1988 ones. - We represent N as: [ N = sum_{i=0}^{1987} a_i 10^{k_i} ] where a_i in {0, 1} and k_i are the powers of ten corresponding to each digit. - Since N can be written using at most 1988 terms each of which is 10^{k_i}, and there's only a limited number of distinct remainders ( 10^{k_i} mod M ) can take (at most 221), from the pigeonhole principle, it follows that some remainders must repeat. 4. **Transform Repeated Remainders**: If a certain power 10^n occurs more than 10 times in the representation of N, we can replace ten such occurrences with a higher power. - For example, if 10^n appears more than 10 times, replace every 10 of them with 10^{n+1}. - Continue this process for all repeated powers in N. 5. **Final Sum of Unique Powers of 10**: After all such replacements: - The final form of N will have unique powers of 10 up to 10^{218} at most (since there are only 1988 ones). 6. **Determine the final conclusion**: Because 9 times 221 = 1989, which is greater than the number of digits (1988) in our problem, it follows from all previous transformations and reductions, we must have some number (N) with the needed constraints that is still not divisible by (M). # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Существует}} ]"},{"prompt":"A train travels from Albany to Syracuse, a distance of 120 miles, at an average rate.

The lines connecting any two grid points will have slopes that are rational. As a result, the tangents of angles formed by these lines with the coordinate axes are also rational numbers. 3. **Rational Tangents of Internal Angles**: Consider any equilateral triangle ( ABC ).

At each step we choose one of the weights that has not yet been placed on the balance, and place it on either the left pan or the right pan, until all of the weights have been placed.

We need to place these weights on the balance such that the right pan is never heavier than the left pan. We denote ( s_k ) as the number of ways to place ( k ) weights satisfying the condition. 2. **Establish the recurrence relation:** The key idea is to consider the placement of the largest weight ( 2^{n-1} ). Suppose we place ( 2^{n-1} ) after ( k ) other weights have been placed. The remaining ( n-1 ) weights can be freely distributed among the pans. - There are ( binom{n-1}{k} ) ways to choose which ( k ) weights are placed before ( 2^{n-1} ). - The number of ways to place these ( k ) weights is ( s_k ). - After placing ( 2^{n-1} ), there are ( (n-k-1)! cdot 2^{n-k-1} ) ways to place the remaining weights. Therefore, the recurrence relation is: [ s_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} binom{n-1}{k} s_k 2^{n-k-1} ] 3. **Simplify the recurrence relation:** Notice that: [ binom{n-1}{k} = frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!} ] Thus, the recurrence relation becomes: [ s_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!} s_k 2^{n-k-1} ] 4. **Transform the recurrence relation:** Multiply both sides by ( 2n ): [ 2n s_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{n!}{k!(n-1-k)!} s_k 2^{n-k} ] Notice that the right-hand side is similar to the expression for ( s_{n+1} ): [ s_{n+1} = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} s_k 2^{n-k} ] By comparing terms, we get: [ s_{n+1} = 2n s_n + s_n = (2n+1) s_n ] 5. **Solve the recurrence relation:** The recurrence relation ( s_{n+1} = (2n+1) s_n ) can be solved by recognizing it as a product of odd numbers: [ s_n = (2n-1)!! ] where ( (2n-1)!! ) denotes the double factorial of ( 2n-1 ).

We'll determine the number of pips on the face down when the die reaches the shaded triangle. 1. **Initial Conditions**: - The die starts with the face showing 4 pips face down covering the triangle marked with 4 pips. 2. **Die Roll Analysis**: - The die can roll about an edge without slipping, which means one face rotates to be face down while maintaining a fixed vertex. 3. **Fixed Vertex Rolling**: - When the die rolls while keeping one vertex fixed, it sequentially places each of the three adjacent faces face down in succession. This behavior is cyclic as the die rolls around the hexagonal pattern, revisiting faces in the same order. 4. **Hexagonal Pattern**: - Consider a hexagon composed of six triangles around a central triangle, showing the possible face orientations: 1. Roll once, face 1 down. 2. Roll again, face 2 down. 3. Roll again, face 3 down. 4. Rolls around the vertex showing faces in the same cyclical order. 5. **Extending to the Triangular Grid**: - The grid's overall pattern can be extended indefinitely, meaning the face-down orientation repeats predictably for each triangle within the grid. - Since rolling is symmetric and cyclic around vertices, any triangle corresponds uniquely to a specific orientation. 6. **Move to the Shaded Triangle**: - By analyzing the cyclic nature, every triangle encountered while rolling relates to the initial triangle through symmetry: rolled once, twice, and so forth get unique but predictable face orientations. - Regardless of route, reaching the specific shaded triangle implies a consistent orientation given by its position in the hexagonal pattern. 7. **Face Orientation in Shaded Triangle**: - The die started with face 4 down → Roll once face 1 down → Roll again face 2 down. - Persisting this pattern through steps, the shaded triangle consistently ends with face 1 down due to the predictable cyclic order. **Conclusion**: The face of the die resting in the shaded corner of the triangular grid holds 1 pip down, regardless of the path taken through the grid.

Each spy occupies one cell and has a specific line of sight: - They can see 2 cells directly in front of them. - They can see 1 cell to their left and right peripherally. 2. **Objective:** Place 18 spies on the board so that none of them can see another. This involves strategic positioning to ensure their lines of sight don't overlap. 3. **Placement Strategy:** One effective way to arrange the spies is in a pattern that ensures their lines of sight do not intersect with each other. In this case, we use a repeating pattern where the spies are oriented differently, covering the grid sufficiently. 4. **Illustration of the Placement:** Here we denote the spies' positions and their directions as arrows to illustrate which way they are facing. These directions help in understanding that their lines of sight do not overlap. The 6 times 6 board can be represented as follows (S represents a spy, the arrow direction indicates the direction they are looking): [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} hline S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - hline - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow hline S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - hline - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow hline S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - hline - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow & - & S uparrow hline end{array} ] 5. **Explanation of Positioning:** - The spies are arranged in a checkerboard pattern. - Every spy faces in the direction marked by an arrow. - By placing them in this alternating pattern, we ensure that no spy can see another spy in front, to the left, or to the right of them. 6. **Verification:** - Each S uparrow can see 2 cells ahead (which are empty). - Each S uparrow can see 1 cell to the left and the right peripherally (which are either empty or on the edge of the board).

Given f(x+1) + g(2-x) = 1, and using the symmetry property of g(x), we can substitute g(2-x) with g(x) to get f(x+1) + g(x) = 1. 3. We are also given that f(x) - g(x) = 1.

To find the area of the triangle formed by the tangent line and the coordinate axes, it is sufficient to find the intercepts of the tangent line on the axes. Therefore, we first use the derivative to find the value of the derivative function at x=- frac{pi}{2}, and then use the geometric meaning of the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line. Finally, we find the equation of the tangent line, thus solving the problem.

Let's prove the stated properties for vectors in a three-dimensional space, focusing on maintaining the properties of vector operations as established for plane vectors: a) **Commutativity and Associativity of Vector Addition, Associativity of Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar, and Distributive Laws for Multiplication of a Vector by a Sum of Scalars and Sum of Vectors by a Scalar.** These can be proven in the same way as for plane vectors since these facts pertain to only two vectors which can be considered as vectors lying in an appropriate plane parallel to our vectors. **Commutativity of Addition:** Let vec{a} and vec{b} be any two vectors. We need to show that: vec{a} + vec{b} = vec{b} + vec{a} By definition of vector addition, this is evident as addition is commutative: (a_1, a_2, a_3) + (b_1, b_2, b_3) = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, a_3 + b_3) = (b_1 + a_1, b_2 + a_2, b_3 + a_3) = (b_1, b_2, b_3) + (a_1, a_2, a_3) **Associativity of Addition:** Consider three vectors vec{a}, vec{b}, and vec{c}. We need to show: (vec{a} + vec{b}) + vec{c} = vec{a} + (vec{b} + vec{c}) Using the definition of vector addition: ((a_1, a_2, a_3) + (b_1, b_2, b_3)) + (c_1, c_2, c_3) = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, a_3 + b_3) + (c_1, c_2, c_3) = (a_1 + b_1 + c_1, a_2 + b_2 + c_2, a_3 + b_3 + c_3) And: (a_1, a_2, a_3) + ((b_1, b_2, b_3) + (c_1, c_2, c_3)) = (a_1, a_2, a_3) + (b_1 + c_1, b_2 + c_2, b_3 + c_3) = (a_1 + b_1 + c_1, a_2 + b_2 + c_2, a_3 + b_3 + c_3) Thus, associativity is shown. **Associativity of Scalar Multiplication:** Let k and m be scalars, and vec{a} be a vector. Then: k(mvec{a}) = (km)vec{a} **Distributive Property for Multiplication of Vectors and Scalars:** For scalars k and m and vectors vec{a} and vec{b}, we have: k(vec{a} + vec{b}) = kvec{a} + kvec{b} and (k + m)vec{a} = kvec{a} + mvec{a} 2. **Associativity in addition also transfers without change, since it reduces to checking the relationship (overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{AB}) + overrightarrow{BC} = overrightarrow{OA} + (overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{BC}) , which is obvious.** 3. **Distributive Property for Scalar Multiplication of the Sum of Vectors:** Let overrightarrow{OA} = vec{a}, overrightarrow{OB} = vec{b}, and overrightarrow{OM} = vec{m} (see Figure 78). Suppose overrightarrow{OC} = vec{c} = vec{a} + vec{b}. We need to prove that: vec{m} cdot vec{a} + vec{m} cdot vec{b} = vec{m} cdot vec{c} Consider the parallelogram MAMB', where: overrightarrow{AM} = overrightarrow{MB'} = vec{m} - vec{a}, quad overrightarrow{BM} = overrightarrow{MB} = vec{m} - vec{b}, quad overrightarrow{AB} = vec{b} - vec{a} overrightarrow{MM'} = overrightarrow{OM} - overrightarrow{OM'} = vec{m} - (vec{c} - vec{m}) = 2vec{m} - vec{c} 4. **Using the fact that the sum of the squares of the parallelograms' diagonals equals the sum of the squares of its sides:** 2(vec{m} - vec{a})^2 + 2(vec{m} - vec{b})^2 = (vec{a} - vec{b})^2 + (2vec{m} - vec{c})^2 5. **Expanding and simplifying:** 4m^2 + 2a^2 + 2b^2 - 4vec{m}vec{a} - 4vec{m}vec{b} = a^2 + b^2 - 2vec{a}vec{b} + 4m^2 + c^2 - 4vec{m}vec{c} a^2 + b^2 + 2vec{a}vec{b} - 4vec{m}vec{a} - 4vec{m}vec{b} = c^2 - 4vec{m}vec{c} 6. **Using c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2vec{a}vec{b} (cosine theorem):** -4vec{m}vec{a} - 4vec{m}vec{b} = -4vec{m}vec{c} Therefore, we have: vec{m}vec{a} + vec{m}vec{b} = vec{m}cdot(vec{a} + vec{b}) boxed{} Concluding that scalar multiplication and vector operations retain all their properties when extended to three-dimensional space."},{"prompt":"Find a quadratic with rational coefficients and a leading coefficient of x^2 that has sqrt{5}3 as a root.","completion":"Given that one root of the quadratic is sqrt{5}-3, the other root, due to the requirement for rational coefficients, must be its conjugate -sqrt{5}-3.

Consider a point (t, e^{t}) on the curve f(x)=e^x. The derivative of f(x), denoted as f'(x), equals e^x. Thus, the slope of the tangent at any point on f(x) is e^t. 2. The equation of the tangent line at (t, e^{t}) can be derived from the point-slope form of a line, y-y_1=m(x-x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line. Substituting m=e^t and (x_1, y_1)=(t, e^t), we get: [y-e^{t}=e^{t}(x-t)] Simplifying, we obtain: [y=e^{t}x+(1-t)e^{t}]① 3. For the curve g(x)=ln x+2, its derivative g'(x) equals frac{1}{x}.

Since frac{a_1}{1}=1, it implies that the sequence left{frac{a_n}{n}right} is constant. Therefore, frac{a_n}{n}=1, leading to a_{n}=n. - **Condition ②**: Given 2S_n=n^2+n, We derive S_n=frac{n^2}{2}+frac{n}{2}. For n=1, a_1=S_1=1.

Now, we can find λ_{1} + λ_{2}: begin{align} λ_{1} + λ_{2} &= frac{x_{1}}{4 - x_{1}} + frac{x_{2}}{4 - x_{2}} &= frac{4(x_{1} + x_{2}) - 2x_{1}x_{2}}{16 - 4(x_{1} + x_{2}) + x_{1}x_{2}} &= frac{4 cdot frac{200k^{2}}{9 + 25k^{2}} - 2 cdot frac{400k^{2} - 225}{9 + 25k^{2}}}{16 - 4 cdot frac{200k^{2}}{9 + 25k^{2}} + frac{400k^{2} - 225}{9 + 25k^{2}}} &= -frac{50}{9}. end{align} Therefore, the correct answer is option B: boxed{-frac{50}{9}}.

We need to show that: s < PA + PB + PC < 2s Let's start with the proof of the leftmost inequality, ( s < PA + PB + PC ): 1. **Using the triangle inequality**: For any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the remaining side. This is known as the triangle inequality. Applying the triangle inequality to ( triangle APB ): [ AB < AP + PB ] Similarly, for the triangles ( triangle BPC ) and ( triangle CPA ): [ BC < BP + PC ] [ CA < CP + AP ] 2. **Adding the inequalities**: Given the inequalities from above: [ begin{aligned} & AB < AP + PB & BC < BP + PC & CA < CP + AP end{aligned} ] Summing these inequalities, we get: [ AB + BC + CA < (AP + PB) + (BP + PC) + (CP + AP) ] Simplifying the right-hand side: [ AB + BC + CA < 2(AP + BP + CP) ] 3. **Rewriting the perimeter**: We know that the perimeter ( K_{ABC} ) of the triangle ( ABC ) is ( AB + BC + CA ), and we are given that it equals ( 2s ). Thus: [ 2s < 2(AP + BP + CP) ] Dividing both sides by 2: [ s < AP + BP + CP ] This verifies the left half of the inequality: [ s < PA + PB + PC ] Next, let's prove the rightmost inequality ( PA + PB + PC < 2s ): 4. **Using further applications of the triangle inequality**: Consider the triangles ( triangle AQC ) and ( triangle BQP ) (where ( Q ) is a point such that ( P ) is inside ( triangle ABC ) and intersects sides ( BC), ( CA ), or ( AB )). In the triangle ( triangle AQC ): [ AQ = AP + PQ ] Since ( P ) lies inside ( triangle ABC ): [ AQ < QC + CA ] For the triangle ( triangle BQP ), applying the triangle inequality: [ BP < BQ + PQ ] 5. **Combining and simplifying inequalities**: Combining these results, we get: [ AP + PQ + BP < QC + CA + BQ + PQ ] Simplifying: [ AP + BP < QC + CA + BQ ] Analogously: [ BP + CP < CA + AB ] [ CP + AP < AB + BC ] 6. **Adding these inequalities**: Summing all three inequalities: [ 2(AP + BP + CP) < AB + BC + CA + AB + BC + CA ] Simplifying the right-hand side: [ 2(AP + BP + CP) < 2(AB + BC + CA) ] Dividing by 2: [ AP + BP + CP < AB + BC + CA ] We know ( AB + BC + CA = 2s ), thus: [ PA + PB + PC < 2s ] This verifies the right half of the inequality.

Since the number ( N ) consists of 300 ones followed by some zeros, we can write ( N ) as: [ N = underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{300 text{ ones}} underbrace{000 ldots 0}_{k text{ zeros}} ] 2. **Step 2: Sum the digits of ( N ).** The sum of the digits of ( N ) is simply the sum of 300 ones since the zeros do not contribute to the sum.

The second divisor is 9.","completion":"To find the least number that should be subtracted from 997 so that the remainder when divided by 5, 9, and 11 will leave the same remainder of 3, we need to find a number that is a common multiple of 5, 9, and 11, and then add 3 to it (since we want a remainder of 3). The least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 9, and 11 can be found by multiplying the highest powers of all prime factors present in the numbers. 5 is a prime number, so its highest power is 5^1 = 5. 9 is 3^2 (since 9 is 3 * 3). 11 is a prime number, so its highest power is 11^1 = 11. The LCM of 5, 9, and 11 is therefore 5 * 3^2 * 11 = 5 * 9 * 11 = 45 * 11 = 495. Now, we want the number to have a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, 9, and 11. So we add 3 to the LCM: 495 + 3 = 498 Now, we need to find the largest multiple of 498 that is less than 997 and then subtract it from 997 to find the least number that should be subtracted. To find the largest multiple of 498 that is less than 997, we divide 997 by 498: 997 ÷ 498 = 2 with a remainder of 1. The largest multiple of 498 that is less than 997 is 2 * 498 = 996.

Prove that any crosssection of the polyhedron by a plane not containing any vertices is a polygon with an even number of sides.","completion":"Let's denote the given convex polyhedron as P. We are to prove that any section of P by a plane that does not contain any of its vertices results in a polygon with an even number of sides. # Step-by-Step Solution 1. **Initial Setup and Observation:** The polyhedron P is convex, and each vertex v of P is connected by an even number of edges. This condition is crucial for our proof. 2. **Perturbation of the Plane:** Consider a plane pi that intersects P but does not contain any vertices of P. Because edge intersections with pi generate the polygon, slight perturbations of pi do not change the essential nature of the intersections; pi can be moved slightly without becoming parallel to any edge of P or missing any vertices of P. 3. **Behavior of the Intersecting Plane:** As the plane pi moves through the polyhedron parallel to itself, it intersects a set of edges when passing through the polyhedron’s volume, forming the sides of a polygon. The vertices of this polygon are simply the points where pi intersects the edges of P. 4. **Vertex and Edge Combination Analysis:** Let us now suppose the plane pi intersects an edge at a single point (which is not a vertex). Every time pi passes an edge, it intersects two faces of the polyhedron that share this edge. 5. **Even Number Condition Analysis:** When pi moves and intersects vertices (as it can), the number of edges in the section polygon changes. We need to show that these changes keep the number of sides of the polygon even. Let's analyze what happens as pi moves past a vertex v. Vertex v has an even degree (it connects to an even number of edges). If m edges lie above pi and n edges lie below pi, then when pi moves slightly through v, it intersects k = m + n edges. Since v has an even degree, k is even. This means the transition does not change the parity of the polygon's side count. Let's detail: [ text{Change in the number of sides} = (n + m) - 2m = 2k - 2m ] Since k is even (k = 2k'), the equation simplifies to [ 2k' - 2m text{ (which is even as well)}. ] 6. **Conclusion:** Initially, as pi intersects nothing, the polygon has 0 sides (even number). Whenever pi intersects an edge, it happens in pairs due to the even degree condition ensuring the total number of sides remains even until pi leaves P entirely. Hence, any section of P by a plane pi results in a polygon with an even number of sides. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a complex number z_1=1+ai (where a>0), and z_1^2 is a pure imaginary number.

Let's denote the six numbers in the series as ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 ). 2. We are given that the arithmetic averages of any three consecutive numbers are equal.

Simplifying this equation, we get: [ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = a_2 + a_3 + a_4 ] Subtracting ( a_2 + a_3 ) from both sides, we get: [ a_1 = a_4 ] 4. Similarly, we have: [ frac{1}{3}(a_2 + a_3 + a_4) = frac{1}{3}(a_3 + a_4 + a_5) ] Which simplifies to: [ a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = a_3 + a_4 + a_5 ] Subtracting ( a_3 + a_4 ) from both sides, we get: [ a_2 = a_5 ] 5.

What is our opinion on their conversation?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Conversation:** - Panni initially implies that Kati might be overconfident or lucky, assuming the 84 will be drawn again soon. - Panni's statement can be interpreted as suggesting that it is highly improbable for the 84 to be drawn again in the near future. - Kati counters by asserting that each drawing is independent, and therefore the probability of drawing 84 next week remains the same, despite its recent frequency. 2. **Independence of Weekly Draws:** - It is important to acknowledge that in a lottery, each draw is an independent event. This means that the outcome of previous draws does not influence the next draw. - Each number, including 84, has an equal probability of being chosen in any given draw regardless of its previous occurrences. 3. **Calculating the Probability of Drawing 84:** - Suppose the lottery consists of drawing 5 winning numbers out of 90 possible numbers. - The probability v_1 that the number 84 (or any specific number) will be drawn in the next draw is: [ v_1 = frac{5}{90} = frac{1}{18} approx 0.0556 ] 4. **Probability of Drawing 84 in Subsequent Weeks:** - The probability v_2 that number 84 is drawn in the second week (not the first week) involves two stages: - It should not be drawn in the first week. - It should be drawn in the second week. - The probability of not drawing 84 in the first week is (1 - v_1 = 1 - frac{1}{18} = frac{17}{18}). - Thus, the combined probability v_2 is: [ v_2 = left( frac{17}{18} right) cdot v_1 = left( frac{17}{18} right) cdot left( frac{1}{18} right) = frac{17}{18} cdot frac{1}{18} approx 0.0525 ] 5. **Generalizing to the (n)-th Week:** - For the (n)-th draw, the probability v_n that the number 84 is first drawn in the (n)-th week (and not before) can be expressed as: [ v_n = left( frac{17}{18} right)^{n-1} cdot v_1 = left( frac{17}{18} right)^{n-1} cdot frac{1}{18} ] 6. **Comparing Probabilities:** - We observe that for n > 1, the probability v_n becomes smaller compared to v_1. [ v_n = left( frac{17}{18} right)^{n-1} cdot frac{1}{18} < frac{1}{18} ] - Therefore, the highest probability for drawing the number 84 in any future draw occurs in the next draw (v_1). # Conclusion: Given the independence of weekly draws in the lottery, Kati's argument—that the probability of drawing the number 84 in the next draw remains the same as any other draw—is correct.

Given that Nissa takes 10 seconds to clip each claw, the time taken to clip all the claws would be: Time to clip all claws = 10 seconds/claw * 18 claws = 180 seconds It takes 90 seconds to clean each ear. Assuming the cat has two ears, the time taken to clean both ears would be: Time to clean both ears = 90 seconds/ear * 2 ears = 180 seconds It takes 5 minutes to shampoo the cat.

While constructing the perpendicular bisector to a chord requires drawing a pair of arcs, you can limit yourself to three arcs when constructing the perpendicular bisectors of two adjacent chords by using the same arc for both bisectors. Using a compass and a straightedge, this method can be optimized by drawing only two arcs and using the straightedge once. This method is known as Shale's method.

Draw another circle with center ( Q ) having the same radius, and note the point ( R ) where it intersects circle ( D ) inside ( C ). Let the line ( PR ) intersect circumference ( C ) at point ( L ).

Step 1: Verify the Recurrence Relation The recursion condition requires that: [ a_{n+2} = x a_{n+1} + y a_{n}. ] Using trigonometric identities, particularly the angle addition formulas for cosine: [ cos((n+2)theta) = cos(ntheta + 2theta) = cos(ntheta)cos(2theta) - sin(ntheta)sin(2theta). ] We also know from the double-angle identity: [ cos(2theta) = 2cos^{2}(theta) - 1, ] [ sin(2theta) = 2sin(theta)cos(theta). ] Then: [ a_{n+2} = 2r cos(theta) a_{n+1} - r^2 a_{n}. ] So if we set: [ x = 2r cos(theta), ] [ y = -r^2, ] the recursion condition is satisfied.

However, as: [ theta = frac{pi}{2} left( frac{1}{x_{1}} + frac{1}{x_{2}} + ldots right) ] is constructed to have a non-periodic binary expansion, making (frac{theta}{pi}) irrational. Therefore, ( cos(ntheta) neq 0 ) for any integer ( n ).

Therefore, the sequence ({a_{n}}) constructed with ( r = 2 ) and such (theta ) will certainly satisfy: [ |a_{i}| < r < |a_{j}| ] for sufficiently chosen ( i ) and ( j ). # Conclusion: Thus, the sequence ( {a_{n}} ) defined as [ a_{n} = r^{n} cos (n theta) ] with ( r = 2 ) and [ theta = frac{pi}{2} left( frac{1}{x_{1}} + frac{1}{x_{2}} + ldots right) ] satisfies all the given conditions.

Let the foci correspond to points ( V_o ). - Note that the altitudes are crucial in the setup of our ellipses as their corresponding foci (V_o) are aligned with the altitudes (AN) and (CH). 3. **Utilize the Definition of Ellipses**: - Recall that an ellipse is the set of points such that the sum of the distances to the foci is constant. - Since the foci of our ellipses are aligned along the directions perpendicular to (AN) and (CH), observe: [ text{Distance from } H text{ along the ellipse } = text{Distance from } A text{ along the ellipse to } B_0 ] This symmetry simplifies our analysis. 4. **Equal Distance and Ratio Relationship**: - The distances from the orthocenter ( H ) to the points on the ellipses and the related ratios give: [ text{Distance from } A text{ to } V_0 = text{Distance from } C text{ to } B_0 ] - The above equality hinges on the orthocentric property where the altitudes intersect at a common point (H). 5. **Apply the Resulting Geometric Property**: - For the points of intersection of the ellipses, as both ellipses relate to the orthocenter’s distances, their intersection implies a line passing through ( H ). - Since the ellipses' definitions anchor on the common focus properties and intersection, the points of intersection must be collinear with the orthocenter. 6. **Confirm the Points on a Line**: - By confirming the distances share identical focus-determined properties: [ frac{text{Distance from a point on ellipse to } V_0}{text{Distance from another point on ellipse to } V_0} = 1 text{ (or reciprocal ratios)} ] - Hence, the points of intersection in coherence with the ratio polar property must be collinear, passing through (H) or some focal line connected to the orthocenter. # Conclusion: Since the geometric construction relies on the shared focus points and distances, and seeing that their intersection aligns with the orthocenter, it implies collinearity through fundamental ellipse intersection properties and triangle orthocentric properties. <div style=\\"text-align: center;\\"> (blacksquare) </div>"},{"prompt":"Let x, y, z be real numbers such that x + y + z = 6 and xy + xz + yz = 10.

If a_1 has an odd number of digits, then at some point, one of the a_n must have an even number of digits because the number of digits will eventually increase as the sequence progresses. 8. **Conclusion:** Since one of a_1, a_2, ldots, a_6 has an even number of digits, we have: [ a_k + b_k equiv 0 pmod{11} quad text{for some} quad k le 6 ] This implies that a_7 equiv 0 pmod{11}, meaning a_7 is divisible by 11 and hence cannot be a prime number.

Because ( AP = PC ) (as just proven), triangle ( APC ) is isosceles with ( widehat{PAC} = 60^circ ). An isosceles triangle with a ( 60^circ ) angle must be equilateral; therefore, triangle ( APC ) is equilateral, meaning ( AP = AC ). - In the same way, observe ( widehat{BAQ} = widehat{BAC} = 60^circ ) and ( AQ = QB ). The triangle ( ABQ ) is also equilateral, meaning ( AQ = AB ). 3. **Symmetry Argument:** - Define ( s ) as the reflection symmetry with respect to the angle bisector of ( widehat{BAC} ). Since the angle bisector of ( widehat{BAC} ) is 60 degrees and both ( widehat{PAC} ) and ( widehat{QAB} ) are symmetric around this line, the perpendicular bisectors and their respective points ( P ) and ( Q ) will similarly be symmetric. 4. **Reflection Mapping:** - In symmetry ( s ), point ( C ) maps to point ( P ), denoted as ( s(C) = P ). - Similarly, point ( B ) maps to ( Q ), denoted as ( s(B) = Q ). 5. **Equal Segments:** - By this symmetry mapping, segment ( [PQ] ) is the image of segment ( [BC] ) under the reflection ( s ). Hence, ( PQ ) and ( BC ) are congruent (equal in length). Conclusion: Therefore, we have shown that the length of ( PQ ) is equal to the length of ( BC ), that is: [ PQ = BC ] [ boxed{PQ = BC} ]"},{"prompt":"For some real numbers a and b, the equation 9x^3 + 5ax^2 + 4bx + a = 0 has three distinct positive roots.

The Baron claims that if you take one weight of each kind, the total weight of these 1000 weights will be less than 2^{1010}, and this weight cannot be achieved by combining weights from this set in any other way. Could the Baron's words be true?","completion":"1. **Problem Statement Recap**: Baron Munchausen has a set of weights consisting of 1000 distinct integers, with 2^{1000} weights of each integer. The claim is if he takes one weight of every possible kind, the total weight will be less than 2^{1010}, and this total weight cannot be achieved by any other combination of weights from this set. 2. **Weight Set Definition**: Let's define the set of weights as follows: [ a_{k-1} = 2^k - 2^{k-1},quad a_{k-2} = 2^k - 2^{k-2},quad ldots,quad a_0 = 2^k - 2^0 ] where ( k = 1000 ). 3. **Sum of Weights Calculation**: We need to calculate the sum ( S ) of these 1000 weights: [ S = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (2^k - 2^i) ] Simplifying, we separate the summation into two parts: [ S = k cdot 2^k - sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i ] The sum of powers of 2 from ( 2^0 ) to ( 2^{k-1} ) is a geometric series: [ sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i = 2^k - 1 ] Substituting this back into our expression for ( S ): [ S = k cdot 2^k - (2^k - 1) = (k-1) cdot 2^k + 1 ] 4. **Validation Against the Upper Bound**: For ( k = 1000 ), we check the expression: [ S = 999 cdot 2^{1000} + 1 ] We need to show ( S < 2^{1010} ). Considering the growth rates: [ 999 cdot 2^{1000} < 1000 cdot 2^{1000} = 2^{1000} cdot 10^3 ] As ( 2^{1000} times 10^3 ) is significantly smaller than ( 2^{1010} ): [ 2^{1000} times 10^3 < 2^{1010} ] This validates ( S < 2^{1010} ). 5. **Uniqueness by Modulo Analysis**: We use modulo arithmetic to confirm the uniqueness of the sum: [ S equiv 1 pmod{2^k} ] Suppose there is another combination of weights giving the same sum ( S ). Each ( a_i equiv -2^i pmod{2^k} ). Thus, to achieve 1 modulo ( 2^k ) by summing these ( -2^i )'s, one would need to form a set that sums to: [ 2^k - 1 = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i ] This is only possible if the sums ( a_{k-1}+a_{k-2}+cdots+a_0 ). Any deviation would result in combinations exceeding the required modular sum properties. 6. **Replacement and Sum Increase Proof**: If we replace one power of 2 by two smaller ones (or vice versa), it inherently increases the sum due to the weights defined. This means our chosen method is indeed the unique sum ( S ). **Conclusion**: The uniqueness and condition ( S < 2^{1010} ) hold true. Therefore, Baron Munchausen's statement is correct.

Therefore, ( N ) should be of the form ( 3^m times 7^n ) where ( m ) and ( n ) are non-negative integers. 3. **Run induction to check the last digit parity:** - We need to verify that a number ( 3^m times 7^n ) always produces a 10s digit (the digit just to the left of the last digit) that is even. This statement is key to showing a contradiction. **Base case:** - For a single ( 3 ), i.e., ( 3^1 = 3 ), the 10s digit is considered to be 0 by convention. - For a single ( 7 ), i.e., ( 7^1 = 7 ), the 10s digit is again considered to be 0. **Induction step:** - Suppose ( 3^m times 7^n ) has an even 10s digit. - When we multiply by 3 or 7, we have to check the resulting 10s digit parity. - Multiplying ( 1, 3, 7, 9 ) by ( 3 ) results in the final digits ( 3, 9, 21 rightarrow 1 (carry 2), 27 rightarrow 7 (carry 2) ).

Since 100 votes were invalid, the valid votes are 12600 - 100 = 12500. The winner got P% + 5000 votes, and the defeated candidate got P% of the valid votes. Since these two percentages must add up to 100% of the valid votes, we can set up the following equation: P% + (P% + 5000) = 12500 Now, let's convert the percentages to actual numbers. P% of 12500 is (P/100) * 12500.

Since the rolling circle rolls without slipping, (theta) is related to (phi) by: [ theta = frac{a - b}{b} phi = phi ] because (frac{a - b}{b} = 1). 5. **Position of the marked point:** The coordinates of the marked point on the rolling circle are given by: [ left( frac{a}{2} cos phi + frac{a}{2} cos theta, frac{a}{2} sin phi - frac{a}{2} sin theta right) ] Substituting (theta = phi), we get: [ left( frac{a}{2} cos phi + frac{a}{2} cos phi, frac{a}{2} sin phi - frac{a}{2} sin phi right) ] Simplifying, we obtain: [ left( a cos phi, 0 right) ] 6. **Conclusion:** The coordinates of the marked point are ((a cos phi, 0)), which lies on the x-axis. Therefore, as the rolling circle makes a turn, the marked point moves along the x-axis, which is a straight line.

Algorithme glouton et coloration Commençons par rappeler quelques termes et concepts clés: - **Nombre chromatique (chi(G))**: le nombre minimum de couleurs nécessaires pour colorier le graphe G de manière telle que deux sommets adjacents n'ont jamais la même couleur. - **Degré d'un sommet**: nombre d'arêtes incidentes à ce sommet. - **Degré maximal, D(G)**: le plus grand degré parmi tous les sommets de G. - **Algorithme glouton**: une heuristique pour colorier un graphe qui consiste à parcourir les sommets dans un ordre donné et assigner à chaque sommet la couleur la plus petite possible qui n'est pas encore utilisée par ses voisins. 2.

Our task is to determine the locus of points ( C ) such that the area of triangle ( ABC ) is less than half the area of the square constructed on any side of the triangle. 2. **Area Calculation:** For a triangle with side ( a ) and height ( m ) from the opposite vertex, the area ( T ) is: [ T = frac{1}{2} a m ] The area of the square constructed on side ( a ) is ( a^2 ). Half of that area is: [ frac{1}{2} a^2 ] Hence, the condition ( frac{1}{2} a m < frac{1}{2} a^2 ) simplifies to: [ m < a ] 3. **Condition for Triangle Area with Respect to the Base ( AB ):** For side ( AB ), the above condition ( m < a ) means that the height from point ( C ) perpendicular to ( AB ) (the distance from ( C ) to ( AB )) must be less than ( AB ). 4. **Equations of Boundary Lines:** The points ( C ) that satisfy the condition must lie in the region bounded by two lines parallel to ( AB ), and at a distance ( AB ) from ( AB ). These lines are denoted as ( d ) and ( e ).

What is the maximum number of pieces of cake that can be obtained with one straight cut? What is the minimum number of straight cuts necessary to ensure that each of the 15 original pieces is cut?","completion":"Let's address each part of the problem step by step. **Part 1: Finding the maximum number of pieces from one straight cut** 1. The cake is initially in the shape of a rectangle with dimensions 3 text{ dm} times 5 text{ dm}. The cake is divided into 15 pieces, each with square bases of 1 text{ dm} times 1 text{ dm}, making a 3 text{ rows} times 5 text{ columns} grid pattern. 2. We need to find a way to achieve the maximum number of distinct pieces with one straight cut. 3. Examine possible cutting lines. To maximize the number of pieces, the cut has to traverse through the maximum number of these squares. The best path would be a diagonal that crosses through the interior of maximum squares. 4. The most effective cut is the diagonal that cuts across the rectangle from one corner to the opposite corner. This is based on the understanding that each unit cut increases the number of pieces by one and that crossing more unit edges represents more intersections. 5. Calculating the maximum pieces formed: - The maximal path is the diagonal of the rectangle. - The diagonal will cut the 3 times 5 grid and cross through 3 + 5 - 1 = 7 individual squares. - This is because a diagonal in an (m times n) grid crosses exactly (m + n - gcd(m,n)) squares, with (gcd(3,5)=1). 6. As a result, crossing 7 squares results in creating one more piece for every unit length. Thus: [ text{Total pieces} = 15 text{ original pieces} + 7 text { new cut intersections} = 22 text{ pieces}. ] **Part 2: Finding the minimum number of straight cuts so each of the 15 original pieces is cut at least once** 1. A single cut doesn't guarantee that each of the 15 pieces will be cut. We need to determine how many cuts are required to intersect every piece. 2. Since we have a grid of 3 times 5, we can strategically place cuts: - One vertical cut through each column and one horizontal cut through each row ensures every piece is cut. 3. Because we have 5 vertical columns and 3 horizontal rows, drawings through on each line results in: - Total cuts = the number of vertical cuts + the number of horizontal cuts = 5 - 1 + 3 - 1 = 2 + 4 = 6 (Note there's actually only three cuts required because counting the intersections reduces the necessary cuts to a minimal 3 cuts in each suitable direction). 4. Therefore, considering every piece must be cut individually: - A minimum of 3 straight cuts is sufficient to guarantee every piece, all 15 pieces are assuredly intersected by a cut. # Conclusion: - The maximum number of pieces obtained from a single straight cut is 22. - The minimum number of straight cuts needed to ensure each of the 15 pieces is cut at least once is 3.

Clearly, ( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3) ) does not hold, but since ( k = 1 ) is allowed, we can choose ( k = 1 ) and ( x_1 = x_2 ), making the condition trivially satisfied. - For a linear polynomial ( P(x) = x + b ), we can choose ( k = 2 ) and three distinct integers ( x_1, x_2, x_3 ). Then ( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = (x_1 + b) + (x_2 + b) = x_1 + x_2 + 2b ) and ( P(x_3) = x_3 + b ). We need ( x_1 + x_2 + 2b = x_3 + b ), which simplifies to ( x_1 + x_2 + b = x_3 ). This can always be satisfied by choosing appropriate ( x_1, x_2, x_3 ). - For a quadratic polynomial ( P(x) = x^2 + bx + c ), we can choose ( k = 1 ) and two distinct integers ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). Then ( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = (x_1^2 + bx_1 + c) + (x_2^2 + bx_2 + c) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + b(x_1 + x_2) + 2c ) and ( P(x_3) = x_3^2 + bx_3 + c ). We need ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + b(x_1 + x_2) + 2c = x_3^2 + bx_3 + c ), which simplifies to ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + b(x_1 + x_2) + c = x_3^2 + bx_3 ). This can be satisfied by choosing appropriate ( x_1, x_2, x_3 ). 2. **Counterexample for ( n = 1 ):** - Consider the polynomial ( P(x) = x ). For ( k = 1 ), we need ( P(x_1) = P(x_2) ), which implies ( x_1 = x_2 ), contradicting the requirement for distinct integers. Hence, ( n = 1 ) does not satisfy the condition. 3. **Counterexample for ( n ge 3 ):** - Consider the polynomial ( P(x) = (x-1)(x-2) cdots (x-m) + N cdot m! cdot x + 1 ) for some large ( N ) and odd ( m ge 3 ). We need to show that ( P ) is injective over the real numbers for sufficiently large ( N ). - The derivative ( P'(x) = frac{d}{dx}[(x-1)(x-2) cdots (x-m)] + N cdot m! ). Since ( (x-1)(x-2) cdots (x-m) ) is a polynomial of degree ( m ), its derivative is a polynomial of degree ( m-1 ). For sufficiently large ( N ), ( P'(x) ) will be dominated by the term ( N cdot m! ), making ( P'(x) ) positive for all ( x ), ensuring ( P ) is injective. - For any ( k le m+1 ), ( P(x_1) + P(x_2) + cdots + P(x_k) equiv k pmod{m!} ) and ( P(x_{k+1}) equiv 1 pmod{m!} ). This implies ( m! mid k - 1 ), which is impossible since ( 0 < k - 1 le m < m! ). Hence, ( P ) does not satisfy the condition for ( n = m ) or ( n = m + 1 ). 4. **Conclusion:** - The only positive integer ( n ) that satisfies the given condition is ( n = 2 ).

Define ( u = (a+b)^2 ) and ( v = 2ab ). Note that ( a^2 + b^2 = u - v ), and it is evident that ( u geq 2v ). 3. Substituting the newly defined variables into the inequality, we get: [ v^k (u - v)^n leq left( frac{u}{2} right)^{k+n} ] 4.

Prove that a deck of 1000 cards can be transformed from any arrangement into any other arrangement in no more than 56 shuffles.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Flop Operation:** - A shuffle is defined as dividing a deck of n cards into multiple parts, reversing the order of these parts without changing the order of cards within each part, and then reversing the entire deck. - However, instead of considering the full shuffle, we'll focus on reversing parts of the deck and call this the \\"flop\\" operation. Let F(n) represent the number of flops needed to transform a deck of n cards from any order to any other order. 2. **Initial Constraints and Objective:** - It's clear that if we can manage smaller subproblems (smaller decks), we'll be able to handle larger decks. - We need to establish an upper bound for F(1000). We'll use the property that F(n) leq F(m) for n < m. 3. **Breaking Down the Flop Operations:** - We claim that for any power of 2, F(2^k) leq F(2^{k-1}) + k. We will assume this initially and then extend it to find the desired number for F(1000). - Suppose we have a deck of 2^{k} cards. We can break it into two halves of 2^{k-1} cards each. By our assumption, the maximum number of operations needed for each half is F(2^{k-1}). 4. **Combining to Verify the Claim:** - To solve it for 2^k cards: - Flop the first 2^{k-1} cards. - Flop the second 2^{k-1} cards. - Flop the entire set (2^{k} cards). - This sequence requires k additional operations to account for the hierarchical combination and reversal for each binary split, leading to at most F(2^{k-1}) + k operations in total. 5. **Induction Basis and Recursive Calculation:** - Starting with F(1) = 0, as a single card needs no operations. - For k=1, F(2) leq 1. Continuing this argument recursively gives a series where F(2^k) leq F(2^{k-1}) + k. This builds the foundation for larger numbers. 6. **From Power of 2 to 1000:** - Note that 1000 < 1024 = 2^{10}. By our claim for k = 10: [ F(1024) leq F(512) + 10. ] - Continuing down recursively using our formula, we find that F(2^{10}) leq 55 because each level adds no more than 10. 7. **Final Adjustment:** - F(1000) leq F(1024). Since 1024 > 1000, the extra flops can always be translated down to the exact 1000 cards, keeping the bound consistent. - If necessary, an additional shuffle (which would simply reverse the entire deck) could be added to adjust any last placements. - This final adjustment confirms any initial order to any desired order within leq 56 operations. # Conclusion: [ boxed{56} ] Therefore, it is shown that a deck of 1000 cards can be brought from any order to any other order in no more than 56 shuffle operations."},{"prompt":"Find the cosine of the angle between the vectors overrightarrow{A B} and overrightarrow{A C}.

Recall the formula for the sum of the first n terms in an arithmetic sequence, S_{n} = na_{1} + frac{1}{2}n(n-1)d. This formula helps us express the sum in terms of the first term a_{1}, the number of terms n, and the common difference d. 2. To find the average of the first n terms, we divide S_{n} by n, which gives us frac{S_{n}}{n} = a_{1} + frac{d}{2}(n-1). This simplification shows that the average term value in an arithmetic sequence increases linearly with n. 3. By incrementing n to n+1, we get frac{S_{n+1}}{n+1} = a_{1} + frac{d}{2}n. This step shows how the average term value changes as we consider one more term in the sequence. 4. The difference between the average values of consecutive terms, frac{S_{n+1}}{n+1} - frac{S_{n}}{n}, simplifies to frac{d}{2}. This indicates that the sequence of average values itself forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of frac{d}{2}. 5. Given frac{S_{2020}}{2020} - frac{S_{20}}{20} = 2000, and knowing that the difference between these averages is proportional to the common difference d, we set up the equation (2020-20) times frac{d}{2} = 2000. 6.

Initially, ( s ) is negative because the right pan is heavier. - If we can find a sequence where ( s ) becomes positive, it would demonstrate that the left pan can become the heavier one. 4. **Sum Over All Sequences:** - Consider all possible sequences in which students enter the classroom. Importantly, each distinct set of students can be represented by a unique sequence independent of order. - Summing ( s ) over all such sequences, we observe that ( s ) must average out to zero. - This follows because each distinct sequence either increases or decreases ( s ) symmetrically if we pair up sequences where specific weights are on opposite sides of the balance. 5. **Detailed Analysis:** - Each ( s ) value out of all possible sequences is a combination of weights with coefficients ( pm 1 ). - Examining a single weight and one of the names on it, consider all other students' sequences. - These can be paired where one sequence includes this particular student and the other does not. - For each pair, the corresponding change in ( s ) values for this weight will be +1 in one sequence and -1 in the other, averaging out to zero. 6. **Constructive Conclusion:** - Since the sum of ( s )-values over all sequences is zero, and the initial ( s ) is negative, there must be at least one sequence where ( s ) is positive. - Therefore, there exists a sequence of student entries where the left pan becomes heavier than the right. # Conclusion: [ boxed"},{"prompt":"**What is the sum of even proper divisors of 1728, where 1728 = 2^6 cdot 3^3?**","completion":"**Step 1**: Prime factorization of 1728 is 2^6 cdot 3^3. **Step 2**: Sum of all divisors using formula: - For 2^6, the sum of divisors that are even: sigma_{text{even}}(2^6) = 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 126. - For 3^3, the only divisor we consider is 1 (since only 1 times text{even} = text{even}), which is not even, hence contributes nothing to the even sum. **Step 3**: The sum of all divisors of 1728 can be calculated by: - sigma(2^6 cdot 3^3) = (126)(1) - However, we must subtract the number 1728 itself (since it's even, but not \\"proper\\") and the multiplication of every odd divisor from sigma(3^3) by every even divisor from sigma(2^6) that exceeds the number itself. sigma_{text{even proper}}(2^6) = 126 However, to facilitate the process, since 1728 itself needs to be subtracted, we remove it: - Previously calculated total even sum is 126. - Subtract 1728 itself from the sum: 126 - 60 - 120 - 180 - 360 - 720 - 1440 = 126 **Final Calculation**: - Sum of even proper divisors (considering no overlapping even divisors exceeding the original number): [ boxed{126} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the difference between two smallest integers greater than 2 which, when divided by any integer k such that 2 le k le 12, have a remainder of 2.

How many positive integer solutions does this equation have?","completion":"To find the number of positive integer solutions to the equation x + y + z + t = 10, we can use the method of stars and bars (also known as balls and urns). However, since we are looking for positive integer solutions, we need to ensure that each variable (x, y, z, t) is at least 1. First, we can subtract 1 from each variable to ensure that they are all positive. This gives us the equation: (x - 1) + (y - 1) + (z - 1) + (t - 1) = 10 - 4 x' + y' + z' + t' = 6 where x', y', z', and t' are the new variables representing (x - 1), (y - 1), (z - 1), and (t - 1), respectively. Now, we can find the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation, which will correspond to the number of positive integer solutions to the original equation. Using the stars and bars method, we can think of this as distributing 6 indistinguishable stars (representing units) into 4 distinguishable bars (representing the variables x', y', z', and t'). The number of ways to do this is given by the formula for combinations with repetition: C(n + k - 1, k - 1) where n is the number of stars and k is the number of bars. In our case, n = 6 and k = 4, so we have: C(6 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(9, 3) To calculate C(9, 3), we use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) C(9, 3) = 9! / (3! * (9 - 3)!) = 9! / (3! * 6!) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 84 Therefore, there are 84 positive integer solutions to the equation x + y + z + t = boxed{10} ."},{"prompt":"Given a line l with a slope of 1 that intersects the parabola y^{2}=2px (p > 0) at two distinct points A and B located above the xaxis, let K_{1} and K_{2} denote the slopes of the lines OA and OB, respectively.

This implies that ( S ) is closed under taking divisors. 2. **Express elements of ( S ) in terms of prime factors:** Let ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_s ) be all the primes dividing any element of ( S ). Any element ( x in S ) can be written as ( x = prod_{i=1}^s p_i^{x_i} ), where ( 0 leq x_i leq alpha_i ) and ( alpha_i ) is the largest exponent of the prime ( p_i ) over all elements of ( S ). We can identify ( x ) with the ( s )-tuple ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_s) ). 3. **Define a good subset ( T ):** A subset ( T ) of ( S ) is good if for any ( x, y in T ) with ( x < y ), the ratio ( y/x ) is a power of a prime number. This implies that in the prime factorization of ( y ), each prime factor's exponent is either the same as or greater than that in ( x ), and the difference in exponents corresponds to a power of a single prime. 4. **Determine the largest size ( k ) of a good subset:** For any index ( j ) where ( alpha_j = max_{1 leq i leq s} alpha_i = alpha ), a good subset can be of the form ( {(x_1, ldots, x_j, ldots, x_s) mid x_j = 0, 1, ldots, alpha} ).

This implies that the exponents of the prime factors in ( y ) differ from those in ( x ) in more than one prime factor. 6. **Use Dilworth's theorem:** Dilworth's theorem states that in any finite partially ordered set, the maximum size of an antichain (a set of elements none of which are comparable) is equal to the minimum number of chains (totally ordered subsets) needed to cover the set. 7. **Define a partial order relation:** Define ( y prec x ) by having all ( y_i = x_i ) with the exception of one index ( j ) for which ( y_j leq x_j ), and also ( leftlfloor frac{1}{k} sum_{i=1}^s y_i rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{1}{k} sum_{i=1}^s x_i rightrfloor ).

We need to determine if it is possible to divide them into two groups such that the sum of the numbers in each group is equal. 2. **Greedy Placement Strategy:** We will use a greedy strategy to place the numbers into two groups. Let ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) be the sums of the numbers in the two groups, respectively. 3. **Initial Placement:** Place ( a_n ) and ( a_{n-1} ) in two separate piles. Without loss of generality, assume ( a_n ) is placed in the first pile and ( a_{n-1} ) in the second pile. Thus, we have: [ |S_n - S_{n-1}| = |a_n - a_{n-1}| ] Given ( a_{n-1} le a_n le 2a_{n-1} ), it follows that: [ |a_n - a_{n-1}| le a_{n-1} ] 4. **Inductive Step:** We claim that for each ( k ), ( |S_{k+1} - S_k| le a_k ) given a greedy placing of the numbers. Assume this holds for ( k ), i.e., ( |S_k - S_{k-1}| le a_{k-1} ). 5. **Placing ( a_{k+1} ):** Place ( a_{k+1} ) into the smaller of the two piles. This ensures that the difference between the sums of the two piles remains controlled. Specifically: [ |S_{k+1} - S_k| le a_k ] This follows because placing ( a_{k+1} ) into the smaller pile will not increase the difference by more than ( a_k ). 6. **Base Case:** For the base case, consider ( k = 2 ). Initially, we have: [ |S_2 - S_1| le a_1 = 1 ] 7. **Sum Condition:** Since the total sum of the numbers is even, ( S_1 + S_2 ) is even. Given that ( |S_2 - S_1| le 1 ), the only way for ( S_1 + S_2 ) to be even is if ( S_1 = S_2 ). 8. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that it is possible to place the numbers into two groups such that the sums of the numbers in each group are equal.

The areas of the triangles give us the perpendicular heights from P to the bases: - Area of triangle PCD = 2, so frac{1}{2} s cdot PY = 2 Rightarrow PY = frac{4}{s}. - Area of triangle PAB = 5, so frac{1}{2} r cdot PX = 5 Rightarrow PX = frac{10}{r}. 4. **Total area of the trapezoid**: The total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of the four triangles, which is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14. Using the area formula for a trapezoid, A = frac{1}{2} (AB + CD) cdot h, where h is the height of the trapezoid: - Here, h = PX + PY = frac{10}{r} + frac{4}{s}. - Thus, 14 = frac{1}{2} (r + s) left(frac{10}{r} + frac{4}{s}right). 5. **Simplify the equation**: Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction: [ 28 = (r+s) left(frac{10}{r} + frac{4}{s}right) = 10 frac{s}{r} + 4 frac{r}{s} + 10 + 4. ] Simplifying further, we get: [ 14 = 10 frac{s}{r} + 4 frac{r}{s} + 14. ] Subtracting 14 from both sides: [ 0 = 10 frac{s}{r} + 4 frac{r}{s}. ] 6. **Introduce the ratio rho = frac{r}{s}**: Substitute rho into the equation: [ 10 rho^{-1} + 4 rho = 0 Rightarrow 4 rho^2 + 10 = 0. ] Solving for rho: [ rho^2 = frac{10}{4} = 2.5 Rightarrow rho = sqrt{2.5} = sqrt{frac{5}{2}}. ] 7. **Find the correct ratio**: The ratio frac{AB}{CD} = frac{r}{s} = rho = sqrt{frac{5}{2}}.

Step 2: Recognize divisibility by 17 Given that 50^{2023} + a is divisible by 17, we know that all terms involving powers of 51 are divisible by 17 since 51 itself is divisible by 17.

Now, we will generate new sums by replacing one element at a time from the smallest sum with the next larger element in ( S ). This process will be done in steps. 5. In each step, we replace one element ( x_i ) in the current sum with ( x_{i+1} ). Since ( x_1 < x_2 < ldots < x_n ), each replacement increases the sum. 6. We can perform this replacement for each of the ( k ) elements in the sum, and we can do this for ( (n-k) ) steps, as there are ( (n-k) ) elements larger than the ( k )-th element in the smallest sum. 7. Therefore, we can generate ( k(n-k) ) distinct sums by performing these replacements. 8. Including the initial sum ( x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_k ), we have ( k(n-k) + 1 ) distinct sums. Thus, ( T ) contains at least ( k(n-k) + 1 ) distinct elements.

The total number of ways person X can choose two spots is given by the combination formula C_{3}^{2}, which also applies to person Y. Therefore, the total number of ways both persons can make their selections is: (C_{3}^{2})^2 = (C_{3}^{2}) cdot (C_{3}^{2}) Next, we need to find the number of ways in which both persons choose the exact same spots. This is again given by C_{3}^{2}, as they must both choose the same two spots out of the three available. To find the number of ways in which their choices are not all the same, we subtract the number of identical selections from the total number of selections. Hence, we get: (C_{3}^{2})^2 - C_{3}^{2} Calculating the combinations, we have: C_{3}^{2} = frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = frac{3 cdot 2}{2 cdot 1} = 3 Therefore, the number of different selections where their choices are not all the same is: 3^2 - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6 So, there are boxed{6} different selections where persons X and Y do not choose all the same scenic spots."},{"prompt":"Given sin (x+pi)+cos (xpi)= frac {1}{2}, xin(0,pi).

If 14.285714285714285% of the motorists on that road exceed the posted speed limit, what percent of the motorists who exceed the speed limit do not receive speeding tickets?","completion":"Let's denote the total number of motorists on the road as ( M ). According to the information given: - 10% of all motorists receive speeding tickets for exceeding the speed limit. This means ( 0.10M ) motorists receive tickets. - 14.285714285714285% of all motorists exceed the speed limit. This means ( 0.14285714285714285M ) motorists exceed the speed limit. We want to find the percentage of motorists who exceed the speed limit but do not receive speeding tickets. To find this, we need to subtract the number of motorists who receive tickets from the number of motorists who exceed the speed limit: Number of motorists who exceed the speed limit but do not receive tickets = ( 0.14285714285714285M - 0.10M ) This equals ( 0.04285714285714285M ). Now, to find the percentage of these motorists out of the ones who exceed the speed limit, we divide the number of motorists who exceed the speed limit but do not receive tickets by the total number of motorists who exceed the speed limit and multiply by 100: ( frac{0.04285714285714285M}{0.14285714285714285M} times 100 ) ( M ) cancels out, and we are left with: ( frac{0.04285714285714285}{0.14285714285714285} times 100 ) This simplifies to: ( frac{3}{10} times 100 ) ( 0.3 times 100 ) ( = 30% ) Therefore, boxed{30%} of the motorists who exceed the speed limit do not receive speeding tickets."},{"prompt":"Consider a regular nonagon (a 9sided polygon).

Such sets are formed by choosing four vertices declaring a quadrilateral permitting diagonal intersection: [ binom{9}{4} = 126. ] Step 5: Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen pair of diagonals intersect inside the nonagon is: [ dfrac{126}{351}. ] Step 6: Simplify the probability: [ dfrac{126}{351} = dfrac{6}{21} = dfrac{2}{7}. ] boxed{dfrac{2}{7}} Conclusion: The final answer, considering each step and their valid outcomes, shows that for any four vertices chosen in our nonagon, the specific pair arrangement into intersecting diagonals logically follows the geometric properties of a nonagon.
