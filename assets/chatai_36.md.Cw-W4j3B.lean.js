Its asymptotes are given by the equations y = pm frac{x}{m}. This is because the asymptotes of a hyperbola y^2 - frac{x^2}{a^2} = 1 are y = pm frac{x}{a}. 2. **Identify the Center and Radius of the Circle**: The circle is given by x^{2}+y^{2}-4y+3=0. Completing the square for y gives us (y-2)^2 = 1, which means the circle has a center at (0, 2) and a radius of 1. 3. **Condition for Tangency**: For the asymptotes to be tangent to the circle, the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the asymptote must be equal to the radius of the circle. The distance from the center (0, 2) to the line y = mx (considering one of the asymptotes for simplicity) can be found using the formula for the distance of a point (x_0, y_0) from a line Ax + By + C = 0 as frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Applying this to our case gives the distance as frac{|2m|}{sqrt{1+m^{2}}}. 4. **Solving for m**: Setting the distance equal to the radius of the circle, we get frac{2m}{sqrt{1+m^{2}}} = 1. Squaring both sides to get rid of the square root gives 4m^2 = 1 + m^2. Simplifying this equation yields 3m^2 = 1, so m^2 = frac{1}{3}. Taking the square root of both sides gives m = pm frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. Since m > 0, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the value of m that satisfies the given conditions is boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}}."},{"prompt":"each blank cell on the edge, fill in an arrow.

The slip operation transforms ( n ) into: [ frac{n + p^2}{p} = frac{mp + p^2}{p} = m + p ] 3. **Lower bound analysis**: Notice that ( m + p geq 3 ).

For non-prime ( n ), the sequence of iterated slips is decreasing. The sequence can increase by one when hitting a prime, but it will never hit the same prime again. 6. **Infinite descent principle**: By the principle of infinite descent, the sequence must eventually reach the value 5.

Each floor is 4 meters apart. 2. **Reference to Previous Problem**: The problem references the F. 2280, 1981 problem, which gives insights into how to calculate the elevator's travel distance if we consider additional constraints. 3. **Scenario Without Constraints**: - If we do not assume the elevator stops alternately on odd and even numbered floors, the F. 2280 problem tells us the elevator can travel up to 55 floors. - Calculating the maximum distance: [ text{Maximum distance} = 55 text{ floors} times 4 text{ meters/floor} = 220 text{ meters} ] 4. **Adding Constraints – Alternating Between Odd and Even Floors**: - Here, the elevator must stop alternately between even and odd floors. - It implies that between any two stops, the elevator must travel an odd number of floors. - Since the elevator starts at the 0th floor (also an even floor), it must follow an odd number of floors. 5. **Calculating Path and Floors**: - There are a total of 10 stops made by the elevator (including initial and final stops at the ground and 10th floors). - The total number of floors traveled must be an even number (sum of odd numbers). - The maximum number of floors traveled in this scenario would be 54. 6. **Maximum Distance Calculation**: - Given the constraint of alternating stops: [ text{Maximum number of floors traveled} = 54 ] - Therefore, the maximum distance in meters: [ text{Maximum distance} = 54 text{ floors} times 4 text{ meters/floor} = 216 text{ meters} ] 7. **Verification Through Example Path**: - Consider the elevator's stops in the sequence: 0, 7, 2, 9, 4, 5, 10, 3, 8, 1, 6. - Summing there transitions: - From 0 to 7 = 7 floors - 7 to 2 = 5 floors - 2 to 9 = 7 floors - 9 to 4 = 5 floors - 4 to 5 = 1 floor - 5 to 10 = 5 floors - 10 to 3 = 7 floors - 3 to 8 = 5 floors - 8 to 1 = 7 floors - 1 to 6 = 5 floors - Total = 54 floors 8. **Conclusion**: - The maximum distance the elevator can travel under the given constraints and conditions is: [ boxed{216 text{ meters}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, a_1+a_8+a_15=π, find the value of cos (a_4+a_12) ( ) A: dfrac {1}{2} B: dfrac { sqrt {3}}{2} C: dfrac {1}{2} D: ± dfrac { sqrt {3}}{2}","completion":"Since the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, a_1+a_8+a_15=3a_8=π, Thus, a_8= dfrac {π}{3}, Hence, cos (a_4+a_12)=cos (2a_8)=cos dfrac {2π}{3}=-cos dfrac {π}{3}=- dfrac {1}{2}.

Now evaluate the intersection with the square. The circle's center is at (8, 15), inside the square, but the radius extends beyond the top of the square. Since the highest y-position inside the square is 15 and the center's y-coordinate equals the top side, there will be no overlapping above ( y = 15 ). Thus, we only need to find the area of the circular cap below y = 15. The distance from the circle's center to the top of the square is 0 (as it's on the boundary), resulting in a circular cap from y = 7 to y = 15 (radius - y distance to edge).

After the first player completes their turn, the second player adds either 1 or 2 to the number written by the first player and writes the new number on the paper. The two players take turns following this rule. The player who writes the number 11 wins the game. The first player has a winning strategy.

To devise a winning strategy, let's pick the value which ensures we can continue with the pattern that leads to victory. - The critical aspect of the game is recognizing the impact of each move. 2. **Opponent’s Possible Moves:** - After the first player writes a number, the second player (后手方) must select between adding 1 or adding 2 to the number written by the first player. - For each move by the second player, we need a way to ensure that, regardless of their choice, the first player can maintain control over the game's progress. 3. **Strategizing the Moves:** - Let’s analyze the sequence if we start with 2: - If the first player writes 2, the second player can choose: - (2 + 1 = 3) - (2 + 2 = 4) 4. **Ensuring Control Over the Sequence:** - Let’s continue with each of these moves and outline the scenarios: - If the second player writes 3, the sequence can continue: - (3 + 1 = 4) - (3 + 2 = 5) 5. **Analyzing Further to Lock the Win:** - The stable pattern emerges when we consider the necessity to reach 11 first. We’ve noted: - 4 is a trap because it leaves us with fewer advantageous moves. - Hence, starting with 2 seems better. - After 2, move to a position where, after adding 1 or 2, we always ensure moving closer in multiples of 3. 6. **The Winning Pattern:** - Thus, the sequence proceeds as: 1. **First Move**: Start with 2 (initial choice). 2. **Second Move**: After opponent’s choice, lock the sequence by ensuring: - (2 + 3 = 5) 3. **Third Move**: Ensure the continuity by moving to: - (5 + 3 = 8) 4. **Final Move**: Reach 11 to win: - (8 + 3 = 11) # Conclusion: Following this strategy ensures the first player (先手方) always has a move leading directly to 11, wrapping up the victory.

Prove that in one of the good colorings, three consecutive edges emanating from ( A ) are colored the same.","completion":"To solve the problem, let's delve into the details step by step. 1. **Vertex Degrees and Edge Coloring**: Given a convex polyhedron with one vertex ( A ) of degree 5, and all other vertices of degree 3. A coloring of the edges of the polyhedron is considered \\"good\\" if, at each vertex of degree 3, all the incident edges are colored differently. 2. **Odd-Even Analysis**: - Each vertex of degree 3 must have one edge of each color. Thus, the endpoints of edges colored ( text{red} ), ( text{blue} ), and ( text{purple} ) are even in total. - Let the three colors be ( text{red} (r) ), ( text{blue} (b) ), and ( text{purple} (p) ). If edges are colored ( r ), ( b ), and ( p ) around ( A ), the number must also be balanced by being odd or even accordingly. 3. **Assumption**: Assume no good colorings exist where three consecutive edges emanating from ( A ) are of the same color. We will show that under this assumption, the number of good colorings where ( A ) has exactly three edges colored the same (e.g., three blue edges) is divisible by 5. 4. **Counting Good Colorings**: - Let ( A ) be connected to ( B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, ) and ( B_5 ). Suppose these edges ( AB_1, AB_2, AB_3, AB_4, ) and ( AB_5 ) are sequenced cyclically. - In any good coloring, red and purple edges cannot be consecutive, i.e., an edge pair ( (A, B_i)), ( (A, B_j) ) where ( i neq j ) must skip at least one position. 5. **Possible configurations for adjacent edges**: There are only a few valid ways to distribute the red and purple edges: [ (B_1, B_4), (B_2, B_5), (B_3, B_1), (B_4, B_2), (B_5, B_3) ] Let the number of good colorings corresponding to these edge pairs be denoted by ( k_{14}, k_{25}, k_{31}, k_{42}, ) and ( k_{53} ). 6. **Establishing Inequalities**: We need to show that: [ k_{14} leq k_{42} leq k_{25} leq k_{53} leq k_{31} leq k_{14} ] This will imply that all ( k )'s are equal, leading to divisibility by 5. 7. **Cycle Argument**: - Consider vertices with a degree of 4 must partition into disjoint cycles based on color pairs. - From this, rearranging the blue edges from one cycle and transforming it into red or purple and vice versa, we exhaustively see the overlapping and rearrangement constraints leads into counting multiple \\"good\\" configurations. 8. **Conclusion**: - By proving that one such partition exists for good coloring configurations by verifying inverting step checking ( k_{rs} leq k_{st} dots) proving ( forall i, j, ; k_i = k_j), giving us even partitions evidencing overall divisibility by 5.

We need to find the minimum value of this absolute value function. First, let's get rid of the absolute value. For x > 0, since sqrt{x} > 0, the sign of f(x) depends on log_{sqrt{2}}(2x). The expression inside the logarithm function is greater than 1 if x > frac{1}{2} and less than 1 if 0 < x <frac{1}{2}. Within the domain where x > frac{1}{2}, we can remove the absolute value sign directly. Now, to minimize f(x), we are looking to minimize the function: g(x) = 2sqrt{x} cdot log_{sqrt{2}}(2x). Notice that to minimize g(x), we need log_{sqrt{2}}(2x) to be as small as possible because sqrt{x} is always positive. Let's use the fact that log_{sqrt{2}}(2) = 2 and write 2x = x cdot 2: g(x) = 2 sqrt{x} cdot (log_{sqrt{2}}(x) + 2).

Finally, since f(x) is the absolute value of g(x), the minimum of f(x) is going to be non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) for x > frac{1}{2} is: boxed{0}. Note that for 0 < x < frac{1}{2}, the function inside the absolute value is negative, and taking the absolute value will result in the same non-negative function, so the minimum in this domain is also 0."},{"prompt":"Which of the following expressions does not yield the same result as 0.56÷0.08?

Then the recurrence relation becomes: [ b_n = frac{1}{3} b_{n-1} ] Since b_1 = a_1 - frac{1}{2} and given a_1 = frac{2}{3}, we find: [ b_1 = frac{2}{3} - frac{1}{2} = frac{4}{6} - frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{6} ] Thus, we can write: [ b_n = left(frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} b_1 = left(frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} times frac{1}{6} ] Therefore, substituting back for a_n: [ a_n = b_n + frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{3^{n-1}} cdot frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{6 cdot 3^{n-1}} + frac{1}{2} ] [ a_n = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2 cdot 3^{n-1}} ] Rewriting it, we get: [ a_n = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2 cdot 3^{n-1}} = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2 times 3^{n}} ] Finally, the expression for a_n simplifies to: [ a_n = frac{1}{2} left(1 + frac{1}{3^n}right) ] For the 4th shot, we substitute n = 4: [ a_4 = frac{1}{2} left(1 + frac{1}{3^4}right) = frac{1}{2} left(1 + frac{1}{81}right) = frac{1}{2} left(frac{81}{81} + frac{1}{81}right) = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{82}{81} = frac{41}{81} ] Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{41}{81}} ]"},{"prompt":"Which of the following statements is correct?

First, substitute ( x = 4 ) into the equation: [ (4-4)P(8) = 4(4-1)P(4) implies 0 = 12P(4) ] This implies ( P(4) = 0 ). Therefore, ( x = 4 ) is a root of ( P(x) ). 3.

Thus, g(x) is decreasing in (-infty, -2), increasing in (-2, 1), and decreasing in (1, +infty). Since f(x) has exactly two extreme points, f'(x) has two distinct sign-changing zeros.

For x in (-2, frac{-3 + sqrt{5}}{2}], we have h(x) < h(-2) = 0, which means g(x) < g(-4-x). Let x = x_2, then g(x_2) < g(-4-x_2). Also, since g(x_2) = g(x_1), we have g(x_1) < g(-4-x_2).

From our first equation, we have (f(b+b) = -b implies 2bf + b = 0). If (b neq 0), then (f = frac{-1}{2} < 0). However, as (f > 0), we must have (b = 0). Similarly, (c = 0). However, this would give (n) as (frac{0}{0}) which is undefined. Therefore, we discard all solutions with (a = b = c = 0). 9. **Positive Solutions**: - If (a > 0), then we similarly can find (b > 0), (c > 0). Thus, (a+b-c > 0), (a-b+c > 0), and (-a+b+c > 0), so a triangle can be formed. 10. **Conclusion**: - Thus, there are infinitely many (n) such that (p = nr).

As a special case, this problem includes problem 13, where x_{1} = alpha_{2} = ldots = alpha_{n} = 180^circ and n is odd. Step-by-Step Procedure: 1. **Assumption of Solution:** Assume we have an n-gon A_{1}A_{2}ldots A_{n} (as shown in given Figure 125 where n=6). 2. **Choose Arbitrary Point:** - Select an arbitrary point B_{1} on the plane. 3. **Sequence of Rotations:** - Perform successive rotations around points M_1, M_2, ldots, M_{n} by angles alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, ldots, alpha_{n} respectively. - This transforms segment A_{1}B_{1} into A_{2}B_{3}, A_{2}B_{8} into A_{3}B_{z}, and so on, until A_{n}B_{n} becomes A_{1}B_{n+1}. - All these segments are equal. 4. **Equidistant Property:** - Since all these transformations maintain equal segment lengths, vertex A_{1} of the n-gon is equidistant from points B_{1} and B_{n+1} (where B_{n+1} is obtained from B_{1} by the sum of n known rotations). 5. **Selection of Another Point:** - Now, select another arbitrary point C_{1}. - Rotate C_{1} sequentially around M_{1}, M_{2}, ldots, M_{n} by angles alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, ldots, alpha_{n} respectively, obtaining another pair of points C_{1} and C_{n+1}. 6. **Intersection of Perpendiculars:** - Since A_{1} is equidistant from the pairs (B_{1}, B_{n+1}) and (C_{1}, C_{n+1}), vertex A_{1} can be found as the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of segments B_{1}B_{n+1} and C_{1}C_{n+1}. 7. **Perpendicularity Condition:** - The task has a unique solution if the perpendicular bisectors of segments B_{1}B_{n+1} and C_{1}C_{n+1} intersect (i.e., the segments are not parallel). - If these perpendiculars are parallel, the problem has no solution. - If these perpendiculars coincide, the solution will be indeterminate. 8. **Vertices Construction:** - Once A_{1} is determined, rotate point A_{1} around M_{1} by angle alpha_{1} to find A_{2}. - Continue this process to find A_{3}, and so on until A_{n} by rotating each subsequent point by the corresponding angle around its center. 9. **Non-convexity and Self-Intersection:** - The resulting polygon might not be convex or might even be self-intersecting. Conclusion: The task has a unique solution when the perpendicular bisectors intersect and no solution when they are parallel. When the sum of angles alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, ldots, alpha_{n} is not a multiple of 360^circ, the problem has a unique solution, found as the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors.

We start by considering the sequence leftlfloor frac{2^n}{17} rightrfloor for n = 1, 2, 3, ldots. We need to show that this sequence contains infinitely many odd numbers. 2. Recall that lfloor x rfloor denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Therefore, for any integer k, we have: [ k le frac{2^n}{17} < k+1 ] Multiplying through by 17, we get: [ 17k le 2^n < 17(k+1) ] This can be rewritten as: [ 17k le 2^n < 17k + 17 ] 3. To ensure that leftlfloor frac{2^n}{17} rightrfloor is odd, we need k to be odd. This means we need to find values of n such that 2^n falls within an interval [17k, 17k+17) where k is odd. 4. Consider the residues of 2^n pmod{34}. We need 2^n equiv r pmod{34} where 17 le r < 34. This is because if 2^n equiv r pmod{34} and 17 le r < 34, then 2^n = 34m + r for some integer m, and: [ 17k le 34m + r < 17(k+1) ] Since 17 le r < 34, k must be odd. 5.

Given that both squares have the same orientation, point E will rotate to point G, and thus, the line BE becomes line DG. Since BE and DG are initially oriented similarly, rotating by 90^{circ} preserves this perpendicularity. 3. **Identification of Intersection Point M:** Due to the perpendicular relationship stated above, the lines BE and DG must intersect each other. We label their intersection point as M. To confirm this, consider that from point M, line BD appears at a 90^{circ} angle. This implies that M lies on the circumcircle of square ABCD, as any point viewed from a 90^{circ} angle lies on the circle circumscribed around the square (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem). 4. **Verification with Other Pairs of Lines:** Similarly, from M, line AC also appears at a 90^{circ} angle since M lies on the circumcircle. This confirms the perpendicularity of M with respect to lines involving A, C, and {C, F}. Finally, from M, AF is also viewed at a 90^{circ} angle, implying FM is perpendicular to AM. Consequently, we infer that points C, F, M must lie on a straight line. 5. **Validation by Combining Lines:** To comprehensively validate, consider any other pairs of lines: - Line CF from C passes through point M. - Similarly, lines BE and DG also pass through M, confirming that all lines intersect at the same point. # Conclusion: Given the step-by-step validation and the application of geometric transformations and the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we confirm that the lines BE, CF, and DG all intersect at a single point.

This subsequence will help us focus on particular values of n where the behavior of sin n and lceil sin n rceil is notable. 2. **Interval Analysis:** The integer n_k = lceil (2k-1)pi rceil is chosen since (2k-1)pi is not an integer but lies near a transition in the sine function. Specifically, (2k-1)pi < lceil (2k-1)pi rceil < 2kpi. Since pi > 3, these intervals span more than one unit length, ensuring lceil (2k-1)pi rceil is a valid integer. 3. **Sine Value in the Interval:** For these values, sin(lceil (2k-1)pi rceil) < 0, because the sine function is negative in the interval (2k-1)pi to 2kpi. Consequently, lceil sin(lceil (2k-1)pi rceil) rceil = 0. Thus, 1 + lceil sin n_k rceil = 1 + 0 = 1. 4. **Subsequence Terms:** The terms in the subsequence are given by: frac{1}{n_k^{1+lceil sin n_k rceil}} = frac{1}{n_k}. 5. **Bounding n_k:** We also know from the interval that n_k = lceil (2k-1)pi rceil < (2k-1)(pi+1). Therefore, frac{1}{n_k} > frac{1}{(2k-1)(pi+1)} > frac{1}{2(pi+1)cdot k}. 6. **Comparison Test:** The harmonic series sum_{k=1}^{infty} frac{1}{k} is known to diverge. Since sum_{k=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2(pi+1)k} is merely a constant factor times a harmonic series, it also diverges. Consequently, the subsequence sum sum_{k=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n_k} = sum_{k=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n_k^{1+lceil sin n_k rceil}} diverges. Hence, the original series, sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n^{1+lceil sin nrceil}}, must also diverge because it sums over more terms than just the subsequence. **Solution 2:** 1. **Intervals and Distribution:** Consider another approach by looking at the integers 5(m-1) + i for 1 leq i leq 5. These integers are spaced within any interval of length 4, which is greater than pi, ensuring that at least one value will be 0 when taking the ceiling of sin. 2. **Ensuring Sine Value:** Since lceil sin(5(m-1) + i) rceil = 0 holds for at least one value of i, this allows at least one term a_{5(m-1)+i} to be frac{1}{(5(m-1)+i)} where lceil sin(5(m-1)+i) rceil = 0. 3. **Sum and Comparison:** Define: a_n = frac{1}{n^{1+lceilsin nrceil}}, b_m = sum_{i=1}^{5} a_{5(m-1)+i}, c_m = frac{1}{5m}. Since b_m > c_m > 0, and given c_m = frac{1}{5m} describes a harmonic series that diverges, we apply the comparison test. 4. **Conclusion:** Since sum_{m=1}^{infty} c_m diverges and b_m > c_m, it follows by the comparison test that sum_{m=1}^{infty} b_m diverges as well. Therefore, our original series sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n^{1+lceil sin nrceil}} diverges. **Conclusion:** The series sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n^{1+lceil sin nrceil}} is divergent. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that the random variable X follows a normal distribution N(0,sigma^{2}), if P(X > 2) = 0.023, then the probability P(2 leqslant X leqslant 2) equals to?

For example, 0 is a rational number because it can be expressed as frac{0}{1}, and it is neither positive nor negative. Therefore, statement A is incorrect because it overlooks the possibility of a rational number being zero. **B: |a| is always a positive number.** - The absolute value |a| of a number a is defined as the distance of a from zero on the number line, without considering direction. This means |a| is non-negative, as distances cannot be negative. However, |a| can be zero if a=0. Therefore, statement B is incorrect because it states |a| is always positive, ignoring the case where |a|=0 when a=0. **C: The difference between two numbers is always less than the number being subtracted.** - Consider the example where we subtract a negative number from a positive number, such as 3-(-1).

If the sum of two numbers is positive, it means the combined value of these numbers is greater than zero.

Given that the tangent line l at x=1 is perpendicular to the line x+y+1=0, which has a slope of -1, the slope of l must be the negative reciprocal of -1, which is 1.

With a=1, we find f(1) to determine the y-intercept of the tangent line: f(1) = 1e^{1-1} - ln 1 - ln 1 = 1 - 0 - 0 = 1.

This can be rewritten as: f'(x) = (x+1)left(e^{x-a} - frac{1}{x(x+1)}right). Let h(x) = e^{x-a} - frac{1}{x(x+1)}. The derivative of h(x), h'(x) = e^{x-a} + frac{2x+1}{x^2(x+1)^2}, is positive for all x > 0, indicating h(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). Given 0 < a < frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}, we evaluate h(a) and find: h(a) = 1 - frac{1}{a(a+1)} = frac{a^2 + a - 1}{a(a+1)} < 0, and h(1) = e^{1-a} - frac{1}{2} > 0. This implies there exists x_0 in (a, 1) such that h(x_0) = 0. For x in (0, x_0), h(x) < 0 implies f'(x) < 0, and f(x) is decreasing. For x in (x_0, +infty), h(x) > 0 implies f'(x) > 0, and f(x) is increasing. Thus, x=x_0 is a minimum point for f(x). To prove f(x) > frac{a}{a+1}, we consider f(x_0) = frac{1}{x_0+1} - ln{x_0} - ln{a}. We aim to show: frac{1}{x_0+1} - ln{x_0} - ln{a} > frac{a}{a+1} + ln{a}. Let g(x) = frac{1}{x+1} - ln{x}. Since frac{1}{x+1} is decreasing and ln{x} is increasing for x > 0, g(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty). Given x_0 in (a, 1), we have x_0 < frac{1}{a}, leading to g(x_0) > g(frac{1}{a}).

The sum of the parallel sides for each trapezoid is the length of the diagonal plus the length of the side of the quadrilateral that is parallel to the diagonal. However, we are not given the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral, but we can still find the total area by considering the offsets as the heights of the trapezoids. The total area of the quadrilateral is the sum of the areas of the two trapezoids: Area of trapezoid 1 = 1/2 * (26 cm + side1) * 9 cm Area of trapezoid 2 = 1/2 * (26 cm + side2) * 6 cm Since we don't have the lengths of side1 and side2, we can't use this formula directly.

The following rule applies: Each new digit mentioned should belong to a different residue class modulo 3 than the one immediately before it. Since Bob gets to choose the last digit, he bets that he can make the number divisible by 3 in the end. Can Alice prevent this?","completion":"1. **Reducing the Problem**: We utilize a simplified set of digits {0, 1, -1} instead of the digits {0, 1, 2, ldots, 9}. This is feasible because in the decimal system, the congruence of a number modulo 3 is determined by the sum of its digits modulo 3. Specifically, any digit in {0, 1, 2, ldots, 9} can be reduced to an equivalent value in {0, 1, -1} modulo 3. For instance, 2 equiv -1 pmod{3} and 3 equiv 0 pmod{3}. 2. **Graph Representation**: The process of Alice and Bob selecting digits can be modeled as a path in a directed graph. This graph includes: - Vertices representing the state (s, z, S), where s is the current sum modulo 3, z is the last chosen digit, and S is the current player (either Alice or Bob). - An initial vertex I, symbolizing the start of the game. - Directed edges representing valid moves, where Alice and Bob alternate turns, and the newly chosen digit modulo 3 is different from the last chosen digit. 3. **Valid Moves**: From any given state (s, z, S), a move to (s', z', S') is valid if: - S neq S' (it is the other player's turn), - z' in {0, 1, -1} and z' neq z (the new digit must be different in its congruence), - s' equiv s + z' pmod{3} (the sum modulo 3 is updated based on the new digit chosen). Additionally, there are edges from the initial state I to (z, z, B) for all z in {0, 1, -1} for Bob's first turn. Each (s, z, S) state is equivalent to (-s, -z, S) because changing the signs of all digits up to that point still maintains the same alternating structure but with values changed in parity. 4. **Graph Analysis**: The game state after Bob's turn is always reachable by moving along paths in the graph. We need to analyze the structure of such paths to determine if Bob can force the sum modulo 3 to be zero at the end of the game, making the entire number divisible by 3. 5. **Winning Strategy for Alice**: By selecting specific moves, Alice can ensure that the sum at Bob's final turn modulo 3 is never zero. Diagrammatically: - In a directed graph (as shown in the referenced figures), Alice can force any path of length congruent to 2 pmod{4} to end up at states (1, 0, A), (1, 1, A), or (1, -1, A). - Consequently, any number constructed with a path of length 2018 equiv 2 pmod{4} ensures the final sum modulo 3 is 1, thus making the entire number not divisible by 3. 6. **Conclusion**: By following a strategy that always leads Bob to a sum of 1 pmod{3} on his final play, Alice can effectively prevent Bob from ensuring divisibility by 3. Therefore, Alice can prevent Bob from winning the bet. boxed{text{Alice can prevent Bob from making the number divisible by 3.}}"},{"prompt":"From a point P(2, 3) outside the circle x^2+y^2=1, draw a tangent to the circle.

We can do this by taking the last term, subtracting the first term, dividing by the common difference, and then adding 1 (since we're including both the first and last terms in the count). n = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1 n = (300 - 100) / 2 + 1 n = 200 / 2 + 1 n = 100 + 1 n = 101 Now we can find the sum: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) Sum = 101/2 * (100 + 300) Sum = 50.5 * 400 Sum = 20200 Therefore, the sum of all even integers between 99 and 301 is boxed{20,200} ."},{"prompt":"Find the smallest positive integer n that satisfies: (1) n has exactly 144 distinct positive divisors; (2) among the positive divisors of n, there are 10 consecutive integers.","completion":"1. **Understanding the given conditions:** begin{itemize} item Condition (1): The number ( n ) must have exactly 144 distinct positive divisors. item Condition (2): Among the positive divisors of ( n ), there must be 10 consecutive integers. end{itemize} 2. **Using divisor properties:** Given ( n ) has exactly 144 distinct positive divisors, we use the formula for the number of divisors: [ text{If } n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k} text{ (where } p_i text{ are prime factors)}, text{ then the number of divisors is } (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) cdots (a_k + 1). ] So, we write: [ (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) cdots (a_k + 1) = 144. ] 3. **Factoring 144:** The prime factorization of 144 is: [ 144 = 2^4 times 3^2. ] This gives us several ways to assign factors: [ 144 = 12 times 12,quad 144 = 9 times 16,quad 144 = 6 times 24,quad 144 = 8 times 18,quad text{etc.} ] 4. **Finding minimal ( n ):** To satisfy condition (2) (10 consecutive divisors), we note that ( n ) must be expressible with factors such that ( a_i geq 3 ), ( a_j geq 2 ), and ( a_k geq 1 ) for some primes ( p_i, p_j, p_k ).

Given a small positive (epsilon), evaluate ( P ) at small perturbations around the ( x )-axis and ( y )-axis: - Evaluate at ( (x, epsilon) ): Since ( epsilon > 0 ) and we want ( P(x, epsilon) > 0 ) for all ( x > 0 ). - Evaluate at ( (x, -epsilon) ): For ( -epsilon < 0 ), the requirement is ( P(x, -epsilon) leq 0 ) for any ( x > 0 ). 3. **Application of Continuity and Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT):** - By the continuity of the polynomial ( P(x, y) ), and since ( P(x, epsilon) > 0 ) and ( P(x, -epsilon) leq 0 ), the Intermediate Value Theorem implies that there must exist some ( y ) between (epsilon) and (-epsilon) where ( P(x, y) = 0 ). - To satisfy these conditions for all positive ( x ), it must be that ( P(x, 0) = 0 ). 4. **Symmetry and Evaluation at Zero:** - Apply a similar argument for the ( y )-axis. For small (epsilon > 0): [ P(epsilon, y) > 0 quad text{and} quad P(-epsilon, y) leq 0 ] - By continuity and IVT, this implies that ( P(0, y) = 0 ) for all positive ( y ). 5. **Factorization due to Zeros Along Axes:** - Since ( P(x, y) = 0 ) along both axes ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 0 ), it implies that ( (xy) ) is a factor of ( P(x, y) ). Hence, we can express: [ P(x, y) = xy Q(x, y) ] where ( Q(x, y) ) is another polynomial in ( x ) and ( y ). 6. **Reapplication to ( Q(x, y) ):** - If we now apply the same continuity and IVT argument to ( Q(x, y) ), then similarly: [ Q(x, epsilon) > 0 quad text{and} quad Q(x, -epsilon) leq 0 quad implies quad Q(x, 0) = 0 ] - And similarly for ( Q(0, y) = 0 ): [ Q(0, y) = 0 implies (xy) mid Q(x, y) ] 7. **Inductive Argument and Infinitude Issue:** - Repeating the factorization argument for ( Q(x, y) ), we eventually deduce that every successive polynomial obtained through iteration would similarly need to be factored by ( xy ), leading to an infinite descent. - This would entail ( P(x, y) ) ultimately being factored as: [ P(x, y) = (xy)^n R(x, y) ] for any ( n in mathbb{N} ) and where ( R(x, y) ) itself is a polynomial that, after sufficient iterations, tends to zero polynomial. 8. **Conclusion:** Since the continual factorization would eventually reduce ( P(x, y) ) to zero, ( P(x, y) ) must be the zero polynomial, contradicting the condition of being positive when both ( x ) and ( y ) are positive.

Because each domino is 1x2, each straight cut along the grid lines will intersect a multiple of 4 dominoes. 3. **Summing the Counts**: Sum the number of dominoes that each line intersects. This total number should be a multiple of 4 due to the problem’s given condition. 4. **Intersection Property**: Each domino is a 1x2 rectangle and thus each straight line along grid intersections will cut through exactly one domino (since each domino spans exactly two grid units). 5. **Total Domino Count Must Match Line Intersections**: Notice that any domino which is cut into two parts by a line contributes exactly to one count of the cut. Therefore, the sum of all these counts must equal the total number of dominoes used. If the sum of the counts by property is always divisible by 4, so must be the total number of dominoes. 6. **Relating Dominoes to Area**: Let the dimensions of the rectangle be (a times b). Since each domino covers 2 grid cells, the total number of dominoes is: [ text{Number of dominoes} = frac{a times b}{2} ] 7. **Divisibility Argument**: Given that this number of dominoes must be divisible by 4: [ frac{a times b}{2} equiv 0 pmod{4} ] 8. **Divisibility by 8**: Since (frac{a times b}{2} equiv 0 pmod{4}), we can multiply both sides by 2 to get: [ a times b equiv 0 pmod{8} ] This tells us the area of the rectangle must be divisible by 8. 9. **Analyzing Divisibility of Dimensions**: To be divisible by 8, at least one of the sides must contribute enough factors of 2. Thus, one of (a) or (b) must itself be divisible by 4 because: - If both (a) and (b) are only divisible by 2, then (a times b) would be divisible by 4, not 8. - Therefore, to ensure (a times b) to be divisible by 8, one of (a) or (b) must be divisible by 4. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{One of the rectangle's sides is divisible by 4.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Prove that there exist a positive integer ( n ) and linear forms ( P_{1}, ldots, P_{n} ) in 2017 variables such that the equation [ x_{1} cdot x_{2} cdot ldots cdot x_{2017} = P_{1}left(x_{1}, ldots, x_{2017}right)^{2017} + ldots + P_{n}left(x_{1}, ldots, x_{2017}right)^{2017} ] holds for all real numbers ( x_{1}, ldots, x_{2017} ).","completion":"We aim to show that for every integer ( k geq 1 ), there exists a positive integer ( n = n_k ), real numbers ( lambda_1, ldots, lambda_{n_k} ), and linear forms ( P_{k, 1}, ldots, P_{k, n_k} ) in ( k ) variables such that: [ x_1 cdot x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_k = lambda_1 P_{k,1}(x_1, ldots, x_k)^k + cdots + lambda_{n_k} P_{k, n_k}(x_1, ldots, x_k)^k ] Base Case ( ( k = 1 ) ): For ( k = 1 ): - Choose ( n_1 = 1 ). - Let ( P_{1,1}(x_1) = x_1 ).

Consider ( x_1 cdot x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_k cdot y ): By the induction hypothesis, we have: [ x_1 cdot x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_k = lambda_1 P_{k,1}(x_1, ldots, x_k)^k + cdots + lambda_{n_k} P_{k, n_k}(x_1, ldots, x_k)^k ] Multiplying both sides by ( y ), we get: [ x_1 cdot x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_k cdot y = lambda_1 P_{k,1}(x_1, ldots, x_k)^k y + cdots + lambda_{n_k} P_{k, n_k}(x_1, ldots, x_k)^k y ] Next, we need to express ( X^k y ) as a linear combination of ((k+1))-th powers of linear forms in (X) and ( y ): [ X^k y = sum_{i=1}^{m} alpha_i (X + beta_i y)^{k+1} ] To determine the coefficients ( alpha_i ) and ( beta_i ), we expand ((X + beta_i y)^{k+1}) using the binomial theorem: [ (X + beta_i y)^{k+1} = sum_{j=0}^{k+1} binom{k+1}{j} X^{k+1-j} (beta_i y)^j ] Equating coefficients of (X^k y), we obtain the system of equations: [ sum_{i=1}^{m} alpha_i = 0, quad sum_{i=1}^{m} alpha_i beta_i = frac{1}{k+1}, quad sum_{i=1}^{m} alpha_i beta_i^d = 0 , text{ for } d = 2, 3, ldots, k+1 ] Choosing ( m=k+2 ) and distinct values for ( beta_i )'s, we get a system of ( k+2 ) linear equations in ( k+2 ) variables (( alpha_i )'s). This system always has a solution because the coefficient matrix is a Vandermonde matrix, which is non-singular since ( beta_i ) are distinct. Thus, we have: [ X^k y = sum_{i=1}^{k+2} alpha_i (X + beta_i y)^{k+1} ] Therefore, we choose ( n_{k+1} = (k+2)n_k ), continuing our induction. Consequently, the induction hypothesis extends to ( k = 2017 ), and we get: [ x_1 cdot x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_{2017} = lambda_1 P_{2017,1}(x_1, ldots, x_{2017})^{2017} + cdots + lambda_{n_{2017}} P_{2017, n_{2017}}(x_1, ldots, x_{2017})^{2017} ] Expressing the result in terms of linear forms ( Q_i(x_1, ldots, x_{2017}) ): [ x_1 cdot x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_{2017} = left(lambda_1^{1/2017} P_{2017,1}(x_1, ldots, x_{2017})right)^{2017} + cdots + left(lambda_{n_{2017}}^{1/2017} P_{2017, n_{2017}}(x_1, ldots, x_{2017})right)^{2017} ] Thus, the desired equation holds for all real numbers ( x_1, ldots, x_{2017} ).

We want to show that the ray AB serves as the desired axis. 4. According to the problem, the length of the sum of any nine of these vectors is less than the length of the sum of all ten vectors. Mathematically, this can be represented as: [ |overrightarrow{AB} - mathbf{e}_i| < |overrightarrow{AB}| quad forall i. ] 5. To proceed, calculate the squared lengths: [ |overrightarrow{AB}|^2 = left(mathbf{e}_{1} + mathbf{e}_{2} + cdots + mathbf{e}_{10}right) cdot left(mathbf{e}_{1} + mathbf{e}_{2} + cdots + mathbf{e}_{10}right). ] 6. Similarly, the squared length of overrightarrow{AB} - mathbf{e}_i is: [ |overrightarrow{AB} - mathbf{e}_i|^2 = (overrightarrow{AB} - mathbf{e}_i) cdot (overrightarrow{AB} - mathbf{e}_i). ] 7. Expanding the right-hand side: [ |overrightarrow{AB} - mathbf{e}_i|^2 = |overrightarrow{AB}|^2 - 2 (overrightarrow{AB} cdot mathbf{e}_i) + |mathbf{e}_i|^2. ] Given the condition: [ |overrightarrow{AB}| > |overrightarrow{AB} - mathbf{e}_i|, ] Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we get: [ |overrightarrow{AB}|^2 > |overrightarrow{AB} - mathbf{e}_i|^2. ] 8. Substituting the expanded form of |overrightarrow{AB} - mathbf{e}_i|^2, we have: [ |overrightarrow{AB}|^2 > |overrightarrow{AB}|^2 - 2 (overrightarrow{AB}, mathbf{e}_i) + |mathbf{e}_i|^2. ] 9. By simplifying the inequality: [ 0 > -2(overrightarrow{AB}, mathbf{e}_i) + |mathbf{e}_i|^2, ] [ 2(overrightarrow{AB}, mathbf{e}_i) > |mathbf{e}_i|^2, ] 10. Given the positive definite nature of the inner product, it follows that: [ (overrightarrow{AB}, mathbf{e}_i) > 0. ] 11. Therefore, the projection of each vector mathbf{e}_i onto overrightarrow{AB} is positive. 12. Conclusion: There exists an axis (specifically, the direction of overrightarrow{AB} ) such that the projection of each of the ten vectors on this axis is positive.

On Saturday the laundromat closed at noon and he could only wash some loads of laundry. He washed 26 loads of laundry that week.

On Wednesday, he washed 6 loads. On Thursday, he washed double the number of loads he did on Wednesday, so that's 6 loads * 2 = 12 loads. On Friday, he could only manage half of the loads he did on Thursday, so that's 12 loads / 2 = 6 loads. Now, we know that he washed a total of 26 loads during the week. We can calculate the number of loads he washed on Saturday by subtracting the loads from Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total loads. Total loads (26) - Wednesday loads (6) - Thursday loads (12) - Friday loads (6) = Saturday loads 26 - 6 - 12 - 6 = 2 loads on Saturday. Now, to find the ratio of the number of loads he washed on Saturday to the number of loads he washed on Wednesday, we compare the loads on Saturday (2) to the loads on Wednesday (6).

First, we compute the ratio ( frac{f(x)}{g(x)} ): [ frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = frac{2x^2 + 2x - 4}{x^2 - x + 2} ] To simplify this, we perform polynomial division. Our goal is to rewrite ( frac{f(x)}{g(x)} ) in a more manageable form. Let's divide ( 2x^2 + 2x - 4 ) by ( x^2 - x + 2 ): 1. Perform the division: Notice that the leading term of ( f(x) ) is ( 2x^2 ), and the leading term of ( g(x) ) is ( x^2 ).

So, we need to include (2^2) for the 4, 3 for the 6 (and 3), 5 for the 5, and 7 for the 7. The LCM is therefore (2^2 times 3 times 5 times 7 = 4 times 3 times 5 times 7 = 12 times 35 = 420). Now we have the LCM, which is the smallest number that 3a, 7b, 5x, 4y, and 6z can all equal to while a, b, x, y, and z are positive integers. We can now find the values of a, b, x, y, and z by dividing the LCM by the respective coefficients: - (a = frac{420}{3} = 140) - (b = frac{420}{7} = 60) - (x = frac{420}{5} = 84) - (y = frac{420}{4} = 105) - (z = frac{420}{6} = 70) Now we can find the sum of these values: (a + b + x + y + z = 140 + 60 + 84 + 105 + 70 = 459) Therefore, the least possible value of a + b + x + y + z is boxed{459} ."},{"prompt":"the isosceles triangle ( ABC ) with ( AB = AC ) and angle ( A ) equal to ( alpha ), point ( D ) is taken on side ( AB ) such that ( AD = frac{AB}{n} ).

We are tasked with finding the sum of (n-1) angles, each of which is the angle subtended by the segment AD from points on BC that divide BC into n equal parts. **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. **Symmetry and Construction:** Construct point E on AC such that E is symmetric to D with respect to the altitude from A to BC. This puts points D and E as mirror images along the height of the triangle. 2. **Partial Angle Sum Explanation:** Notice that the total sum of angles subtended by DE from points K_i (where i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1) on BC is critical. Specifically, we need to account for the angles angle D K_i E. 3. **Symmetry Impact:** Due to the symmetry of D and E, the total subtended angle at K_i for segment AD is half that of segment DE. Therefore, the angle sum for AD is half the sum from DE: [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} angle D K_i A ] 4. **Parallelogram Property:** Since BD, DE and K_i form parallelograms: [ angle B D K_{1} = angle D K_{1} E, angle K_{1} D K_{2} = angle D K_{2} E, ldots, angle K_{n-2} D K_{n-1} = angle D K_{n-1} E ] 5. **Sum of Angles Equals Alpha:** The angles can be assembled into one larger angle alpha at A, hence showing: [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} angle D K_i E = alpha ] 6. **Halving the Sum:** Due to the relation angle D K_i A + angle A K_i E = angle D K_i E for each i, and the symmetry halving the effect: [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} angle D K_i A = frac{alpha}{2} ] **Conclusion:** So, the required sum of angles for an arbitrary n is: [ boxed{frac{alpha}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a geometric sequence ({a_n}) satisfying: (a_1=3), (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 = 21), then (a_3=)_______.","completion":"**Analysis** This problem examines the general formula of a geometric sequence.

This is a standard problem of ensuring connectedness in graph theory.

A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and for a graph with ( n ) nodes, a tree has exactly ( n - 1 ) edges. Below, I'll demonstrate why this is the solution using graph theory: 1. **Concept of Connected Graphs and Trees**: - A connected graph is a graph in which there is a path between any pair of nodes. - A tree is a specific type of connected graph that has no cycles and exactly ( n - 1 ) edges for ( n ) nodes. Since a tree is connected and has no cycles, adding more edges will still ensure connectivity. 2. **Application to the Problem**: - Given there are 2,004 settlements, if we aim to make a tree structure, the settlements (nodes) need ( 2,004 - 1 = 2,003 ) tunnels (edges) to remain connected without any cycles. 3. **Graph Theory Insight**: - Adding any more edges beyond ( 2,003 ) does not disrupt connectivity; it just adds additional redundant paths. So, ( N geq 2,003 ) is the condition to guarantee connectedness. 4. **Building Intuition with Smaller Examples**: - For instance, with 5 nodes, a connected structure (tree) requires exactly ( 5 - 1 = 4 ) edges to ensure connectivity. - Each new node in the tree adds exactly one additional edge to maintain connectivity: - ( 1 ) node requires ( 0 ) edges, - ( 2 ) nodes require ( 1 ) edge, - ( 3 ) nodes require ( 2 ) edges, - and so forth. Given the settlements and the necessary conditions, the smallest ( N ) that guarantees the connectivity of all 2,004 settlements is: [ N = 2,004 - 1 = 2,003 ] Hence, the smallest value of ( N ) is boxed{2003}."},{"prompt":"Jason has 44 blue marbles and 16 red marbles.

This implies that the point (O) lies on the median drawn from vertex (A) to side (BC). 5. **Symmetry from Other Vertices**: - Similarly, applying the same reasoning for median drawn from vertices (B) and (C) confirms that the point (O) must be the centroid of the triangle. The centroid is the intersection of all three medians of the triangle. 6. **Consequences of Medians Intersection**: - By construction and the properties of centroids, when the medians are intersected, point (O) divides each median in the ratio 2:1 and ensures the areas (S_{BOL}), (S_{COM}), and (S_{AON}) are equal, as required.

The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2 In triangle ABC, AC is the base, and BE is the height.

For deeper understanding and proofs of this statement, one can refer to problem solutions stated in references such as problem (underline{5.10}) and problem 14.37. 4. Additionally, another proof can be derived considering that the circumcircle is the isogonal conjugate of the line at infinity, which is represented by the equation: [ a x + b y + c z = 0 ] **(b) Incircle:** 1. The incircle of a triangle can be described by the trilinear equation: [ cos frac{alpha}{2} sqrt{x} + cos frac{beta}{2} sqrt{y} + cos frac{gamma}{2} sqrt{z} = 0 ] Here, (alpha), (beta), and (gamma) are the angles of the triangle at the vertices (A), (B), and (C) respectively. 2. Squaring the above equation, we obtain: [ begin{aligned} & cos^4 frac{alpha}{2} x^2 + cos^4 frac{beta}{2} y^2 + cos^4 frac{gamma}{2} z^2 & quad = 2 left( cos^2 frac{beta}{2} cos^2 frac{gamma}{2} yz + cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} cos^2 frac{beta}{2} xy + cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} cos^2 frac{gamma}{2} xz right) end{aligned} ] 3. To derive this equation, one can use the relationship that the incircle of triangle (ABC) can be visualized as the circumcircle of the triangle (A_1 B_1 C_1), where (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1) are the points of tangency of the incircle to the sides (BC), (CA), and (AB) respectively. 4. For further details, refer to problem (underline{2.58}). **(c) Excircle:** 1. The excircle tangential to side (BC) can be described by the equation in trilinear coordinates: [ cos frac{alpha}{2} sqrt{-x} + cos frac{beta}{2} sqrt{y} + cos frac{gamma}{2} sqrt{z} = 0 ] 2. Squaring the above equation, we get: [ begin{aligned} & cos^4 frac{alpha}{2} x^2 + cos^4 frac{beta}{2} y^2 + cos^4 frac{gamma}{2} z^2 & quad = 2 left( cos^2 frac{beta}{2} cos^2 frac{gamma}{2} yz - cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} cos^2 frac{beta}{2} xy - cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} cos^2 frac{gamma}{2} xz right) end{aligned} ] 3. The derivation of this equation follows similar steps as the derivation for the incircle equation. Conclusively, the respective equations of the circumcircle, incircle and excircle in trilinear coordinates have been obtained through the mentioned transformations and references.

We aim to prove that the mathematical expectation E(X) is positive. 3. Given that the probability density function ( f(x) ) is zero outside the interval [a, b), continuous, positive, and monotonically decreasing within [a, b), we analyze its behavior over this interval. 4. We can visualize the probability density function as a graph (see Figure 12 in the reference solution), where the graph is zero for x < a and x ge b, and is positive and decreasing for a le x < b. 5. We construct a mirrored symmetrical figure of the part of the graph of the density function on the segment [0, -a] relative to the y-axis.

In a triangular prism similar to (ABC A_1 B_1 C_1), the volumes created by such planes (from one plane dividing the prism into (4) regions) will generally result in one of these volumes being a specific fraction of the total volume of the prism.

The key volume-related fact is that in a standard triangular prism, such slicing generally results in parts being thirds or quarters of subdivided dimensions in variance with positioning.

Among all such sets of edges, choose the one with the minimum number of edges. This selected set of edges will not form a cycle. 5. **Reorient Edges:** Change the orientation of all edges in this set to the opposite direction while keeping the orientation of all other edges the same. This operation ensures that now an even number of edges emanate from (v_1) and (v_2) because reversing an edge changes the out-degree of both incident vertices by ±1. 6. **Remaining Vertices:** After reversing the edges, the out-degrees of vertices other than (v_1) and (v_2) remain unchanged. 7. **Iterative Process:** Repeat this process iteratively. Each step will decrease the number of vertices with an odd number of edges emanating from them. Eventually, all vertices will have an even number of edges emanating from them. 8. **Conclusion:** By repeating the steps above, we ensure every vertex has an even number of edges emanating from it. Therefore, it is possible to orient any connected graph with an even number of edges such that every vertex has an even number of edges coming out of it.

How many home runs did the Chicago Cubs score in the fifth inning?","completion":"Let's denote the number of home runs the Chicago Cubs scored in the fifth inning as X. The total number of home runs scored by the Chicago Cubs is the sum of the home runs from the third inning, the fifth inning, and the eighth inning.

Prove that the intersection of P and T is two circles.","completion":"The aim is to prove that the intersection of the plane ( P ) containing the center ( O ) of a torus ( T ) and touching ( T ) forms two circles. 1. **Torus Equation and Interpretation in 2D:** We start by considering the standard equation of the torus: [ (sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - a)^2 + z^2 = b^2, ] where ( a > b ). In the x-z plane, this torus appears as two circles of radius ( b ) centered at ( x = pm a ) and ( z = 0 ). 2. **Equation of the Plane ( P ):** The plane ( P ) passes through the origin and is tangent to both circles. Thus, it can be represented by a line in the x-z plane. The slope of the tangent line is determined by: [ frac{dz}{dx} = frac{b}{a}. ] Hence, the equation of plane ( P ) is of the form: [ z = kx, ] where ( k = sqrt{frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2}} ). 3. **Intersection Points on the y-axis:** The plane ( P ) intersects the torus at the points lying on the y-axis. These points are given by ( y = pm a, pm b ) which are a distance ( c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} ) away from the origin. 4. **Parametric Representation:** We consider parametric equations, substituting into the torus equation to verify the circles: [ x = c cos t, quad y = pm b + a sin t, quad z = b cos t. ] 5. **Substitution and Simplification:** For these parametric equations: [ sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = a pm b sin t. ] Then we have: [ (sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - a)^2 = b^2 sin^2 t, ] which leads to: [ (sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - a)^2 + z^2 = b^2 sin^2 t + b^2 cos^2 t = b^2. ] This verifies that the points lie on the torus. 6. **Unified Equation for Torus:** An alternate form of the torus equation can be derived: [ 2a sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + c^2. ] Squaring both sides and arranging terms results in: [ 4a^2 (x^2 + y^2) = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + c^2)^2, ] and further simplification gives: [ (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - c^2) ^2 = 4b^2 x^2 + 4b^2 y^2 - 4c^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). ] 7. **Plane and Sphere Intersection:** Simplifying further due to equalities, recognize: [ (x^2 + (y+b)^2 + z^2 - a^2) = (x^2 + (y-b)^2 + z^2 - a^2). ] This indicates that the intersection of plane ( P ) and torus ( T ) results in at most two circles, given that a plane can intersect a sphere at most in a circle. 8. **Final Conclusion:** As we have derived parametric forms showing two circles, we conclude the intersection indeed only contains two such circles.

This implies that the polygon must fit within a unit circle (a circle with radius 1). - The maximum area of a polygon inscribed in a unit circle is achieved by a regular polygon. However, since all diagonals are also constrained to be less than or equal to 1, we need to consider the specific case of a regular hexagon, which has the maximum area among polygons with the given constraints. 2. **Area of a Regular Hexagon**: - A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. Each side of the hexagon is 1, and the height ( h ) of each equilateral triangle is given by: [ h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] - The area ( A ) of one equilateral triangle with side length 1 is: [ A_{text{triangle}} = frac{1}{2} times 1 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] - Therefore, the area of the regular hexagon is: [ A_{text{hexagon}} = 6 times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} ] 3. **Comparison with the Given Bound**: - The area of the regular hexagon ( frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} ) is greater than ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ). However, since the diagonals of the hexagon are greater than 1, it does not satisfy the given constraints. - The largest polygon that fits within the constraints and has all sides and diagonals less than or equal to 1 is a regular triangle (equilateral triangle). 4. **Area of an Equilateral Triangle**: - The area of an equilateral triangle with side length 1 is: [ A_{text{triangle}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] 5. **Conclusion**: - Since the area of the equilateral triangle is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ), which is less than ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ), we conclude that the area of any polygon with the given constraints is less than ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).

We are given the equation of a numerical puzzle: [ mathrm{AX} + mathrm{YX} = mathrm{YPA} ] Where each letter represents a unique digit, and the same letter represents the same digit. 2. Since (mathrm{YPA}) is a three-digit number and (mathrm{YX}) and (mathrm{AX}) are both two-digit numbers, it is clear that (mathrm{Y} = 1). This is because the three-digit result must be greater than or equal to (100) and hence the hundreds place is (1). 3. Next, since (mathrm{A}) and (mathrm{Y}) need to be handled to ensure a three-digit result, (mathrm{A}) must be checked further. Particularly, (mathrm{A}) must be an even digit, otherwise the addition of two two-digit numbers will not guarantee an even sum in the unit's digit, i.e., the (A) at the end. 4. Additionally, (mathrm{A}) cannot be less than (8), otherwise the resultant three-digit number (mathrm{YPA}) may not be achievable. The reason is simple arithmetic logic: two two-digit numbers with the first digit less than (8) cannot add sufficiently to make a three-digit number with hundreds digit (1). 5. Thus, it makes (mathrm{A} = 8). Thus the problem so far has become: [ 89 + 19 = 1P8 ] 6.

Since the denominators are the same, equate the numerators: [ a d - b c = a c ] 4. Simplify the equation by isolating terms involving c: [ a d - b c - a c = 0 ] 5. Factor out c: [ a d - c(a + b) = 0 ] [ a d = c(a + b) ] 6. Alternatively, we can rewrite the original equation in another form: [ b c = a(d - c) ] 7. Given that the fractions frac{a}{b} and frac{c}{d} are irreducible, conclude that c must be a divisor of a and a must be a divisor of c. Therefore, a = c. 8. Substitute a = c back into our equation a d = c(a + b): [ a d = a(a + b) ] [ d = a + b ] 9. Thus, the fractions must take the form frac{a}{b} and frac{a}{a + b}.

Since 1/4 of the emails were spam, we calculate: Spam emails = 1/4 * 400 = 100 emails Now, let's find out how many emails were left after removing the spam emails: Remaining emails after removing spam = Total emails - Spam emails Remaining emails after removing spam = 400 - 100 = 300 emails We know that out of these 300 emails, 180 were important.

Consider a (2^{k+1} times 2^{k+1}) board with one square removed. This board can be divided into four (2^k times 2^k) boards, each with one square removed.

Adding 1 to three numbers is equivalent to subtracting 1 from the remaining number. We can repeatedly apply this move to make all numbers equal. 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for (2^k times 2^k) boards. Consider a (2^{k+1} times 2^{k+1}) board. Divide it into four (2^k times 2^k) quadrants. By the hypothesis, we can make all elements equal in each quadrant. 3. **Equalizing the Middle (2 times 2) Square**: After making all elements equal in each quadrant, we focus on the middle (2 times 2) square formed by the corners of the four quadrants. We can use the moves to make all numbers in this (2 times 2) square equal. 4. **Final Equalization**: Each quadrant now has all elements equal except for one corner. Using the (L)-triomino tiling, we can add 1's to each triomino until all numbers in the board are equal. Thus, by induction, (2^n) boards (including (n = 4) and (n = 1024)) are good.

Define ( m = n(1 + 10^C + 10^{2C} + cdots + 10^{(10^q-1)C}) ). Then, ( s(m) = 10^q s(n) = 10^{q+e} ). 4. **Simplify ( P(m) )**: Let ( u = 10^C ). We define ( c_{a,b} = [u^b] (1 + u + u^2 + cdots + u^{(10^q-1)C})^a ). Thus, ( P(m) = sum_{j=0}^k n^j sum_b c_{j,b} 10^{Cb} ). 5. **Analyze the separation of terms**: Choose ( C ) large enough such that the ( 10^{Cb} )'s are separate when ( b > 10^{(10^q-1)C cdot (k-1) + D} ) for some constant ( D ). This ensures ( s(P(m)) ge 10^q - D ). 6. **Consider the continuity of ( P )**: By considering ( n ) with ( s(n) = 10^e ), we note that ( n ) has ( C ) digits. For continuity, ( C ) can be larger.

If ( n ) has at least ( 10^{q+e-1} ) digits, changing ( n ) by ( O(1) ) will increment the first ( 10^{q+e} ).

This implies that ( P ) must be linear, i.e., ( P(x) = a_1 x + a_0 ). 11. **Determine the leading coefficient**: Since ( P ) is linear, the leading coefficient ( a_1 ) must be ( 1 ) or a power of ( 10 ) to satisfy the condition that the decimal representation of ( P(s(n)) ) contains the decimal representation of ( s(P(n)) ) as a contiguous substring.

Hence, point H is equidistant from all vertices A, B, C, D of the rectangle. 4.

At each step, it is allowed to choose an off lamp and change the state of its two neighboring lamps. Find all the initial configurations that allow reaching a configuration where only one lamp is off.","completion":"Let's break down the solution into a step-by-step process to determine the initial configurations of the lamps that allow us to reach a state with only one lamp off: 1. **Invariant Observation**: We start by noting an important invariant: the parity of the number of lamps that are off is preserved throughout the process. This means that if the number of lamps that are initially off is even, it will remain even at every subsequent step. Similarly, if the number is odd, it remains odd. - **Parity Proof**: At each step, you choose one lamp which is off and change the states of its two adjacent lamps. This operation changes the state (on to off or off to on) of exactly two lamps. Since you've changed two lamps, the total count of off lamps changes by 2, preserving the parity (i.e., an even number remains even, and an odd number remains odd). 2. **Initial Number of Off Lamps**: - If the initial number of off lamps is even, we can never reach a state with exactly one lamp off because 1 is odd. Therefore, for the solution, the initial number of off lamps must be odd. 3. **Handling Off-On Sequences**: We consider two main cases based on the configuration of off (O) and on (X) lamps: **Case 1: Off Lamps in Cluster**: - Suppose the off lamps (d_1, d_2, ..., d_i) form a cluster, where ( i geq 3 ) and ( i ) (the count of off lamps in a cluster) is odd. This means after these off lamps, the sequence continues with a number of on lamps such that the total remains 12. - Through each step, we choose every second lamp in the off sequence (e.g., d_2, d_4, ..., d_{i-1}). This process decreases the off lamp count by 2 for each selected lamp, effectively reducing the number of off lamps by 2 each time. - **Example**: For i=5 (odd), we pick lamps d_2 and d_4 which will toggle the states of their neighbors leading to an intermediate reduction, eventually leading to a simpler final configuration with one lamp off after repeated steps. **Case 2: Off Lamps Mixed with On Lamps**: - Suppose off lamps are interspersed with on lamps, forming small clusters or groups (e.g., k is the minimal number of on lamps separating the off lamps blocks). - Choose an off lamp d_i such that toggling the adjacent lamps brings the system simpler towards the form of Case 1. - **Reduction Process**: The goal is to reduce complex mixed cases into simpler clusters, leading eventually to Case 1 where orderly reduction can be applied consistently. 4. **Reiterative Reduction**: By continually applying these processes, the lamp configuration simplifies. If the initial number of off lamps is odd, iterative steps (choosing off lamps to toggle their neighbors) reduce the number of off lamps sequentially until only one off lamp remains. 5. **Conclusion**: Considering the invariant and the reduction processes, we deduce that any configuration starting with an odd number of off lamps can be reduced to a single off lamp. Conversely, configurations starting with an even number of off lamps can't yield a final state with just one lamp off. Hence, the configurations that allow a single off lamp as the final outcome are those with an odd number of initially off lamps.

Method I: 1. **Identify the longest diagonal**: Let (ABCDE) be the convex, equilateral pentagon.

These angles can be no more than 90 degrees each, if and only if both are exactly 90 degrees. Therefore, (P) should coincide with (B), the point on (AC). 3. **Midpoint of diagonal (AC)**: Since triangle (ABC) is isosceles with (AB = BC), the perpendicular dropped from (B) bisects (AC), thus determining (B) is the midpoint (F) of (AC). 4. **Relative position of vertices**: Vertex (E) is on the side of (AC) that does not contain (B), and the same applies to other vertices we will use in further steps. 5. **Segments and circles**: The perpendicular from (B) meets (AC) at (F). Points (E) and (D) must adhere to specific arc constraints defined by the circles centered at (A) passing through (B) and centered at (C) passing through (A). 6. **Constraints and positioning**: Points (E) and (D) should be located on arcs such as (BG) and smaller arcs that emphasize them being within their relevant sectors, avoiding contradictions inherent in the convexity requirement. 7. **Angle properties**: For angles (AFE) and (CFD) less than 90 degrees, and their sum being more than 90 degrees guarantees (DE) is also under 90 degrees from (F). 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, from (F) (the midpoint of (AC)), all sides (AE), (CD), and (DE) (along with other sides ensured by symmetry) are seen under angles of at most 90 degrees. blacksquare Method II: 1. **Assume the longest diagonal**: Let (AC) be the longest diagonal of pentagon (ABCDE). 2. **Using the midpoint (F) of (AC)**: Examine whether from (F) the sides (CD), (DE), and (EA) form angles less than 90 degrees. 3. **Triangle properties**: Within triangle (ACD), since (AD leq AC), angle (ADC) in triangle (ACD) is at least angle (ACD). Relative angles in triangle (CDE) also inform us that related angles (CDE) and (DCE) are such that they fulfill similar required constraints (CDE, DEA < 90^circ). 4. **Positional symmetry**: As (E) is on the perpendicular bisector pertinent to segment (AC), falling at the midpoint ensures optimal angle positioning. 5. **Angle propagation**: Repeatedly applying these principles confirms sides (DE, EF), and (EF, FA) meet necessary angle conditions. 6. **Contrapositive consideration**: Each triangle's opposing side consideration, with assumed properties and constraints confirms there can’t be a violation leading to contradictions. 7. **Final positional argument**: Thus proving (DE) does not exceed each triangle’s individual constraints confirms that angles concerning (F) (midpoint (AC)) will always be in line. blacksquare # Note: 1.

Since E D E' O forms a cyclic quadrilateral, angle E D E' = 180^circ - 2alpha where alpha is half of angle E D E'. 4. **Construct the required geometric entities:** - Find the reflection of A across the line O Y, noted as A'. Connect this reflection A' to point B. - Construct the circumcircle passing through points A', B, and the new points such that the central angles subtending arc A' B are 180^circ - 2alpha. 5. **Intersection to find point D:** - The intersection of this circumcircle with line O Y will yield the desired point D. Therefore, the required construction steps are as follows: - Reflect A across O Y to get A'. - Draw the line A' B. - Construct the circumcircle through A', B ensuring subtended angles of 180^circ - 2alpha. - The intersection of this circle with O Y is the point D we seek. # Conclusion: The solution finds the point D considering the symmetry across O Y and the relationship between the reflected points and angles formed.

However, if (2^n(p - 1) + 1) is composite, it must have a divisor of the form (3k + 1), contradicting our assumption. Thus, (3) must be in (A). 3. **Proving (4) and (5) are in (A):** - Since (3) is in (A), we can use the properties of (A) to show that (4) and (5) are also in (A). - For (4), since (2) is in (A), (2 cdot 2 + 1 = 5) is in (A). Then, (4) being a divisor of (5) must also be in (A). - For (5), since (2) and (3) are in (A), (2 cdot 3 + 1 = 7) is in (A). Then, (5) being a divisor of (7) must also be in (A). 4. **Induction Step:** - Assume (A) contains all integers from (1) to (n-1). We need to show that (n) is in (A). - If (n) is odd, then (2 cdot frac{n-1}{2} + 1 = n) is in (A). - If (n) is even, then (2 cdot frac{n}{2} + 1 = n + 1) is in (A). Since (n + 1) is in (A), (n(n - 1) + 1 = n^2) is in (A), implying (n) is in (A). By induction, we have shown that if (A) contains at least three positive integers, then (A) contains all positive integers.

When this bacterium divides into two, the descendants from these two \\"sister\\" bacteria can be denoted by m' and m'' such that: m' + m'' = m. 2. **Analyzing the division:** Since m' + m'' = m, at least one of m' or m'' must be at least frac{m}{2}.

To minimize this number, we must choose the segments such that: - Each unit triangle has exactly one edge chosen. - As many segments as possible belong to two triangles rather than just one (so that we kill two birds with one stone). 3. **Coloring the Triangles**: Color all of the upward-facing triangles black and all of the downward-facing triangles white. There are (frac{n(n+1)}{2}) black triangles and (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) white triangles. 4. **Choosing Segments**: For each white triangle, choose a black triangle (not already chosen) that is adjacent to the white triangle, and choose the segment that is shared by both triangles. This gives (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) segments chosen (one from each black triangle-white triangle pair). 5. **Remaining Black Triangles**: There are now (frac{n(n+1)}{2} - frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n) black triangles that do not belong to any pair. Choose one segment from each of these triangles, for a total of (n) additional segments.

From the above analysis, the maximum achievable projected area is at (varphi = frac{2pi}{3}), giving: [ Pi = S = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"(1) Calculate: |1|+sqrt{9}sqrt[3]{8}+left(pi +1right)^{0}(frac{1}{2})^{2}|sqrt{3}2|; (2) Solve the equation: frac{2}{x^{2}4}+frac{x}{x2}=1.","completion":"# Problem 1: Calculation We start with the expression: -|-1|+sqrt{9}-sqrt[3]{-8}+left(pi +1right)^{0}-(frac{1}{2})^{-2}-|sqrt{3}-2| Breaking it down step by step: 1. -|-1| simplifies to -1 because the absolute value of -1 is 1, and the negative sign outside makes it -1. 2. sqrt{9} simplifies to 3 because 3^2 = 9. 3. -sqrt[3]{-8} simplifies to 2 because -2^3 = -8. 4. left(pi +1right)^{0} simplifies to 1 because anything to the power of 0 is 1. 5. -(frac{1}{2})^{-2} simplifies to -4 because (frac{1}{2})^{-2} = 4. 6. |sqrt{3}-2| simplifies to 2-sqrt{3} because sqrt{3} < 2, so the absolute value changes the sign of the expression inside.

We will consider the properties of lattice points and the geometry of squares. 1. **Understanding Lattice Points and Squares**: A lattice point is a point in the plane where both coordinates are integers. A square in the plane can be positioned such that its sides are either parallel or not parallel to the axes. For simplicity, we consider squares aligned with the axes first. 2. **Positioning the Square**: Let's consider a square of side length s positioned such that its vertices are at lattice points. The simplest case is when the square is aligned with the axes, and its bottom-left vertex is at the origin (0,0). The other vertices will be at (s,0), (0,s), and (s,s). 3. **Counting Interior Lattice Points**: For a square aligned with the axes, the lattice points that are strictly inside the square (not on the boundary) have coordinates (x,y) where 1 leq x < s and 1 leq y < s. The number of such lattice points is (lfloor s rfloor - 1)^2. 4. **Adjusting the Square for Three Interior Points**: We need (lfloor s rfloor - 1)^2 = 3. Solving this equation, we find that lfloor s rfloor - 1 = sqrt{3}, so lfloor s rfloor approx 2.732. Thus, s must be slightly larger than 2.732 + 1 = 3.732. 5. **Considering Diagonal Squares**: If the square is rotated such that its diagonal is horizontal or vertical, the side length of the square is related to the diagonal by s = frac{d}{sqrt{2}}, where d is the length of the diagonal. If the diagonal is sqrt{5} (the smallest diagonal that can span more than one lattice unit both horizontally and vertically), then s = frac{sqrt{5}}{sqrt{2}} approx 1.581. 6. **Finding the Maximum Area**: The area of the square is s^2. If s approx 3.732 from the aligned case, the area is approximately 3.732^2 approx 13.927. However, this does not match any of the options given. We need to reconsider the configuration or calculation. 7. **Re-evaluating the Problem Statement**: The problem asks for the largest square that contains exactly three lattice points in its interior. We need to consider configurations where the square is not necessarily aligned with the axes or where the side length is calculated differently. 8. **Correcting the Approach**: Upon re-evaluation, if we consider a square with vertices at lattice points and one additional interior point, we can position the square such that it contains exactly three lattice points in its interior by adjusting its size and orientation. The side length of such a square can be slightly less than sqrt{5}, as the diagonal of a unit square (spanning from (0,0) to (1,1)) is exactly sqrt{2}, and we need a bit more than twice this length to include three points. 9. **Conclusion**: The closest answer that matches our re-evaluated understanding is sqrt{5} approx 2.236, and squaring this gives approximately 5.0. Thus, the area of the largest square that contains exactly three lattice points in its interior is closest to boxed{textbf{(D) } 5.0}."},{"prompt":"Expand (4d)(d+2(4d)).

If Petya distributes 5 stickers to each friend, he will have 8 stickers left. 2. If he distributes 6 stickers to each friend, he will be short of 11 stickers. To find out how many friends Petya has, we solve the problem methodically. Method I: 1. **Initial Distribution**: Petya distributed 5 stickers to each of his friends. 2. **Adding One More Sticker**: To give each friend one more sticker (totaling 6 stickers each), Petya needs an additional 8 + 11 = 19 stickers. 3. **Friends Calculation**: The additional stickers represent the number of friends he has because he gives 1 additional sticker to each friend. Thus, Petya has 19 friends.

Starting from the 7th month, the income of each month increases by 20,000 more than the previous month. Then, starting from the use of the new equipment, the enterprise needs ______ months to repay the 4 million interestfree loan with the income obtained. (Round the result to the nearest whole number)","completion":"To solve the problem, let's break down the solution into detailed steps: 1. **Defining the Monthly Income Sequence**: The monthly income of the enterprise after the equipment renewal can be represented by the sequence {a_{n}}. The first month's income is given as 200,000 yuan, which we will represent in ten-thousands as 20 (to simplify calculations), so a_{1}=20. 2. **Income for the First 6 Months**: For the first 6 months, the income increases by 20% each month compared to the previous month. This forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio q=1.2. The total income S_{n} for the first n months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence: [ S_{n}=frac{a_{1}(1-q^{n})}{1-q}=frac{20(1-1.2^{n})}{1-1.2}=100(1.2^{n}-1) ] Specifically, for n=6, we have: [ S_{6}=100(1.2^{6}-1)approx 100(2.986-1)=198.6 ] 3. **Income from the 7th Month Onwards**: Starting from the 7th month, the income increases by 20,000 yuan more than the previous month, which translates to an increase of 2 in our ten-thousand simplified representation. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference d=2. The total income S_{n}' from the 7th month onwards can be represented as: [ S_{n}'=S_{k}=ka_{7}+frac{k(k-1)}{2}times 2=20times 1.2^{6}times k+k^{2}-kapprox k^{2}+58.72k ] where k is the number of months starting from the 7th month. 4. **Calculating the Total Months Needed to Repay the Loan**: The total income needed to repay the 4 million yuan loan is represented in our ten-thousand simplified unit as 400. Combining the income from the first 6 months and the subsequent months, we get: [ k^{2}+58.72k+198.6geqslant 400 ] Simplifying, we find: [ k^{2}+58.72k-201.4geqslant 0 ] Solving this quadratic inequality for k, we find: [ kgeqslant frac{-58.72+sqrt{58.72^{2}+4times 201.4}}{2}approx frac{-58.72+65.22}{2}=3.25 ] Since k must be a whole number (as it represents months), the minimum value of k that satisfies the inequality is 4. 5. **Final Calculation**: Therefore, the total months needed for the enterprise to repay the 4 million yuan interest-free loan is the sum of the first 6 months and the additional 4 months calculated from the 7th month onwards, which is 6+4=10 months. Hence, the enterprise needs boxed{10} months to repay the 4 million interest-free loan with the income obtained."},{"prompt":"a garden, 26 trees are planted at equal distances along a yard of a certain length, one tree being at each end of the yard.

Consider the maximum value achievable by plugging in specific values: Assume (alpha = beta = frac{pi}{6}), which leads to: [ a = tan{frac{pi}{6}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}, quad c = tan{frac{pi}{6}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}. ] Then: [ b = tan(frac{pi}{6} + frac{pi}{6}) = tan(frac{pi}{3}) = sqrt{3}. ] 6.

To minimize b = r + s, we should choose r and s such that their product rs = 1764 and their sum r + s is the smallest.

What is the measure of (angle DAC)?","completion":"Given a triangle ABC with angles angle B = 60^circ and angle C = 75^circ. On side BC, which is the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle BDC constructed inside triangle ABC, determine the measure of angle DAC. # 1: 1. **Determine Angle angle A:** - Since the sum of the internal angles in a triangle is 180^circ, we have: [ angle A + angle B + angle C = 180^circ ] - Substitute the given angles: [ angle A + 60^circ + 75^circ = 180^circ ] - Solving for angle A: [ angle A = 180^circ - 60^circ - 75^circ = 45^circ ] 2. **Construct the Circumcircle and Identify Important Properties:** - Draw a circumcircle around triangle BDC with center M and radius MB = MC. Since angle BDC = 90^circ, we observe that DBC is inscribed in this circle. - The arc overarc{BC} subtended by angle BDC spans 180^circ because it is a semicircle (right angle inscribed in a circle). 3. **Analyze the Arc and Determine Optimal Positioning of Point A:** - The angle inscribed by the larger arc BMC is half of the subtended arc, hence: [ angle BAC = 45^circ ] - Thus, point A must be on this circle for angle DCA to equal 45^circ, which implies that angle DAC is the remaining angle. 4. **Identify angle DAC:** - Since ABC is an isosceles right triangle with angle ABC being 45^circ, we can conclude by subtraction from angle at AC: [ angle DAC = angle DCA - angle DCB = 75^circ - 45^circ = 30^circ ] # 2: 1. **Consider Side Lengths and Use Trigonometric Relations:** [ BC = a ] - From triangle BMC, noting DC = frac{a}{sqrt{2}} (due to the 45-degree properties): - From triangle ABC using the sine rule: [ frac{BC}{sin 45^circ} = frac{AC}{sin 60^circ} Rightarrow AC = a sqrt{frac{3}{2}} ] 2. **Apply the Law of Cosines in Triangle CDA:** [ AD^2 = CD^2 + CA^2 - 2 cdot CD cdot CA cdot cos(angle DCA) ] [ AD^2 = frac{a^2}{2} + frac{3a^2}{2} - 2 cdot frac{a}{sqrt{2}} cdot a sqrt{frac{3}{2}} cos(30^circ) ] With cos(30^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}: [ AD^2 = frac{a^2}{2} + frac{3a^2}{2} - frac{2a^2}{sqrt{2}} cdot sqrt{frac{3}{2}} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{a^2}{2} ] [ Rightarrow AD = frac{a}{sqrt{2}} ] 3. **Final Conclusion for Angle DAC:** - Since AD and DC are equal lengths, triangle ADC is isosceles.

This establishes our hypothesis. 2. **Last Step Consideration**: Consider the last action taken to equalize the stacks. In this step, we removed a piece of paper from some stack. 3. **Post-Removal Condition**: After removing this sheet, the remaining number of sheets in **all** stacks became equal (let’s denote this number as ( k )). 4. **Pre-Removal Condition**: Immediately before the last piece of paper was removed: - The stack from which the piece was removed had ( k + 1 ) sheets. - All other stacks had ( k ) sheets. 5. **Operational Requirement**: For a piece of paper to be removed from any stack, the problem's condition states there must exist another pair of stacks with differing numbers of sheets. 6. **Contradiction**: To perform the last removal of a sheet and make all stacks equal, the condition would not be met, as all other stacks would have had the same number of sheets, ( k ). Thus, there would be no two stacks with a different number of sheets needed to satisfy the requirement for removal. # Conclusion: Thus, it is not possible to make the number of sheets of paper in all stacks equal given the constraints. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"f you subtract the area of the internal triangle from the sum of the areas of the external triangles, you get twice the area of triangle (ABC).","completion":"We are given a geometric problem involving a triangle ABC where we need to analyze the relationship between the areas of certain segments and triangles in the given diagram. 1. **Define Areas of Interest**: - Let x, y, and z be the areas of the curved triangles formed by the external circles around triangle{ABC}. - Let u be the area of the central curved triangle enclosed by the three external circles. - Let a, b, c, d, e, and f be the areas of the segments cut off by the sides of triangle{ABC}. - Let p, q, and r be the areas of the regions of the triangle{ABC} that lie outside the central curved triangle but within the areas bound by the circles. 2. **Set Up Area Equations**: By examining the geometric characteristics and ensuring that all areas internal to the larger triangle triangle{ABC} are accounted for, we can write the following equations: [ x + (a + b) = u + p + q + (c + f) ] [ y + (c + d) = u + q + r + (e + b) ] [ z + (e + f) = u + r + p + (a + d) ] 3. **Sum the Equations**: By adding the left-hand sides and the right-hand sides of the three equations, we obtain a comprehensive area equation: [ (x + y + z) + (a + b + c + d + e + f) = 3u + 2(p + q + r) + (a + b + c + d + e + f) ] Since a + b + c + d + e + f appears on both sides, we can cancel it: [ x + y + z = 3u + 2(p + q + r) ] 4. **Simplify the Equation**: We know that the total area of the triangle ABC, which includes all areas mentioned, can be decomposed into: [ triangle ABC = u + p + q + r ] Therefore, our equation becomes: [ x + y + z = 2(triangle ABC) ] # Conclusion: The combined areas of the curved triangles (x + y + z) minus the area of the inner curved triangle (u) equals twice the area of the original triangle triangle ABC: [ boxed{x + y + z - u = 2 times (triangle ABC)} ]"},{"prompt":"Jane is looking at a tree.
