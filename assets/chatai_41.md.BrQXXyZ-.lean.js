Thus, the only possible prime is ( p_1 = 2 ), which is not feasible since ( 2^{13} = 8192 ) > 2000. Therefore, ( k = 1 ) is not possible. 4. **For ( k = 2 ):** [ d(N) = ( alpha_1 + 1)( alpha_2 + 1 ) = 14 ] The valid combinations are: [ (alpha_1 + 1, alpha_2 + 1) = (2, 7) text{or} (7, 2) ] Which implies: [ (alpha_1, alpha_2) = (1, 6) text{or} (6, 1) ] 5. **Case ( alpha_1 = 6 ) and ( alpha_2 = 1 ) without loss of generality:** Hence, the number ( N ) can be written as: [ N = p_1^6 cdot p_2 ] And for ( N ) to be a four-digit number: [ p_1^6 cdot p_2 < 2000 ] 6. **Finding possible primes (( p_1 ) and ( p_2 )):** - For ( p_1 ), checking: [ 2^6 = 64 ] Which gives ( N = 64 cdot p_2 ).

This is possible using a snake-like configuration. - Label the squares from 1 to 64 in the order of this loop, so square 64 is adjacent to square 1. 4. **White Squares:** - Let ( w_1, w_2, ldots, w_{2k} ) be the positions of the white squares in this loop. Since the number of black squares is even, the number of white squares is also even. 5. **Claim:** - If ( w_i ) and ( w_{i+1} ) are both white, we can make them and all squares between them black within ( w_{i+1} - w_i ) moves. 6. **Proof of the Claim:** - Draw an arrow between ( w_i ) and ( w_{i+1} ) within the closed loop. - We can move the white square at ( w_i ) to ( w_i + 1 ), ( w_i + 1 ) to ( w_i + 2 ), and so on, until it becomes adjacent to ( w_{i+1} ). - When ( w_i ) and ( w_{i+1} ) are adjacent, we can flip both to black in one move. - Thus, all squares on the arrow will become black in ( w_{i+1} - w_i ) moves. 7. **Calculating the Steps:** - We can make all squares black in ( s_1 = (w_2 - w_1) + (w_4 - w_3) + cdots + (w_{2k} - w_{2k-1}) ) moves. - Alternatively, we can make all squares black in ( s_2 = (w_3 - w_2) + (w_5 - w_4) + cdots + (w_1 - w_{2k}) ) moves. - Since ( s_1 + s_2 = 64 ), at least one of ( s_1 ) or ( s_2 ) is less than or equal to 32. 8. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, the maximum number of steps required to make all squares black is ( boxed{32} )."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=x^{3}+ax^{2}x+c, and a=f′( frac {2}{3}).

Since the bus takes 40 minutes and Amanda's car takes 5 fewer minutes, Amanda's car takes 40 - 5 = 35 minutes to complete the trip to the beach. Now, let's calculate the total distance Amanda's car travels with the detour. The detour adds an additional 15 miles each way, so for a round trip, the detour adds 15 miles * 2 = 30 miles to the total distance. The original distance for a round trip without the detour is 120 miles * 2 = 240 miles. With the detour, the total distance for a round trip is 240 miles + 30 miles = 270 miles. Now, we need to find out how long it takes Amanda's car to travel these 270 miles. We know that Amanda's car takes 35 minutes to travel 120 miles one way. To find out how long it takes to travel 270 miles, we can set up a proportion: 120 miles / 35 minutes = 270 miles / x minutes Cross-multiply to solve for x: 120 * x = 35 * 270 x = (35 * 270) / 120 x = 9450 / 120 x = 78.75 minutes So, it takes Amanda's car 78.75 minutes to make a round trip to the beach with the detour.

We need to determine the smallest possible value of (a_n) for each (n ge 1). 2. **Base Cases:** - For (n = 1), the smallest possible value of (a_1) is (2). This is because (a_0) can be (1) and (a_1) can be (2), and (2 - 1 = 1) which is not a prime. - For (n = 3), the smallest possible value of (a_3) is (11). This can be achieved with the sequence (1, 2, 10, 11). Here, (2 - 1 = 1), (10 - 2 = 8), (11 - 10 = 1), and (11 - 1 = 10), none of which are primes. 3. **General Case:** For (n not in {1, 3}), we claim that the smallest possible value of (a_n) is (4n + 1).

These are consecutive positive integers that are not prime. The smallest such pair is (8) and (9). - Therefore, (a_n - a_{n-2} ge 9).

Since P is equidistant from points A and B, P must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB. The midpoint of AB is M(-1,2), and the slope of AB is frac{4 - 0}{0 - (-2)} = 2. The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of 2, which is -frac{1}{2}. Using the point-slope form, the equation of the perpendicular bisector can be expressed through M as: y - 2 = -frac{1}{2}(x + 1) Solving for y gives the equation of the perpendicular bisector as: 2y = -x + 3 Hence, y = -frac{1}{2}x + frac{3}{2} Next, we find the minimum value of the expression 2^x + 4^y using the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), which states that for non-negative real numbers a and b: frac{a+b}{2} geq sqrt{ab} Equality holds if and only if a = b.

The cost of each box is 40. The supermarket stipulates that the selling price of each box must not be less than 45. Based on past sales experience, it was found that when the selling price is set at 45 per box, 700 boxes can be sold per day. For every 1 increase in the selling price per box, 20 fewer boxes are sold per day. (1) Find the functional relationship between the daily sales volume y (boxes) and the selling price per box x (in dollars). (2) At what price per box should the selling price be set to maximize the daily profit P (in dollars)? What is the maximum profit? (3) To stabilize prices, the relevant management department has set a maximum selling price of 58 per box for this type of zongzi. If the supermarket wants to make a profit of at least 6000 per day, how many boxes of zongzi must be sold per day at least?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Functional Relationship Given that the base selling price is 45 and the base sales volume is 700 boxes. For every 1 increase in the selling price, the sales volume decreases by 20 boxes. We can express the relationship between the daily sales volume y and the selling price per box x as follows: 1. Let x represent the selling price per box. 2. Let y represent the daily sales volume in boxes. The change in sales volume relative to the base price of 45 can be represented as 700 - 20(x - 45). Simplifying this expression gives us: [ y = 700 - 20(x - 45) = 700 - 20x + 900 = -20x + 1600 ] Therefore, the functional relationship is y = -20x + 1600 for 45 leq x leq 80. Part 2: Maximizing Daily Profit To find the selling price per box that maximizes daily profit, we first express the daily profit P as a function of x: 1. The profit per box is (x - 40), where 40 is the cost per box. 2. The total profit P can be expressed as the product of profit per box and the number of boxes sold: P = (x - 40)(-20x + 1600). Expanding and simplifying gives: [ P = -20x^2 + 2400x - 64000 = -20(x^2 - 120x + 3200) = -20(x - 60)^2 + 8000 ] Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative (-20), the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum point. The vertex of this parabola, (60, 8000), gives the maximum profit and the corresponding selling price. Therefore, the selling price per box should be set at boxed{60} to maximize the daily profit, which is boxed{8000} dollars. Part 3: Selling Price to Achieve a Profit of at Least 6000 Given the maximum profit equation -20(x - 60)^2 + 8000 = 6000, we solve for x: [ -20(x - 60)^2 = -2000 ] [ (x - 60)^2 = 100 ] [ x - 60 = pm 10 ] This gives x_1 = 50 and x_2 = 70. Since the profit is at least 6000 for 50 leq x leq 70 and the maximum selling price is limited to 58, the effective range for x is 50 leq x leq 58. To find the minimum number of boxes that must be sold to achieve this profit, we use the sales volume equation y = -20x + 1600 at x = 58: [ y_{text{min}} = -20 times 58 + 1600 = 440 ] Therefore, the supermarket must sell at least boxed{440} boxes of zongzi per day to achieve a profit of at least 6000."},{"prompt":"Point ( O ) lies on segment ( AB ) with ( AO = 13 ) and ( OB = 7 ).

Now consider two cases: **Case 1:** |a| leq sqrt{3}: [ text{Then, } |b| geq frac{3 - a^2}{3} ] To find the minimum value of |a| + 2|b|: [ |a| + 2|b| geq |a| + 2 cdot frac{3 - a^2}{3} ] [ = |a| + 2 left(frac{3 - a^2}{3}right) ] [ = |a| + 2 left(frac{3 - a^2}{3}right) = frac{19}{8} - frac{2left(|a| - frac{3}{4}right)^2}{3} ] [ geq sqrt{3} ] **Case 2:** |a| > sqrt{3}: [ |a| + 2|b| geq |a| > sqrt{3} ] 7. In both cases: [ |a| + 2|b| geq sqrt{3} ] 8. When a = sqrt{3} and b = 0, we have: [ x_{1} = -1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, quad x_{2} = -frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, quad x_{3} = 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ] [ f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2}) = f(x_{3}) = frac{2sqrt{3}}{9} ] Hence, equality holds. # Conclusion: [ boxed{sqrt{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"an 8 times 8 chessboard, 16 squares are marked such that each row and each column contains exactly two marked squares. Prove that it is always possible to place 8 black pieces and 8 white pieces in the 16 marked squares such that each row and column contains exactly one black piece and one white piece.","completion":"To prove that it is always possible to place eight black and eight white chess pieces in 16 marked squares on an 8 times 8 chessboard such that each row and each column has exactly one black and one white piece: 1. Let's denote the 16 marked squares on the chessboard with coordinates (i,j), indicating row i and column j, where 1 leq i, j leq 8. We need to have each row and each column containing exactly one black piece and one white piece. 2. We can transform the problem into a bipartite graph problem. Construct a bipartite graph where one set represents the row indices {1, 2, ldots, 8}, and the other set represents the column indices {1, 2, ldots, 8}. Create an edge between row i and column j if the square (i,j) is marked. 3. The goal is to find a perfect matching in this bipartite graph, meaning every vertex in one set (rows) can be paired with a unique vertex in the other set (columns), and vice versa. **Detailed Proof:** 1. **Initial Setup:** Consider the bipartite graph mathbf{G} with two disjoint sets: - R (row set): {r_1, r_2, ldots, r_8}, - C (column set): {c_1, c_2, ldots, c_8}. Each vertex r_i (row i) is connected to vertex c_j (column j) if the cell (i,j) is marked. 2. **Degree Conditions:** - Each vertex in both R and C must have exactly 2 connections (since each row and column contains exactly 2 marked squares). 3. **Perfect Matching:** - A perfect matching in a bipartite graph mathbf{G} means there is a set of edges such that each vertex in set R is matched to exactly one vertex in set C, and vice versa. 4. **Hall’s Marriage Theorem:** - For a bipartite graph mathbf{G} with bipartition (R, C), there exists a perfect matching if and only if for every subset S subseteq R, the number of neighbors of S in C (denoted N(S)) is at least as large as |S|. - In our problem, since each row has exactly two marked squares and each column also has exactly two marked squares, this condition holds true universally. 5. **Algorithmic Construction:** - We will employ the technique of augmenting paths or use algorithms like the Hungarian algorithm to find the perfect matching. This ensures that each row and each column has one black and one white piece. Therefore, we can always find such an arrangement to meet the given conditions. # Conclusion: Therefore, a perfect matching exists, allowing for the placement of eight black and eight white chess pieces on the marked squares, such that each row and column contains exactly one black piece and one white piece. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"w many threedigit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4?","completion":"According to the question, each of the three positions (hundreds, tens, and ones) has 4 choices, since we can use any of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 without restrictions. - For the hundreds place, we can choose any one of the 4 digits. - Similarly, the tens place can also be filled with any one of the 4 digits. - The ones place also has 4 options to choose from.

When they work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: Combined work rate = a's work rate + b's work rate + c's work rate Combined work rate = (1/16) + (1/6) + (1/12) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 6, and 12 is 48.

Therefore, we need to find the number of ways to draw a line that separates the points into two groups with non-intersecting convex hulls. 3. **Key Observation** Consider a fixed point ( O ) not lying on any line connecting pairs of given points.

These ( n ) lines are such that no pair is parallel and no three of them intersect at a single point (as derived from the properties of the ( n ) points). 5. **Plane Partitioning by Polar Lines** It is known (refer to the problem from **task 60323**) that these ( n ) lines divide the plane into (frac{1}{2}n(n+1) + 1) regions, from which ( 2n ) are unbounded. 6. **Lemmas and Additional Observations** - **Lemma:** If ( a ) and ( b ) are polar lines of points ( A ) and ( B ), then the polar divisions correspond to parts of the plane. - Polar lines creating parts that intersect a segment ( AB ) lie in opposite vertical angles formed by the intersection of ( a ) and ( b ). 7. **Intersection Dynamics** - If a line ( l ) intersects segment ( AB ) at point ( X ), then polar of ( X ) passes through the intersection of ( a ) and ( b ). - As ( l ) rotates around ( X ), its polar moves along ( a ), thus restricting the separation properties. 8. **Combining Results** - **Proposition:** Two lines divide the set of points similarly if and only if the corresponding poles share the same bounded regions or they lie in unbounded regions. - **Cases:** The unique partition occurs when points lie entirely on one side. 9. **Total Calculation** The total number of unique lines can be determined as follows: - Considering each partition corresponds uniquely with one method of dividing the points among the ( 2n ) unbounded regions. - The regions form pairs, each representing a valid division plan, hence total ways would be: [ frac{1}{2} n(n+1) + 1 - 2n = frac{1}{2}n(n-1) + 1. ] So, excluding the degenerate case (all points in one subset): 10. **Conclusion** [ boxed{frac{1}{2} n(n-1)} ] ways to partition the given ( n ) points into two non-empty subsets with non-intersecting convex hulls."},{"prompt":"When Hannah was 6 years old, her age was double the age of her sister July.

How many different sequences of 15 coin tosses will contain exactly two HH, three HT, four TH, and five TT subsequences?","completion":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps, closely following the logic provided in the standard solution. **Step 1: Understanding the Sequence Structure** First, we recognize that adding HH or TT to a sequence doesn't change the last coin toss. This is because HH adds another head after a head, and TT adds another tail after a tail, effectively maintaining the sequence's ending. On the other hand, adding HT or TH changes the last coin from heads to tails or vice versa. Given that we have three HT and four TH operations, the last coin changes from H to T three times and from T to H four times. This alternating pattern suggests a sequence structure of THTHTHTH, where the transitions between T and H are dictated by the HT and TH operations. **Step 2: Incorporating TT and HH Subsequences** Next, we need to insert the TT and HH subsequences into our THTHTHTH structure. We have 5 TT subsequences to add, which means inserting 5 additional T's into the sequence. These T's must be adjacent to existing T's to form TT pairs. Similarly, we have 2 HH subsequences to add, requiring the insertion of 2 additional H's adjacent to existing H's. **Step 3: Calculating Combinations** For the TT subsequences, we're essentially placing 5 T's into the spaces adjacent to the 4 existing T's in our sequence. This scenario is akin to the balls-and-urns problem, where we have 5 balls (T's) and 4 urns (spaces adjacent to existing T's). However, since the T's are indistinguishable, we use dividers to represent the separation between adjacent T's, leading to 3 dividers. The number of ways to do this is calculated using the combination formula {{5+3}choose3}, which equals 56. For the HH subsequences, the process is similar. We have 2 H's to add to the sequence, adjacent to the existing H's. This is like placing 2 balls into 3 urns (since there are 4 H's in the sequence, creating 3 spaces between them). Using the combination formula {{2+3}choose3}, we find there are 10 ways to do this. **Step 4: Finding the Total Number of Sequences** Finally, to find the total number of sequences that meet the criteria, we multiply the number of ways to add TT subsequences by the number of ways to add HH subsequences.

The constraint is that any two cards share exactly one common picture. 1. We start by labeling the 12 different animal pictures as (1, 2, ldots, 12). 2. Consider the scenario when a specific picture, say picture 1, is common between cards. We aim to create as many unique cards involving picture 1 without repeating any combination of other pictures. To achieve this, let's create the following cards: [ (1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 5, 6, 7), (1, 8, 9, 10) ] Each of these cards contains the picture 1, and the other pictures are all unique. 3.

We can have: [ (2, 5, 8, 11), (2, 6, 9, 12) ] Here, each card has picture 2 in combination with three other unique pictures. 4.

According to the information given, D is equal to the man's swimming speed in still water, which is 12 km/h.

Given that line MN cannot be parallel to the x-axis (as it would imply P lies on the y-axis, contradicting P(1,y_{0})), we assume the equation of line MN to be x=ty+m. Substituting this into the curve C's equation, we get a quadratic equation in y: [ (t^2-4)y^2 + 2tmy + m^2 - 4 = 0 ] From this, we can deduce: [ y_1 + y_2 = -frac{2tm}{t^2-4}, quad y_1y_2 = frac{m^2-4}{t^2-4} ] Further, from the collinearity conditions k_{PA} = k_{MA} and k_{PB} = k_{NB}, and after some algebraic manipulations, we find that m=4. This implies that the line MN always passes through point H(4,0). The locus of point D (the foot of the perpendicular from B to MN) is a circle with diameter HB, which has the equation (x-3)^2 + y^2 = 1. When D coincides with H, |AD| is at its maximum.

Consider tetrahedron (ABCD) with points (E) and (F) as the midpoints of edges (AB) and (CD), respectively. We need to prove that any plane (alpha) passing through line (EF) divides the tetrahedron into two equal volumes. 2. By definition of the midpoints, we have (frac{AE}{EB} = 1) and (frac{CF}{FD} = 1). This crucially implies symmetry with respect to planes through these points. 3. Suppose plane (alpha) intersects edges (AD) and (BC) at points (G) and (H), respectively. 4. Since the plane (alpha) contains line (EF) (which joins the midpoints of (AB) and (CD)), it must also intersect the tetrahedron's diagonals (AC) and (BD) (if extended). 5. We consider the sub-volumes created: - The volumes (Delta GEH). - Analyzing the areas related to (triangle AEH), (triangle BEH), (triangle CHF), and (triangle DHF). 6. Using the property of midpoints: - [ S_{triangle AEH} = S_{triangle BEH}, quad S_{triangle CHF} = S_{triangle DHF} ] - Hence, ( V_{G-AEH} = V_{G-BEH} ) and ( V_{G-HCF} = V_{G-HDF} ). 7. Consequently, to prove the initial volume division, we observe that: - [ V_{AC-EHFG} = V_{BD-EHFG} ] - We need only consider (V_{G-AIK}) which matches volume (V_{G-BHD}) 8. Considering ratios from similar triangles and volumes (based on proportional segments): - [ frac{V_{A-C-H}}{V_{A-H-C}} = frac{AG}{AD} cdot frac{CH}{BC} ] - [ frac{V_{A-B-D}}{V_{A-B-D}} = frac{DG}{AD} cdot frac{BH}{BC} ] 9.

Simplifying, we get: - [ frac{AG}{AD} cdot left(1-frac{BH}{BC}right) = frac{BH}{BC} cdot left(1-frac{AG}{AD}right) ] - which simplifies to (frac{AG}{AD} = frac{BH}{BC}). 11. In figure notation, let (P) represent the intersection of (EF) with (HG). Connect (A) to (P) and redefine intersections on (BCD). 12. Employing Menelaus's Theorem repeatedly on triangles and the divided segments: - We validate intersections and segment ratios, confirming earlier results: - [ 2lambda + 1 = mu cdot left(2 + frac{1}{lambda}right) ] - Solving for (lambda) and (mu), and excluding invalid cases, we find (lambda = mu). 13. Finally, substituting back, we secure: - [ frac{AG}{AD} = frac{BH}{BC} ] Thus, given the ratios hold, any plane ( alpha ) passing through ( EF ) invariably divides the tetrahedron (ABCD) into two equal volumes.

To prove this, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and angles associated with perpendicular sides. 1. **Cyclic Quadrilaterals**: We will describe circles around the quadrilaterals (A A_{1} C A_{2}) and (B B_{1} C B_{2}). Both quadrilaterals (A A_{1} C A_{2}) and (B B_{1} C B_{2}) can be inscribed in circles because they have right angles at (A_{1}) and (A_{2}) for (A A_{1} C A_{2}), and at (B_{1}) and (B_{2}) for (B B_{1} C B_{2}). 2. **Angles in Cyclic Quadrilaterals**: Consider the cyclic quadrilateral (A A_{1} C A_{2}). The inscribed angle theorem tells us that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to (180^circ). Therefore, [ angle A A_{1} A_{2} + angle A_{2} A_{1} C = 180^circ ] Similarly, for quadrilateral (B B_{1} C B_{2}), [ angle B B_{1} B_{2} + angle B_{2} B_{1} C = 180^circ ] 3. **Perpendicularity**: We know that (angle A_{1} A_{2} C) and (angle B_{1} B_{2} C) are each (90^circ) because they come from the perpendiculars dropped from (A) and (B). Hence, because (angle A_{1} A_{2} C) and (angle B_{1} B_{2} C) are each (90^circ), [ angle A_{1} A_{2} B_{2} + angle A_{2} B_{2} C = 90^circ + 90^circ = 180^circ ] But since (angle A_{1} A_{2} B_{2} + angle B_{1} B_{2} C = 180^circ), the lines (A_{1} A_{2}) and (B_{1} B_{2}) must be perpendicular to each other because they complete the half-circle if laid on a flat plane. 4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, based on the properties of the cyclic quadrilaterals and the perpendicular sides, the lines (A_{1} A_{2}) and (B_{1} B_{2}) are mutually perpendicular. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"this round, the brothers made the following statements: First brother: I am Trulya.

The total number of steps required is m + n, with m R-moves and n U-moves. Thus, the number of such paths is given by: binom{m+n}{m} 2. **Introduce the Restriction:** We need to count paths that never touch or cross the line y = x. This means every intermediate point (a, b) on the path must satisfy a < b. 3. **Catalan Paths and Adjusted Initial Steps:** Given the restriction that a < b, the first step from (0, 0) should be an upward move to (0, 1). Thus, the problem reduces to counting paths from (0, 1) to (m, n), ensuring a < b for every intermediate point (a, b). 4. **Count Paths from (0, 1) to (m, n):** The number of unrestricted paths from (0, 1) to (m, n) can be calculated by considering that (0, 1) to (m, n) involves (m + n - 1) moves with m right moves and (n - 1) up moves: binom{m+n-1}{m} 5. **Paths from (1, 0) to (m, n):** Conversely, if we consider paths from (1, 0) to (m, n), every such path must cross the line y = x.

Using the change of base formula (log_{b} x = frac{log_{a} x}{log_{a} b}), we can rewrite log_{4}(3a+4b) as follows: log_{4}(3a+4b) = frac{log_{2}(3a+4b)}{log_{2}(4)}. Now, the given equation becomes: frac{log_{2}(3a+4b)}{log_{2}(4)} = log_{2} sqrt{ab}. Next, we simplify the denominator of the left side and the right side. For the left side, recall that log_{2}(4) = 2. For the right side, we use the property log_{a} sqrt{x} = frac{1}{2}log_{a} x: frac{log_{2}(3a+4b)}{2} = frac{1}{2}log_{2} (ab). Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: log_{2}(3a+4b) = log_{2} (ab). Since the logarithm is a one-to-one function, we can equate their arguments: 3a+4b=ab. To minimize (a+b), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. However, let's first express a in terms of b or vice versa to simplify the problem. Solving for a gives: a=frac{3a+4b}{b}. Now, we substitute this expression of a into a+b to minimize it: a+b = frac{3a+4b}{b} + b. Multiplying both sides by b to get rid of the fraction, we obtain: ab + b^2 = 3a + 4b. Since we already have 3a + 4b = ab, we can substitute it into the equation: ab + b^2 = ab. Subtracting ab from both sides, we get: b^2 = 0. This implies b=0, which leads to a contradiction, as log_{2} sqrt{ab} would be undefined. Therefore, we cannot minimize a + b directly using the method of Lagrange multipliers or basic algebraic manipulations. Instead, let's analyze each answer choice to find the minimum value of a + b. A: If a + b = 7 + 4sqrt{3}, we can let a = 4 + 2sqrt{3} and b = 3 + 2sqrt{3}. We can verify that these values satisfy the original equation 3a+4b=ab.

Let's denote this property as ( P(x, y) ). 3. **First Step: Considering the Expression ( y - x ):** Given ( x in S_i ) and ( y in S_j ), we have: [ y - x in S_k ] This implies: [ (y - x) - y = -x in S_i ] Thus, if ( x in S_i ), then ( -x in S_i ).

Now, we can find S_{10} using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S_{10} = 10 times (-3) + frac{10 times 9}{2} times 2 = 60. Therefore, the answer is boxed{60}. To solve this problem, we set up a common difference d for the arithmetic sequence, where d neq 0. Using the given conditions that a_4 is the geometric mean of a_3 and a_7, and S_8 = 32, we simplify the problem using the properties of geometric sequences and the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Solving the resulting system of equations gives us the first term and common difference, which we then use to find S_{10}.

Her brother then took 1/6 of the remaining sandwiches, which is (1/6)(3/4S) = 1/8S. So after her brother took his share, there were 3/4S - 1/8S left, which simplifies to 5/8S. Her first cousin ate twice as many sandwiches as her brother, which is 2(1/8S) = 1/4S. After her first cousin ate, there were 5/8S - 1/4S left, which simplifies to 3/8S. Her two other cousins ate sandwiches in a 3:2 ratio, totaling 5 sandwiches. Let's denote the number of sandwiches the first of these two cousins ate as 3x and the second as 2x. So, 3x + 2x = 5 sandwiches, which means 5x = 5 sandwiches, so x = 1 sandwich. The first of these two cousins ate 3 sandwiches (3x), and the second ate 2 sandwiches (2x). After these two cousins ate, there were 3/8S - 5 sandwiches left. Finally, there were 4 sandwiches left after everyone had eaten.

Is this decomposition unique?","completion":": **1. Setting up the problem:** We need to prove that every fraction can be decomposed into a sum of distinct unit fractions (fractions where the numerator is 1). Also, we need to see if such a decomposition is unique. **2. Initial decomposition:** Consider a proper fraction (frac{a}{b}). To start, identify the largest unit fraction (denoted by (frac{1}{n_1})) such that: [ frac{1}{n_1} leq frac{a}{b} ] Let’s subtract this unit fraction from (frac{a}{b}): [ frac{a}{b} = frac{1}{n_1} + frac{a_1}{b_1} ] where ( frac{a_1}{b_1} = frac{a}{b} - frac{1}{n_1} ). **3. Continuation of the process:** Now, repeat the process for the remaining fraction (frac{a_1}{b_1}) to find the next unit fraction (frac{1}{n_2}) such that: [ frac{1}{n_2} leq frac{a_1}{b_1} ] Again, subtract this unit fraction from (frac{a_1}{b_1}): [ frac{a_1}{b_1} = frac{1}{n_2} + frac{a_2}{b_2} ] Thus, [ frac{a}{b} = frac{1}{n_1} + frac{1}{n_2} + frac{a_2}{b_2} ] **4. Inductive process:** Continue this process. At each step (i), identify a unit fraction (frac{1}{n_i}) and subtract it from the remaining fraction: [ frac{a_{i-1}}{b_{i-1}} = frac{1}{n_i} + frac{a_i}{b_i} ] We know from the problem reference (Problem 308) that: [ a > a_1 > a_2 > cdots ] **5. Termination of the process:** Due to the strict inequality (a_{i} < a_{i-1}), this process will eventually terminate. This ensures that eventually, the remaining fraction (frac{a_k}{b_k}) will also be a unit fraction. Thus: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{1}{n_1} + frac{1}{n_2} + cdots + frac{1}{n_k} ] **6. Non-equality of unit fractions:** To see why the unit fractions are distinct, we argue that each subsequent unit fraction is smaller than the previous one. Suppose the first unit fraction selected is (frac{1}{n_1}). For the second unit fraction, we select (frac{1}{n_2}) from the fraction (frac{a}{b} - frac{1}{n_1}). We need to show that: [ frac{a}{b} - frac{1}{n_1} < frac{1}{n_1} ] Given ( frac{a}{b} < frac{1}{n_1 - 1} ), we get: [ frac{a}{b} - frac{1}{n_1} < frac{1}{n_1 - 1} - frac{1}{n_1} ] By simplifying, we have: [ frac{1}{n_1 - 1} - frac{1}{n_1} = frac{n_1 - (n_1 - 1)}{n_1(n_1 - 1)} = frac{1}{n_1 (n_1 - 1)} ] This implies: [ frac{a}{b} - frac{1}{n_1} < frac{1}{n_1 (n_1 - 1)} ] **7. Concluding the uniqueness:** This sequence shows that each unit fraction (frac{1}{n_i}) is distinct for any (i). However, the decomposition is not unique. Consider the following example, where: [ frac{1}{a_n} = frac{1}{a_n + 1} + frac{1}{a_n (a_n + 1)} ] This implies that if: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{n-1}} + frac{1}{a_n} ] We can also express it as: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{n-1}} + frac{1}{a_n + 1} + frac{1}{a_n (a_n + 1)} ] **Conclusion:** The decomposition of fractions into sums of distinct unit fractions is guaranteed but is not unique.

If ( x ) is a root of unity, we know ( x^{-1} = bar{x} ) (i.e., the reciprocal of ( x ) is also its complex conjugate). 3. Consider the polynomial ( x^{n}P(x^{-1}) ). We can verify that the roots of ( x^{n}P(x^{-1}) ) are ( x^{-1} ), which are the complex conjugates of the roots of ( P(x) ): [ x^{n} Pleft(x^{-1}right) = x^{n} left(a_{n} x^{-n} + a_{n-1} x^{-(n-1)} + cdots + a_{0} x^{0}right) ] Simplifying: [ x^{n} Pleft(x^{-1}right) = a_{0} x^{n} + a_{1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_{n} ] 4. Since the roots of ( x^{n} P(x^{-1}) ) are the same as the roots of ( P(x) ), the polynomials ( P(x) ) and ( x^{n} P(x^{-1}) ) must be related by a constant multiple ( c ): [ P(x) = c cdot x^{n} P(x^{-1}) ] 5. By comparing the coefficients of ( P(x) ) and ( x^{n}P(x^{-1}) ), we get: [ a_{n} = c a_{0}, quad a_{n-1} = c a_{1}, quad ldots, quad a_{0} = c a_{n} ] 6. Notice ( a_{0} = c a_{n} ) and ( a_{n} = c a_{0} ) imply: [ a_{0} = c^{2} a_{0} ] 7. Since ( a_{0} neq 0 ) (otherwise, the polynomial would not be of degree ( n )), it follows that ( c^{2} = 1 ), so ( c = pm 1 ). 8. But now consider ( P(1) ): [ P(1) = a_{n} + a_{n-1} + cdots + a_{0} ] If ( c = -1 ), substituting into the relationship gives: [ P(x) = -x^{n} P(x^{-1}) implies P(1) = -P(1) ] 9. This implies: [ P(1) = 0 ] which is a contradiction because we are given ( P(1) neq 0 ). 10. Therefore, ( c = 1 ) and so: [ a_{n} = a_{0}, quad a_{n-1} = a_{1}, quad ldots, quad a_{i} = a_{n-i} ] # Conclusion: The coefficients of ( P ) are symmetric: [ a_{n} = a_{0}, quad a_{n-1} = a_{1}, quad ldots, quad a_{i} = a_{n-i} ] (blacksquare) # Additional Information: The reasoning above leverages key properties of polynomials with real coefficients, particularly symmetry and the relationship between polynomials and their reciprocals when roots of unity are involved."},{"prompt":"Given that ( x, y, z ) are positive real numbers and ( 0 leq lambda leq 2 ), prove that: frac{sqrt{xy}}{x+y+lambda z} + frac{sqrt{yz}}{y+z+lambda x} + frac{sqrt{zx}}{z+x+lambda y} leq frac{3}{2+lambda}.","completion":"We need to prove the inequality: [ frac{sqrt{xy}}{x+y+lambda z} + frac{sqrt{yz}}{y+z+lambda x} + frac{sqrt{zx}}{z+x+lambda y} leq frac{3}{2+lambda} ] for ( x, y, z ) as positive real numbers and ( 0 leqslant lambda leqslant 2 ). 1.

For the minimum area of triangle OMN with OM bot ON, let's consider points M(rho_1, theta) and N(rho_2, theta pm frac{pi}{2}). Substituting into the curve's equation, we have: [ rho_1^2(1+3sin^2theta) = 4 ] [ rho_2^2(1+3cos^2theta) = 4 ] Multiplying these equations, we get: [ rho_1^2rho_2^2 = frac{16}{(1+3sin^2theta)(1+3cos^2theta)} ] [ = frac{16}{4+9sin^2thetacos^2theta} ] [ = frac{16}{4+frac{9}{4}sin^2 2theta} ] [ geq frac{16}{frac{25}{4}} ] [ = frac{64}{25} ] The equality holds when theta = frac{pi}{4}, frac{3pi}{4}, frac{5pi}{4}, frac{7pi}{4}.

For each ( x = a_i ) (where ( i in {1, 2, ldots, n} )), we have: [ f(a_i) = (a_i - a_1)(a_i - a_2) cdots (a_i - a_n) - 1 = -1 ] This implies that: [ p(a_i) q(a_i) = -1 ] Since ( p(a_i) ) and ( q(a_i) ) are integers, the only integer pairs ((p(a_i), q(a_i))) that multiply to (-1) are ((1, -1)) and ((-1, 1)). 5. Therefore, for each ( i ), exactly one of ( p(a_i) ) and ( q(a_i) ) is ( 1 ) and the other is ( -1 ). This means: [ w(a_i) = p(a_i) + q(a_i) = 1 + (-1) = 0 quad text{or} quad -1 + 1 = 0 ] Hence, ( w(a_i) = 0 ) for all ( i in {1, 2, ldots, n} ). 6. Since ( w(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients and ( w(a_i) = 0 ) for ( n ) distinct values ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ), ( w(x) ) must have at least ( n ) roots. However, the degree of ( w(x) ) is less than ( n ) because ( w(x) = p(x) + q(x) ) and both ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) are nonconstant polynomials, so their degrees are less than ( n ). 7. This is a contradiction because a polynomial of degree less than ( n ) cannot have ( n ) distinct roots. 8. Therefore, our initial assumption that ( f(x) ) can be factored into the product of two nonconstant polynomials with integer coefficients must be false.

By observing the board: - There are 4 columns and 4 usable rows. However, we need the ones that aren't obstructed completely by other rooks. We have to find unique positions for 3 rooks without overlap. 3. **Calculate the combinations**: We need to choose 3 distinct rows and 3 distinct columns from 4 possible rows and columns: [ binom{4}{3} times binom{4}{3} ] Since we must choose 3 out of these 4 rows and columns, this simplifies to: [ binom{4}{3} = 4 ] Thus we get: [ 4 times 4 = 16 ] 4. **Correct for allowed placements**: Because the placement of the rooks themselves must avoid the columns and rows intersecting at forbidden cells of the board, not every combination of 3x3 allows for correct placing.

We have 2 choices for b and 1 remaining choice for c. This approach leads to 2 times 2 times 1 = 4 valid configurations.

How many kilograms does Amir weigh?","completion":"1. Let the weights of the boys be as follows: - ( x ) is the weight of Bulat in kilograms, - ( y ) is the weight of Ilnur in kilograms. 2. Given the conditions: - Amir is heavier than Ilnur by 8 kg, therefore the weight of Amir is ( y + 8 ) kg. - Daniyar is heavier than Bulat by 4 kg, hence the weight of Daniyar is ( x + 4 ) kg. 3. Note that the sum of the weights of the heaviest and lightest boys is 2 kg less than the sum of the weights of the other two boys, and the total weight of all four boys together is 250 kg. 4. Analyze the cases to identify the heaviest and lightest boys: - **Case 1: Daniyar is the heaviest**. [ x + 4 > y + 8 implies x > y ] Therefore, the lightest boy could be Ilnur. But in this scenario, the total weight sums do not align with the given conditions. Hence, this is a contradiction and Daniyar cannot be the heaviest. - **Case 2: Amir is the heaviest**. Therefore, Amir's weight ( y + 8 ) is the greatest. Let's first consider if Bulat is the lightest. - If Bulat is the lightest, the sum of Amir and Bulat's weights is ( (y + 8) + x ). For this scenario to be valid, this sum must be precisely 2 kg less than the sum of the weights of Daniyar and Ilnur, which leads to another contradiction. Thus, Bulat cannot be the lightest. - Therefore, Ilnur must be the lightest. In this configuration, the sum of the weights of the heaviest (Amir) and the lightest (Ilnur): [ (y + 8) + y = 2y + 8 ] And it is 2 kg less than the sum of the weights of Bulat and Daniyar: [ 2y + 8 = x + (x + 4) - 2 implies 2y + 8 = 2x + 4 - 2 implies 2y + 8 = 2x + 2 implies 2y = 2x - 6 ] Solving for ( y ) in terms of ( x ), we get: [ y = x - 6 ] 5.

Thus, [ overline{x} = frac{1}{50} times left(5 times 10 + 15 times 30 + 20 times 50 + 5 times 70 + 5 times 90right) ] [ = frac{1}{50} times (50 + 450 + 1000 + 350 + 450) ] [ = frac{1}{50} times 2300 ] [ = 46 ] So, the mean of the daily extracurricular reading time is boxed{46} minutes. To find the median m, we know that the median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample. For grouped data, we estimate the median using the formula that involves the cumulative frequency. Given that the total number of students is 50, the median will be in the (40,60] interval because the cumulative frequency reaches 50% of the total within this interval. The formula for the median in a grouped data set is not directly given, but we can infer it from the calculation provided: [ 0.1 + 0.3 + left(m - 40right) times frac{0.4}{20} = 0.5 ] Solving for m, [ 0.4 + left(m - 40right) times 0.02 = 0.5 ] [ left(m - 40right) times 0.02 = 0.1 ] [ m - 40 = 5 ] [ m = 45 ] Therefore, the median of the daily extracurricular reading time is boxed{45} minutes. **(2)** To find the probability that all three students selected from the (60,80] interval have excellent Chinese scores, we note that there are 5 students in total in this interval, with 4 having excellent scores.

Method 1: 1. **Choose a large prime number**: Let ( p ) be a prime number greater than ( 10^{12} ). 2. **Define the set of numbers**: Consider the numbers ( {p, 2p, 3p, ldots, 1000000p} ). 3. **Analyze the sum**: Suppose ( S ) is the sum of some subset of these numbers. Then ( S ) can be written as: [ S = kp ] for some integer ( k ). 4. **Bounds on ( k )**: Notice that since we are summing up to one million of these numbers, ( k ) can range from 1 to: [ k le 1000000 ] Hence, [ k < p ] 5. **Divisibility properties**: Since ( S = kp ) and ( k < p ), we observe that ( S ) is divisible by ( p ) but not by ( p^2 ). 6. **Perfect square condition**: A number ( S ) that is divisible by ( p ) but not by ( p^2 ) cannot be a perfect square. This ensures that ( S ) is not a perfect square for any subset sum. Therefore, using the set ( {p, 2p, 3p, ldots, 1000000p} ), we achieve our goal. Method 2: 1. **Define the set of numbers**: Consider the numbers ( 10^{2k+1} ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 1000000 ). 2. **Form of the numbers**: Note that each number is of the form ( 10^{2k+1} ), which means each number ends with an odd number of zeros. 3. **Analyze the sum**: Consider the sum of any subset of these numbers. The sum will also be a number ending with an odd number of zeros. 4. **Perfect square check**: A number that ends with an odd number of zeros cannot be a perfect square. This is because a perfect square's decimal representation must have an even number of trailing zeros if it ends in zeros. Thus, using the set ( {10^{2k+1} mid k = 1, 2, ldots, 1000000} ), we again have a set of numbers where no sum of any subset is a perfect square. # Conclusion Therefore, we have demonstrated two methods to construct a set of 1,000,000 natural numbers such that no subset sum is a perfect square.

From the given conditions, we can determine that one focus of the hyperbola is (3, 0). This implies that m + 5 = 9, which leads to m = 4. Consequently, we can find the eccentricity of the hyperbola. Here's a step-by-step solution: 1. The focus of the parabola y^2 = 12x is (3, 0). 2.

A 2x2 square is divided into several smaller rectangles and then colored in a chessboard pattern such that the total area of blue rectangles equals the total area of yellow rectangles. To prove we can arrange the blue rectangles into a 1x2 rectangle, follow these steps: 2. **Reorganize Column-wise:** - Rearrange the columns so that all the blue rectangles in the first row are consecutive starting from the left edge. - This implies that in all rows, blue rectangles in the odd-numbered rows will align from the left edge and in the even-numbered rows from the right edge. 3. **Reorganize Row-wise:** - Similarly, rearrange the rows so that all the previous odd-numbered rows are placed consecutively, followed by all the even-numbered rows. - This configuration results in larger blocks where all blue rectangles are grouped together in the same pattern: odd rows having blue rectangles from the left and even rows from the right. 4. **Grouping Rectangles:** - After the rearrangement, you will notice four large groups of rectangles separated by the middle lines of the original 2x2 square. - Since the total area of blue and yellow rectangles are equal and every blue rectangle must fit into the 2x2 grid, it's important to establish a common vertex alignment, where they adhere to the middle lines. 5. **Checking Common Vertex:** - If one common vertex lies on the middle line of the square, we can split the blue region into exact blocks with the sides of 1 unit length, and their combined remaining two sides will add up to 2 units. 6. **Contradiction and Area Analysis:** - Assume the center of the square lies within one blue rectangle. Let’s denote the area of each sub-rectangle within a 9-grid division after rearranging: - Let ( S_i ) be the area of the ( i )-th rectangle. - These areas will satisfy the equality relations: ( S_1 = S_7, S_4 = S_6, S_2 = S_8, ) and ( S_3 = S_9 ). - Given the rearrangement and equal coloring condition, the above area distribution should hold true. Hence, blue and yellow areas match. 7. **Conclusion:** - Since the common vertex of the blue rectangles lies along these middle separations of the 9 subdivisions, each group now adheres to the condition where combining 1 unit-length segments from different blue rectangles forms a 1x2 rectangle. - Thus, it's possible to arrange blue rectangles into a 1x2 rectangle.

Thus, ( m = 1 ) is a losing position (denoted as ( L )). - If ( m = 2 ), the first player can fold the table to ( 1 times 1 ), which is a losing position for the second player.

Since ( 2j + 1 geq 2 lceil frac{n}{2} rceil + 1 > n ), this is a contradiction.

Let: - ( widehat{A_{1} widehat{S} O} = widehat{A_{2} widehat{S} O} = varphi ) - ( angle A_{1} widehat{S} A_{2} = alpha ) - ( |S O| = h ) - ( M ) be the midpoint of ( [A_{1} A_{2}] ) 3. **Relationship Between Plane and Dihedral Angles**: The plane ( A_{2}PN ) is perpendicular to the line ( A_{1}S ), thus making: - ( angle A_{2}widehat{P}N = frac{gamma}{2} ) where ( gamma ) is the sought quantity of the dihedral angle. 4. **Perpendicular Relationships**: Given: - ( left(A_{2}Pright) perp left(A_{1}Sright) ) - ( left(A_{2}Nright) perp left(A_{1}Oright) ) - ( (PN) perp left(A_{2}Nright) ) From the corresponding right-angled triangles, we obtain the following relationships: 5. **Calculations**: [ left|A_{1}Oright| = left|A_{2}Oright| = h tan varphi ] [ left|A_{1}Sright| = left|A_{2}Sright| = frac{h}{cos varphi} ] [ left|M A_{1}right| = left|M A_{2}right| = left|A_{1}Oright| sin frac{pi}{n} = h tan varphi sin frac{pi}{n} ] [ sin frac{alpha}{2} = frac{left|M A_{1}right|}{left|S A_{1}right|} = tan varphi cdot sin frac{pi}{n} cdot cos varphi ] [ sin frac{alpha}{2} = sin frac{pi}{n} cdot sin varphi ] [ left|A_{2}Nright| = left|O A_{2}right| sin frac{2pi}{n} = h tan varphi cdot sin frac{2pi}{n} ] [ left|A_{2}Pright| = left|S A_{2}right| sin alpha = frac{h sin alpha}{cos varphi} ] [ sin frac{gamma}{2} = frac{left|A_{2}Nright|}{left|A_{2}Pright|} = frac{tan varphi sin frac{2pi}{n} cos varphi}{sin alpha} ] [ sin frac{gamma}{2} = frac{sin frac{2pi}{n} sin varphi}{sin alpha} ] # Conclusion: The calculations for the plane angle ( alpha ) and the dihedral angle ( gamma ) are expressed in terms of the given angle ( varphi ).

Solving for a_{1} gives a_{1} = frac{3}{2}. - Therefore, the general formula for {a_{n}} is a_{n} = frac{3}{2} + (n-1)cdotfrac{1}{2} = frac{n}{2} + 1. - For the sequence {b_{n}}, given S_{n} = 2b_{n} - 2, we find b_{1} by setting n=1 which gives b_{1} = 2. - For n geqslant 2, we have b_{n} = S_{n} - S_{n-1} = (2b_{n}-2) - (2b_{n-1}-2) = 2b_{n} - 2b_{n-1}, which simplifies to b_{n} = 2b_{n-1}.

Removing 13, 12, 11, 10, or 9 removes one pair each. Thus, one of these numbers should be chosen as n to increase probability for other sums. - For an optimal choice, removal of any of these numbers will increase the likelihood of achieving other sums. The choice is essentially equal among 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13, as each eliminates one pair. However, we consider removing the largest numbers (11, 12, 13) which creates lesser impact on lower sums.

For the first inequality 2x + 3 > 5, we simplify it to find the range of x that satisfies this condition: [ 2x + 3 > 5 implies 2x > 2 implies x > 1 ] This means that x must be greater than 1. 2. For the second inequality x - a leq 0, we solve it to find the relationship between x and a: [ x - a leq 0 implies x leq a ] This indicates that x must be less than or equal to a.

Therefore, we have x = 2 as the unique integer solution that satisfies both inequalities. To ensure x = 2 is the only solution, we analyze the constraints placed on a by the inequalities: 1.

The amount of work Tom does alone is his rate (1/T) times the time he works alone (7/3 hours), which equals (1/T) * (7/3).

She tells the remaining number to Béla, who, after a short consideration, figures out the deleted digit. How?","completion":"1. Initial Setup Anna writes down two random natural numbers. Let's denote these numbers by ( A ) and ( B ). The numbers have the same digits but are arranged in different orders. Let's assume ( A > B ). 2. Difference Calculation Anna calculates the difference between the larger number ( A ) and the smaller number ( B ): [ d = A - B ] 3. Properties of the Numbers and Their Difference Both ( A ) and ( B ) contain the same digits but in different orders. This means: - The sum of the digits of ( A ) is equal to the sum of the digits of ( B ). - Therefore, the sum of the digits of ( A ) and ( B ) have the same remainder when divided by 9. This property is derived from the rule of divisibility by 9, which states that a number is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9. Since the sum of the digits of both numbers is the same, [ A equiv B pmod{9} ] Hence, the difference ( d ) between ( A ) and ( B ) must be divisible by 9: [ d = A - B equiv 0 pmod{9} ] 4. Multiplication and Digit Removal Anna then multiplies this difference ( d ) by some arbitrary natural number ( n ): [ k = d times n ] where ( k ) is the product. Next, Anna deletes a non-zero digit from this product ( k ), resulting in a new number, which we will denote by ( k' ). 5. Sum of the Digits and Restoring Divisibility The number ( k ) is divisible by 9 because ( d ) is divisible by 9. When a non-zero digit is removed from ( k ), the new number ( k' ) generally will not be divisible by 9 anymore. To restore divisibility by 9, we need to add back the removed digit ( r ) to ( k' ): [ k' + r ] should be divisible by 9 again because ( k equiv 0 pmod{9} ). 6. Conclusion Béla receives the number ( k' ) and calculates the sum of its digits. Let’s denote the sum of the digits of ( k' ) by ( S ). To find the removed digit ( r ), Béla determines the smallest non-negative integer ( r ) such that: [ S + r equiv 0 pmod{9} ] Therefore, the digit Béla figures out needs to be added back to ( k' ) to make the sum of the digits of ( k ) divisible by 9, which reveals the removed digit ( r ).

This is because the divisors of a number usually come in pairs (e.g., for number (n), if (d) is a divisor, so is (frac{n}{d})). However, for perfect squares, one of these pairs is a repeated number (e.g., for (16), the divisor (4) pairs with itself). 2. **Count of three-digit numbers**: - The range of three-digit numbers is from 100 to 999.

By properties of parallelograms and triangles, segment ( mathrm{KL} ) is parallel to ( mathrm{BC} ) and equal to half the length of ( mathrm{BC} ). Thus, ( mathrm{BKL} ) is a triangle with a base along ( mathrm{KL} ), which is parallel to one side of the parallelogram and has vertices that are midpoints of the sides of the parallelogram. 4. **Infer Ratios and Area Relationships:** Since ( mathrm{K} ) and ( mathrm{L} ) are midpoints of two sides: [ triangle BKL text{ is similar to and half the height of } triangle BCD ] Taking into account properties of midpoints in parallelograms, each of these vertical triangles will now form 1/4 the area of the whole parallelogram. 5. **Calculate the Area of ( triangle BCD ):** Since ( triangle BCD ) is effectively half of the parallelogram: [ text{Area of } triangle BCD = frac{1}{2} times text{Area of } mathrm{ABCD} = frac{1}{2} times 120 = 60. ] 6. **Area Deduction from ( triangle BCD ):** Since ( K ) and ( L) are midpoints, ( triangle BKL) is half the height of ( triangle BCD), so only one fourth of the parallelogram: [ text{Area of } triangle BKL = frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times text{Area of } mathrm{ABCD} = frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times 120 = frac{1}{4} times 120 = 30. ] Therefore, by accounting for triangular overlaps and midpoints intersection properties: [ boxed{45} ]"},{"prompt":"Peter and Victor are playing a game, taking turns painting rectangles of size (1 times 1), (1 times 2), and (2 times 2) on a checkered square of size (7 times 7).

If so, how should he play?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the layout of a 7 times 7 board and understand the strategy that maximizes the chances of a player being able to make the last move. 1. **Initial Observation**: The board has 49 cells (7 times 7 = 49). Since the board is square and the dimensions are both odd, this will affect how larger rectangles (especially 2 times 2) can be placed without leaving isolated cells. 2. **Piece Sizes**: The pieces each player can place are 1 times 1 (covers 1 cell), 1 times 2 (covers 2 cells), and 2 times 2 (covers 4 cells). 3. **Player Turns and Parity**: - Since a 7 times 7 board has 49 = 7^2 cells, the total number of 1x1 cells is odd. - The players will take turns painting, so their moves will alternate. - After the entire board is painted (assuming they can finish), there would be 49 moves in total. 4. **Strategy for Forced Win**: Since the moves are alternating, the player who goes first will make the last move if no other player forfeits a move (assuming optimal play by both players). Therefore, the key strategy here will be to ensure the optimal arrangement of pieces to avoid leaving any unplaceable sections for the opponent while maximizing usable space. 5. **Optimal Move Sequences**: - **Peter (First Player)**: Peter starts the game. To ensure he always has a move: - He should prioritize placing larger pieces first to block larger contiguous sections of the board. - Place 2 times 2 pieces to cover corner cells or centralized larger sections. - Use 1 times 1 pieces and 1 times 2 pieces to fill in smaller gaps towards the latter part of the game. - **Victor (Second Player)**: Victor reacts to Peter's placements strategically to ensure he is minimizing wasted space. 6. **Guaranteed Win Analysis**: If Peter plays optimally: - Peter can guarantee a win by making the last move because he takes the first move and there are an odd number of total cells. - Peter’s strategy involves reducing the degree of freedom for Victor with each move, ensuring no isolated cells or odd-shaped gaps remain that can exclusively accommodate specific piece types. Conclusion: Peter can guarantee himself a victory by placing pieces using an optimal strategy where he always attempts to block large spaces first and leaves the board such that any remaining constraints inhibit Victor’s successive moves more severely than his own. Therefore, the player who starts (Peter) can secure the last move and win.

Now, denote by ( D ) the diametrically opposite point of ( C ) on the circle.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, f(2)) is ae^2 - 1, and the tangent point is (2, 0). Hence, the equation of the tangent line is y - 0 = (ae^2 - 1)(x - 2), which simplifies to y = (ae^2 - 1)(x - 2). 2. Since the derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = (x - 1)(ae^x - 1), - When a = 0, f'(x) = -(x - 1).

Notice that angle A_1AC' + angle A_1AB' = 90^circ + 90^circ = 180^circ. Since these angles add up to 180^circ, the points A, B', A_1, C' are concyclic.

We will also consider that each plane has an additional infinitely distant line where all the infinitely distant points of the lines in that plane lie. The infinitely distant line intersects each ordinary line l in the same plane at the infinitely distant point of line l. When introducing infinitely distant points and lines, the central projection of plane alpha_{1} onto plane alpha_{2} with center at point O will be defined for all points of plane alpha_{1}. The exceptional line will be projected into the infinitely distant line of plane alpha_{2}, meaning the image of point M of the exceptional line will be the infinitely distant point of line OM; at this point, the lines of plane alpha_{2} that are parallel to line OM intersect.","completion":"Let's denote the initial plane by alpha_1 and the target plane by alpha_2.

For any point P in alpha_1, we draw the line OP which intersects alpha_2 at some point P'. This point P' is the projection of P. 2. **Consider a Line l on alpha_1:** Let l be a straight line on the plane alpha_1.

For any M in l, M neq O, the projection line OM would be in the plane alpha_1 itself completely for all its points. 4. **Projecting Line l:** Consider two distinct points A and B on the line l in alpha_1. Draw the lines OA and OB. These lines intersect alpha_2 at A' and B' respectively. 5. **Forming the Projection Line on alpha_2:** Since A' and B' are points on alpha_2, the line passing through A' and B' on alpha_2 will be the projection of the line l. We need to show that any other point on l will project onto this line. 6. **General Point on l:** Consider any point C on the line l. The projection process described in step 4 applies: draw OC and determine the intersection with alpha_2, which yields the point C'. Once again, since A', B', and C' lie on alpha_2 and are projections of collinear points from alpha_1, the points A', B', and C' must be collinear on alpha_2. 7. **Conclusion:** Through central projection, the image of any point on line l (not passing through O) aligns on the line A'B' in alpha_2. Hence the image of l is a line in alpha_2. Therefore, any line not passing through the center of projection O will project into another line under central projection from alpha_1 to alpha_2. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"On a plane, Bob chooses 3 points ( A_{0}, B_{0}, C_{0} ) (not necessarily distinct) such that ( A_{0} B_{0} + B_{0} C_{0} + C_{0} A_{0} = 1 ).

As given, A cannot be on duty on Day 2. With that in mind, we can break down the problem into cases based on which day A starts their duty. We must ensure that every person is on duty at least one day and no one is on duty for two consecutive days. **Case 1: A starts on Day 1** If A starts on Day 1, they can't be on duty for Day 2. Because every person must be on duty at least one day, and there can't be two consecutive days by the same person, the arrangement must alternate between B and C for the remaining days. There are two arrangements possible: ABACA and ACABA. **Case 2: A starts on Day 3** Similar to Case 1, A can't be on duty on Day 2 or Day 4, and B and C must alternate. There are also two arrangements: BCABC and CBACB. **Case 3: A starts on Day 5** Now, for A to be on duty on Day 5 and not violate the consecutive days rule, B and C must again alternate for Days 1 to 4, allowing for the same two arrangements as in Cases 1 and 2, reversed: BCACB and CBABC. We have not considered situations where A does not start on Day 1, 3, or 5 but is scheduled on one of these days. Since A cannot be on duty on Day 2 and everyone should have a chance to be on duty, let's look at the remaining possibilities: **Case 4: A is on duty on Day 4** This case would restrict A from being on duty on Day 3 and Day 5. Hence, B and C must alternate starting from Day 1, and A fits into Day 4. Possible arrangements are BCBCA and CBCBA. Since only one 'A' is in these arrangements, A must also be on duty Day 1 (as everyone must have at least one duty day), giving us two new arrangements: ABCBC and ACBCB. **Case 5: A is on duty on Day 1 and Day 3** This case will create the arrangement ABACA.

Since f(x) is a sine function, its graph's symmetry about a specific vertical line suggests that g(x) = 3cos(omega x + varphi) + 1 is the corresponding cosine function, which reaches its maximum or minimum at the symmetry center of f(x) due to the co-function identity between sine and cosine (sin(alpha) = cos(frac{pi}{2} - alpha)). Thus, the symmetry center for g(x) in relation to the line x = frac{pi}{3} is characterized by the fact that cos(omega(frac{pi}{3}) + varphi) + 1 will either be the maximum or minimum value of g(x) at x = frac{pi}{3}, depending on the phase shift varphi. However, for g(x) to be the symmetry center, it must be equal to the average of its maximum and minimum values, which for a cos function with amplitude 3 is 1 (being (3+(-3))/2 + 1).

That is, assume [ p(x) = g(x) cdot h(x), ] where ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) are non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. 2. **Roots of the Polynomial**: From the given polynomial ( p(x) ), we know that ( p(x) = left(x - a_1right) left(x - a_2right) cdots left(x - a_nright) - 1 ). The values ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) are ( n ) distinct integers such that [ p(a_i) = -1 quad text{for each} i = 1, 2, ldots, n. ] 3. **Factorization Implication**: Since ( p(x) = g(x) cdot h(x) ), it follows that ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) must be the roots of the equation [ g(x) cdot h(x) = -1. ] 4. **Characteristics of ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) )**: Because ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) have integer coefficients, and each ( a_i ) is an integer, we can deduce that ( g(a_i) ) and ( h(a_i) ) must be integers. Additionally, since the product ( g(a_i) cdot h(a_i) = -1 ), ( g(a_i) ) and ( h(a_i) ) must be either ( (1, -1) ) or ((-1, 1)) for each ( i ). 5. **Sum of Polynomials**: Consider the polynomial ( g(x) + h(x) ). For each root ( a_i ), it holds that [ g(a_i) + h(a_i) = 0. ] Thus, each ( a_i ) is a root of the polynomial ( g(x) + h(x) ). 6. **Degree Argument**: The polynomial ( g(x) + h(x) ) cannot have ( n ) distinct roots unless its degree is at least ( n ). However, both ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) are of degree strictly less than ( n ), meaning their highest degree sum would be less than ( n ). Therefore, ( g(x) + h(x) ) should be a polynomial of a degree strictly less than ( n ). 7. **Contradiction**: Since ( g(x) + h(x) ) is supposed to have ( n ) distinct roots, but it is a polynomial of degree less than ( n ), it is impossible for ( g(x) + h(x) ) to have ( n ) distinct roots. This contradiction proves that our initial assumption is false. 8. **Conclusion**: We thus conclude that ( p(x) ) cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.

Consequently, the radius at point A is perpendicular to AB: [ MA perp AB ] **Step 2**: Reflect triangle Delta BCP over the perpendicular bisector of AB. In this reflection, point B maps onto point A, and point P remains P'. Thus, point C maps to a new point C' such that overline{C' A} = overline{DA}. **Step 3**: Analyze angle angle MAC'. Based on angle reflection properties and the given perpendicularity, [ angle MAC' = angle BAC' - angle BAM ] [ = angle CBA - 90^circ ] With further deduction, [ = 180^circ - angle BAD - 90^circ ] [ = angle BAM - angle BAD ] [ = angle DAM ] Thus, point C' can be seen as a reflection of point D over the line AM. **Step 4**: Conclude quadrilateral properties and angle results.

Specifically, we can pair the largest number in the second sequence with the smallest number in the first sequence, the second largest number in the second sequence with the second smallest number in the first sequence, and so on.

Let's denote the number of sides by ( n ). 1. Expression for the Number of Diagonals: The formula for finding the number of diagonals in a polygon with ( n ) sides is given by: [ frac{n(n-3)}{2} ] This is because each vertex connects to ( n-3 ) other vertices forming diagonals, and each diagonal is counted twice. 2. Setting Up the Equation: According to the problem, the number of diagonals is 33 more than the number of sides. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: [ frac{n(n-3)}{2} = n + 33 ] 3. Eliminating the Fraction: To clear the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 2: [ n(n-3) = 2(n + 33) ] 4. Expanding and Simplifying: Distribute ( n ) on the left-hand side and 2 on the right-hand side: [ n^2 - 3n = 2n + 66 ] 5. Rearranging the Terms: Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero: [ n^2 - 3n - 2n - 66 = 0 ] Combine like terms: [ n^2 - 5n - 66 = 0 ] 6. Solving the Quadratic Equation: To solve the quadratic equation ( n^2 - 5n - 66 = 0 ), use the quadratic formula, ( n = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -5 ), and ( c = -66 ): [ n = frac{-(-5) pm sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-66)}}{2 cdot 1} ] Simplify inside the square root: [ n = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 + 264}}{2} ] [ n = frac{5 pm sqrt{289}}{2} ] Since (sqrt{289} = 17), we have: [ n = frac{5 pm 17}{2} ] 7.

Step 2: Check Each Case - **Last Digit is 0**: The sum of the first two digits must be 26, which is not possible with digits from 0 to 9. - **Last Digit is 2**: The sum of the first two digits must be 24. The maximum sum for any two digits (each being at most 9) is 18, so this is not possible. - **Last Digit is 4**: The sum of the first two digits must be 22.

The function f(x) is defined when the expression under the square root, log_{frac{1}{2}}(2x-1), is positive, because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real number system. Additionally, since we are taking the log_{frac{1}{2}} of (2x-1), this value must be positive. Hence, we have two conditions: 1. log_{frac{1}{2}}(2x-1) > 0 2. 2x-1 > 0 Now, let's solve the second condition and find the domain of 2x-1: 2x-1 > 0 implies x > frac{1}{2} This tells us that the domain of f(x) is (frac{1}{2}, +infty). Next, we will consider f(x+1) which translates every point in the function to the left by 1.

However, we need to ensure that after shifting the function, the first condition (logarithm being positive) remains valid. Let's solve the first condition with the shifted function f(x+1): log_{frac{1}{2}}(2(x+1)-1) > 0 Which simplifies to: log_{frac{1}{2}}(2x+1) > 0 Since frac{1}{2} is between 0 and 1, the logarithm with base frac{1}{2} is a decreasing function. Therefore, for the inequality log_{frac{1}{2}}(2x+1) > 0 to hold, (2x+1) must be less than 1: 2x+1 < 1 implies x < 0 Thus, the upper bound for the domain of f(x+1) is 0.

To find out how many days it will take them to complete the work, we divide the total work (which is 1, representing the whole job) by their combined work rate: Days to complete the work = Total work / Combined work rate Days to complete the work = 1 / (47/300) Days to complete the work = 300 / 47 Now, we divide 300 by 47 to get the number of days: Days to complete the work ≈ 6.38 days Since they can't work a fraction of a day, we can round up to the nearest whole day.

Now, we know that the correct average is 40, so the correct sum of the 10 numbers should be ( 10 times 40 = 400 ). Since the corrected sum after fixing the first error is 386, we need to add the difference between the actual second number (31) and the wrongly copied number ( x ) to get the correct sum of 400.

Therefore, the runs made by running between the wickets are 60% of T: Runs from running = 60% of T = 0.60 * T Now, we can express the total score (T) as the sum of the runs from boundaries, sixes, and running: T = Runs from boundaries + Runs from sixes + Runs from running T = 48 runs + 0.60 * T To find T, we need to solve for T in the equation above: T - 0.60 * T = 48 runs 0.40 * T = 48 runs T = 48 runs / 0.40 T = 120 runs Therefore, the batsman's total score was boxed{120} runs."},{"prompt":"The condition x^{2} > 1 is a ( ) condition for x > 1.

These perfect squares are: (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121). **Step 2: Calculate Digits** - For those ages, we will calculate the product and sum of their digits to find a match that satisfies the condition.

We start by observing the equal arcs given by the problem: - (widehat{ABC} = widehat{BCD} = widehat{CDE}) - Since the angles subtended by the arcs (overarc{BC}) are equal, it follows that the line segments joining these points must be parallel, i.e., (BC parallel AD) and (CD parallel BE). 3.

(3) According to the problem, 400 + 10x^2 - 120x < 80, we get x^2 - 12x + 32 < 0 Solving this, we get 4 < x < 8, i.e., 4 < sqrt{6t} < 8, solving for t gives frac{8}{3} < t < frac{32}{3} Since frac{32}{3} - frac{8}{3} = 8, there are approximately boxed{8} hours of water supply tension each day."},{"prompt":"Prove that for any integer ( n geq 2 ), there exists a set of ( 2^{n1} ) points in the plane such that no three of them are collinear and no ( 2n ) points are the vertices of a convex ( 2n )gon.","completion":"1. **Define initial set S_2**: Let [ S_2 = { (0,0), (1,1) }. ] 2. **Construct the set S_n recursively**: - For any integer ( n geq 2 ), assume the set ( S_n ) has been defined. - Choose a sufficiently large real number ( M_n ) such that for any ((x_i, y_i), (x_j, y_j), (x_k, y_k), (x_h, y_h) in S_n), the following inequality holds: [ frac{y_i + M_n - y_j}{x_i + 2^{n-1} - x_j} > frac{y_k - y_h}{x_k - x_h}. ] 3. **Define the translated set T_n**: - Define the set ( T_n ) as follows: [ T_n = S_n + (2^{n-1}, M_n) = { (x + 2^{n-1}, y + M_n) mid (x, y) in S_n }. ] 4. **Define the set S_{n+1}**: - Combine ( S_n ) and ( T_n ) to form the set ( S_{n+1} ): [ S_{n+1} = S_n cup T_n. ] - It is clear that ( left| S_{n+1} right| = 2^n ). 5. **Verify properties for ( S_{n+1} )**: - Since any three points in ( S_n ) are not collinear, and any three points in ( T_n ) are not collinear from the construction of ( M_n ), any three points in ( S_{n+1} ) are also not collinear. Thus, the property holds for ( S_{n+1} ). 6. **Minimum natural number ( n ) such that ( S_n ) may contain ( 2n ) points forming a convex ( 2n )-gon**: - Suppose ( n ) is the smallest natural number for which ( S_n ) contains exactly ( 2n ) points forming a convex ( 2n )-gon. - Construct this convex ( 2n )-gon and draw the diagonal connecting the vertices with the smallest and largest ( x )-coordinates. - This diagonal divides the ( 2n )-gon into two smaller convex polygons, one of which has an edge count not smaller than ( n+1 ). - Let the ( n+1 ) vertices be ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{n+1} ) with ( x_1 < x_2 < cdots < x_{n+1} ). 7. **Use the convexity property**: - By the convexity property of the polygon, for ( i = 2, 3, ldots, n ), we have: [ frac{y_i - y_{i-1}}{x_i - x_{i-1}} < frac{y_{i+1} - y_i}{x_{i+1} - x_i}. ] 8. **Determine vertex set membership**: - Given the minimum ( n ), we know that ( x_1 in S_{n-1} ) and ( x_{n+1} in T_{n-1} ). Therefore, there exists ( 2 leq k leq n ) such that ( P_k in S_{n-1} ) and ( P_{k+1} in T_{n-1} ). - Assuming ( k = n ), if not, and assuming ( k < n ), we will contradict the convexity property because ( T_{n-1} ) contains points ((x_{k+1}^{prime}, y_{k+1}^{prime})) and ((x_{k+2}^{prime}, y_{k+2}^{prime})) such that: [ (x_{k+i}, y_{k+i}) = (x_{k+i}^{prime} + 2^{n-2}, y_{k+i}^{prime} + M_{n-1}), i = 1, 2. ] 9. **Checking contradiction**: - From the definition of ( T_{n-1} ), we get: [ frac{y_{k+1} - y_k}{x_{k+1} - x_k} < frac{y_{k+2}^{prime} - y_{k+1}^{prime}}{x_{k+2}^{prime} - x_{k+1}^{prime}}. ] - This is a direct contradiction to our previous step. 10. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, for every ( n ), there are no ( 2n ) points in ( S_n ) forming the vertices of a convex ( 2n )-gon.

Let this difference be positive. - Rotate the ( N )-gon such that the endpoints ( A ) and ( B ) of the diameter become diametrically opposite to each other again, but now with each end lying on one of the previously identified significant sides. 4. **Examining Changes Upon Rotation**: - When the ( N )-gon is suitably rotated, reevaluate the sum differences across the diameter. If the original difference was positive, rotating should change this difference. - Construct a new situation with diametrically opposite positions at vertices, and evaluate this difference shift. 5. **Calculations**: - Let the sum differences before rotation be ( D ). - After rotation, let the new difference be given by flipping the sum calculations, say now ( 2(A - B) ) where ( A ) and ( B ) represent modified sum values. - Recognize the constraints derived from logical bounds on sums and differences within the ( N )-gon configuration, particularly using the theoretical bound ( 999-100 = 899 ), adjusting for positional shifts and evaluating the overall differences. 6. **Concluding Properties**: - Remember that following 50 full turns (or other counts proportional to the ( N )-gon sides), the difference in the sum must at some point switch from positive to negative, indicating that certain required side properties inherently cross a midpoint. 7. **Symbolic Boundaries**: - The typical interval ([-900, 900]) helps formalize this consideration, where differences after specified rotations remain realistic, i.e., changing by at most ( 1800 ). 8. **Contradiction Finalization**: - Given the properties, it then follows in ( N geq 5 ) cases, that assumptions contradict our initial given condition because the required difference lies in the restricted interval necessary to form the initial triangle containing the polygon. - Thus proving the initial statement was indeed incorrectly negated and the sides exist as stated. This requires the contradiction stepping within sums and logical boundary requirements, particularly illustrating steps. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{The statement that such three sides exist is true, proving the assertion.}} ]"},{"prompt":"John had a stock of 620 books in his bookshop.

To determine these, divide each number by the highest power of 2 that it can be divided by, leaving the largest odd number as the remainder. - For instance, 8 becomes 1 (since ( frac{8}{2^3} = 1 )), 12 becomes 3 (since ( frac{12}{2^2} = 3 )), 18 becomes 9, and so forth. 2. There are only 100 possible distinct odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, ... , 199). 3.

In context to the solution to problem a): - If we consider odd divisors of the selected integers as in part (a), we continue to have the maximum of such digits to be 1, 3, 5, ..., 31, which are 16 in total. 3. Hence, any integer less than 16 must ensure that: - It can be included in the set of multiples as defined in part (b) multiplied by the distinct powers of 2. 4. Since the integer is less than 16, it has to be fairly low to not generate overlaps by repeatedly multiplying such low integer by powers of 2, to surpass the condition framed in problem (b). 5. Given the pigeonhole principle: - We have 100 integers, many significantly sharing similar factors and within each defined multiple, so such distribution eventually creates multiples subset.

Applying the AM-GM inequality: [ frac{x^3 + y^3 + frac{1}{27}}{3} geq sqrt[3]{x^3 y^3 left(frac{1}{27}right)} ] 3. **Simplifying the Expression:** Simplify the right-hand side of the inequality: [ frac{x^3 + y^3 + frac{1}{27}}{3} geq sqrt[3]{x^3 y^3 left(frac{1}{27}right)} = sqrt[3]{ frac{x^3 y^3}{27} } = sqrt[3]{x^3 y^3} cdot frac{1}{3} ] Since ( sqrt[3]{x^3 y^3} = xy ), we can rewrite this as: [ frac{x^3 + y^3 + frac{1}{27}}{3} geq frac{xy}{3} ] 4. **Multiplying Both Sides by 3:** Multiply both sides by 3 to obtain: [ x^3 + y^3 + frac{1}{27} geq xy ] 5. **Condition for Equality:** The equality ( x^3 + y^3 + frac{1}{27} = xy ) holds if and only if ( x^3 = y^3 = frac{1}{27} ) (Equality condition in AM-GM inequality). 6. **Solving for ( x ):** Therefore, we get: [ x^3 = frac{1}{27} ] Taking the cube root of both sides: [ x = sqrt[3]{frac{1}{27}} = frac{1}{3} ] 7. **Finding ( frac{1}{x} ):** Now, we need to find ( frac{1}{x} ): [ frac{1}{x} = frac{1}{frac{1}{3}} = 3 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{3} ]"},{"prompt":"For any natural number ( n ), let ( a_{n} ) denote the units digit of ( n^{n} ) in decimal representation.

Both pass through the center ( O ) and are perpendicular bisectors within the square. - Given that points ( M ) and ( K ) as well as ( N ) and ( L ) are symmetrically located relative to ( O ), the pairs ( O - M ) and ( O - K ) as well as ( O - N ) and ( O - L ) are of equal length: [ OM = OK quad text{and} quad ON = OL ] 6. **Parallelogram Argument:** - The diagonals ( OK ) and ( ON ) intersect at ( O ), and since ( O ) is the midpoint: [ OM = OK quad text{and} quad ON = OL ] - The quadrilateral ( MNKL ) thus forms a parallelogram where diagonals bisect each other. 7. **Verification of Square Properties:** - The conditions given imply that the diagonals are also perpendicular: [ angle MON = 90^{circ} ] - Since ( MNKL ) is a parallelogram with diagonals that bisect each other and are perpendicular, it satisfies all the additional properties of a square. # Conclusion: The points ( M, N, K, ) and ( L ) that intersect the sides of the original square indeed form a square too due to their equal lengths, angle properties and bisected diagonals intersecting perpendicularly.

Solution:** 1. Consider the hexagon (ABCDEF) with the properties that opposite sides are parallel and diagonals connecting opposite vertices are equal. 2. Let's analyze the quadrilateral (ABDE). Since the diagonals (AD) and (BE) are equal, (ABDE) is an isosceles trapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. This implies that the angles (angle ADE) and (angle ABE) are equal. 3. By a similar argument, the quadrilaterals (BCFE) and (CDAF) are also isosceles trapezoids. Therefore, the adjacent angles in these trapezoids are also equal, which further implies that each pair of opposite angles sums up to (180^circ). 4. Consider the quadrilateral (CDEF). Since opposite angles sum up to (180^circ), (CDEF) is a cyclic quadrilateral, meaning it can be inscribed in a circle. 5. Since (B) lies on this circle (by the property (angle EBC = angle EFC)), point (B) also lies on the circumcircle of (CDEF). 6. Likewise, point (A) lies on this circle (by the property (angle FAD = angle FCD)). 7. Thus, all six vertices (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) lie on the same circle, meaning the hexagon can be circumscribed. # Conclusion: Given that the diagonals connecting opposite vertices of the hexagon are equal and the opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be inscribed in a circle. [ boxed{} ] **II. Solution:** 1. Consider the quadrilateral (ABDE). Since (ABDE) is an isosceles trapezoid, the perpendicular bisectors of the parallel sides (AB) and (DE) intersect at a common point. This point is the center of the circumscribed circle of (ABDE). 2. Let's denote this intersection point as (O_1). Similarly, for the quadrilaterals (BCFE) and (CDAF), we have points (O_2) and (O_3) respectively. 3. By geometric properties of isosceles trapezoids, the perpendicular bisectors of opposite sides of the entire hexagon (ABCDEF) (since (ABCDEF) is divided into three isosceles trapezoids) will meet at a single point (O). This point (O) is equidistant from vertices (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F). 4. Therefore, (O) is at an equal distance from each vertex of the hexagon, and hence it is the center of the circumscribed circle of hexagon (ABCDEF). # Conclusion: The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the hexagon meet at a single point equidistant from all vertices, implying the existence of a circumscribed circle for the hexagon. [ boxed{} ] **Remarks:** The theorem also holds for a hexagon that is not simple (inward looped hexagon) as demonstrated by the intersection of two exterior and one interior angle bisectors of the triangle formed by the equal diagonals.

The ratio is S:C, which is 18:81. To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor of 18 and 81, which is 9.

What is the minimum number of regions into which these circles divide the plane?","completion":"1. **Defining the Problem and Initial Conditions**: We are given that there are circles on a plane such that exactly 12 points lie on at least two circles. We need to determine the minimum number of regions these circles divide the plane into. 2. **Connecting and Intersecting Circles**: Define a set of circles ( M ) as connected if from any point on any circle we can move along the arcs to reach any other circle in the set. We'll prove the following statement: If a set ( M ) of circles is decomposed into exactly ( m ) connected components, and there are exactly ( k ) points where at least two circles intersect, then these circles divide the plane into at least ( k + m + 1 ) regions. 3. **Single Connected Component ( ( m=1 ) )**: Start by considering ( m=1 ), meaning ( M ) is connected. Draw the circles one by one such that the resulting set always remains connected. This is possible because any newly added circle intersects or touches at least one of the previously drawn circles due to the connectedness of ( M ). - **First Drawing Step**: When the first circle is drawn, it divides the plane into 2 regions, the interior and the exterior of the circle. There are no points that lie on at least two circles, so the number of such points is 0. - **Subsequent Drawing Steps**: In each step, when a new circle is drawn, let the ( n )-th circle intersect the already drawn circles in ( l ) points (( l geq 1 )). Each intersection point creates ( l ) arcs from the new circle, dividing the plane further. As a result, the number of regions increases by ( l ), and the total number of points where circles intersect (each counted at most once) also increases by ( l ). Therefore, the number of new regions created in this step is at least ( l ). Accumulating these steps: After drawing all circles and accounting for ( k ) points, the minimum number of regions formed is at least ( k + 2 ). 4. **Multiple Connected Components ( ( m > 1 ) )**: Next, consider the case where ( M ) has ( m > 1 ) connected components. Let ( k_i ) be the number of points where at least two circles intersect within the ( i )-th component (( i=1,2,ldots,m )). In each connected component, the plane is divided into at least ( k_i + 2 ) regions. Summing over all components, noting ( k = sum_{i=1}^{m} k_i ), and recognizing that we've counted the outer infinite region ( m ) times, the total number of regions is given by: [ sum_{i=1}^{m} (k_i + 2) - (m-1) = k + 2m - (m-1) ] Simplifying, we get: [ k + m + 1 ] 5. **Applying the Given Data**: Given ( k = 12 ) points where at least two circles intersect, substituting into ( k + m + 1 ) with ( m ) as the number of connected components, we get the minimum number of regions: [ 12 + m + 1 ] For the minimized case, we assume ( m = 2 ) as the minimum number of connecting parts required, but usually, ( m = 1 ) is used for simplification in such cases, thus yielding: [ k + 1 + 1 = 12 + 1 + 1 = 14 ] This configuration (as shown in the diagram for four mutually intersecting circles, forming 14 regions) can be achieved when exactly four circles intersect each other pairwise, creating a minimum standard topology. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{14} ] Therefore, the minimum number of regions these circles can divide the plane into is 14."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=begin{cases} 3^{3+log_{2}{x}}, & x > 0 f(x+frac{1}{2}), & xleqslant 0 end{cases}, then f(2018)= _____ A: frac{1}{3} B: 3 C: frac{1}{9} D: 9","completion":"**Analysis** This question examines the method of finding function values, including the properties of functions, the rules of logarithmic operations, computational problem-solving skills, and the concept of functions and equations.

Choose one of the five segments from which we will take rings to open. 2. Open all 3 rings from this chosen segment. 3. Each of the 3 rings will then be used to link to the other 4 segments: - Use the first opened ring to connect the chosen segment to the second segment. - Use the second opened ring to connect to the third segment. - Similarly, use the third opened ring to connect to the fourth segment. - This ensures that the fifth segment is also connected, resulting in one continuous chain. 5. **Validation of the Approach:** - If we try to open fewer than 3 rings, we would not have enough rings to connect all the segments.

Each pair of rooks (R_1, R_2) located at (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) determines two opposite vertices of a rectangle, which in turn determines two empty squares at coordinates (x_1, y_2) and (x_2, y_1).

Let (a = 2^m) and (b = 2^n) where (m > n). Then: [ frac{2^m}{m} leq frac{2^n}{n - 1} ] - It is obvious that (frac{2^m}{m} geq 2), so (b) must be 2. Therefore, (a = 2v_2(a)). Since (a > b = 2), we have (a = 4). 2. **Case 2: (v_2(a) < v_2(b))** - Similarly to Case 1, we would get (a = 2), which contradicts (a > b). 3. **Case 3: (v_2(a) = v_2(b) = c)** - Let (a = 2^c cdot a') and (b = 2^c cdot b') where (a') and (b') are odd. - Substituting into the original equation, we get: [ (2^c(a' - b'))^{ab} = (2^c)^{ab}(a' - b')^{ab} = 2^{abc}(a' - b')^{ab} ] [ a^b b^a = (2^c a')^b (2^c b')^a = 2^{bc} a'^b 2^{ac} b'^a = 2^{a+b} a'^b b'^a ] - Since (ab > a + b) (because (a > b) and both are even), this leads to a contradiction.

When envisioning a scene styled around samurai legends with intricate brushwork under a setting sun, we enter a world that is both dramatic and serenely poetic. Imagine the scene unfolding on a washi (traditional Japanese paper) or silk canvas, dominated by monochromatic shades of black ink, yet filled with profound depth and contrast. The samurai stands as the focal point, possibly depicted in a moment of solitude, reflecting the bushido (the way of the warrior), which emphasizes honor, courage, and discipline. The samurai could be shown in profile, capturing a moment of contemplation. The details of the armor, known as yoroi, reveal the intricate brushwork; each stroke adds depth and texture, giving life to the hard and soft elements of the armor. The helmet (kabuto), with its intricate design, signifies the status and the spirit of the samurai. In the background, the setting sun creates a dramatic backdrop, with the ink diluted to various shades of gray to depict the fading light. The sun, perhaps partially hidden by rolling hills or a silhouette of a distant Mount Fuji, casts elongated shadows and brings a warm, albeit monochromatic, glow to the scene. Delicate, yet bold brush strokes might suggest a breeze, gently swaying the grass or the cherry blossoms, adding a transient beauty to the scene. This fleeting beauty, known as mono no aware, is a celebration of the ephemeral nature of life, echoing the samurai’s readiness to face their destiny. Nature plays a significant role in the composition, with elements like a meandering stream or aged pine trees framing the scene, their rugged textures contrasting with the smooth flow of the water and the softness of the sky at dusk. These elements are not just fillers; they symbolize endurance, flow, and the transition of time. The intricate brushwork is not merely a technical showcase but a medium through which the principles of Zen Buddhism are conveyed—the harmony between man and nature, the balance between strength and softness, and the beauty of the moment. The setting sun is a powerful symbol within this context, representing both the end and the beginning, the impermanence of glory, and the cycle of life and death. This envisioned ink drawing is not just a visual representation but a narrative woven with cultural, philosophical, and aesthetic threads unique to Japanese art, capturing a moment that tells a story larger than the scene itself—a testament to the legacy of the samurai and the enduring beauty found in the mastery of sumi-e."},{"prompt":"Japanese ink drawing, in the style of samurai legends, intricate brushwork, setting sun, normal, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, Begin title with \\"Coated Greeting Cards\\", do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","completion":"Coated Greeting Cards: Samurai Legends at Sunset, Exquisite Japanese Ink Artistry"},{"prompt":"Japanese ink drawing, in the style of samurai legends, intricate brushwork, setting sun, normal, generate a 200 char length description that is personable and describe the {model} Coated Greeting card, include it being a great gift for people, collections or holiday, Material: 270gsm paper Four sizes, quantities and paper finishes to choose from Double-sided print Horizontal and vertical options available Blanks sourced from USA Envelopes included, do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","completion":"Embrace the art of Japanese ink drawing with our exquisite Samurai Legends Greeting Card.

Consequently, it is theoretically important to Miliband to know who actually controls state power at any given time. One of the most direct indicators of ruling-class domination is the degree to which members of the capitalist class control the state apparatus through interlocking positions in the governmental, administrative, coercive and other apparatuses. Miliband (1969, 54) emphasizes that: It is these institutions in which “state power” lies, and it is through them that this power is wielded in its different manifestations by the people who occupy the leading positions in each of these institutions. For this reason, Miliband attaches considerable importance to the social composition of the state elite. The class composition of a state elite creates “a strong presumption … as to its general outlook, ideological dispositions and political bias” and, thus, one way to measure the degree of potential class domination is to quantify the extent to which members of a particular class have disproportionately colonized command posts within the state apparatuses (Miliband, 1969, 55). In the eyes of critics, Miliband’s theory of the state is considered synonymous with the concept of institutional colonization. This misrepresentation of Miliband’s analysis has wildly exaggerated his empirical claims about the direct domination of the state apparatuses by members of the capitalist class. Despite the importance of institutional colonization to Miliband’s (1969, 55) analysis, his empirical claims about the degree to which capitalists colonize the state apparatus were always circumscribed by his recognition that capitalists have not “assumed the major share of government” in most advanced capitalist democracies.6 For that reason, Miliband (1969, 59) argues that capitalists “are not, properly speaking, a ‘governing’ class, comparable to pre-industrial, aristocratic and landowning classes.”7 Indeed, a fact completely ignored by Miliband’s (1969, 55) critics is that he quotes Karl Kautsky to the effect that “the capitalist class reigns but does not govern.”8 The colonization of key command posts in selected state apparatuses is merely one weapon, albeit an important one, in the larger arsenal of ruling class domination. What Miliband (1969, 56, 48) actually claims is that capitalists are “well represented in the political executive and in other parts of the state system” and that their occupation of these key command posts enables them to exercise decisive influence over public policy.9 The fact that finance capitalists usually control the executive branch of government and the administrative-regulatory apparatuses is considered particularly important, under normal circumstances, for both historical and theoretical reasons. In historical terms, the political development of the modern state system has been marked mainly by the growth of its regulatory, administrative, and coercive institutions over the course of the last century. As these institutions have grown in size, numbers, and technical complexity, the state’s various subsystems have achieved greater autonomy from government in their operations. The growth of independent administrative and regulatory subsystems within the state has occurred as governments, especially legislatures, have found it increasingly difficult to maintain any central direction over the many components of the state system. The historical result is that the preponderance of state power has shifted from the legislative to the executive branch of government and to independent administrative or regulatory agencies. This development is theoretically important partly because the very basis of state power is concentrated in those institutions (i.e., administration, coercion, knowledge) and because it is those institutions that the capitalist class has colonized most successfully. Thus, the actual degree of state power that capitalists achieve by colonizing executive, administrative, and regulatory command posts has been magnified by the asymmetrical power structure within the contemporary state system, (e.g., in the United States by the imperial presidency and the emergence of independent regulatory agencies). This asymmetrical distribution of state power within the contemporary state form provides capitalists with strategic locations inside the state system from which to initiate, modify, and veto a broad range of policy proposals.10 Miliband recognizes that a potential weakness of this more limited claim is the fact that capitalists usually colonize only the top command posts of government and administration. The colonization process is clearly unable to explain the operational unity of the entire state system and, therefore, one must be able to identify the mechanism that leads a number of relatively autonomous and divergent state subsystems to operate as if they were a single entity called the state.11 Indeed, the loose connection of lower level career administrators to the state elite is indicated by Miliband’s description of them as servants of the state. In fact, these servants are frequently conceptualized as a separate professional-managerial class composed of lower and middle level career state managers (Ehrenreich and Ehrenreich, 1977).12 Miliband (1969, 119) observes that: The general pattern must be taken to be one in which these men [i.e. state managers] do play an important part in the process of governmental decision-making, and therefore constitute a considerable force in the configuration of political power in their societies. Likewise, a problem of systemic unity derives from the disparate organization of the contemporary state apparatus. To the extent that the state system is viewed as a web of decentered institutions, one must account for how the state elite and state managers are able to maintain some overarching interinstitutional cohesion that is “capitalist” in its content. Miliband has attempted to explain the coherence of the state system by suggesting that its operational unity is partly ideological. He argues that most state elites, including those who are not members of the capitalist class, “accept as beyond question the capitalist context in which they operate.” In Miliband’s (1969, 72, 75) account, the ideological commitments of state elites and state managers are of “absolutely fundamental importance in shaping their attitudes, policies and actions in regard to specific issues and problems with which they are confronted.” The result of their underlying ideological unity is that “the politics of advanced capitalism have been about different conceptions of how to run the same economic and social system.” Miliband (1969, 75) certainly recognizes that state elites and state managers in the various apparatuses, whether members of the capitalist class or not “wish, without a doubt, to pursue many ends, personal as well as public.” However, the underlying ideological unity of state elites and state managers means that “all other ends are conditioned by, and pass through the prism of, their acceptance of and commitment to the existing economic system.” Thus, in an observation that seems to anticipate Claus Offe’s (1975; 1984, 126) “dependency principle,” Miliband (1969, 75) observes that: … it is easy to understand why governments should wish to help business in every possible way. … For if the national interest is in fact inextricably bound up with the fortunes of capitalist enterprise, apparent partiality towards it is not really partiality at all. On the contrary, in serving the interests of business and in helping capitalist enterprise to thrive, governments are really fulfilling their exalted role as guardians of the good of all. Otherwise, as Miliband describes it, the modern state system in capitalist societies is a vast and sprawling network of political institutions loosely coordinated, if at all, through mechanisms that provide a tenuous cohesion at best. Importantly, for Miliband, the diffuseness of the state system in capitalist societies also means that the conquest of state power is never an all or nothing proposition, because it is—in the Gramscian phrase—a war of fixed position, waged on many fronts, in many trenches, with shifting lines of battle, where victories and successes occur side by side on the same day. The conquest of state power is never absolute; it is never uncontested; and it is never complete, because it is an on-going and contingent political struggle.13 Hence, Miliband’s concept of the state requires an analysis and understanding of state power that always refers to particular historical circumstances and to institutional configurations that may vary widely from one capitalist society to another, and where over time class hegemony may shift in one direction or another within the same society. Indeed, Miliband (1969, 77) is quite explicit in pointing out that state elites “have in fact been compelled over the years to act against some property rights, to erode some managerial prerogatives, to help redress somewhat the balance between capital and labour, between property and those who are subject to it.” ”翻译为中文","completion":"什么是国家权力？ 因此，对于米尔班德来说，理论上重要的是要知道在任何特定时间谁实际上控制着国家权力。统治阶级控制的最直接指标之一是资本家阶级的成员在政府、行政、强制和其他机构中通过相互关联的职位控制国家机器的程度。米尔班德(1969, 54)强调: 正是这些机构拥有“国家权力”，并且正是通过这些机构的领导者，这些权力以其不同的表现形式被施加。 出于这个原因，米尔班德非常重视国家精英的社会组成。国家精英的阶级组成“强烈假定……关于其一般观点、意识形态倾向和政治偏见”，因此，量化特定阶级的成员在国家机器内的指挥岗位上不成比例地占据支配地位的程度，是衡量潜在阶级统治程度的一种方法（米尔班德，1969, 55）。在批评者看来，米尔班德对国家理论的看法被认为与机构殖民概念是同义的。这对米尔班德分析的误解极大地夸大了他对资本家阶级成员直接统治国家机器的经验主张。 尽管机构殖民对米尔班德（1969，55）的分析很重要，但他对资本家殖民国家机器程度的经验主张始终受到他认识到的限制，即资本家在大多数先进资本主义民主国家中并未“承担政府的主要份额”。因此，米尔班德（1969，59）认为，资本家“严格来说，不是一个‘统治’阶级，与前工业、贵族和土地所有阶级不相当。”实际上，米尔班德（1969，55）的批评者完全忽略了他引用卡尔·考茨基的话说，“资本家阶级统治但不治理。”在选定的国家机器内占据关键指挥岗位只是统治阶级主导地位中的一种武器，尽管它很重要。米尔班德（1969，56, 48）实际上声称，资本家“在政治执行机构和国家系统的其他部分得到了良好的代表”，并且他们占据这些关键指挥岗使他们能够对公共政策施加决定性影响。 财务资本家通常控制政府的行政部门和监管机构，在正常情况下，这被认为特别重要，有历史和理论上的原因。从历史上看，现代国家系统的政治发展主要是通过过去一个世纪对其监管、行政和强制机构的增长来标记的。随着这些机构在规模、数量和技术复杂性方面的增长，国家的各种子系统在运作中实现了相对于政府的更大自主性。独立的行政和监管子系统在国家内的增长发生在政府，特别是立法机关，越来越难以对国家系统的许多组成部分保持任何中央指导的同时。历史结果是，国家权力的重心已从立法机关转移到政府的行政机关和独立的行政或监管机构。 这一发展在理论上部分重要，因为国家权力的基础集中在那些机构（即行政、强制、知识），而这些机构是资本家阶级最成功地殖民的。因此，资本家通过殖民行政、行政和监管指挥岗位实现的实际国家权力程度，已被当代国家系统内不对称的权力结构所放大（例如，在美国由皇帝式总统制和独立监管机构的出现）。在当代国家形态中，权力在国家内的不对称分配为资本家提供了从国家系统内的战略位置发起、修改和否决广泛政策建议的能力。米尔班德认识到这一更有限主张的一个潜在弱点是事实，即资本家通常只殖民政府和行政的顶级指挥岗位。殖民过程显然无法解释整个国家系统的运作统一性，因此，必须能够识别使相对自治和多样的国家子系统像一个叫做国家的单一实体那样运作的机制。 实际上，米尔班德对低层次的职业管理员与国家精英之间松散联系的描述表明他将这些人视为国家的仆人。事实上，这些仆人经常被概念化为由低中层级职业国家经理组成的独立的专业管理阶级（Ehrenreich和Ehrenreich，1977）。米尔班德（1969，119）观察到： 一般模式必须被视为这些人[即国家经理]在政府决策过程中发挥重要作用，因此在他们社会政治力量的配置中构成了相当大的力量。 同样，系统统一性的问题源于当代国家机器的不同构造。在某种程度上，如果将国家系统视为去中心化机构的网络，则必须说明国家精英和国家经理如何能够维持某种超越机构的凝聚力，这种凝聚力在其内容上是“资本家”的。米尔班德试图通过暗示其运作统一性部分是意识形态的来解释国家系统的一致性。他认为，大多数国家精英，包括那些不是资本家阶级成员的人，都“无可质疑地接受了他们所在的资本主义环境。”在米尔班德（1969，72，75）的描述中，国家精英和国家经理的意识形态承诺在“塑造他们面对的特定问题和问题的态度、政策和行动方面具有绝对根本的重要性。”他们潜在意识形态统一的结果是，“先进资本主义的政治是关于如何运行同一经济和社会体系的不同概念的。” 米尔班德（1969，75）当然认识到，在各种机构中的国家精英和国家经理，无论是否属于资本家阶级，“毫无疑问，希望追求许多目标，个人的和公共的。”然而，国家精英和国家经理的潜在意识形态统一意味着“所有其他目标都受到他们对现有经济系统的接受和致力的制约。”因此，在一次观察中，似乎预示了克劳斯·奥费的（1975；1984，126）“依赖原则”，米尔班德（1969，75）观察到： “……很容易理解为什么政府希望以一切可能的方式帮助商业。……因为如果国家利益实际上与资本主义企业的命运密不可分，那么对它的明显偏袒实际上根本不是偏袒。相反，在为商业服务并帮助资本主义企业繁荣时，政府实际上是在履行它们作为所有人福祉守护者的崇高角色。” 此外，正如米尔班德所描述的，资本主义社会中的现代国家系统是一个庞大而杂乱的政治机构网络，如果有的话，仅通过提供最微弱的凝聚力的机制来松散协调。对米尔班德来说，资本主义社会中国家系统的分散性也意味着，征服国家权力从来不是一个全有或全无的命题，因为它是——用格拉西亚的说法——一个固定位置的战争，涉及许多战线，在许多战壕中进行，战线不断变化，胜利和成功在同一天并存。征服国家权力从未是绝对的；它从未不受争议；也永远不会完成，因为这是一场持续的、有条件的政治斗争。因此，米尔班德的国家概念需要对国家权力的分析和理解，这种分析和理解始终涉及特定的历史情况和可能在不同的资本主义社会之间广泛变化的制度配置，以及随着时间的推移，阶级霸权可能在同一社会内向一个或另一个方向转移。实际上，米尔班德（1969，77）在指出国家精英“实际上多年来被迫采取行动反对一些产权，侵蚀一些管理特权，帮助在资本和劳动之间、财产和受其支配者之间的平衡上有所调整”时非常明确。"},{"prompt":"请将“Poulantzas’ Theory of the State Nicos Poulantzas was relatively unknown to Anglo-American scholars until he initiated the Poulantzas-Miliband debate with his review of The State in Capitalist Society in late 1969 (Buchanan, 2010, 381). When Poulantzas informed readers that his critique of Miliband derived from epistemological positions presented more fully in his Pouvoir Politique et Classes Sociales (1968), the debate itself stimulated a demand for Poulantzas’ book, which was finally published in English in 1973.14 SOCIAL CLASS AND POLITICAL PRACTICE In Political Power and Social Classes, Poulantzas (1978a, 1–22) claims that every mode of production can be understood theoretically in terms of the functional interrelations between its economic, political, and ideological levels.15 Each level in a mode of production consists of structures, which tend to reproduce and stabilize the mode of production and class practices, which generate conflicts and contradictions within the mode of production (Poulantzas, 1978a, 37, 86). A structure consists of one or more institutions that fulfill specific economic, political, or ideological functions necessary to sustain a particular mode of production. For instance, the economic structure of a capitalist society is constituted primarily by the social relations of production as defined in Marx’s Capital.16 The political structures of a mode of production consist of the institutionalized power of the state (Poulantzas, 1978a, 42). The ideological structures of a mode of production refer both to the subjective consciousness of individual social actors and to the collective thought-systems that exist in a given society (Poulantzas, 1978a, 28–34; Therborn, 1980, 2). A stable social formation—that is, a social system in equilibrium—is one where the structures at each level function together as an integrated system to maintain and extend the dominant relations of production and, hence, the ability of a dominant class to appropriate surplus value from a subordinate laboring class. However, Poulantzas emphasizes that the normal functioning of structures within the capitalist mode of production generates contradictory class practices that simultaneously destabilize the conditions of ruling class domination. In Political Power and Social Classes, Poulantzas (1978a, 41) explains class practices as the effects of: (1) structural dislocations generated by class struggle and (2) the uneven development of structures between and within the levels of a social formation.17 In direct contrast to what he calls the “historicist conception” of class practice, Poulantzas (1978a, 66) argues that “relations of production as a structure are not social classes … capital and wage-labour are not, of course, the empirical realities of ‘capitalists’ and ‘labourers’.” Instead, for Poulantzas (1978a, 66), the relations of production: … consist of specific forms of combination of the agents of production and the means of production. This structure of relations of production “determines the places and functions occupied and adopted by the agents of production, who are never anything more than the occupants of these places, in so far as they are supports of these functions.” Thus, Poulantzas can never regard the main tasks of Marxist political theory as empirical or historical, because such analyses in his framework confuse the agents of production (i.e., groups of individuals) with the structural-functional relations that determine social class. Individuals “support” and “carry out” various functions within temporal history, but these functions are in no way dependent upon particular individuals or groups of individuals. Hence, even before the publication of Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society, Poulantzas (1978a, 62) was dismissing the historicist conception of class practice as one that: … leads ultimately to the establishment of an ideological relation between individuals/agents-of-production (“men”) and social classes; this relation is given a theoretical foundation in the status of the subject. Agents of production are perceived as agents/producers, as subjects which create structures; and social classes are perceived as the subjects of history. Poulantzas (1978a, 62) finds the historicist conception of class practice theoretically flawed because it “fails to recognize two essential facts: firstly, that the agents of production, for example the wage-earning labourer and the capitalist, as ‘personifications’ of Wage-Labour and Capital, are considered by Marx as the supports or bearers of an ensemble of structures; secondly, that social classes are never theoretically conceived by Marx as the genetic origin of structures.” Consequently, Poulantzas (1978a, 67–68) contends that “social class is a concept which shows the effects of the ensemble of structures, of the matrix of a mode of production or of a social formation on the agents which constitute its supports.” Social classes are structural effects, which mediate between structures (e.g., relations of production) and class practices (e.g., trade unionism). Indeed, according to Poulantzas (1978a, 86), “social classes are conceivable only in terms of class practices” and it is these practices which determine agency, not vice versa.18 Importantly, Poulantzas (1978a, 86) views the identification of specific class practices as synonymous with the concept of “contradiction” because “class practices can be analysed only as conflicting practices in the field of class struggle … for example, the contradiction between those practices which aim at the realization of profit and those which aim at the increase of wages.” In other words, it is impossible to understand the structural place of working class practices that aim to increase wages without taking into consideration how such aims contradict capitalist class practices that aim to realize higher and higher profits. In this example, capitalist and proletarian class practices are each produced as the contradictory structural effect of relations of production on the agents of production (who merely carry out and support these practices within the capitalist system). Certainly, one can find explicit textual support for this claim in Marx’s Capital and such a reading is perfectly consistent with the theoretical status accorded to that work by Poulantzas and other structuralists.19 Yet, the importance of class practices in mediating between structure and history in Poulantzas’ political theory raises some difficult and immanent epistemological issues. This is because Poulantzas (1978a, 41) equates “the political” with class practices and, thus, he defines the specific object of politics as “the ‘present moment’ (as Lenin said), i.e., the nodal point where the contradictions of the various levels of a formation are condensed in the complex relations governed by over-determination and by their dislocation and uneven development.” The epistemological difficulty for Poulantzas (1978a, 37) is that if the specific object of the political is the present moment, then “the problem of the political and politics is linked to the problem of history.” As noted earlier, Poulantzas argues that the “the problems of the general Marxist theory of the state and of the political class struggle” are addressed in a group of “political texts” by Marx, Engels, and Lenin that complement one’s reading of Capital. Interestingly, the critical text forging an explicit theoretical nexus between structure and history is the Communist Manifesto; namely, the single most significant text that Poulantzas does not include on his list of “Marxian classics” in political theory. Yet, at a crucial point in the development of his argument, Poulantzas (1978a, 37) introduces two propositions from the Communist Manifesto to provide a theoretical nexus between class practices and history: “(a) ‘Every class struggle is a political struggle’, and (b) ‘The class struggle is the motive force of history’.” Poulantzas never mentions that passage on the state emphasized so heavily by Miliband, but he does recognize that it is “possible to make a historicist reading” of the Communist Manifesto. In fact, to preempt such a reading, Poulantzas engages in a running polemic against “Marxist historicism” throughout Political Power and Social Classes and, after publication of The State in Capitalist Society, Poulantzas immediately identified Miliband as an exemplar of Marxist historicism. Significantly, Poulantzas (1978, 37–38) never challenges Miliband’s “first reading” of the Communist Manifesto, as such, but instead questions the effects of such a reading on political practice as leading “to the ideological invariant voluntarism/economism and to the various forms of revisionism, reformism, spontaneism, etc.” Yet, as if to compound the difficulty, Poulantzas (1978, 39), like Miliband, turns to Gramsci in addressing questions of the political only to find that Gramsci’s views are “often tainted by the historicism of Croce and Labriola.”20 ”翻译为中文","completion":"保兰察斯的国家理论 直到1969年晚些时候，他通过对《资本主义社会中的国家》的评论发起了保兰察斯-米尔班德辩论，尼科斯·保兰察斯对英美学者来说还相对不为人知（Buchanan，2010，381）。当保兰察斯告诉读者他对米尔班德的批判源自于他在其《政治权力与社会阶级》（1968）中更全面地提出的认识论立场时，这场辩论本身激发了人们对保兰察斯书籍的需求，该书最终于1973年以英语出版。 社会阶级与政治实践 在《政治权力与社会阶级》中，保兰察斯（1978a，1-22）声称，每一种生产方式都可以从其经济、政治和意识形态层面之间的功能性相互关系理论上理解。每一种生产方式中的每个层级由结构组成，这些结构倾向于再生产并稳定生产方式和阶级实践，这些实践在生产方式内部产生冲突和矛盾（保兰察斯，1978a，37，86）。一个结构由一个或多个机构组成，这些机构完成特定的、为维持特定生产方式所必需的经济、政治或意识形态功能。例如，资本主义社会的经济结构主要由马克思在《资本论》中界定的生产社会关系构成。生产方式的政治结构由国家的制度化权力构成（保兰察斯，1978a，42）。生产方式的意识形态结构既指个别社会行为者的主观意识，也指给定社会中存在的集体思维体系（保兰察斯，1978a，28-34；Therborn，1980，2）。一个稳定的社会形态——即一个平衡的社会系统——是指每个层级的结构作为一个整体一起功能，以维持和扩展主导的生产关系以及因此主导阶级从从属的劳动阶级那里获取剩余价值的能力。 然而，保兰察斯强调，资本主义生产方式内部结构的正常运作产生了矛盾的阶级实践，这些实践同时破坏了统治阶级统治的条件。在《政治权力与社会阶级》中，保兰察斯（1978a，41）将阶级实践解释为：（1）由阶级斗争产生的结构错位和（2）社会形态各层级之间及其内部结构的不均匀发展的结果。与他所说的“历史主义概念”相反，保兰察斯（1978a，66）认为“作为结构的生产关系不是社会阶级……资本和工资劳动当然不是‘资本家’和‘劳工’的经验现实。”相反，对于保兰察斯（1978a，66）而言，生产关系： …包含生产要素与生产手段的特定形式的结合。这种生产关系结构“决定了生产要素所占据和采用的位置和功能，这些要素仅仅是这些位置的占有者，因为它们是这些功能的支持者。” 因此，保兰察斯绝不会把马克思主义政治理论的主要任务视为经验或历史的，因为在他的框架内，这种分析将生产要素（即个体群体）与决定社会阶级的结构功能关系混为一谈。个人“支持”和“执行”历史中的各种功能，但这些功能绝不依赖于特定个人或个人群体。因此，甚至在《资本主义社会中的国家》出版之前，保兰察斯（1978a，62）就已经将历史主义的阶级实践观点视为一种： …最终建立起个体/生产要素之间的意识形态关系（“人”）与社会阶级之间的理论基础为主体地位。生产要素被视为代理人/生产者，作为创造结构的主体；社会阶级被视为历史的主体。 保兰察斯（1978a，62）认为历史主义的阶级实践观念在理论上是有缺陷的，因为它“未能认识到两个基本事实：首先，生产要素，例如领取工资的劳动者和资本家，作为工资劳动和资本的‘人格化’，被马克思视为结构整体的支持者或承担者；其次，社会阶级从未被马克思理论上视为结构的基因起源。”因此，保兰察斯（1978a，67-68）认为“社会阶级是一个概念，显示了一整套结构的效应，显示了一种生产方式或社会形态的矩阵对构成其支持的要素的影响。”社会阶级是结构效应，它介于结构（例如，生产关系）和阶级实践（例如，工会主义）之间。事实上，根据保兰察斯（1978a，86）的说法，“社会阶级只能以阶级实践的术语来理解”，而正是这些实践决定了代理性，而不是相反。 重要的是，保兰察斯（1978a，86）将特定阶级实践的识别视为与“矛盾”概念同义，因为“阶级实践只能作为阶级斗争领域中的冲突实践分析……例如，旨在实现利润的实践与旨在增加工资的实践之间的矛盾。”换句话说，如果不考虑这种目标如何与旨在实现越来越高利润的资本家阶级实践相矛盾，就不可能理解旨在增加工资的工人阶级实践在结构上的位置。在这个例子中，资本家和无产者阶级的实践都被生产如生产关系对生产要素的矛盾结构效应（这些要素仅在资本主义系统中承担和支持这些实践）。当然，在马克思的《资本论》中可以找到对这一主张的明确文本支持，这种解读与保兰察斯和其他结构主义者赋予该作品的理论地位完全一致。 然而，阶级实践在介于结构和历史之间发挥作用的重要性，为保兰察斯的政治理论提出了一些困难和内在的认识论问题。这是因为保兰察斯（1978a，41）将“政治”等同于阶级实践，因此，他将政治的具体对象定义为“‘当前时刻’（正如列宁所说），即，各层次矛盾在由过度决定和它们的错位及不均匀发展所统治的复杂关系中凝结的节点。”对于保兰察斯（1978a，37）来说，认识论难题在于，如果政治的具体对象是当前时刻，那么“政治和政治问题就与历史问题相关联。” 如前所述，保兰察斯认为，“马克思主义国家理论和政治阶级斗争的问题”在马克思、恩格斯和列宁的一组“政治文本”中得到了讨论，这些建议读者通过阅读《资本论》来补充。有趣的是，构建结构与历史之间明确理论联系的关键文本是《共产党宣言》；即，保兰察斯没有在政治理论中的“马克思主义经典”列表上包括的最重要的文本。然而，在其论点发展的关键时刻，保兰察斯（1978a，37）引入《共产党宣言》中的两个命题来提供阶级实践和历史之间的理论联系：“（a）‘每一次阶级斗争都是一场政治斗争’，和（b）‘阶级斗争是历史的动力’。” 保兰察斯没有提及米尔班德如此强调的有关国家的那段话，但他确实认识到“可能对《共产党宣言》做出历史主义解读”。事实上，为了预防这样的解读，保兰察斯在《政治权力与社会阶级》中一直与“马克思主义历史主义”进行抨击，并且在《资本主义社会中的国家》出版后，保兰察斯立即将米尔班德确定为马克思主义历史主义的典型例子。值得注意的是，保兰察斯（1978，37-38）从未质疑米尔班德对《共产党宣言》的“初步阅读”，但却质疑这样的阅读对政治实践的影响，认为它“导致意识形态不变的自愿主义/经济主义和各种形式的修正主义、改良主义、自发主义等。”然而，如果增加难度，保兰察斯（1978，39），像米尔班德一样，在处理政治问题时转向格拉西，只是发现格拉西的观点“经常被克罗齐和拉布里奥拉的历史主义所污染。”"},{"prompt":"请将“WHAT IS THE STATE? The contradictory effects of class practices on the equilibrium of the capitalist system means that immanent crisis tendencies are always disrupting the functional stability of the capitalist mode of production. Thus, the basic structure of the capitalist mode of production generates contradictory class practices, dislocations, and crisis tendencies, and it this inexorable disruption of the capitalist system that necessitates a separate structure to specifically maintain, monitor, and restore its equilibrium as a system. Although Poulantzas (1978, 45) modifies structural-functionalism by introducing class practices as a disequilibrating mechanism, nevertheless, he was clearly indebted to mainstream American functionalists and systems theorists insofar as he argues that the general function of the state in the capitalist mode of production is to serve as “the regulating factor of its global equilibrium as a system.”21 In particular, Poulantzas identifies three ensembles of class practices that require regulation by the state in order to maintain and restore the equilibrium of the capitalist system. First, Poulantzas argues contrary to the mythology of neo-classical economic theory, that the economic level of the capitalist mode of production has never “formed a hermetically sealed level, capable of self-production and possessing its own ‘laws’ of internal functioning.” Rather, the economic level of the capitalist mode of production is only relatively autonomous from the political and ideological levels, but given this relative autonomy, Poulantzas (1978, 45) concludes that structural “equilibrium is never given by the economic as such, but is maintained by the state.” To this extent, the state fulfills a general maintenance function “by constituting the factor of cohesion between the levels of a social formation” (Poulantzas 1978a, 44).22 Consequently, Poulantzas (1980, 17) identifies a second ensemble of class practices, constituted by the fact that “the political field of the State (as well as the sphere of ideology) has always, in different forms, been present in the constitution and reproduction of the relations of production.” Capitalist relations of production do not appear ex nihilo in history, nor do they reproduce themselves on a day-to-day basis without struggle and resistance on the part of subordinate classes whose labor is exploited by the capitalist class. Hence, in maintaining the cohesion of the levels of a social formation, Poulantzas (1978a, 52) observes that “the function of the state primarily concerns the economic level, and particularly the labour process, the productivity of labour.”23 This claim appears numerous times in Political Power and Social Classes and the claim is reiterated in both Classes in Contemporary Capitalism and State, Power, Socialism.24 Despite the evident importance of this function, Poulantzas (1978a, 53) also notes that “this function of the state as organizer of the labour process is only one aspect of its economic function.” The state also establishes and enforces the rules which organize capitalist exchanges (property and contract law, enforcement, punishment) and it functions to organize labor through its role of education, teaching, and so on. Finally, Poulantzas calls attention to an ensemble of class practices which occur “at the strictly political level” of the capitalist mode of production. Poulantzas (1978a, 53) identifies the strictly political function of the state with “the maintenance of political order in political class conflict.” By maintaining political order, by punishing disorder, and by monitoring political “subversion,” the state represses revolution and revolt and, thereby, maintains conditions of exploitation under the neutral guise of “law and order.” The operational objectives of state policy are realized through three “modalities of the state function.” The modalities of the state function identify the structural levels in which the effects of state policies are realized: (1) the technico-economic function at the economic level, (2) the political function at the level of class struggle, and (3) the ideological function at the cultural level. Regardless of the level at which the state’s modalities are effected, however, Poulantzas contends that the state function is always oriented “with particular reference to the productivity of labor.”25 The modalities of the state function are always implemented through three functional subsystems of the state: the judicial subsystem, the ideological subsystem, and the political subsystem. Poulantzas (1978a, 50, 53) argues that in capitalist societies the judicial subsystem is constituted as a set of rules, which facilitate market exchanges by providing a “framework of cohesion in which commercial encounters can take place,” (e.g., property and contract law, fair business practices). The state’s ideological subsystem functions primarily through public educational institutions, while the strictly political subsystem consists of institutions engaged in “the maintenance of political order in political class conflict” (e.g., electoral laws, the party system, police, bureaucracy).26 The state’s modalities each constitute political functions insofar as their operational objective is the maintenance and stabilization of a society in which the capitalist class is the dominant and exploitative class. As Poulantzas (1978a, 54) notes: … the state’s economic or ideological functions correspond to the political interests of the dominant class and constitute political functions, not simply in those cases where there is a direct and obvious relation between (a) the organization of labour and education and (b) the political domination of a class, but also where the object of these functions is the maintenance of the unity of the formation, inside which this class is the politically dominant class. It is to the extent that the prime object of these functions is the maintenance of this unity that they [i.e., the functions and their modalities] correspond to the political interests of the dominant class. It should be emphasized as a point of considerable theoretical significance that structures (i.e., the levels of the capitalist mode of production) are not reducible to the economic, political, or ideological institutions that compose them.27 On this point, David Gold, Clarence Lo, and Erik Olin Wright (1975, 36 fn.) observe that for Poulantzas the concept of “structure does not refer to the concrete social institutions that make up a society, but rather to the systematic functional interrelationships among these institutions.” Hence, Poulantzas’ structural analysis always emphasized “the functional relationship of various institutions to the process of surplus-value production and appropriation,”28 whereas Miliband tends to emphasize the empirical organization, operation, and control of particular institutions. WHAT IS STATE POWER? The differences between Miliband and Poulantzas concerning the importance of institutions initially appear to be much more than a mere difference in emphasis or theoretical focus. Miliband and Poulantzas each articulate competing concepts of state power that are linked inextricably to their methodological differences. Whereas Miliband articulates an institutionalist conception of power, anchored by the methodological (Weberian) assumptions of power structure research, Poulantzas articulates a functionalist conception of power anchored by the methodological (Parsonian) assumptions of systems analysis and structural functionalism. Notably, and in direct contrast to Miliband, Poulantzas draws a sharp analytic distinction between the concepts of state power and the state apparatus (Therborn, 1978, 148). Poulantzas (1978a, 104) defines state power as the capacity of a social class to realize its objective interests through the state apparatus. Bob Jessop (1982, 221) lends greater specificity to this idea by observing that within this framework “state power is capitalist to the extent that it creates, maintains, or restores the conditions required for capital accumulation in a given situation and it is non-capitalist to the extent these conditions are not realised.” In this respect, the objective effects of state policies on capital accumulation and the class structure are the main objective indicators of state power.29 On the other hand, the state apparatus is identified with two relations that are analytically (though not functionally) distinct from state power. Poulantzas (1978a, 116) defines the state apparatus as: “(a) The place of the state in the ensemble of the structures of a social formation,” that is, the state’s functions and “(b) The personnel of the state, the ranks of the administration, bureaucracy, army, etc.” The state apparatus is thus a unity of the effects of state power (i.e., policies) and the network of institutions and personnel through which the state function is executed.30 The functional unity between state power and the state apparatus in emphasized by Poulantzas (1978a, 115 fn. 24) with the observation “that structure is not the simple principle of organization which is exterior to the institution: the structure is present in an allusive and inverted form in the institution itself.” For Poulantzas (1978a, 115), the concept of the state apparatus intrinsically includes the functions executed through state institutions and by state personnel. Hence, in direct contrast to Miliband, Poulantzas insists that “the institutions of the state, do not, strictly speaking, have any power. Institutions, considered from the point of view of power, can be related only to social classes which hold power.”31 State institutions are political arenas for the exercise of class power and exist as such only by virtue of their functional role in the capitalist mode of production (Poulantzas, 1978a, 115).32 ”翻译为中文","completion":"什么是国家？ 阶级实践对资本主义体系平衡的矛盾效应意味着，固有的危机倾向始终在破坏资本主义生产方式的功能稳定性。因此，资本主义生产方式的基本结构产生矛盾的阶级实践、错位和危机倾向，正是这种不可避免的资本主义体系的破坏，使得一个独立的结构特别需要维护、监控并恢复其系统平衡。尽管保兰察斯（1978, 45）通过引入阶级实践作为失衡机制来修改结构功能主义，但他显然亏欠于主流美国功能主义者和系统理论家，因为他认为，国家在资本主义生产方式中的一般功能是作为“其作为系统的全局平衡的调节因素”。21 特别地，保兰察斯确定了三组需要国家调节以维持和恢复资本主义体系平衡的阶级实践。首先，保兰察斯认为，与新古典经济理论的神话相反，资本主义生产方式的经济层面从未“形成一个密封等级，能够自我生产并拥有其内部运作的‘规律’”。相反，资本主义生产方式的经济层面只是相对独立于政治和意识形态层面，但鉴于这种相对自治，保兰察斯(1978, 45)得出结构“平衡从不由经济本身给出，而是由国家维持”。在这种程度上，国家通过“构成社会形态各层面之间的凝聚因素”（保兰察斯 1978a, 44）履行了一般维护功能。22 因此，保兰察斯（1980, 17）确定了第二组阶级实践，由这样一个事实构成：“国家的政治领域（以及意识形态领域）总是以不同形式出现在生产关系的构建和再生产中。”资本主义生产关系并非在历史中凭空出现，也不是在没有从属阶级的斗争和抵抗的情况下日复一日地自我再生产，这些从属阶级的劳动被资本家阶级剥削。因此，在维持社会形态各层面的凝聚力时，保兰察斯（1978a, 52）观察到“国家的功能主要关注经济层面，特别是劳动过程，劳动生产率。”23 这个观点在《政治权力与社会阶级》中多次出现，并且在《当代资本主义中的阶级》和《国家、权力、社会主义》中反复强调。24 尽管这个功能的重要性显而易见，保兰察斯（1978a, 53）也指出：“国家作为劳动过程组织者的这一功能只是其经济功能的一个方面。”国家还确立并执行组织资本主义交换的规则（财产和合同法、执行、惩罚），并通过其在教育、教学等方面的作用来组织劳动。最后，保兰察斯关注发生在资本主义生产方式的“纯粹政治层面”的阶级实践。保兰察斯（1978a, 53）将国家的严格政治功能与“在政治阶级冲突中维持政治秩序”相对应。通过维护政治秩序，惩治混乱，并通过监控政治“颠覆”，国家压制革命和叛乱，从而在“法律与秩序”的中立幌子下维持剥削条件。 国家政策的运作目标通过三种“国家职能的方式”实现。国家职能的方式确定了国家政策效果实现的结构层次：（1）经济层面的技术-经济功能，（2）阶级斗争层面的政治功能，（3）文化层面的意识形态功能。然而，无论国家的方式在何种层次上发挥效果，保兰察斯均认为，国家职能总是“特别关注劳动生产率”。25 国家职能的方式总是通过国家的三个功能子系统实施：司法子系统、意识形态子系统和政治子系统。保兰察斯（1978a, 50, 53）认为，在资本主义社会中，司法子系统构成为一组规则，这些规则通过提供“商业交往发生的凝聚框架”（例如，财产和合同法、公平商业实践）来促进市场交换。国家的意识形态子系统主要通过公共教育机构发挥作用，而严格的政治子系统则包括从事“在政治阶级冲突中维持政治秩序”的机构（例如，选举法、党派制度、警察、官僚体系）。26 国家的各种方式都构成政治功能，因为它们的运作目标是维护和稳定一个资本家阶级是占主导地位和剥削阶级的社会。正如保兰察斯（1978a, 54）指出的： …国家的经济或意识形态功能符合主导阶级的政治利益，并构成政治功能，不仅在劳动和教育的组织与一个阶级的政治统治之间有直接和明显关系的情况下，还包括这些功能的目标是维持统一性的情况下，内部这个阶级是政治上占主导的阶级。这些功能[即，功能及其方式]符合主导阶级的政治利益，是因为它们的首要目标是维持这种统一性。 应该强调的一个具有相当理论意义的观点是，结构（即，资本主义生产方式的层级）不能简化为构成它们的经济、政治或意识形态机构。27 在这一点上，大卫·戈尔德、克拉伦斯·洛和埃里克·奥林·赖特（1975, 36 fn.）指出，对于保兰察斯来说，“结构”一词不是指构成一个社会的具体社会机构，而是指这些机构之间的系统功能性相互关系。因此，保兰察斯的结构分析总是强调“各种机构对剩余价值生产和占有过程的功能性关系”，而米尔班德倾向于强调特定机构的实证组织、运作和控制。 什么是国家权力？ 米尔班德和保兰察斯对机构重要性的不同看法，最初似乎不仅仅是强调或理论重点的区别。米尔班德和保兰察斯各自阐述了与他们的方法论差异密切相关的竞争性国家权力概念。米尔班德表达了一种以方法论（韦伯式）权力结构研究的假设为基础的制度主义权力概念，而保兰察斯表达了一种以系统分析和结构功能主义的方法论（帕森斯式）假设为基础的功能主义权力概念。值得注意的是，与米尔班德形成直接对比的是，保兰察斯在国家权力和国家机器的概念之间划出了明显的分析区别（Therborn, 1978, 148）。 保兰察斯（1978a, 104）将国家权力定义为社会阶级通过国家机器实现其客观利益的能力。鲍勃·杰索普（1982, 221）通过观察在这一框架内“国家权力是资本主义的，因为它创造、维护或恢复给定情况下资本积累所需的条件，而它是非资本主义的，因为这些条件没有实现”，为这一概念提供了更具体的说明。在这方面，国家政策对资本积累和阶级结构的客观效应是国家权力的主要客观指标。29 另一方面，国家机器与（分析上虽然不是功能上）与国家权力有区别的两种关系相关联。保兰察斯（1978a, 116）将国家机器定义为：“（a）国家在社会形态结构体系中的位置，即国家的职能和（b）国家人员，行政、官僚体系、军队等的行列。”国家机器因此是国家权力（即政策）效应和执行国家职能的机构和人员网络的统一体。30 保兰察斯（1978a, 115 fn. 24）通过观察“结构不是外在于机构的简单组织原则：结构以一种隐晦和颠倒的形式存在于机构本身中”来强调国家权力和国家机器之间的功能统一。对于保兰察斯（1978a, 115）来说，国家机器的概念固有地包括通过国家机构和国家人员执行的职能。因此，与米尔班德形成直接对比的是，保兰察斯坚持认为“严格地说，国家机构没有任何权力。从权力的角度来看，机构只能与掌握权力的社会阶级相关。”31 国家机构是阶级权力行使的政治舞台，只有通过其在资本主义生产方式中的功能性角色，才能作为这样的存在（保兰察斯，1978a, 115）。32"},{"prompt":"请将“The First Exchange: The Problem of Method From the outset of their critical exchange, Poulantzas focused the debate on “the problem of method” in Marxist political theory. As a result, and as I have suggested earlier, even though the Poulantzas-Miliband debate has generally been viewed as a contest between instrumentalist and structuralist theories of the state, it was actually more about methodology than about state theory. Notably, Poulantzas praises Miliband for methodically attacking bourgeois conceptions of the state and political power by rigorously deploying a formidable array of empirical data to challenge the dogmatic assertions of pluralist theory. Poulantzas (1969, 69) acknowledges that Miliband’s empirical methodological approach had enabled him to “radically demolish” bourgeois ideologies of the State and to provide Marxists “with a positive knowledge that these ideologies have never been able to produce.” For Poulantzas (1969, 73), this means that Miliband’s work functions as an ideology critique and that its political value is its ideological effect in demystifying the claims of bourgeois social science.33 However, as an ideology critique that demystifies bourgeois conceptions of the state and political power, it does not thereby elaborate a Marxist theory of the state. Ideology critique does not go far enough in challenging the dominance of bourgeois conceptions because, in Poulantzas’ view, it is never sufficient to juxtapose empirical facts against theoretical concepts. The concepts themselves must be attacked at a philosophical and theoretical level with other “concepts situated in a different problematic.” Instead of merely demystifying bourgeois ideology from within its own problematic, Poulantzas (1969, 69) insists that it is necessary to displace that epistemological terrain and Poulantzas claims that “Miliband appears to omit this first step.”34 Poulantzas is not content with an analysis that empirically demystifies the concept of a plural elite, for example; he insists that one must reject the very concepts of bourgeois social science and replace them with “the scientific concepts of Marxist theory.” This is because empirical facts only become “concrete” by having a new theoretical meaning conferred on them by their place within a radical theory constituted as an epistemological break with bourgeois social science. Poulantzas insists that epistemology and theory construction must precede ideology critique for two reasons. First, ideology critique employs the theoretical concepts of an ideological adversary and, in using these concepts, Poulantzas (1969, 70) is certain that “one legitimizes them and permits their persistence.” Hence, even the limited objectives of an ideology critique are vitiated by a self-defeating exercise that strengthens one’s adversary. Second, Poulantzas is concerned about the risk of being “unconsciously and surreptitiously contaminated by the very epistemological principles of the adversary.” Although Poulantzas initially agrees that Miliband’s methodological procedures have not taken him too far down that path, Poulantzas does caution that “Miliband sometimes allows himself to be unduly influenced by the methodological principles of the adversary,” that is, bourgeois social scientists. Poulantzas identifies several specific instances where he believes that Miliband’s methodology led him astray theoretically: (1) the problem of the subject, (2) the problem of state cohesion, (3) the problem of ideological apparatuses. If this series of so-called problematics shaped the direction of Marxist political theory for the next decade, it is the Poulantzas-Miliband debate which defined the frontiers and boundaries of those explorations. THE PROBLEM OF THE SUBJECT Poulantzas (1969, 70–71) defines the problem of the subject as “a problematic of social actors, of individuals as the origin of social action.” If individuals or groups of individuals are considered as social actors, then Poulantzas argues that theoretical research is diverted from “the study of the objective co-ordinates that determine the distribution of agents into social classes and the contradictions between these classes … to the search for finalist explanations founded on the motivations of conduct of the individual actors.” Poulantzas claims that Miliband’s empirical and institutional analysis of states in capitalist societies “constantly gives the impression” that “social classes or ‘groups’ are in some way reducible to inter-personal relations, that the State is reducible to inter-personal relations of the members of the diverse ‘groups’ that constitute the State apparatus, and finally that the relation between social classes and the State is itself reducible to inter-personal relations of ‘individuals’ composing social groups and ‘individuals’ composing the State apparatus.” Consequently, Poulantzas chastises Miliband for offering explanations of corporate behavior, the state elite, and state managers that are “founded on the motivations of conduct of the individual actors.” Poulantzas contends that this method of analysis vitiates Miliband’s ideology critique to the extent that he fails to comprehend “social classes and the State as objective structures, and their relations as an objective system of regular connections, a structure and a system whose agents, ‘men’, are in the words of Marx, ‘bearers’ of it.” Otherwise, Poulantzas is concerned that “to transpose this problematic of the subject into Marxism is in the end to admit the epistemological principles of the adversary.” Interestingly, in an earlier essay, also published in the New Left Review, Poulantzas (1967) argues that the problem of the subject is a theoretical error endemic to Anglo-American Marxism in general and so in many ways his critique of Miliband merely serves to illuminate his assessment of a widespread theoretical shortcoming within the Anglo-American left. THE PROBLEM OF STATE COHESION According to Poulantzas, this same problem of the subject resurfaces in Miliband’s treatment of the state bureaucracy, the army, regulatory agencies, and other personnel of the state system. The problem appears in the fact that Miliband places so much emphasis on the role of ideology in linking these agents to the capitalist class and the top state elite, because this explanatory mechanism suggests that the criterion for membership in a particular class is the shared motivations and subjective orientations of a group of individuals. Hence, Poulantzas (1969, 73) concludes that Miliband “seems to reduce the role of the State to the conduct and ‘behavior’ of the members of the State apparatus.” Poulantzas (1969, 71), of course, insists that Marx’s criterion for the designation of class boundaries is “the objective place in production and the ownership of the means of production.” Instead, Poulantzas (1969, 73) proposes that civil servants, military officers, regulators, and other state managers are “a specific social category—not a class. This means that, although the members of the State apparatus belong, by their class origin to different classes, they function according to a specific internal unity.” A social category’s “internal unity derives from its actualization of the objective role of the State” (Poulantzas, 1969, 74). Therefore, Poulantzas (1969, 73) claims in a now legendary passage that: … the direct participation of members of the capitalist class in the State apparatus and in the government, even where it exists, is not the important side of the matter. The relation between the bourgeois class and the State is an objective relation. This means that if the function of the state in a determinate social formation and the interests of the dominant class in this formation coincide, it is by reason of the system itself: the direct participation of members of the ruling class in the state apparatus is not the cause but the effect, and moreover a chance and contingent one, of this objective coincidence. Although Poulantzas insists that the state as a whole, as an objective system of power, is relatively autonomous from the dominant class, the state’s internal unity requires that we not view its individual apparatuses and personnel as relatively autonomous. Rather, it is the general function of the state that gives cohesion and unity to the apparatuses and personnel and which make it possible to refer both to a state and to the capitalist state. However, from Poulantzas’ perspective, Miliband relies on factors “exterior” to the state itself and, therefore, he lacks a theoretical capacity to conceptualize the necessary unity and cohesion of the state. In contrast, Poulantzas (1969, 77) insists that “the State in the classic Marxist sense of the term, possesses a very rigorous internal unity which directly governs the relation between the diverse branches of the apparatus.” THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGICAL APPARATUSES Poulantzas was not inclined to dismiss ideology altogether, but instead he proposes to reconceptualize its production and distribution within a Marxist theory of the state. Poulantzas (1969, 76–77) was quite correct to point out that “the classic Marxist tradition of the theory of the State is principally concerned to show the repressive role of the State, in the strong sense of organized physical repression.” On the other hand, ideology had been dismissed as epiphenomenal (rather than constitutive) of social and political relations, mainly because ideology had been equated “with ideas, customs or morals without seeing that ideology can be embodied, in the strong sense, in institutions: institutions which then, by the very process of institutionalization, belong to the system of the State.” Poulantzas proposes that the realm of ideology be brought inside the state by reconceptualizing the state as a dual matrix of apparatuses that either perform repressive functions or ideological functions.35 Poulantzas defines the state ideological apparatuses to include churches, political parties, trade unions, schools and universities, the press, television, radio, and even the family.”翻译为中文","completion":"第一次交流：方法论问题 在他们的批判性交流一开始，保兰察斯把辩论聚焦在马克思主义政治理论中的“方法论问题”上。结果，正如我之前所述，尽管保兰察斯-米尔班德辩论通常被视为工具主义和结构主义国家理论之间的较量，实际上更多的是关于方法论而非国家理论。值得注意的是，保兰察斯赞扬米尔班德以系统的方式攻击资产阶级国家和政治权力的概念，通过严谨地部署大量的实证数据挑战多元主义理论的教条式断言。保兰察斯（1969, 69）承认米尔班德的实证方法论方法使他能够“从根本上摧毁”资产阶级的国家意识形态，并为马克思主义者提供了这些意识形态从未能够产生的积极知识。对保兰察斯（1969, 73）来说，这意味着米尔班德的作品作为一种意识形态批判发挥作用，其政治价值在于其在揭露资产阶级社会科学主张方面的意识形态效应。33 然而，作为一种揭露资产阶级国家和政治权力概念的意识形态批判，它并没有进而阐述一种马克思主义国家理论。意识形态批判在挑战资产阶级概念的主导地位方面还远远不够，因为在保兰察斯看来，仅仅将经验事实与理论概念对立起来是不够的。概念本身必须在哲学和理论层面上被攻击，用置于不同问题域中的其他“概念”来攻击它们。保兰察斯（1969, 69）坚持认为，必须转移那个认识论领域，而不仅仅是在其自身的问题域内揭露资产阶级意识形态，并声称“米尔班德似乎忽略了这一第一步。”34保兰察斯对仅仅实证地揭露如多元精英概念等资产阶级社会科学概念并不满足；他坚持认为，必须拒绝资产阶级社会科学的概念，并用“马克思主义理论的科学概念”来取代它们。这是因为，实证事实只有通过被置于一个与资产阶级社会科学形成认识论断裂的激进理论中，获得新的理论意义后才变得“具体”。 保兰察斯坚持认为，认识论和理论构建必须先于意识形态批判，原因有二。首先，意识形态批判采用了意识形态对手的理论概念，并且在使用这些概念时，保兰察斯（1969, 70）确信“这赋予了它们合法性并允许它们的持续存在。”因此，即使意识形态批判的有限目标也被一种加强对手的自我挫败行为所削弱。其次，保兰察斯担心存在“无意识和悄然被对手的认识论原则所污染”的风险。尽管保兰察斯最初同意米尔班德的方法论程序并没有让他走得太远，但保兰察斯确实警告说“米尔班德有时让自己过多地受到对手的方法论原则的影响”，即资产阶级社会科学家。保兰察斯指出了几个具体的实例，他认为米尔班德的方法论在理论上将他引入歧途：（1）主体问题，（2）国家凝聚力问题，（3）意识形态机构问题。如果这一系列所谓的问题塑造了未来十年马克思主义政治理论的方向，那么保兰察斯-米尔班德辩论定义了这些探索的前沿和边界。 主体问题 保兰察斯（1969, 70-71）将主体问题定义为“关于社会行动者、个体作为社会行动起源的问题域。”如果将个体或个体群体视为社会行动者，那么保兰察斯认为，理论研究就会被转移，“从研究决定代理人被分配到社会阶级中的客观坐标以及这些阶级之间的矛盾……转向寻找以个体行为者动机为基础的终极解释。”保兰察斯声称米尔班德对资本主义社会中国家的实证和制度分析“经常给人以印象”，认为“社会阶级或‘群体’在某种程度上可以还原为人际关系，国家可以还原为构成国家机器的不同‘群体’成员之间的人际关系，最终社会阶级与国家之间的关系本身可以还原为构成社会团体和国家机器的‘个体’之间的人际关系。”因此，保兰察斯批评米尔班德提供了基于个体行为者动机的公司行为、国家精英和国家经理的解释。保兰察斯认为，这种分析方法削弱了米尔班德的意识形态批判，因为他未能理解“社会阶级和国家作为客观结构，以及他们之间的关系作为一个客观系统的规律连接，一个结构和系统，其代理人，‘人’，用马克思的话来说，是它的‘承载者’。”此外，保兰察斯担心，“将这种主体问题转移进马克思主义最终等于承认对手的认识论原则。”有趣的是，在《新左评》上发表的一篇早期文章中，保兰察斯（1967）认为主体问题是普遍存在于一般盎格鲁-美国马克思主义的理论错误，因此在许多方面，他对米尔班德的批评只是为了阐明盎格鲁-美国左翼普遍存在的理论缺陷。 国家凝聚力问题 根据保兰察斯的说法，这个相同的主体问题在米尔班德对国家官僚机构、军队、监管机构和国家系统的其他人员的处理中重新出现。问题在于米尔班德过分强调意识形态在将这些代理人与资本家阶级和最高国家精英联系起来的作用，因为这种解释机制暗示特定阶级成员资格的标准是一群个体分享的动机和主观取向。因此，保兰察斯（1969, 73）得出结论，米尔班德“似乎将国家的作用还原为国家机器成员的行为和‘行为’。”当然，保兰察斯（1969, 71）坚持，马克思指定阶级界限的标准是“生产中的客观位置和生产资料的所有权。”相反，保兰察斯（1969, 73）认为，公务员、军官、监管者和其他国家经理“是一个特定的社会类别——不是一个阶级。这意味着，尽管国家机器的成员按他们的阶级出身属于不同的阶级，但他们根据一个特定的内部统一性来运作。”一个社会类别的“内部统一性源于其实现国家的客观角色”（保兰察斯，1969, 74）。因此，保兰察斯（1969, 73）在一个如今已成传奇的段落中声明： … 资本家阶级成员直接参与国家机器和政府，即使存在，也不是重要的方面。资产阶级与国家之间的关系是一种客观关系。这意味着，如果国家在一个特定的社会形态中的功能与这一形态中的主导阶级的利益相吻合，那是由于体系本身的原因：统治阶级成员直接参与国家机器不是原因，而是这种客观吻合的结果，而且还是一个偶然和有条件的结果。 尽管保兰察斯坚持认为，作为一个客观的权力系统，国家整体相对于主导阶级具有相对的自主性，但国家的内部统一要求我们不将其个别机构和人员视为相对自主的。相反，正是国家的总体功能赋予了机构和人员凝聚力和统一性，并使得我们既能说有一个国家，也能说有一个资本主义国家。然而，从保兰察斯的角度来看，米尔班德依赖于国家本身“外部”的因素，因此他缺乏概念化国家必要的统一性和凝聚力的理论能力。相比之下，保兰察斯（1969, 77）坚持认为，“按照经典马克思主义意义上的国家，具有非常严格的内部统一性，它直接支配着机器各个分支之间的关系。” 意识形态机构问题 保兰察斯并不倾向于完全忽视意识形态，而是建议在马克思主义国家理论中重新概念化其生产和分配。保兰察斯（1969, 76-77）正确地指出，“经典马克思主义国家理论传统主要关注展示国家的压迫作用，强调有组织的物理压迫的强烈意义。”另一方面，意识形态被视为次要的（而非构成性的）社会和政治关系，主要是因为意识形态被等同于“观念、习俗或道德，而没有看到意识形态可以以强烈意义上体现在机构中：这些机构因此，通过制度化的过程，属于国家制度。”保兰察斯提议将意识形态领域引入国家内部，通过重新概念化国家为一个双重机构矩阵，既执行压迫功能也执行意识形态功能。35保兰察斯将国家意识形态机构定义为包括教堂、政党、工会、学校和大学、新闻媒体、电视、广播，甚至是家庭。"},{"prompt":"请将“Max Weber: Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft.

Die Methode dieser einleitenden, nicht gut zu entbehrenden, aber unvermeidlich abstrakt und wirklichkeitsfremd wirkenden Begriffsdefinitionen beansprucht in keiner Art: neu zu sein. Im Gegenteil wünscht sie nur, in – wie gehofft wird – zweckmäßigerer und etwas korrekterer (eben deshalb freilich vielleicht pedantisch wirkender) Ausdrucksweise zu formulieren, was jede empirische Soziologie tatsächlich meint, wenn sie von den gleichen Dingen spricht. Dies auch da, wo scheinbar ungewohnte oder neue Ausdrücke verwendet werden. Gegenüber dem Aufsatz im Logos IV (1913, S. 253 ff. [Ges. Aufs. z. Wissenschaftslehre, 3. Aufl.. S. 427 ff.]) ist die Terminologie tunlichst vereinfacht und daher auch mehrfach verändert, um möglichst leicht verständlich zu sein. Das Bedürfnis nach unbedingter Popularisierung freilich wäre mit dem Bedürfnis nach größtmöglicher Begriffsschärfe nicht immer vereinbar und muß diesem gegebenenfalls weichen.  Ueber »Verstehen« vgl. die »Allgemeine Psychopathologie« von K. Jaspers (auch einige Bemerkungen von Rickert in der 2. Aufl. der »Grenzen der naturwissenschaftlichen Begriffsbildung« [1913, S. 514-523] und namentlich von Simmel in den »Problemen der Geschichtsphilosophie« gehören dahin). Methodisch weise ich auch hier, wie schon öfter, auf den Vorgang von F. Gottl in der freilich etwas schwer verständlich geschriebenen und wohl nicht überall ganz zu Ende gedanklich durchgeformten Schrift: »Die Herrschaft des Worts« hin, sachlich vor allem auf das schöne Werk von F. Tönnies, »Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft«. Ferner auf das stark irreführende Buch von R. Stammler, »Wirtschaft und Recht nach der materialistischen Geschichtsauffassung« und meine Kritik dazu im Archiv f. Sozialwissensch. XXIV (1907, [Ges. Aufs. z. Wissenschaftslehre, 3. Aufl. S. 291 ff.]), welche die Grundlagen des Nachfolgenden vielfach schon enthielt. Von Simmels Methode (in der »Soziologie« und in »Philos. des Geldes«) weiche ich durch tunlichste Scheidung des gemeinten von dem objektiv gültigen »Sinn« ab, die beide Simmel nicht nur nicht immer scheidet, sondern oft absichtsvoll ineinander fließen läßt.   § 1. Soziologie (im hier verstandenen Sinn dieses sehr vieldeutig gebrauchten Wortes) soll heißen: eine Wissenschaft, welche soziales Handeln deutend verstehen und dadurch in seinem Ablauf und seinen Wirkungen ursächlich erklären will. »Handeln« soll dabei ein menschliches Verhalten (einerlei ob äußeres oder innerliches Tun, Unterlassen oder Dulden) heißen, wenn und insofern als der oder die Handelnden mit ihm einen subjektiven Sinn verbinden. »Soziales« Handeln aber soll ein solches Handeln heißen, welches seinem von dem oder den Handelnden gemeinten Sinn nach auf das Verhalten anderer bezogen wird und daran in seinem Ablauf orientiert ist.   I. Methodische Grundlagen.  1. »Sinn« ist hier entweder a) der tatsächlich α. in einem historisch gegebenen Fall von einem Handelnden oder β. durchschnittlich und annähernd in einer gegebenen Masse von Fällen von den Handelnden oder b) in einem begrifflich konstruierten reinen Typus von dem oder den als Typus gedachten Handelnden subjektiv gemeinte Sinn. Nicht etwa irgendein objektiv »richtiger« oder ein metaphysisch ergründeter »wahrer« Sinn. Darin liegt der Unterschied der empirischen Wissenschaften[1] vom Handeln: der Soziologie und der Geschichte, gegenüber allen dogmatischen: Jurisprudenz, Logik, Ethik, Aesthetik, welche an ihren Objekten den »richtigen«, »gültigen« Sinn erforschen wollen.  2. Die Grenze sinnhaften Handelns gegen ein bloß (wie wir hier sagen wollen:) reaktives, mit einem subjektiv gemeinten Sinn nicht verbundenes, Sichverhalten ist durchaus flüssig. Ein sehr bedeutender Teil alles soziologisch relevanten Sichverhaltens, insbesondere das rein traditionale Handeln (s.u.) steht auf der Grenze beider. Sinnhaftes, d.h. verstehbares, Handeln liegt in manchen Fällen psychophysischer Vorgänge gar nicht, in anderen nur für den Fachexperten vor; mystische und daher in Worten nicht adäquat kommunikable Vorgänge sind für den solchen Erlebnissen nicht Zugänglichen nicht voll verstehbar. Dagegen ist die Fähigkeit, aus Eignem ein gleichartiges Handeln zu produzieren, nicht Voraussetzung der Verstehbarkeit: »man braucht nicht Cäsar zu sein, um Cäsar zu verstehen.« Die volle »Nacherlebbarkeit« ist für die Evidenz des Verstehens wichtig, nicht aber absolute Bedingung der Sinndeutung.

Jaspers的《普通精神病学》（还有Rickert在《自然科学概念界限》第2版[1913年, 第514-523页]的一些评论，尤其是Simmel在《历史哲学问题》中的论述也是此列）。在方法上，我再次，如同之前多次一样，指向F. Gottl在其写作稍显晦涩且可能在思维上未完全成形的著作《文字的统治》中的过程，尤其是在实质上，主要是F. Tönnies那部精彩的著作《社群与社会》。此外，还有R. Stammler误导性较强的书《经济与法律：从唯物史观看》和我在《社会科学档案》第XXIV卷（1907年, [科学论文集，第3版, 第291页及以后]）中对其的批评，其中已经包含了许多后续内容的基础。与Simmel的方法（在《社会学》和《货币哲学》中）相比，我尽可能地区分了所指的“意义”与客观上有效的“意义”，而Simmel不仅不总是区分这两者，而且经常有意将它们混为一谈。 § 1. 社会学（在此处所理解的这个多义词的意义上）应指的是：一门旨在通过解释理解社会行动以及因此对其过程和影响进行因果解释的科学。“行动”在此指的是，只要行为者赋予其一定的主观意义，无论是外在的或内在的行为、忽略或忍受即可称之为行动。“社会性”行动则是指，根据行为者所指的意义，把它与他人的行为联系起来，并在其过程中以此为导向的行动。 I. 方法论基础。 1. “意义”在此可以指 a) 在一个历史给定情况下由一个行动者实际意指，或者b) 在一群给定情况下通常和大致上由行动者们意指，或者c) 在概念上构建的纯粹类型中，由被视为类型的一个或多个行动者所主观意指的意义。这不涉及任何客观上“正确”的或通过形上学探究得到的“真正”的意义。这就是实证行为科学——社会学和历史学——与所有教条式学科：法学、逻辑学、伦理学、美学的区别，后者旨在研究其对象上的“正确”、“有效”的意义。 2. 有意义的行为与仅仅是（如我们在此所称）反应式的、未与主观意义相连的行为之间的界限是非常模糊的。很大一部分与社会学相关的行为，特别是纯粹传统的行为（见下文），处于这两者的边界上。在某些情况下，心理生理的过程中根本不存在可理解的、即有意义的行为；在其他情况下，只有专业人士可以理解；神秘且因此无法用言语充分沟通的过程对于那些无法体验到这些体验的人来说，并不完全可理解。然而，能够产生类似行为的能力并非理解的前提：“不需要成为凯撒，就能理解凯撒。”完全的“可经历性”对于理解的明显性很重要，但并非解释意义的绝对条件。一个过程中可理解和不可理解的成分往往混合并联结在一起。"},{"prompt":"请将“3.

Culture is not what supports the repressive apparatus; it is the repressive apparatus that supports and promotes the dominant culture. In other words, revolutions occur on a political and not a cultural battlefield.36 THE PROBLEM OF METHOD II Miliband responded to Poulantzas’ critique on most points, although he was convinced that many of Poulantzas’ quibbles with his work were trivial and unwarranted. Miliband did not expend a great deal of energy replying to every minor criticism, but instead chose to address only those general points which seemed of particular importance to understanding the nature and role of the state in capitalist society. Miliband readily acceded to Poulantzas’ postulate that a precondition of any scientific approach to the concrete is to make explicit the epistemological principles of its own treatment of the concrete. The point, however, is that from Miliband’s (1970b, 54) perspective he did “quite explicitly give an outline of the Marxist theory of the state.” In defending this claim, Miliband refers us back to that famous passage in the Communist Manifesto only to reiterate his previous position that once stated it is only possible to elucidate that concept further “in empirical terms.”37 Thus, Miliband concludes from within his epistemological framework that Poulantzas, Louis Althusser, and their collaborators are “so profoundly concerned with the elaboration of an appropriate ‘problematic’ and with the avoidance of any contamination with opposed ‘problematics’, as to lose sight of the absolute necessity of empirical enquiry, and of the empirical demonstration of the falsity of these opposed and apologetic ‘problematics’.” As a wry gesture to the Poulantzasian interpretation of the Marxist classics, which emphasized the centrality of Capital, Miliband argues that as a methodological text Capital stresses “the importance of empirical validation (or invalidation),” while noting that Marx “spent many years of his life in precisely such an undertaking.”38 THE PROBLEM OF THE SUBJECT II Miliband also fundamentally rejects Poulantzas’ indictment of his work as one contaminated by the problem of the subject. Quite the contrary, Miliband was convinced that Poulantzas greatly under-estimates the extent to which he did take account of the objective relations which affect and shape the role of the state. Indeed, Miliband describes Poulantzas’ methodology as “structural super-determinism” and concludes that it is Poulantzas’ one-sidedness which makes it impossible for him to recognize Miliband’s treatment of objective structural factors and which also leads Poulantzas to go much too far in dismissing the nature of the state elite as irrelevant to an understanding of concrete differences between states and state policies in different capitalist societies. Instead, Miliband (1970b, 57) takes Poulantzas to task for his exclusive stress on objective relations which implies “that what the state does is in every particular and at all times is wholly determined by these ‘objective relations’: in other words, that the structural constraints of the system are so absolutely compelling as to turn those who run the state into the merest functionaries and executants of policies imposed upon them by ‘the system’.”39 THE PROBLEM OF STATE COHESION II Miliband’s defense of the role of the state elite, and his rejection of structural factors as absolutely determining allowed him to highlight another significant difference with Poulantzas. Whereas Poulantzas criticized Miliband for not being able to conceptualize state cohesion adequately, Miliband’s very point was to emphasize the tenuous unity and tendencies toward disaggregation of the state apparatuses. Miliband’s (1970b, 57) analysis is designed to demonstrate that “the state elite is involved in a far more complex relationship with ‘the system’ and with society as a whole than Poulantzas’ scheme allows; and that at least to a certain but definite and important extent that relationship is shaped by the kind of factors,” which Poulantzas dismisses as irrelevant; namely, ideology, individual motivations, the fragmentation and disunity of the state apparatuses. In other words, Miliband did not fail to conceptualize state cohesion adequately, but was drawing the empirical conclusion that such unity does not exist for states in advanced capitalist societies. THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGICAL APPARATUSES II Finally, Miliband simply rejects outright Poulantzas’ assertion about the neglect of ideology by Marxist political theory. First, Miliband points out that he devoted two chapters of The State in Capitalist Society to “the institutions which are the purveyors of ideology” and thus adopts exactly the method of analysis proposed by Poulantzas. Second, however, Miliband rejects Poulantzas’ suggestion that these institutions be conceptualized as part of the state apparatus. Precisely because ideological institutions are increasingly linked to and buttressed by the state, Miliband insists that it is important not to blur the fact that in bourgeois democracies they are not generally part of the state, but part of a wider political or ideological system. Certainly, Miliband agrees that ideological institutions are increasingly subject to a process of “statization” and he concedes that their statization “is likely to be enhanced by the fact that the state must, in the conditions of permanent crisis of advanced capitalism, assume ever greater responsibility for political indoctrination and mystification.” Nevertheless, Miliband (1970b, 59) draws the empirical conclusion that such a process has not gone far enough to permit the conceptualization of such institutions as part of the state, because most of them continue to “perform their ideological functions outside it” (e.g., private schools and universities, churches, the mass media). The Second Exchange: The Problem of Method Again (1973) Miliband continued his rejoinder in 1973 following the publication in English of Poulantzas’ Political Power and Social Classes, which he viewed as “an opportunity to continue with the discussion” begun three years earlier. Miliband’s essay again focused on the problem of method, although as a review of Poulantzas’ book, Miliband shifted the emphasis from a defense of his own position to a critique of Althusserian structuralism. The availability of a sound English language translation of Poulantzas’ book confirmed Miliband’s (1973, 83–84) apprehension that the book is “obscurely written for any reader who has not become familiar through painful initiation with the particular linguistic code and mode of exposition of the Althusserian school to which Poulantzas relates.” Consequently, in his second rejoinder, Miliband frequently complains of Poulantzas’ opaqueness and proposes that instead of describing his method as structural super-determinism, it would be more appropriate to call it structuralist abstractionism. In fact, Miliband provides numerous examples of oxymoronic terminology, self-contradictory phraseology, and completely opaque scholasticism. While a genre of structural abstractionism might make for great art, or even great literature, Miliband did not think it made very good political theory. First, although Miliband concedes that “poor exposition” is a secondary defect he suggested that the abstractness of contemporary Marxist theory was paradoxical given its claim to be a science of working class revolution. The most prominent Marxist theorists seem to compete with one another as to who can write at a level of abstraction so opaque that it is never likely to be accessible to anyone but a few highly educated and specialized professional academicians. In contrast, contemporary liberal and conservative political theorists routinely write “academic” works that are easily accessible to an educated lay audience and this in no way jeopardizes the intellectual integrity of the work. In this respect, if one is to judge the functional value of Marxist social science by its objective effects at the political and ideological levels, then Miliband (1973, 84) suggests that the sooner the problem of excessive abstraction “is remedied, the more likely it is that a Marxist tradition of political analysis will now be encouraged to take root.” At some point, the value and role of Marxist political theory must be judged against its effects on the political, that is, in promoting and facilitating socialism as opposed to its current preoccupation with establishing academic legitimacy within the dominant ideological institutions. Second, as Miliband (1973, 84–85, 91) begins to recognize at this point, Poulantzas’ main concern was not to provide a theory of the capitalist state (at least not as Miliband understands that concept), but “to provide a ‘reading’ of texts from Marx and Engels, and also from Lenin, on the state and politics.” As Miliband notes, “such a ‘reading’, in the Althusserian sense, is, of course, not a presentation or a collation of texts; nor is it commentary on them or even an attempt at interpretation, though it is partly the latter.” Instead, an Althusserian reading of the classic texts—which Miliband confesses makes him “a bit uneasy”—involves a complementation of the original texts. To his credit, Miliband did not follow the path of much contemporary literary/political theory by engaging Poulantzas and the structuralists in a debate over “methods of textual interpretation.” Instead, he simply returns directly to the original texts as a basis for asking himself how well Poulantzas conducted his interpretive exercise and “whether the ‘deciphering’ has produced an accurate message.” Miliband concludes on the basis of his own reading “that much of Poulantzas’ ‘reading’ constitutes a serious misrepresentation of Marx and Engels and also of the actual reality he is attempting to portray.” To put it bluntly, Miliband does not consider Poulantzas’ reading of Marx very rigorous and, unfortunately, “care and scruple in textual quotation are not simply matters of scholarship: they also involve large political issues.” ”翻译为中文","completion":"以这种方式，保兰察斯（1969, 68）试图扩大资本主义社会中革命活动的潜在范围，因为他坚持认为“革命行动的主要目标是国家权力，任何社会主义革命的必要前提是破坏资产阶级国家机器。”正如保兰察斯（1969, 78）所观察到的：“根据马克思列宁主义理论，社会主义革命不仅意味着国家权力的转移，它还必须‘打破’，也就是说根本改变国家机器”，因此，“社会主义社会的到来不能在维持国家意识形态机器完整的情况下实现。”然而，保兰察斯对当代文化批评家发出了强烈警告，他的结论是“意识形态机器的‘破坏’以国家镇压机器的‘破坏’为前提，后者维持着前者。”因此，保兰察斯认为认为文化革命可以发生而不直接对抗国家镇压机器是一种“虚幻的错误”，或如他所说，认为在资本主义社会中“摧毁大学”等是一种革命活动。文化并非是支撑镇压机器的基础；正是镇压机器支持和促进了主导文化。换句话说，革命发生在政治而非文化战场上。 方法论问题 II 米尔班德对保兰察斯的批评做了回应，尽管他认为保兰察斯对他的工作的许多挑剔是琐碎和不合理的。米尔班德并没有花太多精力回应每一个小批评，而是选择只针对那些似乎对理解资本主义社会中的国家性质和作用特别重要的一般观点进行回应。米尔班德欣然接受保兰察斯的假设，即任何科学方法论对具体事物的处理的前提是要明确其自身的认识论原则。然而，问题是，从米尔班德（1970b, 54）的角度来看，他确实“相当明确地勾勒了马克思主义的国家理论”。 在捍卫这一主张时，米尔班德引用了《共产党宣言》中的那段著名段落，只是重申他之前的立场，即一旦声明它，只能通过“实证术语”进一步阐述该概念。因此，米尔班德在他的认识论框架内得出结论，保兰察斯、路易·阿尔都塞及其合作者“如此深切关注对适当‘问题域’的阐述以及避免与对立的‘问题域’的任何污染，以至于忽视了实证研究的绝对必要性，以及实证地展示这些对立和辩解的‘问题域’的虚假性的必要性。”作为对保兰察斯对马克思经典作品的解读的讽刺，米尔班德认为《资本论》作为一部方法论文本强调了“实证验证（或否证）的重要性”，同时指出马克思“用了许多年的时间正是在进行这样的努力。” 主体问题 II 米尔班德也基本上拒绝了保兰察斯对他的作品受到主体问题污染的指控。恰恰相反，米尔班德相信保兰察斯极大地低估了他在考虑影响和塑造国家角色的客观关系方面所做的努力。事实上，米尔班德将保兰察斯的方法论描述为“结构超决定主义”，并得出结论，保兰察斯的片面性使他无法认识到米尔班德对客观结构因素的处理，这也导致保兰察斯在否定国家精英性质对理解不同资本主义社会中的国家和国家政策之间的具体差异的重要性方面走得太远。相反，米尔班德（1970b, 57）批评保兰察斯过分强调客观关系，这暗示“国家所做的一切在每一个具体情况和任何时候都完全由这些‘客观关系’决定：换句话说，系统的结构限制如此绝对强制，以至于那些管理国家的人变成了最简单的职能人员和‘系统’赋予他们的政策的执行者。” 国家凝聚力问题 II 米尔班德对国家精英的作用的辩护，以及他对结构因素作为绝对决定因素的拒绝，使他能够强调与保兰察斯的另一个重要区别。尽管保兰察斯批评米尔班德未能充分概念化国家凝聚力，但米尔班德的重点正是强调国家机器的脆弱统一性和分化倾向。米尔班德的（1970b, 57）分析旨在证明“国家精英与‘系统’及整个社会的关系远比保兰察斯的方案所允许的要复杂得多；至少在一定但明确且重要的程度上，这种关系是由某些保兰察斯认为不相关的因素塑造的，”即意识形态、个人动机、国家机器的碎片化和不统一性。换句话说，米尔班德并没有未能充分概念化国家凝聚力，而是得出了一个实证结论，即在发达资本主义社会中的国家不存在这样的统一性。"},{"prompt":"请将“THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGICAL APPARATUSES II Finally, Miliband simply rejects outright Poulantzas’ assertion about the neglect of ideology by Marxist political theory.

At nearly every major turn, Poulantzas uses vague and general references to support his major claims; for example: on the construction of general theory, Poulantzas (1978a, 12) bolsters his position with “Marx demonstrated in the Introduction of 1857”; on the concept of overdetermination, Poulantzas (1978a, 17) articulates a concept “as expounded by Marx in Capital”; on the autonomy of the levels, Poulantzas (1978a, 29) claims that “Marx demonstrated this in Capital”; on the autonomy of the political, Poulantzas (1978a, 30) insists that this claim is verified “In the Grundrisse and in passages concerning the feudal mode of production in Capital.” Yet, Poulantzas never makes a specific citation to support these claims, among many others. This peculiarity is now far more interesting theoretically, since Louis Althusser (1993, 165–66) admitted that his “philosophical knowledge of texts was rather limited … a bit about Hegel, and finally a few passages of Marx.” Althusser describes his real method of learning philosophy as “hearsay … gleaning certain phrases in passing from my friends, and lastly from the seminar papers and essays of my own students.” Similarly, Hall (2000, vii) notes that Poulantzas informed him during an interview that “it was virtually impossible in the early days even to acquire the classical texts of Marx and Engels, and he came to Marxism largely through French philosophy.” In contrast, Miliband (1973, 85) advances his own reading of Marx by noting “that the basic theme of the [Poulantzas] book, its central problematic, is absolutely right.” This theme, as Miliband understands it, is to reaffirm “that the political realm is not, in classical Marxism, the mere reflection of the economic realm, and that in relation to the state, the notion of the latter’s ‘relative autonomy’ is central.” However, in a significant and lengthy footnote that is generally ignored, Miliband (1973, 85 fn. 4) again returns to his original text to argue that Poulantzas’ central theme is already fully contained in: … the most familiar of all the Marxist formulations on the state, that which is to be found in the Communist Manifesto, where Marx and Engels assert that “the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie” … what they are saying is that “the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie”: the notion of common affairs assumes the existence of particular ones; and the notion of the whole bourgeoisie implies the existence of separate elements which make up that whole. This being the case, there is an obvious need for an institution of the kind they refer to, namely the state; and the state cannot meet this need without enjoying a certain degree of autonomy. In other words, the notion of autonomy is embedded in the definition itself, is an intrinsic part of it. Thus, there is no need for a symptomatic reading of Marx and no reason to complement the Marxian classics, because the requisite theory and concepts are already sufficient to proceed with an analysis of the capitalist state.40 Moreover, the real problem with Poulantzasian structuralism for Miliband is that it fails to achieve its stated purpose. Poulantzas claims to develop a theory of the capitalist state and, yet, Miliband (1974, 84) complains “the book hardly contains any reference at all to an actual capitalist state anywhere” primarily because Poulantzas has “an absurdly exaggerated fear of empiricist contamination.” From this perspective, Poulantzas’ “‘structural super-determinism’ makes him assume what has to be explained about the relationship of the state to classes in the capitalist mode of production” and, hence, he sees no need for serious empirical or historical investigations. Thus, “the real trouble,” as Miliband puts it, is that Poulantzas’ approach to the questions raised in their first exchange is what “prevents him from providing a satisfactory answer to them.” Thus, Miliband (1973, 89, 85–86) laments that “the world of ‘structures’ and ‘levels’ which he [Poulantzas] inhabits has so few points of contact with historical or contemporary reality that it cuts him off from any possibility of achieving what he describes as ‘the political analysis of a concrete conjuncture’.””翻译为中文","completion":"意识形态机器问题 II 最后，米尔班德直接拒绝了保兰察斯关于马克思主义政治理论忽视意识形态的断言。首先，米尔班德指出他在《资本主义社会中的国家》一书中专门用了两章来讨论“传递意识形态的机构”，因此完全采用了保兰察斯所提议的分析方法。然而，米尔班德拒绝了保兰察斯的建议，即将这些机构视为国家机器的一部分。正是因为意识形态机构越来越多地与国家联系并得到国家的支持，米尔班德坚持认为重要的是不要模糊一个事实，那就是在资产阶级民主制度中，这些机构通常不是国家的一部分，而是更广泛的政治或意识形态系统的一部分。当然，米尔班德同意意识形态机构越来越受到“国家化”过程的影响，并承认他们的国家化“很可能会因为在高级资本主义的永久性危机条件下，国家必须承担起越来越大的政治灌输和神秘化责任”而得到加强。然而，米尔班德（1970b, 59）根据经验证据得出结论，这个过程还远远没有达到允许将这些机构概念化为国家的一部分的程度，因为它们大多数继续“在其外部执行其意识形态功能”（例如，私立学校和大学、教堂、大众媒体）。 第二次交流：再次讨论方法问题（1973） 继保兰察斯的《政治权力与社会阶级》英文版出版之后，米尔班德在1973年继续他的回应，他视此为“继续三年前开始的讨论的一个机会”。虽然米尔班德的文章再次聚焦于方法问题，但作为对保兰察斯书籍的评论，米尔班德将重点从捍卫自己的立场转向批评阿尔都塞结构主义。保兰察斯书籍的可靠英文翻译使米尔班德（1973, 83–84）确信这本书“对于那些还未通过痛苦的启蒙熟悉阿尔都塞学派特定的语言代码和表达方式的读者来说，写得很晦涩。”因此，在他的第二次回应中，米尔班德频繁抱怨保兰察斯的晦涩，并提议，与其称他的方法为结构超决定主义，不如称之为结构主义抽象主义。实际上，米尔班德提供了许多矛盾的术语、自相矛盾的措辞和完全晦涩的学术主义的例子。虽然结构抽象主义可能为了创造伟大的艺术或甚至伟大的文学，但米尔班德并不认为它构成了非常好的政治理论。 首先，尽管米尔班德承认“表述不清”是次要缺陷，但他指出当代马克思主义理论的抽象性鉴于其自称为工人阶级革命的科学而言颇具讽刺意味。最杰出的马克思主义理论家似乎在争论谁能以一种如此晦涩的抽象水平写作，以至于它几乎不可能为少数高度教育化且专业化的学术人员所接触。相比之下，当代自由派和保守派政治理论家经常撰写对受过教育的普通读者来说易于理解的“学术”作品，这丝毫不会危及作品的智力完整性。在这方面，如果要根据其在政治和意识形态层面的客观效应评价马克思主义社会科学的功能价值，那么米尔班德（1973, 84）建议，尽早“解决”过度抽象的问题，“更有可能鼓励马克思主义政治分析传统扎根。”在某种程度上，马克思主义政治理论的价值和作用必须根据其在政治上的效果来评判，即促进和方便社会主义，而不是其当前专注于在主导意识形态机构内建立学术合法性。 其次，正如米尔班德（1973, 84–85, 91）在这一点开始认识到的，保兰察斯的主要关切不是提供一个资本主义国家的理论（至少不是米尔班德理解的那个概念），而是“提供马克思、恩格斯以及列宁关于国家和政治的文本‘解读’。”正如米尔班德所指出的，“这样的‘解读’，在阿尔都塞的意义上，当然不是文本的呈现或汇编；也不是对它们的评论，甚至不是尝试解释，尽管部分是后者。”相反，阿尔都塞式的经典文本解读——米尔班德承认这让他“有点不安”——涉及对原始文本的补充。值得赞扬的是，米尔班德没有追随许多当代文学/政治理论的路径，通过与保兰察斯和结构主义者就“文本解释方法”进行争论。相反，他直接回到原始文本，作为评估保兰察斯如何进行他的解释练习以及“‘解读’是否产生了准确信息”的基础。根据自己的阅读，米尔班德得出结论，“保兰察斯的‘解读’在很大程度上对马克思和恩格斯以及他试图描绘的实际现实造成了严重的曲解。”直截了当地说，米尔班德不认为保兰察斯对马克思的解读非常严谨，不幸的是，“在文本引用的谨慎和精确度不仅仅是学术问题：它们还涉及到重大的政治问题。” 事实上，仔细阅读保兰察斯（1978a）表明，他从未对马克思经典文本进行过仔细的“症状性”阅读，而是至少最初严重依赖于阿尔都塞及其追随者的结论。在几乎每一个重要转折点，保兰察斯使用模糊和泛泛的引用来支持他的主要主张；例如：在构建一般理论时，保兰察斯（1978a, 12）用“马克思在1857年导言中证明了”来加强他的立场；在过度决定的概念上，保兰察斯（1978a, 17）表达了一个“由马克思在《资本论》中阐述的”概念；关于层次的自主性，保兰察斯（1978a, 29）声称“马克思在《资本论》中证明了这一点”；关于政治的自主性，保兰察斯（1978a, 30）坚持这个主张得到验证“在《1857-1858年经济学手稿》和关于封建生产方式的部分中。”然而，保兰察斯从未提供任何具体引用来支持这些主张，以及许多其他主张。 这种特点如今在理论上更加引人注目，因为路易·阿尔都塞（1993, 165-66）承认他对文本的“哲学知识相当有限……对黑格尔略有了解，最后是马克思的几段文字。”阿尔都塞描述他真正学习哲学的方法是“道听途说……从我的朋友那里偶然捡拾到某些短语，最后是来自我自己学生的研讨班论文和文章。”类似地，霍尔（2000, vii）注意到，保兰察斯在一次采访中告诉他，“在早期，即使要获取马克思和恩格斯的经典文本也几乎是不可能的，他主要是通过法国哲学接触到马克思主义的。” 相比之下，米尔班德（1973, 85）通过指出“书中的基本主题，它的核心问题域，是绝对正确的”推进了他自己对马克思的阅读。按照米尔班德的理解，这一主题是要重申“在经典马克思主义中，政治领域不仅仅是经济领域的简单反映，关于国家，后者‘相对自主性’的概念是核心。”然而，在一个通常被忽视的重要而冗长的脚注中，米尔班德（1973, 85 fn. 4）再次返回到他原本的文本来辩论，保兰察斯的中心主题已经在： ...《共产党宣言》中找到的关于国家的最熟悉的马克思主义表述中完全包含了，马克思和恩格斯断言“现代国家不过是管理整个资产阶级共同事务的委员会”……他们所说的是“现代国家不过是管理整个资产阶级共同事务的委员会”：共同事务的概念假定了特定的事务存在；而整个资产阶级的概念意味着组成那个整体的独立元素的存在。鉴于这种情况，显然需要他们所指的那种机构，即国家；而国家不能满足这种需要而不享有一定程度的自主性。换句话说，自主性的概念蕴含在定义本身中，是其固有的一部分。 因此，不需要对马克思进行症状性阅读，也没有理由对马克思经典文本进行补充，因为所需的理论和概念已经足够进行资本主义国家的分析。此外，对米尔班德而言，保兰察斯结构主义的真正问题在于它未能实现其所声称的目的。保兰察斯声称发展了关于资本主义国家的理论，然而，米尔班德（1974, 84）抱怨“这本书几乎没有任何实际的资本主义国家的参考”，主要是因为保兰察斯“对经验主义污染有着荒谬地夸张的恐惧。”从这个角度看，保兰察斯的“‘结构超决定主义’使他假设了有关国家与资本主义生产方式中阶级之间关系的内容，因此，他看不到进行严肃的经验或历史调查的必要。”因此，正如米尔班德所说，“真正的麻烦”是保兰察斯对第一次交流中提出的问题的处理方式，“阻止了他提供一个令人满意的答案。”因此，米尔班德（1973, 89, 85-86）感叹，“他[保兰察斯]所栖息的‘结构’和‘层次’的世界与历史或当代现实几乎没有接触点，这让他无法实现他所描述的‘对具体形势的政治分析’”。"},{"prompt":"请将“THE PROBLEM OF STATE POWER Miliband illustrates his methodological claim by contrasting their conceptions of state power. Poulantzas argues that state institutions, as such, do not have any power, but must be related only to social classes which hold power. However, Miliband (1973, 87) observes that if the state does not have any independent source of power, “this, inter alia, is to deprive the state of any kind of autonomy at all” and, for all practical matters, conceptualizes the state out of existence in everything but name only. Thus, aside from being a self-contradictory and self-defeating theoretical position, Miliband insists that one has to make a distinction between class power and state power, not only because it is necessary to conceptualize the state as relatively autonomous, but because it is also necessary to recognizing that while state power may be the main and ultimate means of maintaining ruling class domination, it is not the only form of class power as Poulantzas’ formulation implies. Miliband’s point is that state power is not the only form, nor the only site, of ruling class domination. This is another reason why Miliband again rejects Poulantzas’ suggestion that institutions such as churches, the educational system, political parties, the press, radio, television, publishing, the family, and so on, should all be brought within the realm of state theory as components of an ideological state apparatus. Indeed, Miliband (1973, 87, 88 fn. 16) scoffs at the suggestion as carrying “to caricatural forms the confusion between different forms of class domination and, to repeat, makes impossible a serious analysis of the relation of the state to society, and of state power to class power.” THE THIRD EXCHANGE: STALEMATE (1976) Poulantzas did not reply immediately to Miliband’s scathing critique, but following the English language publication of Fascism and Dictatorship (1974) and Classes in Contemporary Capitalism (1975), he decided that “the moment has come to continue the debate.” In fact, Poulantzas’ polemical strategy was to end the debate by shifting the terms of the debate from a direct confrontation over the problems of method and theory to an ideological divergence between contaminated Marxism and real Marxism. The third exchange essentially ended the debate—at least as a personal exchange between Miliband and Poulantzas—although by this time Poulantzas (1976a, 63–64) recognized that “a good many others, in Europe, the United States, Latin America, and elsewhere, have joined in, in articles and books.” By this time, Poulantzas (1976a, 63–64) was acutely aware that the differences between Miliband and himself were being conceptualized by other scholars, “especially in England and the United States, as a controversy between ‘instrumentalism’ and ‘structuralism’.” Poulantzas dismissed these terms “as an utterly mistaken way of situating the discussion.” As a matter of fact, Poulantzas complains that the only reason he decided to continue the discussion is “that certain authors, especially in the United States, have perceived the debate between Miliband and myself as a supposed debate between instrumentalism and structuralism, thus posing a false dilemma.”41 Consequently, Poulantzas hoped in one last salvo to clarify what he considered to be the “real” conflict as one between materialism and idealism or between Marxist social science and bourgeois ideology (i.e., contaminated Marxism). THE PROBLEM OF METHOD III Poulantzas (1976a, 76) curtly dismisses Miliband’s comments on the difficulty of his terminology and on the lack of concrete analysis as evidence that their approaches are “situated on disparate [epistemological] terrains.” Poulantzas held firm to his claim that it is only possible to “carry on a far-reaching debate with the aid of a precise language, and … from within their respective problematics, to attach precise definitions to the concepts, terms or notions they are using.” In Poulantzas’ view, there was no point in continuing the debate further because Miliband’s writings “are marked by the absence of any theoretical problematic” and allegedly it is the absence of an explicit problematic that accounts for Miliband’s repeated criticisms of Poulantzas’ work for its lack of concrete analysis. Hence, Poulantzas writes that “on the subject of Miliband’s own work, I have nothing to add to what I wrote in my original review of his book.” From Poulantzas’ perspective, Miliband was not engaged in theory construction or in the production of new concepts capable of displacing his own epistemological position. Quite simply, Poulantzas and Miliband do not agree on how to read the Marxian classics, on what constitutes a concept, on what counts as a theory or as theory construction, or even on what counts as a concrete analysis and most of these divergences are anchored in the fundamental assumptions of competing social science methodologies. Poulantzas (1976a, 76) is certainly aware of this fact and, for this reason, he explicitly rejects the ambitions of Anglo-American authors hoping to escape the dichotomy by finding a compromise between instrumentalism and structuralism or a synthesis of the two perspectives. Poulantzas understood from the beginning that the real debate was about the problem of method. More to the point, however, in his last essay of the debate, Poulantzas seeks to conflate the categories of methodology and ideology to create a new dichotomy between materialism (Marxism) and idealism (bourgeois ideology). Poulantzas begins to introduce this new distinction in his reply to Miliband’s comments on “structural abstractionism.” Poulantzas was evidently irritated by Miliband’s reproach concerning the lack of concrete analyses or references to concrete historical and empirical facts in his writings. First, Poulantzas (1976a, 65) did not consider the reproach justified because he insists that “constant and precise references to the state of the class struggle and to the historical transformations of the State are abundantly present in Political Power.” However, once Poulantzas cites his discussions of the absolutist State, historical models of bourgeois revolution, and the forms of the capitalist State, it is clear that Poulantzas’ notion of concrete analysis is a usage peculiar to structuralist epistemology and it is certainly not what Miliband means by concrete analysis (e.g., a historical and empirical analysis of Thatcher regime policies in the 1980s). Furthermore, Poulantzas emphasizes that the difference between him and Miliband over the meaning of the concrete goes back to their “respective approaches to ‘concrete facts’.” For Poulantzas, as noted earlier, an isolated fact is an abstraction that only becomes concrete when it is given meaning “with the aid of a theoretical apparatus constantly employed throughout the length of the text.” Thus, Poulantzas concludes that without an explicit theoretical problematic, “one can pile up as many concrete analyses as one likes, they will prove nothing whatsoever.” What Miliband calls a lack of concrete analysis, Poulantzas (1976a, 65) embraces as eschewing “the demagogy of the ‘palpitating fact’, of ‘common sense’, and the ‘illusions of the evident’.” Indeed, Poulantzas returns to an old theme when he berates Miliband for succumbing to “the demagogy of common sense” and, for good measure, sideswipes “the dominant ‘Anglo-Saxon culture’ as a whole” as the source of this epistemological error. Poulantzas (1976a, 67–68) can scarcely conceal his disdain for “English readers” who steeped in the demagogy of common sense and empiricism are unable to grasp what he acknowledges was “sometimes needlessly difficult language.” In the final analysis, Poulantzas is only willing to concede that he shared “an over-rigid epistemological position” with Althusser at the time. Lest anyone think that such an admission carried with it some hope of a reconciliation or a synthesis, Poulantzas (1976a, 66–67) again reiterates that “I naturally maintain my essential difference with Miliband, one that is irreducible, theoretically.”42 For Poulantzas, this irreducible theoretical break was the distinction between real materialist Marxism and contaminated Marxism. Although Miliband and other plain Marxists generally reject any description of their position as instrumentalism, it is still not widely acknowledged that Poulantzas also came to reject the structuralist label by 1976. Poulantzas was apparently stung by Miliband’s references to his structural super-determinism and structural abstractionism. However, in the last exchange, Poulantzas turns these concepts against Miliband by suggesting that such terms have been used historically to criticize Marxists for not granting “sufficient importance to the role of concrete individuals and creative persons; to human freedom and action; to free will and to Man’s capacity for choice; to the ‘project’ as against ‘necessity’ (hence Miliband’s term, ‘super-determinism’); and so on and so forth.” Poulantzas (1976a, 70) retaliates with the observation that Miliband’s use of the term structuralism thus “falls within the humanist and historicist problematic, indeed within a traditional problematic of bourgeois subjectivist idealism such as has frequently influenced Marxism, namely the problematic of the subject.” To the extent that Poulantzas always located Miliband’s work within the problematic of the subject, this reference is a scarcely concealed effort to push Miliband completely off the terrain of Marxist political theory. In fact, Poulantzas (1976a, 70) ends the discussion with a rejoinder that: I would like to state quite clearly that I have no intention of replying to this [charge of structuralism]. I consider that everything there is to say on this subject has already been said, and that all those who have not yet understood, or who have yet to be convinced … are certainly not going to be convinced by the few lines I could possibly add here on this subject. I shall, therefore, merely repeat that the term structuralism applied in this sense to Political Power is nothing more, in the final analysis, than a reiteration in modern terms of the kind of objections that bourgeois idealism has always opposed to Marxism of whatever stripe. ”翻译为中文","completion":"国家权力问题 米尔班德通过对比他们对国家权力的观念来说明他的方法论主张。保兰察斯主张，国家机构本身并没有任何权力，只能与拥有权力的社会阶级联系起来。然而，米尔班德（1973, 87）观察到，如果国家没有任何独立的权力来源，“这就等于完全剥夺了国家的任何形式的自主性”，就实际情况而言，这几乎是在只有名字上消解了国家的存在。因此，除了是一种自相矛盾且自我挫败的理论立场外，米尔班德坚持必须区分阶级权力和国家权力，不仅因为概念化国家为相对自主的是必要的，而且也因为必须认识到虽然国家权力可能是维持统治阶级统治的主要和最终手段，但并非如保兰察斯的表述所暗示的那样，它不是阶级权力的唯一形式。米尔班德的观点是，国家权力并非统治阶级统治的唯一形式，也不是唯一场域。这是米尔班德再次拒绝保兰察斯建议将教堂、教育系统、政治党派、新闻界、广播、电视、出版、家庭等机构纳入国家理论范畴作为意识形态国家机器组成部分的另一个原因。实际上，米尔班德（1973, 87, 88 fn. 16）嘲笑这一建议，认为它“将各种形式的阶级统治之间的混淆带到了滑稽的地步，并且，重申一次，使得对国家与社会的关系，以及国家权力与阶级权力的关系进行严肃分析变得不可能。” 第三次交流：僵局（1976） 保兰察斯没有立即回应米尔班德的尖锐批评，但在《法西斯主义与独裁统治》（1974年）和《当代资本主义中的阶级》（1975年）的英文版出版后，他决定“时机已到，可以继续辩论。”实际上，保兰察斯的论辩策略是通过将辩论从围绕方法和理论问题的直接对抗转移到被污染的马克思主义与真正的马克思主义之间的意识形态分歧，以结束辩论。至少作为米尔班德和保兰察斯之间的个人交流，第三次交流实际上结束了辩论，尽管到了这个时候，保兰察斯（1976a, 63-64）认识到“很多其他人，在欧洲、美国、拉丁美洲和其他地方，已经通过文章和书籍加入进来。”到了这个时候，保兰察斯（1976a, 63-64）非常清楚，米尔班德和他之间的分歧正在被其他学者，尤其是在英国和美国，概念化为“工具主义”与“结构主义”之争。保兰察斯驳斥这些术语“是对讨论定位的完全错误的方式。”事实上，保兰察斯抱怨说，他决定继续讨论的唯一原因是“一些作者，尤其是在美国，将我与米尔班德之间的辩论视为所谓的工具主义与结构主义之间的辩论，从而提出了一个错误的两难选择。”因此，保兰察斯希望通过最后一次发言来澄清他所认为的“真正”冲突是物质主义与唯心主义之间的冲突，或者是马克思主义社会科学与资产阶级意识形态（即被污染的马克思主义）之间的冲突。 方法论问题 III 保兰察斯（1976a, 76）简洁地驳斥了米尔班德关于其术语难度和缺乏具体分析的评论，称这表明他们的方法论“位于不同的[认识论]领域上。”保兰察斯坚定地主张，只有通过使用精确的语言，并“在各自的问题域内，赋予使用的概念、术语或观念以精确定义”，才有可能进行深入的辩论。在保兰察斯看来，没有继续辩论的必要，因为米尔班德的著作“标志着没有任何理论问题域”的缺失，据称，正是缺乏明确的问题域导致了米尔班德对保兰察斯作品缺乏具体分析的反复批评。因此，保양察斯写道“关于米尔班德自己的作品，我没有什么要补充的，除了我在对他的书的原始评论中写过的内容。”从保兰察斯的角度来看，米尔班德没有参与理论构建或产生新概念去取代他自己的认识论立场。简单地说，保兰察斯和米尔班德在如何阅读马克思经典文本、什么构成概念、什么被视为理论或理论构建，甚至什么被视为具体分析的问题上并不一致，而这些分歧根植于竞争的社会科学方法论的基本假设。 保兰察斯（1976a, 76）当然意识到这一事实，因此，他明确拒绝了寻求通过找到工具主义和结构主义之间的妥协或综合来逃避二分法的英美作者的愿望。保兰察斯从一开始就了解到，真正的辩论关乎方法论问题。然而，更重要的是，在他辩论的最后一篇文章中，保兰察斯试图将方法论和意识形态的类别混为一谈，创造了物质主义（马克思主义）和唯心主义（资产阶级意识形态）之间的新二分法。 保兰察斯在回应米尔班德关于“结构抽象主义”的评论时引入了这一新区分。保兰察斯显然对米尔班德因其著作中缺乏具体历史和经验事实的分析或引用而提出的批评感到恼怒。首先，保兰察斯（1976a, 65）不认为这种批评是正当的，因为他坚称“在《政治权力》中充满了对阶级斗争状态和国家历史转变的恒定和精确引用”。然而，一旦保兰察斯提到了他对绝对主义国家、资产阶级革命的历史模式和资本主义国家形式的讨论，就很明显保兰察斯对具体分析的看法是结构主义认识论特有的，而这肯定不是米尔班德所意味的具体分析（例如，对1980年代撒切尔政权政策的历史和经验分析）。 此外，保兰察斯强调，他与米尔班德对具体意义的理解之间的分歧可以追溯到他们对“具体事实”的“各自方法论”的不同。对保兰察斯来说，如前所述，一个孤立的事实是一种抽象，它只有在“借助于贯穿全文不断使用的理论体系”的帮助下才变得具体。因此，保兰察斯得出结论，没有明确的理论问题域，“无论堆积多少具体分析，它们都将一无所证。”米尔班德所谓的缺乏具体分析，保兰察斯（1976a, 65）接受为避免“‘跃动的事实’、‘常识’和‘显而易见的幻觉’的诡辩。”事实上，保兰察斯回到了一个老话题，他指责米尔班德屈服于“常识的诡辩”，并顺便攻击“整个‘盎格鲁-撒克逊文化’”是这种认识论错误的根源。保兰察斯（1976a, 67-68）几乎掩饰不住对“英国读者”的鄙视，这些读者沉浸在常识和经验主义的诡辩中，无法领会他承认的“有时过于困难的语言”。最终分析中，保兰察斯只愿意承认，他与阿尔都塞当时共享了“过于僵化的认识论立场”。以免有人认为这种承认带来了和解或综合的希望，保兰察斯（1976a, 66-67）再次重申“我自然保持与米尔班德的本质差异，这种差异在理论上是不可调和的。” 对于保兰察斯来说，这种不可调和的理论分歧是真正的唯物主义马克思主义与受污染的马克思主义之间的区别。虽然米尔班德和其他纯粹的马克思主义者通常拒绝将他们的立场描述为工具主义，但人们仍然没有广泛承认，到1976年，保兰察斯也来拒绝了结构主义标签。保兰察斯显然被米尔班德对他的结构超决定主义和结构抽象主义的提法所激怒。然而，在最后一次交流中，保兰察斯通过暗示这些术语被用来批评马克思主义者没有“给予足够的重要性给具体个体和创造性人物；人类的自由和行动；自由意志和人的选择能力；‘项目’对抗‘必然性’（因此米尔班德的术语，‘超决定主义’）；等等和等等。”保兰察斯（1976a, 70）以此观察反击米尔班德使用结构主义这一术语，“落入了人文主义和历史唯物主义的问题域，事实上落入了作为资产阶级主观唯心主义传统问题域的一个，这种问题域经常影响马克思主义，即主体的问题域。”鉴于保兰察斯始终将米尔班德的工作定位在主体问题域内，这一提法几乎是在努力将米尔班德完全排除在马克思主义政治理论领域之外。实际上，保兰察斯（1976a, 70）以此结论结束讨论：“我想非常清楚地声明，我无意回应这一[结构主义的]指控。我认为关于这个主题该说的都已经说过了，那些还没有理解，或者还有待被说服的人……肯定不会因为我在这里可能补充的几行文字而被说服。因此，我将仅仅重申，以这种意义将结构主义应用于《政治权力》无异于用现代术语重复那些资产阶级唯心主义一直以来反对任何形式的马克思主义的反对意见。”"},{"prompt":"请将“Finally, Poulantzas concludes the debate by returning to the issue of whether one must draw a distinction between class power and state power. Poulantzas (1976a, 73) dismisses Miliband’s argument that state institutions must be viewed as repositories of independent power (i.e., coercion) to have autonomy as nothing but a blatant “appeal to common sense.” Rather than responding directly to the theoretical argument, Poulantzas again attempts to drive an ideological wedge between himself and Miliband by insisting that Miliband’s conception of state power is “an old and persistent conception of bourgeois social science and politics.” As if to make his point one last time, Poulantzas (1976, 76) dismisses the entirety of the debate with Miliband by concluding that after all is said and done: “all that remains is a polemical catch-phrase pure and simple, masking a factual and empirical critique.” THREE Plain Marxists and Sophisticated Marxists In his book The Marxists (1962), American sociologist C. Wright Mills drew an ironic distinction between “plain marxism” and “sophisticated marxism” that not only foreshadowed the next decade’s state theory debate, but unintentionally set the stage for many of the misrepresentations that eventually characterized that debate. Consequently, it is no coincidence that renewed interest in Poulantzas and Miliband has also generated “a small but pronounced revival” of scholarly interest in the works of C. Wright Mills after a period when Marxist state theorists rejected his work as that of a vulgar “voluntarist” (Aronowitz, 2003). There are also political reasons for the renewed interest in Mills’ exposé of the American power elite, which he described as a tightly knit and venal coalition of the corporate rich, military warlords, and a servile political directorate. The direct seizure of American national government by upper-class scions that was orchestrated during the Reagan/Bush Administrations (1980–1992) under the rubric of populist rhetoric seemed to expose itself in the Bush II Administration (2000–2008) (Edsall, 1984). A stolen election (2000), corporate corruption scandals (Enron, MCI), a global financial collapse (2007–2009), and an unpopular war of occupation (Iraq)—all rationalized with bald-faced lying—have made Mills’ (1956, 343) claim that “the higher immorality is a systematic feature of the American elite” seem remarkably timely (Wolfe, 1999). Hence, the idea of the power elite once again resonates with scholars and ordinary citizens even as middle-class complacency with it all makes Mills’ description of Americans as ideologically “inactionary” seem frighteningly accurate (Mills, 1951, 327).1 As a result, four of Mills’ most important books have been republished in the last few years, each with a new introduction by a prominent scholar, and his daughters have published a collection of his personal letters, including his FBI file, for the first time. This small if pronounced return to Mills seems to have culminated in a three volume reassessment of his work edited by Stanley Aronowitz (2004), which also catalyzed a 2006 panel of the American Political Science Association devoted specifically to The Power Elite. More recently, Aronowitz (2012) has published a reassessment of “C. Wright Mills and the Making of Political Intellectuals.” While the revival of interest in C. Wright Mills has emerged in tandem with renewed interest in the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, it is not yet recognized that these two intellectual currents actually intersect in C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite, which was actually the main object of Nicos Poulantzas’ criticism when he first identified “instrumentalism” and “historicism” as the intellectual sources of a “distorted Marxism.” In Pouvoir Politique et Classes Sociale (1968), it was actually C. Wright Mills who was on the receiving end of Poulantzas’ methodological polemic as Ralph Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society (1969) had not even been published when the original French version of Poulantzas’ book was released in 1968. Yet, equally interesting, and also evidently forgotten is that there was an earlier encounter between Marxists and The Power Elite during the 1950s, when Marxists such as Paul M. Sweezy and Herbert Aptheker took Mills to task, but in ways that yielded a wholly different and far more constructive outcome. The first encounter between Mills and the Marxists was a lively engagement that yielded constructive advances in political theory and, indeed, Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society was at least partially the outcome of that first encounter. On the other hand, during the 1970s, Poulantzas replayed his earlier polemic against “voluntarism” and “instrumentalism” by inserting Miliband into the debate as if he were Mills’ identical theoretical twin. In this respect, Poulantzas and the structural Marxists failed to recognize that Anglo-American Marxists, such as Miliband, had already moved beyond Mills, first, by incorporating his many empirical advances into a theoretical analysis but, second, by criticizing Mills for lacking a theory of political economy and, therefore, ironically for failing to incorporate “structural” factors into his analysis of the power elite (Barrow, 2007). The Power Elite and Marxism It is hardly a revelation to point out that the central concept in C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite is a concept of “the power elite,” rather than a “ruling” or “capitalist class.” However, it has always been a source of consternation for Marxists that Mills elaborated this concept by starting from the Weberian position that societies consist of analytically distinct and autonomous economic, political, social, and cultural orders (Weber, 1946). Rather than asserting that an inherent relationship exists between any of these orders, Mills argued that any such claim was a hypothesis until such time, and to such a degree, as it could be demonstrated as the conclusion of empirical sociological research. A second source of concern for Marxists was Mills’ claim that institutions (and not classes directly) organize power in society by vesting certain positions, and the individuals occupying those positions, with the authority to make decisions about how to deploy the key resources mobilized by that institution. For instance, as an economic institution, the modern corporation vests its board of directors and executive officers with the authority to allocate and determine the use of any economic resources that the corporation owns or controls. Likewise, government vests specific public offices with the authority to employ administrative coercion or police force against anyone who fails to comply with the law. Similarly, as cultural institutions, schools and universities certify specific individuals as possessing expertise in particular fields of knowledge. In this sense, the individuals who occupy positions of institutional authority in a society control different types of power: economic power, political power, and ideological power and it is the authority to make institutionally binding decisions that makes an individual powerful. Thus, power can be imputed to particular groups of individuals to the degree that they occupy the decision-making positions of the organizations that control wealth, force, status, and knowledge in a particular society. A power structure consists of a patterned distribution of resources that is organized by the major institutions of a particular society (Barrow, 1993, 13–16).2 Thus, Mills claimed that: The power elite is composed of men … in positions to make decisions having major consequences … they are in command of the major hierarchies and organizations of modern society. They rule the big corporations. They run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. They occupy the strategic command posts of the social structure, in which are now centered the effective means of the power and the wealth and the celebrity which they enjoy. (Mills, 1956, 3–4)”翻译为中文","completion":"国家权力问题 最终，保兰察斯通过回到是否必须区分阶级权力和国家权力这一问题上来结束辩论。保兰察斯（1976a, 73）直接驳斥米尔班德的论点，即国家机构必须被视为独立权力（即，强制力）的储存库以拥有自主性，他将这一观点称为对“常识”的公然“呼吁”。保兰察斯并没有直接回应这一理论论点，而是再次试图在意识形态上在他和米尔班德之间驱动楔子，坚持认为米尔班德对国家权力的观念“是资产阶级社会科学和政治的一种陈旧且持续的观念”。仿佛想再次表明他的观点，保兰察斯（1976, 76）对与米尔班德的整个辩论得出结论，认为最终：“剩下的不过是一个纯粹、简单的辩论性口号，掩盖了一个事实性和经验性的批评。” 平实的马克思主义者和复杂的马克思主义者 在他的书《马克思主义者》（1962）中，美国社会学家C.赖特·米尔斯讽刺地区分了“平实的马克思主义”和“复杂的马克思主义”，这不仅预示了下一个十年国家理论辩论的内容，而且无意中为最终定义那场辩论的许多误解搭建了舞台。因此，对保兰察斯和米尔班德再次引起关注也导致了对C.赖特·米尔斯作品的“小而显著的复兴”这一学术关注，在此之前马克思主义国家理论家将其作品视为一个粗俗的“自愿主义者”的作品（Aronowitz, 2003）。也有政治原因促成了对米尔斯揭示美国权力精英的关注复兴，他将其描述为一个紧密连接且贪婪的企业富人、军事军阀和服从的政治领导集团的联盟。 雷根/布什政府（1980-1992）期间在民粹主义言辞的掩饰下由上层阶级后裔直接夺取美国国家政权行为，在布什二世政府（2000-2008）期间似乎暴露无遗。一次被窃取的选举（2000年），企业腐败丑闻（安然、MCI），全球金融崩溃（2007-2009年）和一场不受欢迎的占领战争（伊拉克）——所有这些都用赤裸裸的谎言进行合理化——使得米尔斯（1956, 343）关于“高层不道德是美国精英的一个系统性特征”的说法显得非常及时（Wolfe, 1999）。因此，即使中产阶级对这一切的自满使得米尔斯对美国人被描述为意识形态上的“非行动主义者”的观点看上去令人恐惧地准确（Mills, 1951, 327）。结果，米尔斯的四本重要书籍在过去几年中被重新出版，每本都带有一位知名学者的新序言，他的女儿们也首次出版了他的个人信件集，包括他的FBI档案。米尔斯的这一小而显著的回归似乎在斯坦利·阿罗诺维茨（2004）编辑的对其作品的三卷本重新评估中达到顶峰，这也催生了2006年美国政治学会专门针对《权力精英》的小组讨论。更近期地，阿罗诺维茨（2012）出版了对“C.赖特·米尔斯和政治知识分子的塑造”的重新评估。 尽管对C.赖特·米尔斯的兴趣复兴与对保兰察斯-米尔班德辩论的兴趣复兴同步发生，但尚未被认识到的是，这两股知识潮流实际上在C.赖特·米尔斯的《权力精英》中交汇，这正是尼科斯·保兰察斯首次界定“工具主义”和“历史主义”作为“扭曲马克思主义”的知识来源时批评的主要对象。在《政治权力与社会阶级》（1968）中，当拉尔夫·米尔班德的《资本主义社会中的国家》（1969）尚未出版时，实际上C.赖特·米尔斯就成了保兰察斯方法论论战的接收者。然而，同样有趣且显然被遗忘的是，在20世纪50年代，当如保罗·M·斯威齐和赫伯特·阿普塞克这样的马克思主义者批评米尔斯时，出现了先前的遭遇，《权力精英》产生了完全不同且更有建设性的结果。米尔斯与马克思主义者之间的第一次遭遇是一场生动的参与，产生了政治理论的建设性进步，实际上，米尔班德的《资本主义社会中的国家》至少部分是这次第一次遭遇的结果。另一方面，在1970年代，保兰察斯通过将米尔班德插入辩论中，就好像他是米尔斯的理论孪生兄弟一样，重演了他早期对“自愿主义”和“工具主义”的论战。在这个方面，保兰察斯和结构主义马克思主义者未能认识到，诸如米尔班德这样的盎格鲁-美国马克思主义者，已经超越了米尔斯，首先，通过将米尔斯的许多经验进步纳入理论分析，但第二，通过批评米尔斯缺乏政治经济学理论，因此，讽刺的是，由于未能将“结构”因素纳入其对权力精英的分析（Barrow, 2007）。 权力精英与马克思主义 指出C.赖特·米尔斯在《权力精英》中的核心概念是“权力精英”的概念，而不是“统治”或“资本家阶级”的概念，这几乎不是什么新发现。然而，让马克思主义者感到困惑的一直是米尔斯通过采用韦伯的观点来阐述这一概念，即社会由分析上独立和自主的经济、政治、社会和文化秩序组成（Weber, 1946）。与其说是任何这些秩序之间存在固有的关系，不如说米尔斯认为任何此类主张都是一个假设，直到它能以实证社会学研究的结论来证明。对马克思主义者的第二个关切是米尔斯的主张，即是机构（而不是直接的阶级）通过授予某些职位，以及占据这些职位的个人，管理社会权力的权威，来决定如何部署该机构所拥有或控制的关键资源。 例如，作为经济机构，现代公司赋予其董事会和执行官员分配和决定使用公司拥有或控制的任何经济资源的权威。同样，政府赋予特定的公共职务以对任何未遵守法律的人使用行政强制或警察力量的权威。类似地，作为文化机构，学校和大学认证特定个体在特定知识领域拥有专业知识。从这个意义上说，占据社会中机构权威地位的个体控制不同类型的权力：经济权力、政治权力和意识形态权力，而正是做出机构约束性决策的权威使个体变得有权势。因此，可以将权力归于特定个体群体，因为他们占据了在特定社会中控制财富、力量、地位和知识的主要组织的决策职位。权力结构由特定社会的主要机构组织的资源的有模式的分布组成（Barrow, 1993, 13-16） 因此，米尔斯声称： 权力精英由……处于能够作出具有重大后果的决定的位置的男人们组成……他们指挥着大公司。他们运营着国家机器并宣称其特权。他们指导着军事机构。他们占据了社会结构的战略指挥岗位，在那里集中了他们享受的权力和财富和名声的有效手段。（Mills, 1956, 3-4）"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To find the most efficient method, we compare the chance of getting the item per cost for each combination of chest and location at their optimum clears (500 in this case, as it gives the highest probability for both chests). - **Efficiency for Epic Chest at Sendoff Spring:** ( text{Efficiency (Epic at 500 clears)} = frac{5.27%}{96,500} = frac{0.0527}{96,500} approx 5.46 times 10^{-7} ) - **Efficiency for Legendary Chest at Tin Tower:** ( text{Efficiency (Legendary at 500 clears)} = frac{0.74%}{4,500} = frac{0.0074}{4,500} approx 1.64 times 10^{-6} ) # Conclusion Even though the Epic chest has a higher probability of containing the special item, when we consider the cost of obtaining these chests from their respective locations, the Legendary chest from the Tin Tower presents a more cost-efficient option (higher efficiency value) on a per-attempt basis. It means for the same amount of investment, you might get more attempts from Tin Tower (Legendary chest) than from Sendoff Spring (Epic chest), thus potentially increasing your overall chances of obtaining the item based on the cost. Remember, depending on how you value your resources (time, currency in-game, etc.) and the exact mechanics of the game (such as any potential limitations on attempts, your current progress towards the 500 clears, and other rewards or items you might obtain in the process), your preference might vary. But purely on an efficiency calculation comparing the chance of obtaining the item against the cost, Tin Tower (Legendary chest) is the optimal route."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These orbs, a startling shade of azure, hold within them the secrets of a soul both haunted and hunting. The stark visage of Mr. St. Clair is a living sculpture of sinew and strength, his physique a testament to the whispered tales of survival and dominance.

But Tyler's story weaves a darker thread through the luminous tapestry of his existence. Compelled by the cruel hand of necessity to the shadowed edges of society, he sells moments of false intimacy, each parting a fragment of his soul traded for survival.

Poulantzas (1976a, 73) dismisses Miliband’s argument that state institutions must be viewed as repositories of independent power (i.e., coercion) to have autonomy as nothing but a blatant “appeal to common sense.” Rather than responding directly to the theoretical argument, Poulantzas again attempts to drive an ideological wedge between himself and Miliband by insisting that Miliband’s conception of state power is “an old and persistent conception of bourgeois social science and politics.” As if to make his point one last time, Poulantzas (1976, 76) dismisses the entirety of the debate with Miliband by concluding that after all is said and done: “all that remains is a polemical catch-phrase pure and simple, masking a factual and empirical critique.” THREE Plain Marxists and Sophisticated Marxists In his book The Marxists (1962), American sociologist C. Wright Mills drew an ironic distinction between “plain marxism” and “sophisticated marxism” that not only foreshadowed the next decade’s state theory debate, but unintentionally set the stage for many of the misrepresentations that eventually characterized that debate. Consequently, it is no coincidence that renewed interest in Poulantzas and Miliband has also generated “a small but pronounced revival” of scholarly interest in the works of C. Wright Mills after a period when Marxist state theorists rejected his work as that of a vulgar “voluntarist” (Aronowitz, 2003). There are also political reasons for the renewed interest in Mills’ exposé of the American power elite, which he described as a tightly knit and venal coalition of the corporate rich, military warlords, and a servile political directorate. The direct seizure of American national government by upper-class scions that was orchestrated during the Reagan/Bush Administrations (1980–1992) under the rubric of populist rhetoric seemed to expose itself in the Bush II Administration (2000–2008) (Edsall, 1984). A stolen election (2000), corporate corruption scandals (Enron, MCI), a global financial collapse (2007–2009), and an unpopular war of occupation (Iraq)—all rationalized with bald-faced lying—have made Mills’ (1956, 343) claim that “the higher immorality is a systematic feature of the American elite” seem remarkably timely (Wolfe, 1999). Hence, the idea of the power elite once again resonates with scholars and ordinary citizens even as middle-class complacency with it all makes Mills’ description of Americans as ideologically “inactionary” seem frighteningly accurate (Mills, 1951, 327).1 As a result, four of Mills’ most important books have been republished in the last few years, each with a new introduction by a prominent scholar, and his daughters have published a collection of his personal letters, including his FBI file, for the first time. This small if pronounced return to Mills seems to have culminated in a three volume reassessment of his work edited by Stanley Aronowitz (2004), which also catalyzed a 2006 panel of the American Political Science Association devoted specifically to The Power Elite. More recently, Aronowitz (2012) has published a reassessment of “C. Wright Mills and the Making of Political Intellectuals.” While the revival of interest in C. Wright Mills has emerged in tandem with renewed interest in the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, it is not yet recognized that these two intellectual currents actually intersect in C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite, which was actually the main object of Nicos Poulantzas’ criticism when he first identified “instrumentalism” and “historicism” as the intellectual sources of a “distorted Marxism.” In Pouvoir Politique et Classes Sociale (1968), it was actually C. Wright Mills who was on the receiving end of Poulantzas’ methodological polemic as Ralph Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society (1969) had not even been published when the original French version of Poulantzas’ book was released in 1968. Yet, equally interesting, and also evidently forgotten is that there was an earlier encounter between Marxists and The Power Elite during the 1950s, when Marxists such as Paul M. Sweezy and Herbert Aptheker took Mills to task, but in ways that yielded a wholly different and far more constructive outcome. The first encounter between Mills and the Marxists was a lively engagement that yielded constructive advances in political theory and, indeed, Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society was at least partially the outcome of that first encounter. On the other hand, during the 1970s, Poulantzas replayed his earlier polemic against “voluntarism” and “instrumentalism” by inserting Miliband into the debate as if he were Mills’ identical theoretical twin. In this respect, Poulantzas and the structural Marxists failed to recognize that Anglo-American Marxists, such as Miliband, had already moved beyond Mills, first, by incorporating his many empirical advances into a theoretical analysis but, second, by criticizing Mills for lacking a theory of political economy and, therefore, ironically for failing to incorporate “structural” factors into his analysis of the power elite (Barrow, 2007). The Power Elite and Marxism It is hardly a revelation to point out that the central concept in C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite is a concept of “the power elite,” rather than a “ruling” or “capitalist class.” However, it has always been a source of consternation for Marxists that Mills elaborated this concept by starting from the Weberian position that societies consist of analytically distinct and autonomous economic, political, social, and cultural orders (Weber, 1946). Rather than asserting that an inherent relationship exists between any of these orders, Mills argued that any such claim was a hypothesis until such time, and to such a degree, as it could be demonstrated as the conclusion of empirical sociological research. A second source of concern for Marxists was Mills’ claim that institutions (and not classes directly) organize power in society by vesting certain positions, and the individuals occupying those positions, with the authority to make decisions about how to deploy the key resources mobilized by that institution. For instance, as an economic institution, the modern corporation vests its board of directors and executive officers with the authority to allocate and determine the use of any economic resources that the corporation owns or controls. Likewise, government vests specific public offices with the authority to employ administrative coercion or police force against anyone who fails to comply with the law. Similarly, as cultural institutions, schools and universities certify specific individuals as possessing expertise in particular fields of knowledge. In this sense, the individuals who occupy positions of institutional authority in a society control different types of power: economic power, political power, and ideological power and it is the authority to make institutionally binding decisions that makes an individual powerful. Thus, power can be imputed to particular groups of individuals to the degree that they occupy the decision-making positions of the organizations that control wealth, force, status, and knowledge in a particular society. A power structure consists of a patterned distribution of resources that is organized by the major institutions of a particular society (Barrow, 1993, 13–16).2 Thus, Mills claimed that: The power elite is composed of men … in positions to make decisions having major consequences … they are in command of the major hierarchies and organizations of modern society. They rule the big corporations. They run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. They occupy the strategic command posts of the social structure, in which are now centered the effective means of the power and the wealth and the celebrity which they enjoy. (Mills, 1956, 3–4)”翻译为中文","completion":"最后，波兰察斯通过重新审视是否必须区分阶级权力和国家权力的问题来结束这场讨论。波兰察斯（1976a, 73）驳斥了米利班德的观点，后者认为国家机构必须被视为独立权力（即，强制力）的仓库，以保持自主性，波兰察斯称这只不过是一种公然的“向常识的呼吁”。波兰察斯没有直接回应理论论点，反而再次试图在意识形态上将自己与米利班德区分开来，坚称米利班德对国家权力的看法是“资产阶级社会科学和政治的一种古老且持久的观念”。仿佛要再次强调自己的观点，波兰察斯（1976, 76）通过结论性地说，在与米利班德的全部辩论中：“最终剩下的只是纯粹且简单的论战性口号，掩饰了一个事实和经验的批判。” 纯粹的马克思主义者与复杂的马克思主义者 在他的书《马克思主义者》(1962)中，美国社会学家C.赖特·米尔斯讽刺地区分了“纯粹的马克思主义”和“复杂的马克思主义”，这不仅预示了接下来十年的国家理论辩论，也无意中为该辩论最终充满误解奠定了舞台。因此，对波兰察斯和米利班德重新产生兴趣的同时，也引发了对C.赖特·米尔斯作品的“小而显著的复兴”的学术兴趣，并不是巧合，在此期间，马克思主义国家理论家因其作为一位庸俗“自愿主义者”的工作而拒绝了他的作品（阿隆诺维茨，2003）。对米尔斯对美国权力精英的揭露重新产生兴趣的政治原因也是，他描述的权力精英是由企业富人、军事军阀和奴性的政治指导团体紧密结合的联盟。 直接由上层阶级的子嗣在里根/布什政府期间（1980-1992）以民粹主义的说辞控制了美国国家政府，在布什二世政府期间（2000-2008）似乎暴露无遗（埃德莎尔，1984）。一次被窃取的选举（2000），企业腐败丑闻（安然公司，MCI），全球金融崩溃（2007-2009）以及一场不受欢迎的占领战争（伊拉克）——所有这些都以厚颜无耻的谎言为理由，使得米尔斯（1956, 343）声称“较高的不道德是美国精英的一个系统性特征”看起来异常及时（沃尔夫，1999）。因此，权力精英的观点再次在学者和普通公民中产生共鸣，即使中产阶级对这一切的自满使得米尔斯对美国人意识形态上的“无行动”描述恐怖地准确（米尔斯，1951，327）。结果，米尔斯的四本重要书籍在过去几年里都重新出版，每本都由一位著名学者撰写新的介绍，他的女儿们还首次公开发表了一系列他的个人信件，包括他的FBI档案。这种小而显著的回归米尔斯似乎在斯坦利·阿隆诺维茨（2004）编辑的对他的作品的三卷本重新评估中达到高潮，这也催生了2006年美国政治科学协会专门针对《权力精英》的小组讨论。更近期地，阿隆诺维茨（2012）出版了对“C.赖特·米尔斯和政治知识分子的塑造”的重新评估。 虽然对C.赖特·米尔斯的兴趣复苏是与波兰察斯-米利班德辩论的再次兴趣并行出现的，但人们还没有意识到这两种智力潮流实际上在C.赖特·米尔斯的《权力精英》中交汇，这本书实际上是尼科斯·波兰察斯在他最初确定“工具论”和“历史主义”为“扭曲马克思主义”的智力来源时批评的主要对象。在《政治权力与社会阶级》(1968)中，实际上是C.赖特·米尔斯成了波兰察斯方法论论战的对象，当时拉尔夫·米利班德的《资本主义社会中的国家》(1969)甚至还未出版，当波兰察斯的书的法语原版在1968年发布时。然而，同样有趣，也显然被遗忘的是，在20世纪50年代，当马克思主义者如保罗·M·斯威齐和赫伯特·阿普泰克对米尔斯提出批评时，马克思主义者和《权력精英》之间有过一次早期的遭遇，但以一种全然不同且更为建设性的结果。米尔斯与马克思主义者之间的第一次遭遇是一次热烈的交流，产生了政治理论方面的建设性进展，实际上，米利班德的《资本主义社会中的国家》至少部分是那次首次遭遇的结果。另一方面，在1970年代，波兰察斯通过将米利班德插入辩论来重演他早期对“自愿主义”和“工具论”的论战，仿佛他是米尔斯的理论孪生兄弟。在这方面，波兰察斯和结构主义马克思主义者未能认识到，像米利班德这样的英美马克思主义者，已经首先通过将他的许多实证进步纳入理论分析超越了米尔斯，其次，通过批评米尔斯缺乏政治经济学理论，因此，讽刺地，因未能将“结构”因素纳入其权力精英分析（巴罗，2007）。 权力精英与马克思主义 指出C.赖特·米尔斯在《权力精英》中的核心概念是“权力精英”，而不是“统治”或“资产阶级”这一点几乎不是什么新发现。然而，对于马克思主义者来说，米尔斯从韦伯的立场出发，认为社会由分析上独立且自主的经济、政治、社会和文化秩序组成，这一点一直是一个忧虑的来源（韦伯，1946）。米尔斯并未断言这些秩序之间存在固有的关系，而是认为任何此类的主张都是一个假设，直到通过实证社会学研究得出结论为止，以及在多大程度上可以证明。对马克思主义者的另一个关切是米尔斯的观点，认为是机构（而不是直接的阶级）通过赋予某些职位和占据这些职位的个人决策权来组织社会中的权力，权力决策权涉及如何部署该机构调动的关键资源。 例如，作为一个经济机构，现代公司赋予其董事会和执行官员决定如何分配和使用公司拥有或控制的任何经济资源的权力。同样，政府赋予特定的公共职务以权利，使用行政强制或警察力量对任何未能遵守法律的人。同样，作为文化机构，学校和大学认证特定个体在特定知识领域具有专业知识。从这个意义上讲，占据社会机构权威职位的个体控制着不同类型的权力：经济权力、政治权力和意识形态权力，是做出机构约束性决策的权力使一个人变得有权力。因此，可以认为特定个人群体具有权力，程度上他们占据控制特定社会的财富、力量、地位和知识的组织的决策职位。一个权力结构由特定社会的主要机构组织的资源的模式化分布构成（巴罗，1993, 13-16）。 因此，米尔斯声称： 权力精英由那些……处于能做出具有重大后果决定的位置的男人们组成……他们指挥着大公司。他们运营国家机器并声称其特权。他们指导军事建设。他们占据社会结构的战略指挥岗位，在那里现在集中了权力和财富以及他们享有的名望的有效手段。（米尔斯，1956, 3-4）"},{"prompt":"请将“However, Mills also emphasized that: Behind such men and behind the events of history, linking the two, are the major institutions of modern society. These hierarchies of state and corporation and army constitute the means of power; as such they are now of a consequence not before equaled in human history—and at their summits, there are now those command posts of modern society, which offer us the sociological key to an understanding of the role of the higher circles in America. (Mills, 1956, 5)3 Like many other liberals, the economist Robert Lekachman (1957, 270) was critical of The Power Elite, because he thought it contained too many “Marxist and Hobsonite echoes.” Indeed, he was not alone in wondering how Mills’ conception of a power elite controlling the means of power differed from Paul Sweezy’s (1942, 243) earlier declaration that the state is “an instrument in the hands of the ruling class for enforcing and guaranteeing the stability of the class structure itself.” However, C. Wright Mills was actually quite explicit about his perceived differences with the Marxists on two counts. First, in what is now a famous passage from The Power Elite, Mills rejected the term “ruling class” as an axiomatic statement that assumes what needs to be proven through empirical research. Mills (1956, fn. 277) claimed that: “Ruling class” is a badly loaded phrase. “Class” is an economic term; “rule” is a political one. The phrase, “ruling class” thus contains the theory that an economic class rules politically. That short-cut theory may or may not at times be true, but we do not want to carry that one rather simple theory about in the terms that we use to define our problems; we wish to state the theories explicitly, using terms of more precise and unilateral meaning. Specifically, the phrase “ruling class,” in its common political connotations, does not allow enough autonomy to the political order and its agents, and it says nothing about the military as such. It should be clear to the reader by now that we do not accept as adequate the simple view that high economic men unilaterally make all decisions of national consequences. We hold that such a simple view of “economic determinism” must be elaborated by “political determinism” and “military determinism”; that the higher agents of each of these three domains now often have a noticeable degree of autonomy; and that only in the often intricate ways of coalition do they make up and carry through the most important decisions. Those are the major reasons we prefer “power elite” to “ruling class” as a characterizing phrase for the higher circles when we consider them in terms of power. Thus, Mills argues that theoretically the economic, political, and military domains are each the source of an independent form of power, while empirically he was not convinced that the degree of cohesion and interlock among the three elites, or their subordination to economic elites, was sufficient to justify calling this power elite a ruling class, much less a ruling capitalist class. In a word, he (1956, 277) claims that “the simple Marxian view makes the big economic man the real holder of power; the simple liberal view makes the big political man the chief of the power system; and there are some who would view the warlords as virtual dictators.” Mills rejected each of these theoretical positions in defining a radical position between liberalism and Marxism. Yet, in responding directly to Lekachman’s comment, Mills (1957, 581) wrote: Let me say explicitly: I happen never to have been what is called “a Marxist,” but I believe Karl Marx is one of the most astute students of society modern civilization has produced; his work is now essential equipment of any adequately trained social scientist as well as of any properly educated person. Those who say they hear Marxian echoes in my work are saying that I have trained myself well. Second, while Mills never articulated, nor declared adherence to a particular economic theory, it is clear that he did not subscribe to Marxian economics and that, accordingly, he did not embrace its theory of surplus value and exploitation as a basis for explaining class struggle.4 In fact, Mills’ concept of power renders “the masses” powerless almost by fiat, since power is a function of occupying the command posts of the major institutions that control key resources. This is why early in his career Mills (1948) was hopeful that the “new men of power”—labor leaders at the commanding heights of large industrial unions—would become a progressive counter-elite in American society.5 However, when this expectation proved false, and the new men of power became secondary actors in the lower tier of the dominant power structure, what other sources of popular power were left in American society? In White Collar, Mills (1951, 328) had already written off the American middle classes as being “distracted from and inattentive to political concerns of any kind. They are strangers to politics. They are not radical, not liberal, not conservative, not reactionary; they are inactionary; they are out of it. If we accept the Greek’s definition of the idiot as a privatized man, then we must conclude that the U.S. citizenry is now largely composed of idiots.” Yet, paradoxically, in a chapter of The Power Elite on “Mass Society,” where Mills (1956, 300) dismisses pluralist theory “as a set of images out of a fairy tale,” he simultaneously concludes that “the Marxian doctrine of class struggle … certainly is now, closer to reality than any assumed harmony of interests.” Marxism and The Power Elite While C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite was harshly criticized by mainstream sociologists and political scientists in the United States, his book was embraced in Marxist and socialist circles primarily for strategic and political purposes. The Power Elite directly challenged the dominance of pluralist theory in sociology and political science (Truman, 1951) and it also captured the attention of the mainstream mass media, which celebrated Mills as the new l’enfant terrible of American social science. Consequently, while Marxists were critical of Mills’ work from a theoretical perspective, it was accorded a great deal of respect on the left well into the 1960s, because it opened an ideological space that allowed empirically and historically oriented Marxists to reenter a political discourse that had excluded them in the United States for at least two decades. For example, in a review in Commonweal, Michael Harrington proclaimed Mills “the most imaginative and brilliant of all the sociologists writing from American universities” (quoted in Aptheker, 1960, 9). Herbert Aptheker (1960, 9), a member of the National Committee of the U.S. Communist Party, affirmed Harrington’s sentiment as “a judgment which does not seem to me to be excessive.” Aptheker considered The Power Elite to be the magnum opus of America’s most brilliant sociologist. These views were echoed from across the Atlantic by Ralph Miliband (1962, 16), who proclaimed C. Wright Mills “the most interesting and controversial sociologist writing in the United States.” Miliband (1962, 16) praised The Power Elite as “a rich and intricate book. … There is room for debate about much of its detail. But I don’t think there is much room for serious debate about the book’s general thesis.” Paul Sweezy’s (1968, 118) review of The Power Elite in the Monthly Review (September, 1956) also exuded praise for the book with his declaration that he could not “pretend even to list all the book’s many excellencies.” Sweezy (1968, 132) concluded that “We should be grateful for such a good book.” Even though Mills was not a Marxist, Sweezy informed his readers that “Mills considers himself a socialist” and that was good enough for him (Cf. Miliband, 1964a, 77). Indeed, Sweezy (1968, 117) declaimed that “the greatest merit of The Power Elite is that it boldly breaks the tabu which respectable intellectual society has imposed on any serious discussion of how and by whom America is ruled … currently fashionable theories of the dispersal of power among many groups and interests [pluralism] have been bluntly challenged as flimsy apologetics.” In addition to breaking through the ideological mystique of pluralism, Sweezy identified three other major accomplishments of The Power Elite. First, the book was infused with “numerous flashes of insight and happy formulations” (Sweezy, 1968, 118), particularly “his damning description” of postwar intellectuals and his recognition that class consciousness is now “most apparent in the upper class,” rather than the working class. Second, Sweezy (1968, 119) praised Mills for having assembled and analyzed an impressive array of empirical data to support his main arguments, because it was his empirical research that had the potential to explode “some of the more popular and persistent myths about the rich and the powerful in America today.” Finally, and for the reasons already noted, Sweezy (1968, 119) was not the least bit concerned about Mills’ lack of Marxist terminology, but instead praised him for speaking “with the voice of an authentic American radicalism.” Sweezy (1968, 122) observed that “Mills’ theory is open to serious criticism. But he has the very great merit of bringing the real issues into the open and discussing them in a way that anyone can understand.” However, Sweezy’s admiration for The Power Elite was not without qualification. He criticized Mills on two points that became standard markers in defining Marxists’ relationship to Mills and their distance from him. First, Sweezy chided Mills (1968, 121) for not framing his discussion of the power elite’s higher immorality “in a context of exploitation, an indictment which Mills conspicuously fails to elaborate in any thorough or systematic way.” By viewing the corporate rich merely as decision makers occupying the command posts of corporations, Mills described their higher immorality as if it were the personal failing of corrupt and incompetent individuals, rather than a characteristic to be explained as part of the capitalist economic system. Without a theory of capitalist development, Sweezy (1968, 131) was concerned that Mills “goes much too far in the direction of what I may call ‘historical voluntarism’.” However, unlike Poulantzas a generation later, Sweezy does not offer up a rigid structuralism, but suggests that “What Mills could and should have argued in this connection is that the roles [of the power elite] are not like those of a theatrical performance, completely mapped out and rigidly determined in advance. The actors have a range of choice which is set by the nature and laws of the social structure under which they live.”6”翻译为中文","completion":"然而，米尔斯也强调： 在这些男人背后，以及在历史事件的背后，连接二者的是现代社会的主要机构。这些国家、公司和军队的等级制度构成了权力的手段；作为这样的手段，它们现在的后果在人类历史上是前所未有的——在它们的顶端，现在有着现代社会的那些指挥岗位，这为我们理解高层圈子在美国的角色提供了社会学上的钥匙。（米尔斯，1956, 5） 像许多其他自由主义者一样，经济学家罗伯特·莱卡奇曼（1957, 270）对《权力精英》持批评态度，因为他认为它包含了太多“马克思主义和霍布森式的回声”。事实上，他并不是唯一一个对米尔斯关于权力精英控制权力手段的概念与保罗·斯威齐（1942, 243）早期声明国家是“统治阶级手中的工具，用于强制和保证阶级结构本身的稳定”有何不同感到疑惑的人。然而，C.赖特·米尔斯实际上对他与马克思主义者的看法差异在两个方面非常明确。 首先，在《权力精英》中一个现在广为人知的段落中，米尔斯拒绝了“统治阶级”这一术语，因为它假设了需要通过实证研究证明的东西。米尔斯（1956, 脚注277）声称： “统治阶级”是一个严重负担的短语。“阶级”是一个经济术语；“统治”是一个政治术语。因此，“统治阶级”这一短语含有经济阶级在政治上统治的理论。这一简化理论有时可能是真的，也可能不是，但我们不想在用以定义我们问题的术语中携带着这一相当简单的理论；我们希望明确地陈述理论，使用含义更精确且单一的术语。具体来说，“统治阶级”这一短语，在其常见的政治含义中，没有给政治秩序及其代理人留足足够的自主权，它对军队本身也毫无说明。读者现在应该清楚，我们不接受高层经济人单方面做出国家重大决策的简单观点为充分。我们认为，这种关于“经济决定论”的简单观点必须通过“政治决定论”和“军事决定论”来加以阐述；这三个领域的高层代理人现在通常有相当程度的自主权；并且只有通过联盟的通常复杂的方式，他们才形成并执行最重要的决策。这些是我们更喜欢使用“权力精英”而不是“统治阶级”作为描述高层圈子的特征短语时考虑到的权力方面的主要原因。 因此，米尔斯认为，理论上经济、政治和军事领域各自是一种独立的权力来源，而从经验上看，他不相信这三个精英之间的凝聚力和相互锁定程度，或它们对经济精英的从属程度足以将这个权力精英称之为统治阶级，更不用说是一个统治资本家阶级了。一言以蔽之，他（1956, 277）声称：“简单的马克思主义观点使大经济人成为实际的权力持有者；简单的自由主义观点使大政治人成为权力系统的首脑；也有一些人会将军阀视为虚拟的独裁者。”米尔斯在定义一个介于自由主义和马克思主义之间的激进立场时，拒绝了这些理论立场。然而，在直接回应莱卡奇曼的评论时，米尔斯（1957, 581）写道： 让我明确地说：我从未被称为“马克思主义者”，但我相信卡尔·马克思是现代文明产生的最敏锐的社会学家之一；他的工作现在是任何受过充分训练的社会科学家以及任何受过适当教育的人的基本装备。那些说他们在我的作品中听到马克思主义回声的人是在说我训练得很好。 第二，尽管米尔斯从未明确阐述或宣称遵循特定的经济理论，但很明显他并不订阅马克思经济学，因此，他也没有接受其剩余价值和剥削理论作为解释阶级斗争的基础。实际上，米尔斯对权力的概念几乎是命令性地使“大众”无力，因为权力是占据控制关键资源的主要机构指挥岗位的功能。这就是为什么在他职业生涯早期，米尔斯（1948）曾希望“新的权力人物”——在大型工业工会的指挥高地上的工会领袖——会成为美国社会中的一个进步反精英。然而，当这一期望被证明是错误的，新的权力人物成为主导权力结构底层的次要角色时，美国社会中还有哪些其他的普遍权力源泉呢？在《白领》中，米尔斯（1951, 328）已经将美国中产阶级定义为“对任何种类的政治关切都分心且不关心。他们是政治的陌生人。他们不是激进的，不是自由主义的，不是保守的，不是反动的；他们是无行动的；他们被排除在外。如果我们接受希腊人对于白痴作为一种私人化的人的定义，那么我们必须得出结论，美国公民现在大部分是由白痴组成的。”然而，矛盾的是，在《权力精英》关于“大众社会”的章节中，米尔斯（1956, 300）驳斥了多元主义理论“就像童话故事中的一组图像”，他同时得出结论，“马克思主义的阶级斗争学说……现在，比任何假定的利益和谐更接近于现实。”"},{"prompt":"请将“Marxism and The Power Elite While C.

But he has the very great merit of bringing the real issues into the open and discussing them in a way that anyone can understand.” However, Sweezy’s admiration for The Power Elite was not without qualification. He criticized Mills on two points that became standard markers in defining Marxists’ relationship to Mills and their distance from him. First, Sweezy chided Mills (1968, 121) for not framing his discussion of the power elite’s higher immorality “in a context of exploitation, an indictment which Mills conspicuously fails to elaborate in any thorough or systematic way.” By viewing the corporate rich merely as decision makers occupying the command posts of corporations, Mills described their higher immorality as if it were the personal failing of corrupt and incompetent individuals, rather than a characteristic to be explained as part of the capitalist economic system. Without a theory of capitalist development, Sweezy (1968, 131) was concerned that Mills “goes much too far in the direction of what I may call ‘historical voluntarism’.” However, unlike Poulantzas a generation later, Sweezy does not offer up a rigid structuralism, but suggests that “What Mills could and should have argued in this connection is that the roles [of the power elite] are not like those of a theatrical performance, completely mapped out and rigidly determined in advance. The actors have a range of choice which is set by the nature and laws of the social structure under which they live.”6 Whether Marxist or otherwise, Sweezy argued that Mills needed a theory of exploitation to explain the power elites’ behavior and its relation to the masses. Sweezy (1968, 121) mused that “Mills’ weaknesses in this connection are characteristically American,” but for this same reason he identified this problem as instructive on “the possibility and requirements of an effective American radical propaganda.” Sweezy’s main argument was that Mills’ book could just as easily be read in the same way that individuals follow celebrity gossip and the lifestyles of the rich and famous in various mass media. A mere statement of the facts would not spark outrage, much less political action. Americans are not shocked by the mere existence of spectacular wealth. They are not surprised by the excesses of celebrities or by the corruption of the powerful. In fact, they may well be entertained by it, or encouraged to buy an extra lottery ticket, on the faint hope that they too will become a Megamillions or Powerball winner, which is after all the epitome of modern day finance capitalism (Strange, 1986). Despite his impressive research, Sweezy did not believe that any of the facts revealed by Mills would speak for themselves, because they only find their meaning in the theoretical discovery that all this spectacle, excess, and corruption comes at that their expense; in other words, in a theory of exploitation that explains the spectacle of the higher immorality as a relation of exploitation between the very rich and the working masses. Thus, Sweezy (1968, 121) argued that mere denunciations of wealth will “fall on deaf ears” with the American public unless the accumulation and possession of great wealth is linked to a process of exploitation that can be replaced by alternative economic arrangements that have “more of it [i.e., wealth] to offer the great majority of them [i.e., the public] than has the present system of waste and plunder.” The purpose of Sweezy’s criticism was not to denounce Mills for not being a Marxist, nor to devalue his intellectual contribution, but to suggest a way to move his analysis a step forward theoretically and in a way that would further enhance its value as an ideology critique. It was fine with Sweezy if Mills did not embrace Marxian economics, but the problem was that Mills did not offer a theoretical alternative.7 Mills rejected Marxian economics, neo-classical economics, Keynesian economics, and institutional economics, but he never identified an alternative political economy in which to situate his sociological and cultural critique of the power elite. Sweezy offered a second observation about The Power Elite that quickly became the single most common theoretical criticism by critics of all persuasions. Sweezy developed an immanent critique of The Power Elite based on Mills’ own empirical findings. He argued that Mills’ hypothesis regarding the autonomy of the three domains of power had actually occluded his ability to see the facts as Mills presented them throughout his book. Sweezy (1968, 124) argues that Mills: adduces a wealth of material on our class system, showing how the local units of the upper class are made up of propertied families and how these local units are welded together into a wholly self-conscious national class. He shows the “power elite” is overwhelmingly (and increasingly) recruited from the upper levels of the class system, how the same families contribute indifferently to the economic, military, and political “elites,” and how the same individuals move easily and almost imperceptibly back and forth from one to another of these “elites.” When it comes to “The Political Directorate” (chapter 10), he demonstrates that the notion of a specifically political elite is in reality a myth, that the crucial positions in government and politics are increasingly held by what he calls “political outsiders,” and that these outsiders are in fact members or errand boys of the corporate rich. Sweezy (1968, 125) goes on to argue that “on his own showing the ‘political directorate’ is largely an appendage of the corporate rich,” and even with respect to the alleged ascendancy of the warlords, he notes that: the military has swelled enormously in size and power, but it is precisely then that it has ceased to be a separate domain. The civilian higher circles have moved into commanding military positions, and the top brass has been accepted into the higher circles. What happens in such times is that the “power elite” becomes militarized in the sense that it has to concern itself with military problems, it requires military skills, and it must inculcate in the underlying population greater respect for military virtues and personnel.”翻译为中文","completion":"马克思主义与《权力精英》 尽管C.赖特·米尔斯的《权力精英》在美国受到主流社会学家和政治学家的严厉批评，但他的书籍在马克思主义和社会主义圈子里主要出于战略和政治目的而受到欢迎。《权力精英》直接挑战了社会学和政治科学中多元主义理论的主导地位（Truman, 1951），同时也吸引了主流大众媒体的注意，他们将米尔斯誉为美国社会科学的新“可怕孩子”。因此，虽然马克思主义者从理论角度批评米尔斯的工作，但直到1960年代，他的工作在左翼界仍受到极大尊重，因为它开辟了一个意识形态空间，让以实证和历史为导向的马克思主义者得以重新进入在美国至少两十年来排除他们的政治话语中。 例如，在《Commonweal》的一篇评论中，迈克尔·哈灵顿宣称米尔斯是“所有来自美国大学撰写的社会学家中最富有想象力和最杰出的”(引用自Aptheker, 1960, 9)。美国共产党的全国委员会成员赫伯特·阿普泽克（Aptheker, 1960, 9）认同哈灵顿的观点，并称之为“一个我认为并不过分的判断”。阿普泽克认为《权力精英》是美国最杰出的社会学家的杰作。拉尔夫·米利班德（1962, 16）从大西洋彼岸回响这一观点，他宣布C.赖特·米尔斯是“美国写作中最有趣和最具争议的社会学家。”米利班德（1962, 16）称赞《权力精英》是“一本丰富而复杂的书……其细节有很多讨论空间。但我认为对这本书的总体论点进行严肃辩论的空间不多。” 保罗·斯威齐（1968, 118）在《月刊评论》（1956年9月）对《权力精英》的评论也对这本书给予了高度赞扬，他宣称自己甚至不能“假装列出该书的所有优点。”斯威齐（1968, 132）总结说，“我们应该感激这样一本好书。” 尽管米尔斯不是马克思主义者，斯威齐告诉读者“米尔斯认为自己是社会主义者”而这对他来说已足够（参见Miliband, 1964a, 77）。实际上，斯威齐（1968, 117）声称“《权力精英》的最大优点是，它大胆打破了尊敬的知识界对任何严肃讨论如何以及由谁统治美国的禁忌……目前流行的权力在许多团体和利益之间分散的理论[多元主义]被直截了当地质疑为脆弱的辩解。” 除了打破多元主义的意识形态神秘主义，斯威齐识别出《权力精英》的另外三个主要成就。首先，这本书充满了“众多的洞察力和愉快的表达”（斯威齐，1968, 118），特别是“他对战后知识分子的痛苦描述”以及他认识到阶级意识现在“在上层阶级中最为明显”，而不是在工人阶级中。其次，斯威齐（1968, 119）称赞米尔斯汇编和分析了一系列令人印象深刻的实证数据来支持他的主要论点，因为正是他的实证研究有可能破除“当今美国关于富人和有权势者的一些更流行和持久的神话。” 最后，正如前面已经提到的，斯威齐（1968, 119）对米尔斯缺乏马克思主义术语一点也不担心，反而赞扬他“以真正的美国激进主义者的声音”发言。斯威齐（1968, 122）观察到：“米尔斯的理论面临严峻批评。但他有非常大的优点，即把真正的问题公之于众，并以任何人都能理解的方式讨论它们。” 然而，斯威齐对《权力精英》的赞赏并非毫无保留。他在两点上批评米尔斯，这两点成为定义马克思主义者与米尔斯的关系及他们之间距离的标准标记。首先，斯威齐（1968, 121）批评米尔斯没有在剥削的背景下讨论权力精英的高级不道德行为，“这是米尔斯明显未能以任何彻底或系统的方式详细阐述的指控。”通过将企业富豪仅视为占据公司指挥岗位的决策者，米尔斯描述他们的高级不道德行为似乎是腐败和无能个人的个人失败，而不是作为资本主义经济系统的一部分来解释的特征。没有资本主义发展理论，斯威齐（1968, 131）担心米尔斯“在我所说的‘历史自由意志主义’方向上走得太远。”然而，与一代人后的波兰察斯不同，斯威齐没有提出一种僵化的结构主义，而是建议“米尔斯在这方面本可以并且本应该争辩说，[权力精英的]角色并不像戏剧表演中的角色，完全预先规划并严格确定。演员们有一定选择范围，由他们生活的社会结构的性质和法律设定。” 无论是不是马克思主义者，斯威齐认为米尔斯需要一个剥削理论来解释权力精英的行为及其与大众的关系。斯威齐（1968, 121）沉思道，“米尔斯在这方面的弱点是典型的美国特征”，但因为同样的原因，他认为这个问题对“有效的美国激进宣传的可能性和要求”具有启示性。斯威齐的主要论点是，米尔斯的书很容易以同样的方式被阅读，就像个人在各种大众媒体中追踪名人八卦和富人名流的生活方式一样。单纯陈述事实不会激发愤怒，更不用说政治行动了。美国人对壮观财富的单纯存在并不感到震惊。他们对名人的过度行为或有权势者的腐败并不感到惊讶。实际上，他们可能会被它娱乐，或鼓励他们购买额外的彩票，怀着微弱的希望他们也会成为百万富翁或权力球赢家，毕竟这是现代金融资本主义的典范（Strange, 1986）。尽管斯威齐的研究令人印象深刻，但他不相信米尔斯揭示的任何事实本身就足以说明问题，因为它们只有在理论上发现所有这些壮观、过度和腐败是以他们的代价为代价时才有意义；换句话说，通过一个解释高级不道德行为壮观秀为非常富有者和工人大众之间剥削关系的剥削理论。 因此，斯威齐（1968, 121）认为，单纯地谴责财富会“对美国公众充耳不闻”，除非财富的积累和拥有与一个可以被替代的经济安排过程联系起来，这个过程对于他们中的大多数人[即公众]比现有的浪费和掠夺系统“提供更多的[即财富]”。斯威齐批评的目的不是为了谴责米尔斯不是马克思主义者，也不是为了贬低他的智力贡献，而是为了建议从理论上推进他的分析，并以一种能进一步增强其作为意识形态批判价值的方式。对斯威齐来说，如果米尔斯不接受马克思经济学也无所谓，但问题在于米尔斯没有提供一个理论上的替代。米尔斯拒绝了马克思经济学、新古典经济学、凯恩斯经济学和制度经济学，但他从未确定一个替代的政治经济学，以此为基础来定位他对权力精英的社会学和文化批判。 斯威齐对《权力精英》提出了第二个观察，很快成为所有批评者最常见的理论批评。斯威齐基于米尔斯自己的实证发现，对《权力精英》进行了内在批判。他认为米尔斯关于三个权力领域自治的假设实际上遮蔽了他看到米尔斯在整本书中呈现的事实的能力。斯威齐（1968, 124）认为米尔斯： 提供了大量关于我们的阶级体系的材料，展示了上层阶级的地方单位是如何由拥有财产的家庭组成，以及这些地方单位是如何被整合成一个完全自我意识的全国阶级。他展示了“权力精英”绝大多数（而且越来越多地）从阶级体系的上层水平中招募而来，同一家庭无差别地为经济、军事和政治“精英”贡献，以及同一些个人如何轻易地几乎不易察觉地在这些“精英”中来回转换。当谈到“政治指导阶层”（第10章）时，他证明了特定政治精英的概念实际上是一个神话，政府和政治中的关键职位越来越多地由他称之为“政治局外人”担任，而这些局外人实际上是企业富豪或其跑腿的成员。 斯威齐（1968, 125）继续认为，根据他自己的论证，“政治指导阶层”在很大程度上是企业富豪的附属物，甚至对于所谓的战争领主的优势地位，他指出： 军队在规模和权力上极大膨胀，但正是在那时，它不再是一个独立领域。文职高层圈子已进入军事指挥职位，高级军官已被接纳进高层圈子。在这样的时代，发生的是“权力精英”在必须关注军事问题、需要军事技能，并且必须在基层民众中培养对军事美德和人员更大尊重意义上的军事化。"},{"prompt":"请将“Thus, Sweezy (1968, 129) concludes that “the facts simply won’t fit Mills’ theory of three (or two) sectional elites coming together to form an overall power elite. What we have in the United States is a ruling class with its roots deeply sunk in the ‘apparatus of appropriation’ which is the corporate system.” Consequently, Sweezy (1968, 127) points out that even though Mills’ analysis was “strongly influenced by a straightforward class theory,” he did not consistently explore the implications of his empirical findings, which would have taken him closer to a Marxian position (Cf. Balbus, 1971). Similarly, Tom Bottomore was another of the many critics who claimed that Mills’ own research findings revealed that most members of the power elite were in fact drawn from a socially recognized upper class. Bottomore (1966, 33–34) observes that Mills starts with the hypothesis that he will leave open the question of whether the power elite represents a class that rules through the elites, but when he returns to this theoretical problem late in the book, “it is only to reject the Marxist idea of a ruling class. … In short, the question is never seriously discussed, and this is a curious failing.”8 Robert Lynd (1968, 107) identifies Mills’ failure to engage this discussion as “the colossal loose-end of The Power Elite.” Lynd was not alone in his assessment for it is a criticism that reappears again and again in reviews of the book by scholars of every ideological persuasion.9 Herbert Aptheker draws out a number of additional issues stemming from Mills not having a theory of capitalist development and he illustrates how this lacuna limited Mills’ ability to conceptualize both the power elite and subaltern classes. Aptheker reiterates all of Sweezy’s arguments in his analysis of The Power Elite, but he goes further than Sweezy in criticizing the limitations of Mills’ analysis. Although Aptheker (1960, 34) chastised Mills for not including Lenin among the authors that every educated person should read, his substantive point was that Mills’ conception of the economic elite as an amalgam of the “very rich” and the “corporate rich” failed to capture the emerging role of finance capital and financial groups as the emerging vanguard of the capitalist class. The “economic elite” was more than an aggregation of rich families and corporate executives, but was itself structured internally by developments in the capitalist economy.10 Aptheker (1960, 20) chided Mills not just for failing to interpret his empirical findings correctly, but for ignoring “the central depository of power—the financial overlords.” Mills was unable to recognize finance capitalists as the overlords of the power elite, precisely because his analysis was not structured by any concept of political economy. He saw corporations, but not capitalism; corporate elites, but not a capitalist class. Not surprisingly, Aptheker’s critique was theoretically grounded in Lenin’s Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism and, indirectly, in Rudolf Hilferding’s Finance Capital: The Latest Stage of Capitalism. Thus, Aptheker (1960, 35) attributed Mills’ theoretical blind spot to his “neglect of Lenin,” but he also took Mills to task for failing to even acknowledge the significant work of contemporary Marxist scholars, such as Victor Perlo (1950) and Paul Sweezy (1953, Chaps. 9, 12), who had published empirical research on American imperialism and the American ruling class, respectively. However, even putting this ideological quibble aside, Aptheker was amazed that Mills could have missed an already substantial body of empirical literature on financial groups and monopoly capital that owed nothing to Marxism. As early as 1939, the National Resources Committee had published The Structure of the American Economy (Means, 1939), which used a rigorous power structure methodology to document that the U.S. economy was dominated by eight major “financial groups” (three national and five regional). This government report was based partly on research conducted by Paul Sweezy (1953, Chap. 12), which identified a network of financial groups that each consisted of several large industrial corporations under common control with the locus of power usually being an investment or commercial bank or a great family fortune (Cf. Baran and Sweezy, 1966, 17).11 The internal structure of each financial group was dominated by one or more financial institutions, which sat atop each group and organized it through interlocking directors, loans, bond and securities underwriting, lines of credit, and so on. (Barrow, 1993, 18–21; Mintz and Schwarz, 1985). This idea was picked up again in 1941 and received a great deal of publicity during the highly publicized hearings of the Temporary National Economic Committee.12 Moreover, even during the time that Mills was conducting research for The Power Elite, the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary released a highly publicized Study of Monopoly Power (1951–1952) and two reports on Bank Mergers and Concentration of Banking Facilities (1952, 1955).13 Aptheker’s point was that the concept of “finance capital” as an organizing principle of the capitalist economy was by no means inherently “Marxist” and that Mills had other more populist or even empirical paths to that concept. However, according to Aptheker (1960, 34), Mills was simply blind to the “intensification of the domination of the sinews of capitalism by the banking collosi and to the mounting merger movement among the banks themselves.” Hence, Mills had missed a key factor of class cohesion within the economic elite. In contrast, Aptheker (1960, 35) argues that finance capital “is the apex of power today in the United States, and its absence from Mills’ Power Elite seriously hurts the book’s validity from the viewpoint of sheer description as well as basic definition” (Cf., Zeitlin, 1977, Chaps. 1–5; 1980, Chaps. 2–4). For Aptheker, there were several additional problems that emanated from this theoretical and empirical lacuna. The orthodox Marxist-Leninist analysis saw finance capital as the engine of a new “epoch of imperialism” (Perlo, 1957), which was defined primarily by the internationalization of American capital (Aptheker, 1960, 36). In other words, the power elite was no longer simply an “American” power elite, but one with interests, connections, and structural limitations related to its export of capital. Aptheker contends that Mills’ failure to analyze the economic underpinnings of imperial expansion seriously weakened his ability to understand the “military ascendancy” of the warlords or to grasp the structural and institutional basis of the power elite’s foreign policy. Instead, Mills tended to present the power elite’s new foreign adventures as a cynical form of Beardian “diversion” to entertain and distract the masses, rather than part of the process of capitalist development (see Barrow, 1997). Whether one shared a Marxist viewpoint or not, the importance of this theoretical linkage was that it allowed Aptheker to elaborate the political, as opposed to the methodological, significance of Sweezy’s complaint about Mills’ “historical voluntarism.” Aptheker (1960, 19) also chastised Mills for depicting “the power elite as, in fact, and despite some qualification, all-powerful” and thus depicting the masses of people as generally powerless. Aptheker was concerned that Mills had constructed an exaggerated image of the power elite’s omnipotence, precisely because he does not incorporate “class” and “class conflict” into his theoretical apparatus. In some ways, Mills reproduces the power elite’s own worst delusions about the magnitude of its power, while simultaneously undercutting those delusions with satirical observations about its incompetence and mediocrity. However, Aptheker does not merely offer up the concept of “class conflict” as an ideological epithet for dismissing Mills. He elaborates how an empirical and historical analysis of class conflict would have allowed Mills to see the limitations and contradictions of power in the higher circles. Aptheker (1960, 24–25) argues that: between the will of that elite and its capabilities of implementing that will stands public opinion, including American public opinion. This public opinion is not simply shaped by the elite, and this public opinion does affect what the elite tries to do and what it does and how it does what it does. Moreover, in whole areas of life—as in wages and working conditions, housing and education, the battle against Jim Crow and against war—the desires and power of the masses do exert great influence, manifested in buses that stop running and in atomic bombs that, though loaded aboard planes that are alerted to take off, never are dropped in war. Aptheker was theoretically more attuned to the subterranean movements within American society that at the time were invisible to Mills. Even in 1956, there was a small anti-nuclear movement and a peace movement. There was a burgeoning civil rights movement that was expanding into a poor peoples’ movement. There were still progressives, and even socialists and communists, in American trade unions. In sum, it was Aptheker’s (1960, 20) contention that Mills had overstated the success of “the elite’s effort to make all Americans morally as corrupt as the elite themselves.” There were poor people, African-Americans, and ordinary middle-class Americans who struggled day-to-day to make a living and who did not share the power elite’s war-mongering ways or its self-absorption with conspicuous consumption. In this sense, Mills’ conception of a power elite dominating “the masses” obscured the fact that there were not just very rich people in America, but poor and very poor people in America (Aptheker, 1960, 12). It was not enough to challenge Louis Hartz’s (1955) America as a middle-class thesis by demonstrating the existence of “the very rich,” because this critique still ignored the fact that the United States had an underclass of the poor and very poor and that much of this underclass was racialized and gendered (Harrington, 1962).”翻译为中文","completion":"因此，斯威齐（1968, 129）得出结论：“事实根本无法符合米尔斯关于三个（或两个）部门精英汇聚形成一个整体权力精英的理论。我们在美国实际上拥有的是一个根植于‘占有机制’—即企业系统的统治阶级。”因此，斯威齐（1968, 127）指出，尽管米尔斯的分析“受到了直接阶级理论的强烈影响”，但他并未一贯探索其实证发现的含义，这本可以使他更接近马克思主义立场（参见Balbus, 1971）。 类似地，汤姆·博托莫尔是众多批评者之一，他们声称米尔斯自己的研究发现揭示了大多数权力精英成员实际上来自社会公认的上层阶级。博托莫尔（1966, 33-34）观察到米尔斯以一个假设开始，即他将保留权力精英是否代表通过精英统治的阶级这一问题的答案开放，但当他在书的后期回到这个理论问题时，“只是拒绝了马克思关于统治阶级的观点......简而言之，这个问题从未被严肃讨论，这是一个奇怪的缺陷。”罗伯特·林德（1968, 107）认为米尔斯未能参与这一讨论是《权力精英》中“巨大的遗漏”。林德并不是唯一做出这种评估的人，因为这是一种在每种意识形态观点的学者对该书的评价中反复出现的批评。 赫伯特·阿普泽克提出了一些额外的问题，这些问题源于米尔斯没有资本主义发展理论，他展示了这个空白限制了米尔斯概念化权力精英和次级阶层的能力。阿普泽克在对《权力精英》的分析中重申了斯威齐的所有论点，但他在批评米尔斯的分析限制方面比斯威齐走得更远。尽管阿普泽克（1960, 34）斥责米尔斯未将列宁列入每个受过教育的人应该阅读的作者之中，他的实质性观点是米尔斯将经济精英视为“非常富有”的和“企业富有”的混合体，未能捕捉到作为资本家阶级前卫的金融资本和金融集团的新兴角色。“经济精英”不仅仅是富裕家庭和公司高管的聚集，而是由资本主义经济发展内部构建的。 阿普泽克（1960, 20）批评米尔斯不仅是因为他未能正确解释他的实证发现，而且因为他忽视了“权力的中心存储库——金融霸主。”正是因为米尔斯的分析没有被任何政治经济学概念构架，他无法认出金融资本家是权力精英的霸主。他看到了企业却看不到资本主义；看到了企业精英却看不到资本家阶级。毫不奇怪，阿普泽克的批评理论上基于列宁的《帝国主义：资本主义的最高阶段》和间接地基于鲁道夫·希尔费丁的《金融资本：资本主义的最新阶段》。因此，阿普泽克（1960, 35）将米尔斯的理论盲点归咎于他“忽视了列宁”，但他还因米尔斯未能承认像维克多·佩尔洛（1950）和保罗·斯威齐（1953，第9、12章）这样的当代马克思主义学者的重要工作而批评米尔斯，他们分别发表了关于美国帝国主义和美国统治阶级的实证研究。 然而，即便将这种意识形态上的小瑕疵搁置一旁，阿普泽克对米尔斯竟然错过了一个已经相当丰富的关于金融集团和垄断资本的实证文献而感到惊讶，这些文献与马克思主义无关。早在1939年，国家资源委员会就发布了《美国经济结构》（Means, 1939），该报告使用严格的权力结构方法论，记录了美国经济被八个主要的“金融集团”（三个全国性和五个地区性）所主导。这份政府报告部分基于保罗·斯威齐（1953, 第12章）进行的研究，该研究识别了一个金融集团网络，每个集团由几个大型工业公司在共同控制下组成，权力中心通常是投资或商业银行或一个大家族财富。每个金融集团的内部结构由一个或多个金融机构主导，这些机构通过交叉董事、贷款、债券和证券承销、信贷额度等坐在每个集团的顶端并组织它。（Barrow, 1993, 18-21; Mintz和Schwarz, 1985）。这一观点在1941年再次被提出，并在备受瞩目的临时全国经济委员会听证会期间获得了大量宣传。此外，甚至在米尔斯为《权力精英》进行研究的时候，美国众议院司法委员会发布了备受关注的《垄断权力研究》（1951-1952）和两份关于银行合并和银行设施集中的报告（1952, 1955）。"},{"prompt":"请将“Aptheker’s point was that the concept of “finance capital” as an organizing principle of the capitalist economy was by no means inherently “Marxist” and that Mills had other more populist or even empirical paths to that concept.

This public opinion is not simply shaped by the elite, and this public opinion does affect what the elite tries to do and what it does and how it does what it does.

In this sense, Mills’ conception of a power elite dominating “the masses” obscured the fact that there were not just very rich people in America, but poor and very poor people in America (Aptheker, 1960, 12). It was not enough to challenge Louis Hartz’s (1955) America as a middle-class thesis by demonstrating the existence of “the very rich,” because this critique still ignored the fact that the United States had an underclass of the poor and very poor and that much of this underclass was racialized and gendered (Harrington, 1962). Moreover, Aptheker’s theoretical lens also made him far more attentive to the liberation struggles in what was then called the “Third World.” Here, too, Aptheker (1960, 27) argues that Mills’ inability to recognize the significance of the internationalization of capital as the economic basis of American foreign policy meant that Mills could not see that American public opinion was important, but also that world public opinion, splits among the imperialist partners, and divisions in the opinions of the American elite were also potent forces in constraining the power elite. These factors had all played a role in staying the hand of Mills’ “Military Ascendancy.” In sum, the main point for Aptheker (1960, 29) was “that the elite are by no means omnipotent, and the masses of people in our country are neither powerless nor apathetic.” Finally, Aptheker suggests that the absence of a theory of capitalist development in Mills’ work generates an additional blind spot concerning the role of the U.S. South in American political and economic development. Aptheker’s contention was that race and neo-conservatism had a deeper basis in historical class development than Mills recognized in his analysis of the 1950s “conservative mood.” Aptheker (1960, 11) suggests that Mills would have arrived at different conclusions had he recognized that “there was a relative, not absolute, absence of feudal forms and institutions here—they were, for example, important in upstate New York and in Maryland—and that there was a prefeudal form in our history, chattel slavery, which played a decisive role in American development through the Civil War, just as some of its survivals exert so decisive an influence upon present-day American life.” This was not just a historical quibble, but an omission with profound theoretical implications. First, this lacuna in Mills’ analysis creates a blind spot to the question of race in America. Aptheker (1960, 11–12) laments “Mills’ consistent ignoring of the Negro question in all his writings.” Hence, he misses what was already becoming an important structural base for progressive political action in the United States. Second, this lacuna also leads Mills to ignore the structural basis of traditional conservatism in America—strongly located in the South, but extended more generally throughout the rural and suburban hinterlands of white America. Aptheker observes presciently that what Mills dismissed as a short-term “conservative mood” actually had a deep historical basis in the American social structure—one that was tied historically to race and region—and that would not abate with a changing political mood. Thus, while Mills states that “there can be no conservative ideology of the classic type” in America, Aptheker (1960, 16) identifies this claim as a significant error “stemming from Mills’ complete ignoring of Southern life and history and the realities of a kind of industrial feudalism in U.S. development.” Indeed, this is a serious omission for a sociologist of knowledge so deeply influenced by Karl Mannheim. Finally, Aptheker (1960, 14 fn.) criticizes Mills generally for failing to cite “American Marxist writers, though their work anticipates and expands much of his own.” Despite Mills’ “bare and very brief allusions” to Marx and Marxism in The Power Elite, Aptheker (1960, 15) was hopeful that “perhaps in a future work Mills will yet face up fully to the challenge of Marxism by testing its propositions against American reality as he sees it today.” In this respect, a significant feature of Aptheker’s critique is a genuine effort to engage Mills theoretically based on a discussion of empirical and historical facts—whether by reinterpretation or omission—rather than through conceptual one-upmanship based on ideological prescriptions or party doctrine. One simply does not find the types of ideological epithets—“distorted Marxism,” “semi-Marxism,” or “would-be Marxism”—that became so common in the Poulantzas-Miliband debate and its aftermath in the 1970s. Sweezy’s and Aptheker’s criticisms are meant to build on and extend Mills’ work, rather than dismiss it as part of some sterile abstract jargon-laded polemic. ”翻译为中文","completion":"阿普泽克认为，“金融资本”作为资本主义经济的组织原则的概念绝不是固有的“马克思主义”，而且米尔斯对该概念有着更多民粹主义甚至是实证主义的途径。然而，根据阿普泽克（1960, 34）的说法，米尔斯对“银行巨头加剧对资本主义要害的控制以及银行本身之间不断增加的合并运动”完全视而不见。因此，米尔斯错过了经济精英内部阶级凝聚的一个关键因素。相比之下，阿普泽克（1960, 35）认为，金融资本“是当今美国权力的顶峰，其在米尔斯的《权力精英》中的缺席，严重损害了该书从纯粹描述和基本定义的角度的有效性”（参考Zeitlin, 1977, 第1-5章；1980, 第2-4章）。 对于阿普泽克来说，这一理论和实证的空白产生了几个额外的问题。正统的马克思列宁主义分析将金融资本视为新的“帝国主义时代”的引擎（Perlo, 1957），这主要是由美国资本的国际化所定义。换句话说，权力精英不再仅仅是一个“美国”的权力精英，而是一个与其资本输出有关的利益、联系和结构限制的精英。阿普泽克认为，米尔斯未能分析帝国主义扩张的经济基础，严重削弱了他理解战争领主的“军事上升”或把握权力精英外交政策的结构和制度基础的能力。相反，米尔斯倾向于将权力精英的新外国冒险呈现为一种讽刺的比尔德式“转移”，以娱乐和分散大众的注意力，而不是资本主义发展过程的一部分（参见Barrow, 1997）。无论是否持有马克思主义观点，这一理论联系的重要性在于，它使阿普泽克能够阐述斯威齐对米尔斯“历史自由意志主义”抱怨的政治意义，而非方法论意义。 阿普泽克（1960, 19）还批评米尔斯将“权力精英描述为事实上，并且尽管有一些限制，却是全能的”，因此将普通民众描述为普遍无力的。阿普泽克担心，米尔斯因为没有将“阶级”和“阶级冲突”纳入他的理论框架，而构建了权力精英全能的夸张形象。在某些方面，米尔斯复制了权力精英对其权力程度的最糟糕错觉，同时又通过讽刺性的观察来削弱这些错觉，这些观察涉及其无能和平庸。然而，阿普泽克并非仅将“阶级冲突”概念作为驳斥米尔斯的意识形态标签。他详细说明，如何通过对阶级冲突的实证和历史分析，让米尔斯看到高层圈子中权力的限制和矛盾。 阿普泽克（1960, 24-25）认为： 在那个精英的意愿与其实现那意愿的能力之间，站着包括美国公众舆论在内的公众舆论。这种公众舆论并非简单地由精英塑造，而且这种公众舆论确实影响了精英试图做什么、他们做了什么以及他们如何做他们所做的事情。此外，在生活的整个领域中——如工资和工作条件、住房和教育、反对吉姆·克劳法和反战——大众的愿望和力量确实产生了巨大影响，这体现在停运的公交车和虽然装载在准备起飞的飞机上却在战争中从未投下的原子弹上。 阿普泽克在理论上更加关注于当时对米尔斯来说不可见的美国社会中的地下运动。即使在1956年，就已经有了一个小型的反核运动和和平运动。民权运动正在蓬勃发展成为一个穷人运动。在美国工会中仍有进步人士，甚至社会主义者和共产主义者。总之，阿普泽克（1960, 20）的观点是，米尔斯夸大了“精英努力使所有美国人道德上像精英本身一样腐败”的成功。有贫困人口、非裔美国人和普通的中产阶级美国人，他们每天为生计而奋斗，他们不分享权力精英的好战方式或其对显眼消费的自我吸收。从这个意义上讲，米尔斯对权力精英主导“大众”的概念，掩盖了美国不仅仅有非常富有的人，还有穷人和非常穷的人的事实（阿普泽克，1960, 12）。将路易斯·哈茨（1955）的美国是一个中产阶级论文挑战，并证明“非常富有”的存在是不够的，因为这一批判仍然忽略了美国有一个穷人和非常穷的底层阶级这一事实，而这个底层阶级在很大程度上是种族化和性别化的（哈灵顿，1962）。 此外，阿普泽克的理论视角也使他更加关注所谓的“第三世界”的解放斗争。阿普泽克（1960, 27）认为，米尔斯无法认识到资本国际化作为美国外交政策经济基础的重要性，意味着米尔斯无法看到美国公众舆论很重要，但世界公众舆论、帝国主义伙伴之间的分歧以及美国精英意见的分歧也是限制权力精英的强大力量。这些因素都在阻止米尔斯所谓的“军事上升”的手。总之，阿普泽克（1960, 29）的主要观点是“精英绝非全能，而我们国家的大众也不是无力的，也不是冷漠的。” 最后，阿普泽克指出，米尔斯作品中缺少对资本主义发展理论的探讨，产生了一个额外的盲点，关于美国南部在美国政治和经济发展中的作用。阿普泽克认为，种族和新保守主义在历史阶级发展中有着比米尔斯在分析1950年代的“保守情绪”时所认识到的更深层基础。阿普泽克（1960, 11）提示说，如果米尔斯认识到“这里有相对的、而不是绝对的封建形式和制度的缺失——例如，它们在纽约州北部和马里兰州很重要——还有我们历史上的一种前封建形式，奴隶制，在美国发展中直到内战发挥了决定性作用，就像一些其残余影响对当今美国生活产生如此决定性影响一样。”这不仅仅是一个历史上的小争议，而是一个具有深远理论意义的遗漏。 首先，米尔斯分析中的这一空白创造了对美国种族问题的盲点。阿普泽克（1960, 11-12）哀叹“米尔斯在他所有的著作中一贯忽视了黑人问题。”因此，他错过了已经成为美国进步政治行动重要结构基础的东西。其次，这一空白还导致米尔斯忽视了传统保守主义在美国的结构基础——强烈位于南部，但更普遍地扩展到整个美国白人的农村和郊区腹地。阿普泽克预见性地观察到，米尔斯所轻视的短期“保守情绪”实际上在美国社会结构中有着深刻的历史基础——一个与种族和地区历史联系在一起的基础，并不会随着政治情绪的变化而消退。因此，虽然米尔斯声称“在美国不存在经典类型的保守意识形态”，阿普泽克（1960, 16）认定这一观点是一个重大错误，“这源于米尔斯对南方生活和历史以及美国发展中一种工业封建主义现实的完全忽视。”确实，对于一个深受卡尔·曼海姆影响的知识社会学家来说，这是一个严重的遗漏。 最后，阿普泽克（1960, 14 脚注）普遍批评米尔斯未能引用“美国马克思主义作家，尽管他们的工作预见并扩展了他自己的许多内容。”尽管米尔斯在《权力精英》中对马克思和马克思主义有“简短而非常简略的提及”，阿普泽克（1960, 15）希望“也许在未来的作品中，米尔斯将完全面对马克思主义的挑战，通过测试其命题对抗他今天所看到的美国现实。”在这方面，阿普泽克批评的一个显著特点是基于对实证和历史事实的讨论（无论是重新解释还是遗漏），而不是基于意识形态处方或党的教条的概念竞争，努力从理论上参与米尔斯。在20世纪70年代的波兰察斯-米利班德辩论及其后果中，不会发现变得如此普遍的意识形态标签——“扭曲的马克思主义”，“半马克思主义”，或“假装的马克思主义”。斯威齐和阿普泽克的批评意在建立在米尔斯的工作基础上并扩展它，而不是将其作为某种空洞的抽象术语辩论的一部分轻易驳回。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, there are a few conceptual and technical aspects that need attention for the code to run effectively and meet its intended purpose. # 1. Applying Functions Efficiently Applying your custom functions (\`macd\`, \`twin_range_filter\`, \`detect_engulfing\`) with \`.apply()\` row-by-row is extremely inefficient and will likely result in very long execution times, especially for larger datasets like financial time series. These techniques should ideally work with entire series (or DataFrames) for vectorized operations, which are significantly faster. Unfortunately, the way these functions are structured (e.g., \`twin_range_filter\` and \`detect_engulfing\`) inherently requires a sequential approach, which makes vectorization difficult without rethinking the logic. # 2. Function Return Values Your functions for signals (\`macd\`, \`twin_range_filter\`, \`detect_engulfing\`) are designed to return a signal based on the final row of the DataFrame passed to them. However, when applied row-by-row as in your code, they are not returning an appendable signal for each row but are instead trying to make a decision based on the entire sliced DataFrame up to the current row. This not only is inefficient but also incorrectly attempts to recursively reapply the logic for increasingly larger subsets of your DataFrame. # 3. Correction Suggestion For efficiency and correctness, consider significantly altering the logic of how you generate signals: - **Vectorization:** Instead of applying functions row-by-row, pre-compute the entire series of signals for MACD, Twin Range Filter, and Engulfing patterns. This approach can drastically improve performance. - **Direct Assignment:** Assign signals directly to the DataFrame without using \`apply()\` when possible. - **Trading Logic:** Ensure your strategy's \`next()\` method correctly interprets signals for each time step. # 4. Backtesting Strategy Implementation Your implementation of the \`ChubbStrategy\`'s \`next\` method appears to misunderstand how to use the \`.I()\` method and how signals should govern trades within the \`backtesting.py\` framework. - \`.I()\` method is meant for initializing indicators over the data, not for making dynamic trading decisions in \`next()\`. - In the \`next\` method, you directly compare \`self.signal1\` to integers (1, 2), but \`self.signal1\` is actually a callable object due to the use of \`self.I(lambda: df['signal'])\`. You would need to check the value of the signal at the current step. - Ensure the use of \`self.signal1[-1]\` to check for the latest signal when making buying or selling decisions within \`next\`. This respects the \`backtesting.py\` design where data is accessed as if in real-time, preventing look-ahead bias. # Recommendations To get this code working effectively, you’ll need to: - Revamp your functions for computing indicators and signals so they can operate on the entire DataFrame at once where possible. This might mean rethinking some of your logic to fit a vectorized pattern. - Adapt the strategy pattern correctly within \`backtesting.py\` framework, ensuring proper use of indicators and respecting the temporal nature of trading strategies. Remember, trading strategies and backtesting are complex subjects where details matter a lot. The synergy between financial analysis and technical implementation must be carefully managed."},{"prompt":"how to fix this : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exception Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-25-ea20feb0d7ad> in <cell line: 2>() 1 # df['macd'] = df.apply(lambda x: macd(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) ----> 2 df['trf'] = df.apply(lambda x: twin_range_filter(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 3 df['engulfing'] = df.apply(lambda x: detect_engulfing(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 7 frames /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/talib/__init__.py in wrapper(*args, **kwargs) 33 for k, v in kwargs.items()} 34 ---> 35 result = func(*args, **kwargs) 36 37 # check to see if we got a streaming result talib/_func.pxi in talib._ta_lib.EMA() talib/_func.pxi in talib._ta_lib.check_begidx1() Exception: inputs are all NaN","completion":"The error you're encountering indicates that at some point, the input to the TALib function (in this case, likely \`EMA\`) consists entirely of \`NaN\` values.

TALib functions will return \`NaN\` for the initial period where calculation cannot be performed, which is expected and normal. Usually, you don't apply the function row-by-row but on the whole series directly, which mitigates the issue as the calculation is intended to produce usable values after a warm-up period. 2. **Pre-check for \`NaN\` Values:** Before calling any TALib functions, check if the input series contains only \`NaN\` values. This can be a workaround but might not address the root issue if your calculation logic inherently leads to this scenario often. For instance, insert a condition in your functions to avoid performing TALib operations on entirely \`NaN\` series: \`\`\`python if close.isnull().all(): # handle the case, maybe by continuing to the next iteration or setting a default value continue \`\`\` 3. **Revise the Application Logic:** Instead of applying \`twin_range_filter\` and \`detect_engulfing\` functions row-by-row, consider recalculating these metrics across the entire DataFrame wherever feasible.

This situation can happen early in the dataset where you might have NaN values in your \`'close'\` price data, or due to the way slicing happens in pandas, particularly with the \`.iloc\` and \`.diff()\` operations that can produce segments of the data with insufficient non-NaN values for the calculation. # Suggested Fixes 1. Ensure Sufficient Non-NaN Data Before Calculation Before running your TA-Lib functions, ensure there are enough data points without NaNs. You can use \`.dropna()\` on your close price series or use a fill method (\`fillna\`) if it makes sense for your analysis (which you've started doing with \`fillna(method='ffill')\`). For financial time series analysis, forward filling might not always be appropriate, so consider the implications on your strategy. 2. Refactor the Application of Your Calculations Instead of attempting to apply the \`twin_range_filter\` function on a row-by-row basis with \`df.apply()\` and possibly encountering segments of your data that don't support meaningful EMA calculation, restructure your approach to compute the indicators and signals for the entire series directly. Adjusting \`smoothrng\` and \`rngfilt\` for Whole Series Calculation Modify the usage of your \`smoothrng\` and \`rngfilt\` functions to work on the entire DataFrame series without slicing into smaller segments that might have insufficient data for TA-Lib to process. Example of Adjusted Approach: Here's an illustrative adjustment focusing on preprocessing and ensuring sufficient non-NaN data before running your main logic, assuming \`df['close']\` has been appropriately preprocessed to minimize NaN issues: \`\`\`python # Ensure df['close'] is filled or cleaned of NaNs appropriately # For demonstration, using forward fill (consider the right approach for your use case) df['close'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True) # Then consider this check before applying TA-Lib functions if df['close'].isnull().any(): raise ValueError(\\"NaN values present in 'close' series.\\") \`\`\` 3. Protective Checks Within Your Function For every call to a TA-Lib function (\`talib.EMA()\`, in your case), ensure the series passed does not solely consist of NaN values. You can introduce a check or default to a placeholder value if NaNs are detected: \`\`\`python def safe_ema(series, timeperiod): \\"\\"\\"A safe wrapper around talib.EMA to handle NaN series.\\"\\"\\" if series.isnull().all(): # Return a series of NaNs of the same length, or consider another fallback return pd.Series(np.nan, index=series.index) else: return talib.EMA(series, timeperiod=timeperiod) \`\`\` Then, use this \`safe_ema\` function within your \`smoothrng\` or directly in calculations to mitigate the exception caused by all-NaN inputs. Final Note: Since these adjustments address the NaN issue at a general level, you still might need to revisit the logic within \`twin_range_filter\` to ensure it correctly applies to your entire series at once or adequately handles edge cases specific to your strategy. Always back-test your strategy after making such adjustments to validate its performance and correctness."},{"prompt":"If worldwide average temperatures dropped to 32°F, how long would it take for oceans to freeze?","completion":"If the worldwide average temperature suddenly dropped to 32°F (0°C), the actual freezing of the oceans would not occur overnight, nor would it be uniform or complete due to several important factors: 1. **Depth and Heat Capacity of Oceans**: The oceans are incredibly deep, with an average depth of about 12,080 feet (3,682 meters). This vast body of water has a high heat capacity, meaning it can absorb a lot of heat before its temperature changes significantly. Cooling down the entire volume of the ocean would take a tremendous amount of time. 2. **Salinity**: Ocean water is salty, and salt lowers the freezing point of water. The average salinity of ocean water reduces its freezing point to about -2°C (28.4°F) rather than 0°C (32°F). In some areas, especially where seawater is more saline, this effect would be even more pronounced. 3. **Ocean Currents**: The movement of ocean water plays a crucial role in distributing heat around the planet. Currents such as the Gulf Stream transport warm water from the tropics towards the poles, while colder water is moved towards the equator. These currents would slow the cooling process by constantly moving water around and mixing warmer water with cooler water. Given these factors, even with a drastic and sustained drop in atmospheric temperature to 32°F, the oceans would cool much more slowly than the air. Estimating an exact timeline for the entire ocean to freeze is complex and fraught with uncertainties, largely due to the depth, vast volume, and dynamic nature of the oceans. However, we can confidently say it would take a very long time—on the order of thousands of years—for the oceans to fully freeze solid, if it were even possible under such a scenario. In reality, localized freezing would occur first in the polar regions where sea ice already forms and grows during the winter months, while the deep ocean and areas affected by strong currents would remain unfrozen for a much longer period."},{"prompt":"now, how about 14°F?","completion":"At a sustained average global temperature of 14°F (-10°C), the environmental impact would be significantly more severe than at 32°F (0°C), leading to much more extensive ice cover, including a dramatic expansion of polar ice caps and formation of sea ice over large portions of the oceans. However, even at this lower temperature, several factors would still prevent the oceans from freezing solid quickly or entirely: 1. **Depth and Heat Capacity**: The oceans' vast depth and volume mean they have a tremendous capacity to store heat. Cooling the entire depth of the ocean to the point of freezing solid, especially below the thermocline (where temperature declines sharply), would take an incredibly long time due to the thermal inertia of such a large body of water. 2. **Salinity**: Salt content lowers the freezing point of seawater to about -2°C (28.4°F). In regions with higher salinity, this effect would be more pronounced, further resisting freezing. 3. **Ocean Currents**: Ocean currents would continue to distribute heat around the planet, although their patterns could be altered in such a drastically changed climate. Warm water from the equator would still move towards the poles, slowing the freezing process, especially in deeper waters. Assuming the atmosphere could somehow sustain an average temperature of 14°F (-10°C), surface layers of the oceans in polar regions would freeze over more extensively and quickly than at 32°F (0°C). Sea ice would extend much farther towards the equator, and seasonal sea ice in polar regions would become permanent, thickening over time. However, much of the deep ocean, particularly at lower latitudes, would likely remain liquid for centuries or millennia due to the reasons mentioned. Given the current scientific understanding, a complete freeze of the oceanic body, from surface to seabed globally, is practically inconceivable simply due to a drop in air temperature to 14°F (-10°C). The process towards a significantly ice-encrusted planet would be more rapid at such a low temperature compared to 32°F (0°C), but the deep ocean freezing solid would still take a very long time under these conditions—a time likely measured in thousands of years, with the possibility that equilibrium conditions would never allow the deepest parts to freeze solid at all."},{"prompt":"then -4°F?","completion":"With an even more extreme scenario where the worldwide average temperature drops to -4°F (-20°C), the circumstances become harder to extrapolate based on existing scientific understanding, primarily because such conditions don't have a precedent in the current geological epoch, and the physics starts to involve complex interactions that are not fully accounted for in models designed for current climate conditions. However, several key points can still help frame what might happen: 1. **Dramatic Expansion of Ice Coverage**: Temperatures of -4°F (-20°C) would lead to an extraordinary expansion of ice cover over the oceans. Sea ice would grow extensively, covering much larger areas of the oceans and likely becoming several meters thick, even in some regions that are currently temperate. 2. **Salinity and Deep Water**: The extreme cold would greatly increase the rate at which surface waters freeze, but the saltiness of ocean water lowers its freezing point. Deeper waters, particularly those that are more saline, would resist freezing due to both the salt content and the vast volume of water that would need to be cooled throughout the depths. 3. **Thermohaline Circulation Slowdown or Halting**: One significant factor in ocean dynamics is the thermohaline circulation, driven by differences in water density, which itself is affected by both temperature and salinity. This global \\"conveyor belt\\" could slow down significantly or even halt under such extreme cold, reducing the distribution of remaining heat in the ocean's depths. This reduction could lead to different freezing rates in different areas but would not necessarily mean the entire ocean would freeze solid rapidly. 4. **Deep Ocean Temperatures**: Despite surface freezing, the profound depths of the ocean would remain insulated by the massive volume of water above them. Given the high specific heat capacity of water, cooling the entire depth to the point of freezing, especially in the deep and mid-oceans, would take an incredibly long time—likely many thousands to tens of thousands of years, if it could occur at all. 5. **Global Climate System Collapse and Reconfiguration**: At such extreme sustained temperatures, Earth's climate system as we know it would collapse and reconfigure into a state that is difficult to predict with accuracy. Life, ecosystems, atmospheric dynamics, and oceanic currents would all be radically altered. In this scenario, while the surface of the oceans and seas closer to the poles would freeze and extend towards the equator, and while some upper levels of the deeper oceans might begin to freeze, the complete freezing of the entire ocean, from surface to the deepest trenches, remains unlikely in any practical timescale. The intense cold would lead to a significantly different planet, with vast ice sheets covering much of the surface land and ocean, but the deep ocean would probably still resist freezing solid due to its volume, depth, and residual geothermal heat from the Earth's core warming the seabed."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
