OUTFIT: Gray hoodie (usually worn during the autumn or spring), a dark red plaid shirt faded blue jeans and white sneakers. DESCRIPTION: 17-year-old young man from Chicago with a dark past. Hates his abusive dad. Loves Linkin Park, NIN and Nirvana. Favorite games are Need For Speed, DOOM and GTA. Mostly plays the piano. Rebellious and reckless. Shy and quiet. Secretly likes Anime but doesn\'t admit it.","completion":"Elliot Harper sounds like a complex and intriguing main character for your manga. Here\'s how you might incorporate him into your story, drawing inspiration from both the essence of \\"American Pie\\" and your unique spin on the character: **Setting and Character Dynamics:** Set in a high school environment similar to that of \\"American Pie,\\" Elliot could be navigating the complicated world of teenage social dynamics. Despite his troubled home life marked by an abusive father, he manages to maintain a passion for his interests and hobbies, which serve as an escape from his reality. **Character Growth and Relationships:** Throughout the story, Elliot\'s love for music (Linkin Park, NIN, and Nirvana) could act as a bridge to connect with other characters who share his taste or admire his piano-playing skills, perhaps leading to unexpected friendships or a romantic subplot. This connection to music could also be a gateway to addressing his personal struggles and finding catharsis. His interests in gaming could be a more public aspect of his character, allowing you to illustrate exciting gaming sessions that resemble the cuts and transitions found in movies like \\"American Pie,\\" where characters bond over activities, conversations, and shared interests. **Connection to the \\"American Pie\\" Theme:** To fit the \\"American Pie\\" theme, which often centers around coming-of-age challenges, sexual exploration, and the pressures of the pending end of high school, Elliot could be depicted as someone who yearns for freedom and a sense of belonging. Despite being shy and quiet, he may find himself in situations that push him out of his comfort zone, leading to both humorous and poignant moments. **Rebelliousness and Secrets:** His rebellious and reckless tendencies could generate conflict with authority figures, including his father or school staff, serving as a plot point that tests Elliot\'s boundaries and forces him to make decisions that might alter his future. Meanwhile, his secret affinity for anime could become a pivotal element in his character development, perhaps leading to unexpected alliances or underscoring themes of acceptance and self-expression. **Artistic Style:** Visually, Elliot\'s appearance with short black hair, brown eyes, and skinny stature could be emphasized with distinct facial expressions that convey his internal battles and reactions to the world around him. The gray hoodie and the dark red plaid shirt could become iconic pieces that readers associate with Elliot, symbolizing his identity and his journey throughout the story. By blending themes from \\"American Pie\\" with the depth you\'ve given Elliot, your manga has the potential to explore adolescence in a relatable yet fresh way, all while respecting the core elements that make teen comedies resonate with audiences. It\'ll be important to ensure that the blend of cultural elements and potential sensitive topics are handled thoughtfully to create a manga that\'s both true to the spirit of the source material and original in its storytelling."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Natsuki, are you alright? You look like you’re going to be sick…” Natsuki: “Ugh, I don’t know. I just feel really nauseous all of a sudden. Maybe it was something I ate for lunch, but I don’t feel good at all.” Sayori: “Oh no, Natsuki! Maybe you should go to the nurse’s office! It might help to lie down for a bit.” Yuri: “I agree with Sayori. Rest may be beneficial. And if you need, I can go with you to the nurse or help you get there.” Monika: “Let’s not panic, everyone. Natsuki, take a deep breath and try to relax for a moment. We’re all here to help. How about we get you a glass of water first?” Natsuki: “Thanks, guys. Maybe some water would help. I just hope I’m not coming down with anything serious. Sorry for worrying everyone.” Monika: “Don’t apologize, Natsuki. It’s okay to feel unwell, and it’s important to take care of yourself. We’ll make sure you’re feeling better soon. Just take it easy for n-” (Natsuki suddenly covers her mouth to stop herself from vomiting.) Natsuki: “…someone get a trash bin…” Sayori: “Oh, goodness! Hang on, Natsuki!” (Sayori rushes to find a trash can and hands it over to Natsuki - who immediately vomits right into it.) Monika: (rushing to Natsuki’s side) “It’s alright, Natsuki, don’t worry. Just let it all out. Sayori, would you mind going to fetch the nurse? It might be best if she checks on Natsuki.” Sayori: “Of course, Monika! I’ll be right back, Natsuki! Hang in there!” (Sayori dashes out of the room to find the nurse.) Yuri: (gently rubbing Natsuki’s back) “There, there. Sometimes the body must purge what’s making it ill. You’re going to be okay, Natsuki.” Natsuki: (leaning back, pale and shaking) “Thanks, Yuri…I hate this feeling…” (continues vomiting) Monika: (trying to keep the situation calm) “Just focus on your breathing, Natsuki. In and out, slowly. We’ll take care of everything.” (Yuri fetches a wet cloth and gently wipes Natsuki’s forehead.) Yuri: “This should help you feel a little better. We will make sure you’re looked after.” Natsuki: (between heaves) “I don’t…ugh…I don’t know why this…happened…” Monika: “Sometimes it’s just bad luck, Natsuki. Could be a stomach bug, or maybe food poisoning. We’ll let the nurse figure out what it is and get you the right help.” (Natsuki nods weakly and continues to rely on the trash bin.) Yuri: (concerned) “Remember, Natsuki, your health comes first. We’ll handle club responsibilities, so don’t worry about a thing.” (Natsuki tries to nod again, still struggling with nausea.) {THAT EVENING} Natsuki: (standing next to her bed, talking to herself) “Gosh, that was the worst bout of nausea I’ve ever had. I can’t believe I had to leave school early. I have some of my Mom’s tests from when she was feeling sick a while back. Maybe I should use one, just in case. It couldn’t hurt to check, right?” (Natsuki digs through her cabinet and finds a small box labeled ‘Pregnancy Test’.) Natsuki: (murmuring to herself) “No way, it’s not possible. There’s no way I could be…But I have been tired and moody. Everyone in the club has been noticing, no matter how much I try to hide it.” (She hesitates, looking at the test in her hands.) Natsuki: (sighs) “Fine, I’ll just do it to rule it out. It would explain the nausea and the fatigue, I guess.” (After reading the instructions, Natsuki takes the test, and waits the excruciating few minutes for the result.) Natsuki: “This is silly. I’m probably just sick from something I ate…” (The timer goes off, and Natsuki looks at the test.) Natsuki: (in disbelief) “What? How…?” (The test shows a positive result.) Natsuki: (panic rising) “No, this can’t be right. It must be a false positive or something!” (Natsuki sits on the edge of her bed, feeling overwhelmed and scared.) Natsuki: “What am I going to do? I can’t…I’m not ready for this. What will my father say? And the club…Monika and everyone…” (She puts her face in her hands, trying to process the sudden whirl of emotions running through her mind.) Natsuki: (speaking to herself) “I have to confirm it, get a second opinion. Then I’ll figure it out. There’s no need to freak out before I’m completely sure. But first, I’ll send a text to everyone, but not tell them that I’m pregnant.” (","completion":"Natsuki takes a deep breath, mustering whatever composure she can find, and picks up her phone. With trembling fingers, she begins to type out a message to her friends in the literature club.) Natsuki: (texting) “Hey everyone, thanks for your support today. I\'m feeling a bit better but going to take it easy tonight. Might see the doctor tomorrow. Talk to you all soon.” (She pauses, her thumb hovering over the \'send\' button as she second-guesses what to reveal. With a soft sigh, she sends the text.) Natsuki: (whispering to herself) “There, that\'ll have to do for now. No need to worry them more than they already are.” (She sets down her phone and glances back at the positive pregnancy test, the reality of the situation beginning to sink in. She knows she\'ll have to take steps to confirm the result with a healthcare professional and then make some tough decisions—but for tonight, she just needs to rest and prepare for what\'s to come. Natsuki lies back on her bed, her mind racing with thoughts of the future, but she is determined to face whatever lies ahead with the same strength and resilience she\'s always shown, even if this time, she might need to lean on her friends for help.) [End Scene]"},{"prompt":"which of these are suitable as variable names in golang? var 5_my num35 my _var","completion":"In Go (also known as Golang), variable names must adhere to a set of rules. They must: - Begin with a letter (either uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_) - Be composed of letters, digits, and underscores (_) - Not be one of the reserved keywords Let\'s evaluate each of the provided options with these rules in mind: 1. `var`: Not suitable as a variable name because \\"var\\" is a reserved keyword in Go. It is used to declare a variable. 2. `5_my`: Not suitable as a variable name because it starts with a digit, which is not allowed in Go variable names. 3. `num35`: Suitable as a variable name. It starts with a letter and contains a combination of letters and digits, which is allowed. 4. `my`: Suitable as a variable name. It only contains letters and starts with one, which complies with the rules. 5. `_var`: Suitable as a variable name, even though it is uncommon to use a leading underscore in Go. It starts with an underscore followed by letters, which is acceptable. In summary, out of the options given, `num35`, `my`, and `_var` are suitable as variable names in Go. `var` and `5_my` are not suitable."},{"prompt":"can you explain how this code works line by line x := 5 y := x + 3 x -= y x++ fmt.Println(x)","completion":"Certainly! Below is an explanation of what each line of the provided Go code snippet does: ```go x := 5 ``` This line declares a new variable `x` and assigns the integer value `5` to it. The `:=` operator is a shorthand in Go for declaring and initializing a variable in one step. After this line, `x` will hold the value `5`. ```go y := x + 3 ``` Another variable `y` is declared and initialized to the result of the expression `x + 3`. Since `x` is `5`, the expression evaluates to `5 + 3`, which is `8`. Now, `y` holds the value `8`. ```go x -= y ``` This line modifies the value of `x` by subtracting the value of `y` from it. It\'s equivalent to writing `x = x - y`. Given that `x` was `5` and `y` is `8`, after this operation `x` will be `-3` (`5 - 8` equals `-3`). ```go x++ ``` This line increments the value of `x` by `1`. The `++` operator is the increment operator in Go. Since `x` was `-3` after the subtraction, incrementing it by `1` changes its value to `-2`. ```go fmt.Println(x) ``` Finally, this line prints the current value of `x` to the standard output (typically the console). The `fmt.Println` function is a standard Go function that formats its arguments (in this case, the variable `x`) and prints them followed by a newline character. Given that the value of `x` is now `-2`, it will print `-2` to the console. To summarize, this is what is happening in terms of values assigned to the variables during execution: 1. `x` starts with `5` 2. `y` is assigned the value `8` (`5 + 3`) 3. `x` is updated to `-3` (`5 - 8`) 4. `x` is incremented to `-2` (`-3 + 1`) 5. The value `-2` is printed to the console."},{"prompt":"explain code line by line sum := 1 for i := 5; i <= 8; i++ { sum += i } fmt.Println(sum)","completion":"Sure, let\'s walk through the provided Go code snippet line by line: ```go sum := 1 ``` This line declares a new variable named `sum` and initializes it with the integer value `1`. The `:=` syntax is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable. After this assignment, `sum` will hold the value `1`. ```go for i := 5; i <= 8; i++ { sum += i } ``` This block is a `for` loop, which is used for iteration in Go. The loop consists of three parts, separated by semicolons: 1. Initialization: `i := 5` initializes a new loop variable `i` with the value `5`. 2. Condition: `i <= 8` sets the condition for the loop to continue running. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `8`. 3. Post: `i++` increments the loop variable `i` by `1` on each iteration. Inside the loop block: - `sum += i` is shorthand for `sum = sum + i`. This statement adds the current value of `i` to `sum` during each iteration. Let\'s break down the iterations of the loop: - 1st iteration: `i` is `5`, `sum` becomes `1 + 5` which is `6` - 2nd iteration: `i` is `6`, `sum` becomes `6 + 6` which is `12` - 3rd iteration: `i` is `7`, `sum` becomes `12 + 7` which is `19` - 4th iteration: `i` is `8`, `sum` becomes `19 + 8` which is `27` At this point, after the fourth iteration, `i` is incremented to `9`, and since `9` is not less than or equal to `8`, the loop condition `i <= 8` fails, and the loop exits. ```go fmt.Println(sum) ``` This line calls a function from the `fmt` package called `Println`, which prints the value passed to it followed by a newline character. Here, it will print the current value of `sum`, which is `27` after the completion of the loop. To summarize, the code initializes a variable `sum`, accumulates the sum of the numbers from `5` to `8` (inclusive) into `sum`, and then prints the final result (`27`) to the console."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Natsuki, are you alright?

I am relieved to hear that the process has been made simple and that there are readily available alternatives, such as the iTunes gift card or Bitcoin, for the 125 payment. I am keen on adhering to your instructions and eager to proceed with the iTunes gift card option, as it appears to be the most expeditious method as per your suggestion. However, regrettably, I find myself in a bit of a pickle. As luck would have it, I am temporarily confined to my home due to an unexpected injury and cannot make my way to the store for the gift card purchase. I am sure you can sympathize with my current predicament. In this digital age, I wonder, might there be a secure way for me to purchase this gift card online and send it to you electronically? This could potentially accelerate the process and ensure that the delivery of my consignment box is not delayed by my inability to travel. If this is possible, please provide me with the particular details on how to proceed with this online transaction. Additionally, in anticipation of soon becoming a beneficiary of such a substantial amount, I’d like to take all the required precautions. Could we possibly set up a tentative delivery schedule or arrange a secure means of communication for when the delivery is on route? I want to ensure that I am available and that the consignment arrives at a safe and agreed-upon time. I hope these queries don’t impose too much, and I do apologize for the extra steps.

I can give you delivery information through wassap and email once the 125 is received, Kindly find a way to get the iTunes card purchase and send for our urgent process on your project Email #6, from Cameron: Dear Director <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Your consideration in this matter truly exemplifies the utmost professionalism and empathy. I appreciate your willingness to accommodate the unforeseen circumstances regarding my injury. Your instructions have been a beacon of guidance. It is a relief to hear that communication channels such as WhatsApp can be utilized for swift and secure exchanges of important delivery information. I must commend the International Interpol Police Force Unit for adapting modern technologies to enhance efficiency and customer service. Regarding the payment, your suggestion of using a bank app to purchase the iTunes gift card is a brilliant one. This approach would surely adhere to the constraints of my present condition, allowing me to maintain strict adherence to the payment timeline you’ve so kindly outlined. However, before I proceed with this digital venture, a minor clarification would set my mind at ease. Could you kindly provide the specific details on how to securely transfer the gift card information to you once purchased? I presume, given the sensitive nature of such transactions, that specific protocols must be observed to ensure both the confidentiality and the integrity of the transfer. I am also intrigued by the alternate payment methods you mentioned, such as Zelle, PayPal, and Cash App. While I am somewhat familiar with these services, I am cautious and seek your expert guidance on which would offer the most secure and expeditious channel for this particular transaction. Should we opt for one of these avenues, please provide the necessary details so that I may proceed with the utmost precision. Lastly, with regards to WhatsApp, I am indeed equipped to use this service. My WhatsApp number is identical to the telephone number I’ve previously provided: +1 555-628-0542. Feel free to send any pertinent delivery information through this medium. I am ready and waiting to receive it with the greatest of attentiveness. Once again, thank you for your patience and assistance in navigating these modern payment methodologies. It is my utmost priority to expedite this process and meet all requirements on my end without further ado.

Regard Director Michael A Hughes Email #9, from Michael: What is the situation of things? Are you purchasing the iTunes card ? Update me on the situation Michael A hughe Email #10, from Cameron: Dear Director <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I trust this message finds you in the best of health and spirits. Thank you for providing me with the image of what the iTunes gift card looks like; it certainly clarifies what I should be on the lookout for. I must convey my appreciation for your understanding and patience. The process seems much clearer to me now, and I am prepared to move forward with the necessary payment to expedite our transaction. After mulling over the options you’ve provided and considering my limited mobility, I’ve concluded that using Zelle would be the most convenient and secure method for me. If you would be so kind as to provide me with the requisite details for the Zelle transfer, I shall proceed with all due haste to ensure the funds are dispatched to you posthaste. In addition, I would be grateful if you could preliminarily lay out a tentative delivery schedule for the consignment. Having a rough idea of when to expect the arrival will allow me to make arrangements on my end to receive it appropriately. Finally, thank you for agreeing to use WhatsApp for our further communications. I believe this will greatly enhance our ability to swiftly address any immediate questions or updates regarding the delivery process. I look forward to your instructions and remain committed to a smooth and successful completion of our ongoing engagement.

It is indeed reassuring to know that we can progress with such efficiency. I will initiate the Zelle transfer at the earliest opportunity. However, I have encountered a small stumbling block that I must navigate before completing the payment. My bank has recently implemented additional security measures for new payees, which include a brief waiting period before transactions are fully authorized for accounts that I have not previously transacted with. This is a security protocol to protect against unauthorized transfers. Rest assured, I have already taken the requisite steps on my banking app to add the details provided (<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>, Kendel Vaughn) as a payee. Once my bank clears this new payee for transactions, which should take no more than 24 hours, I will immediately send the 125 via Zelle. In the interim, if you could be so kind as to provide the online tracking details you mentioned earlier, I would be most grateful. This would allow me to monitor the approaching delivery and ensure that I can arrange any necessary adjustments in my schedule. Furthermore, kindly affirm that the recipient name ‘Kendel Vaughn’ directly correlates to the International Interpol Police Force Unit. My bank officers are quite meticulous, and for record-keeping, I would like to document the purpose of the transaction as accurately as possible. As soon as the waiting period concludes and the payment is sent, I will make sure to capture a screenshot of the confirmation page and forward it to you posthaste. In the meantime, I am filled with anticipation for the next steps and excited about the approaching resolution of this matter. I shall update you promptly once the payment has been successfully completed. Thank you once again for your guidance and patience throughout this process. Awaiting your confirmation and the tracking details, I remain, Yours sincerely, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #13, from Michael: Ok I will be waiting for the payment confirmation slip from you once sent, I will update you with online tracking number once I confirm your payment then I can setup your shipment and give you online tracking Hurry up so we can meet up Email #14, from Cameron: Dear Director <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for your understanding and continued guidance. It is a relief to know that you are standing by, ready to progress with the shipment as soon as the transaction is completed. I am monitoring the situation closely and eagerly awaiting authorization from my bank to finalize the Zelle payment. Rest assured, I am expediting this with the highest priority and will inform you the very moment the transfer has been successfully processed. While we await the clearance, it occurred to me that preparing for the arrival of the consignment might require specific arrangements on my part. Could you advise on any particular protocol or requirements I should be aware of during the delivery? For example, will I need to present any form of identification or documentation to the delivery personnel to confirm my identity as the rightful recipient? Additionally, your confirmation that Kendel Vaughn is appropriately linked to the International Interpol Police Force Unit helps me align my records accordingly. I aim to maintain a thorough and transparent account of all transactions for personal and financial records. Once more, I extend my gratitude for your professionalism and the seamless assistance you have provided thus far. My anticipations are high, and I am committed to fulfilling my role as swiftly as the parameters allow. With respect to time, I will halt our correspondence here and turn my full attention to the payment completion. Expect the confirmation slip from me at your earliest convenience, once rendered possible by my financial institution. Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #15, from Michael: You will need to attach me your identity card or drivers license so I can give it to your delivery agent so that once you present yours to him he can confirm and make delivery, again the Zelle account owner is a financial protocol we use to receive the fund, he is a Clark to this office, thank you I wait for slip of payment Email #16, from Cameron: Dear Director <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I am sincerely grateful for the additional information and your diligent attention to detail. It is comforting to know the processes in place are meticulously designed for security and efficiency. Regarding the identity confirmation with the delivery agent, I will have my driver’s license prepared for verification upon their arrival. In addition, I will take the precaution of preparing photocopies to be attached alongside the transaction confirmation slip you’ve requested, ensuring a seamless verification process. Regarding Mr. Kendel Vaughn serving as a financial clerk for your office, that context is valuable and appreciated. This clarification is highly pertinent to maintain the integrity of my records and helps to validate the transaction as legitimate and aligned with standard protocols. As an interim measure, pending the completion of the Zelle transfer, I have attached a scanned copy of my driver’s license to this email for your preliminary records. A higher resolution and notarized copy, if required, will be made available to the delivery agent upon their scheduled arrival. Please rest assured, the moment I receive green light confirmation from my bank that the new payee has been cleared, the Zelle payment of 125 will be dispatched without delay. Upon successful transmission of funds, I will provide you with the payment slip as instantaneously as the transaction confirmation becomes available. I am fully aware of the urgency of the matter, and I am doing all within my power to ensure that no time is wasted. Your patience and professionalism do not go unnoticed and are deeply appreciated during this period of anticipation. Awaiting your instructions upon receipt of the funds, I remain, Yours sincerely, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #17, from Michael: Drivers license received and confirmed, I wait for the payment slip to confirm your payment ASAP Email #18, from Cameron: Dear Director <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I am pleased to hear that you have successfully received and confirmed my driver’s license details. Your promptness is truly commendable. In anticipation of completing this matter efficiently, I have already pre-authored the payment so that it will be transacted instantaneously upon my bank’s approval. I feel it is necessary to underscore my commitment to a punctual resolution to reaffirm my earnest cooperation with the International Interpol Police Force Unit. The moment the transaction goes through, you will be the first to be apprised, accompanied by the appropriate payment slip for your confirmation. Thank you once more for your patience and guidance. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #19, from Michael: Am still waiting for the confirmation of the fee, I need a slip of payment, what’s going on? Email #20, from Cameron: Dear Director <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I understand and share your sense of urgency, and I want to assure you that I am making every effort to expedite the payment process. I am in frequent communication with my bank to ensure the swift authorization of the new Zelle payee. As you can appreciate, these banking protocols are in place to protect against fraud and must be followed to the letter, no matter how eager we both are to proceed. The instant the bank provides me with the green light, I will complete the transaction and the payment confirmation slip will be in your inbox without a moment’s delay. I am diligently monitoring the situation and have requested that my bank prioritize the approval process, emphasizing the time-sensitive nature of our arrangement. I hope that it will provide some reassurance to know that I am as deeply invested in finalizing this affair as you are. The moment there is any development, you will be promptly updated. In the interim, I thank you for your continued patience and understanding. If possible, could you please ensure that the tracking information and any preparatory details for the consignment delivery are primed to be relayed to me as soon as the payment confirmation has been sent to you? I want to make sure that we can move straight ahead to the next steps without any further delays once the bank’s security measures have been satisfied. Rest assured, I am poised to act immediately, and the payment slip will follow my transaction as surely as day follows night. With anticipatory thanks for your collaboration and understanding in this security matter, Best regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #21, from Michael: I am yet to confirm your payment, is over 24 hours now, what is going on? Like I told you before I will furnish you with online tracking information, kindly send the fee and save us delay Hughes Email #22, from Cameron: Dear Director <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I completely sympathize with your concern regarding the protracted nature of this payment process. Please rest assured that this delay is in no way a reflection of my willingness or ability to comply with the terms we’ve discussed. I have full intention to settle the required fee with the utmost urgency; however, the banking security measures are binding and I am beholden to their rigorous due diligence process. Today, first thing in the morning, I contacted my banking representative to stress the critical nature of this transaction once more. They’ve reassured me that the security review is a matter of routine and will conclude shortly. I’ve been assured that this is the final stage and, upon completion, I will be able to immediately expedite the funds to the Zelle account provided. I understand how this may seem to hinder our progress, and for that, I offer my genuine apologies. It was and is never my intention to prolong this transaction unnecessarily. I am ready and on standby to adhere to our agreed terms at the earliest possible juncture. Once my bank fulfills its obligation to account verification, expected to conclude within the next few hours, I will without hesitancy proceed with the transaction and immediately forward you the payment confirmation slip. I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide the online tracking information and delivery details in preparation, which will enable me to arrange my schedule to accommodate the consignment delivery. Again, Director Hughes, thank you for your patience and understanding through this essential banking security process. I am steadfast in my commitment to facilitating this transaction and eagerly look forward to resolving this matter expediently. I shall be in touch with the payment confirmation at the earliest opportunity.

I assure you that my intentions are sincere and that I am actively expediting the process. The demanding security protocols from my bank are unavoidable, and I am in constant communication with them to stress the urgency of our situation. Please understand that these security measures reflect the cautious nature of international banking practices, which are stringent, especially in matters involving overseas transactions. I am fully aware that the delay seems excessive, and I too am feeling the weight of it. This afternoon I made another visit to my bank’s local branch to convey in person the importance of completing this security review with haste. This has certainly added some pressure on their end, and I’ve been reassured that they are expediting the clearance. I value the trust and patience you’ve extended thus far and commit to reciprocating with swift action the moment clearance is granted. I understand that the option to purchase an iTunes card would have seemingly been swifter; however, my physical inability to travel due to my injury presented unique challenges with that route. In light of this, and to allay any concerns about my seriousness and commitment, I am exploring the possibility of having a trusted contact secure the iTunes gift card on my behalf. I will take steps to arrange this contingency plan simultaneously while awaiting my bank’s final approval. If this alternate method proves quicker, I will prioritally relay the gift card details as per your instructions. Again, I must express my appreciation for your forbearance. This saga, much like you, I wish to conclude swiftly and successfully. I will keep you updated on the progress and immediately send you the payment slip once the Zelle transaction clears, or in the event I manage to procure the iTunes gift card through my mentioned alternative. Please feel assured of my utmost attention to this matter.

The situation with my bank has proven to be much more protracted than anticipated, and for this, I am incredibly sorry. I want to reassure you that I am taking your concerns very seriously. I am not just sitting idly; instead, I am taking proactive steps to resolve the matter. I have reached out to a close associate who has agreed to purchase the iTunes gift card on my behalf today. Given the complexities and delays with the Zelle transaction, this alternative method should prove to be a quicker solution. Once my associate has purchased the iTunes gift card, I will ensure that they follow your instructions to the letter: the card will be gently scratched to reveal the code, and the information will be securely attached and sent directly to your email. I am making all necessary efforts to ensure that this is completed within the next few hours. I share your frustration with these delays, and I am doing everything within my power to get the fund to you without further postponement. Rest assured, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations as quickly as possible, and I am thankful for your continued patience and understanding. Please expect an email from me shortly with the iTunes gift card details, which should undoubtedly expedite the delivery process we are both eagerly anticipating.

Palm trees sway in the warm breeze. The serene view is interrupted when footprints lead down the sandy beach where a MEETING unfolds between two unlikely individuals—a Japanese NINJA and an American MARINE. The NINJA, 21, attire unusual for a shinobi, stands nervously by the shoreline, his gaze fixed on the water. His typical black garb has been replaced with a white tank-top, brown shorts, and makeshift flip-flops. Short black hair is tousled by the breeze, and his body language exudes discomfort and apprehension. By his side is a small pack holding what little he\'s chosen to carry into his new life. The MARINE, a lanky 19-year-old with an M1 Garand slung over his shoulder, approaches with a mix of curiosity and wariness. His uniform is a bit disheveled, indicative that he\'s been on patrol for some time. His youthful face, however, cannot mask his openness and inherent optimism. MARINE (trying to break the ice) Hey there! Didn\'t expect to see anyone dressed for the beach out here. You fishing or something? The Ninja glances at the soldier, and an uncomfortable silence ensues before he gathers the courage to respond. NINJA (quiet and shy) No, I am... was a shinobi. I am leaving my clan. I do not agree with their... ambitions. An awkward silence hangs as the Marine processes this revelation. An unexpected smile forms on the Marine\'s face as he lowers his rifle, realizing the ninja poses no threat. MARINE (resting his rifle against a palm tree) Well, you\'re the first ninja I\'ve met who wears flip-flops. The name\'s Jack. What\'s your name? NINJA Hiro. MARINE (JACK) You\'re pretty young to be a ninja. Why\'d you leave your clan? HIRO They wish to \\"restore the glory of Japan.\\" But war... it has already taken so much. I do not believe our past is where our future should lie. And... I fear U.S. Marines patrolling here might mistake me for a soldier... Jack pauses and looks around the desolate shore, then back at Hiro, his expression softening. JACK I can assure you, Hiro, I\'m not here to hurt people who are trying to walk away from the fight. Where will you go now? HIRO (faint smile) I am unsure. I have family to the north, but with the country as it is... it\'s complicated. JACK I get that. I\'ve got family back home in Ohio myself. I miss them like crazy. We used to have these big family cookouts. What\'s your home like? HIRO (slowly warming up) I come from a small village in the mountains. My home... it was peaceful, close to nature. My mother\'s garden, my father\'s calligraphy... there is beauty I wish to preserve, not destroy. JACK (smiling genuinely) Sounds nice. It\'s not that different from what anyone wants, I guess. A peaceful place to call home. The moment is poignant, bridging two worlds that were, up until moments ago, at war. They realize that beneath their uniforms and cloaks, they\'re just young men longing for a world without conflict. HIRO (looking back to the ocean) Perhaps one day, we can all find such a place. JACK (nods thoughtfully) I sure hope so, Hiro. I sure hope so. They both share a mutual glance, a silent understanding forming between them. They stand in peaceful companionship as the waves gently lap against the shore, symbolizing a new beginning for both the ninja who rejected aggression and the marine who discovered an unexpected kinship far from home.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"I\'m working on a project called `medics Communication Server`, which is a communication platform for different medics apps and patients. It allows them to communicate through various channels like text messages, emails, and WhatsApp. The server handles the sending of messages, logs all the details for future analysis, and provides a consolidated response to the client. The project structure is as follows: ``` . ├── controllers │ ├── configuration.controller.js │ ├── index.js │ └── messenger.controller.js ├── log ├── models │ ├── configurations.model.js │ ├── index.js │ └── message_logs.model.js ├── public ├── services │ ├── email │ │ ├── GmailServiceProvider.js │ │ └── OutlookServiceProvider.js │ ├── sms │ │ └── UnicelServiceProvider.js │ ├── whatsapp │ │ ├── GupshupServiceProvider.js │ │ └── TelSpielServiceProvider.js │ ├── HTTPService.js │ ├── ServiceProviderFactory.js │ └── logger.js ├── ReadMe ├── config.json ├── medics-communication-server.js ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── routes.js ``` In this project, I have a service provider for WhatsApp called `TelSpielServiceProvider`. This service provider has a function `createTelSpielMessage` that creates a message payload based on the provided message details and configuration. However, different clients use different templates for the same template name, and these templates have different payloads. Here\'s the current implementation of the `TelSpielServiceProvider`: ```javascript const HttpService = require(\\"../HTTPService\\"); // Update the path accordingly const Logger = require(\'../logger.js\'); class TelSpielServiceProvider { // Function to send a TelSpiel message async sendMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { try { // Create the TelSpiel message based on the provided details const message = this.createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration); // Log the message details before sending Logger.info(`Sending TelSpiel message to {messageDetails.phone}: {JSON.stringify(message)}`); // Send the message via TelSpiel API const response = await this.sendTelSpielMessage(message, configuration); // Log the response after sending Logger.info(`TelSpiel response for message to {messageDetails.phone}: {JSON.stringify(response)}`); return response; } catch (error) { console.error(error); Logger.error(`Error sending TelSpiel message: {error.message}`); throw new Error(`Error sending TelSpiel message: {error.message}`); } } // Function to send a TelSpiel message via the TelSpiel API async sendTelSpielMessage(message, configuration) { try { const url = configuration.url; // Use axios to make the POST request const response = await HttpService.post(url, message, { \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\', }); return response.data; } catch (error) { console.error(error); throw new Error(`Error sending TelSpiel message via API: {error.message}`); } } // Function to create a TelSpiel message based on the provided message details createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { const { phone, content, attachment, attachmentURL, attachmentName } = messageDetails; // Define a generic message structure const message = { phoneNumber: phone, payload: { namespace: configuration.nameSpace, language: { policy: \'deterministic\', code: \'en\', }, }, }; if (attachment && attachment !== \'NULL\') { // For media messages message.payload.components = [ { type: \'header\', parameters: [ { type: \'video\', // can be image, pdf or any document type video: { link: attachmentURL, }, }, ], }, ]; message.payload.name = \'media_template\'; } else { // For text-based messages message.payload.components = [ { type: \'body\', parameters: [ { type: \'text\', text: content, }, ], }, ]; message.payload.name = \'text_template\'; } return message; } } module.exports = TelSpielServiceProvider; ``` I want to make the `createTelSpielMessage` function more generic to handle different templates. The idea is to store these templates in a MongoDB collection and fetch the appropriate template based on the `hospitalCode`, `corporateEntityCode`, and `templateName` when creating a message. If a template is not found for a given `hospitalCode`, the function should try fetching by `corporateEntityCode`. If it\'s still not found, it should fall back to a default `hospitalCode` called \'PRODUCT\'. Could you please help me modify the `createTelSpielMessage` function to implement this functionality?\\"","completion":"To implement the described functionality, you would need to first create a MongoDB schema and model for the templates, then modify the `createTelSpielMessage` function to fetch the appropriate template based on the provided parameters (`hospitalCode`, `corporateEntityCode`, and `templateName`), and finally use the retrieved template to build the message payload. Here\'s a high-level outline of the steps you\'ll need to take: 1. **Define the Template Schema:** You\'ll need to create a new Mongoose schema defining the structure of your templates collection in MongoDB. This might look something like this: ```javascript const mongoose = require(\'mongoose\'); const templateSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ templateName: String, hospitalCode: String, corporateEntityCode: String, templatePayload: mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed // Since the payload structure can vary }); const TemplateModel = mongoose.model(\'Template\', templateSchema); module.exports = TemplateModel; ``` Place this schema definition within the `models` directory, in a new file corresponding to the templates (e.g., `template.model.js`). 2. **Fetch the Template:** Next, modify the `createTelSpielMessage` function to fetch the template from the database. You might want to create a separate function for this to keep your code clean and maintainable. Here\'s a modified version of the `createTelSpielMessage` function, which makes use of a hypothetical `fetchTemplate` function that encapsulates the MongoDB querying logic: ```javascript class TelSpielServiceProvider { // ... // Function to fetch the appropriate template from the database async fetchTemplate(templateName, hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode) { // Priority order: hospitalCode → corporateEntityCode → \'PRODUCT\' const codes = [hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode, \'PRODUCT\']; for (const code of codes) { const template = await TemplateModel.findOne({ templateName: templateName, or: [ { hospitalCode: code }, { corporateEntityCode: code }, ], }).lean(); if (template) { return template.templatePayload; } } throw new Error(\'No template found\'); } // Function to create a TelSpiel message based on the provided message details async createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { const { phone, templateName, hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode } = messageDetails; try { const templatePayload = await this.fetchTemplate(templateName, hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode); // Build your message using the templatePayload const message = { phoneNumber: phone, payload: templatePayload }; return message; } catch (error) { console.error(error); throw new Error(`Error creating TelSpiel message: {error.message}`); } } // ... } ``` Ensure that you have appropriate error handling and logging in place. When calling `createTelSpielMessage`, remember that the function is now `async`, so you should handle it with `await` or `.then()` and `.catch()` methods to manage the Promise properly. Keep in mind that you must connect to MongoDB and ensure that the database operations are correctly handled. Moreover, the `TemplateModel.findOne` query assumes that your MongoDB documents include either `hospitalCode` or `corporateEntityCode`. If your document structure is different, you need to adjust the query accordingly. This outline gives you a direction to start implementing the required functionality. Be sure to test thoroughly and handle any edge cases or errors that might occur during database operations."},{"prompt":"#!/usr/bin/env python import rospy from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist import time rospy.init_node(\'move_bot_myplan\') pub = rospy.Publisher(\'/cmd_vel\', Twist, queue_size=1) rate = rospy.Rate(2) move = Twist() move.linear.x = 0.2 move.angular.z = 0 while not rospy.is_shutdown(): pub.publish(move) rate.sleep() set interval for 10 secoond then stop moving","completion":"To make the robot move for a set interval (10 seconds in this case) and then stop, you need to integrate a simple timing mechanism to keep track of the elapsed time. You can use the `time` module or `rospy.get_time()` for this purpose. In this code snippet, I will show you how to use `rospy.Time` for timing. This approach is better integrated within the ROS ecosystem. Here\'s an updated version of your script that will move the robot for 10 seconds and then stop: ```python #!/usr/bin/env python import rospy from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist from rospy import Rate # Initialize the move_bot_myplan node rospy.init_node(\'move_bot_myplan\') pub = rospy.Publisher(\'/cmd_vel\', Twist, queue_size=1) rate = Rate(2) move = Twist() move.linear.x = 0.2 move.angular.z = 0 # Start time for the movement start_time = rospy.Time.now() # Duration for which the robot will move move_duration = rospy.Duration(10) # 10 seconds while not rospy.is_shutdown(): current_time = rospy.Time.now() # Check if the current time is less than the start time plus the move duration if current_time < start_time + move_duration: # Robot moves pub.publish(move) else: # stop the robot by setting velocities to 0 move.linear.x = 0 move.angular.z = 0 pub.publish(move) break # Exit the loop rate.sleep() ``` In this code, after initializing the `rospy` node and the publisher, `start_time` is recorded using `rospy.Time.now()` and the intended movement duration is set using `rospy.Duration(10)` which effectively gives you a 10-second window in which the robot will move. The while loop runs, publishing your `move` message until `rospy.Time.now()` exceeds the `start_time` plus `move_duration`. After this time period is over, it sets the velocities to 0 to stop the robot and then exits the loop.

It worked by magnetizing particles on a strip of plastic film to represent data, with different patterns of magnetism representing binary information. Magnetic tapes allowed for much more information to be stored than punch cards and were widely used for backup, recording, and data transfer between computers. # 3. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) In 1956, IBM introduced the first hard disk drive (HDD), the IBM 305 RAMAC, which could store 5 million characters (about 5MB). The technology relied on magnetic storage principles, similar to magnetic tape, but with faster access times due to the rotating disks on which data was stored. # 4. Compact Disks (CDs) By the mid-1980s, optical storage, specifically Compact Discs (CDs), entered the market. They represented a major change as they were not subject to wear and tear the way magnetic tapes were, and could store up to about 700MB of data. CDs store data using tiny pits and landings burnt into the surface, which are then read using a laser. # 5. Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) and Blu-ray DVDs were introduced in 1995 as a successor to CDs, offering a significant increase in storage capacity, typically holding around 4.7GB. Following DVDs, Blu-ray discs were introduced in the early 2000s, further expanding storage capacity, with a single dual-layer disc able to hold up to 50GB of data. # 6. Flash Memory and Solid-State Drives (SSDs) Flash memory emerged in the 1980s and gained popularity with the advent of USB flash drives and memory cards in the early 2000s. Unlike previous magnetic storage devices, flash memory is non-volatile and doesn\'t have moving parts, making it more reliable and faster. Solid-State Drives (SSDs), using similar technology to flash memory, emerged as a faster and more robust alternative to traditional HDDs, as they also lack moving parts, are lighter, and consume less power. # 7. Cloud Storage With the expansion of the internet in the 21st century, cloud storage became a significant milestone. Instead of storing data on personal physical devices, users could store their information on remote servers accessed over the internet, providing flexibility, scalability, and convenience for data management. # Conclusion From punch card systems to cloud services, digital storage has progressed in response to increasing demands for capacity, speed, and reliability. As more data is generated every second, the evolution of digital storage continues, with new technologies such as holographic storage and DNA data storage being explored as potential future methods for data preservation in the digital age."},{"prompt":"Which are the best free cloud storage system","completion":"Several cloud storage services offer free tiers with varying amounts of storage space and features. As \\"best\\" can be subjective and dependent on individual needs and preferences, here are some of the notable free cloud storage systems as of my last update: 1. **Google Drive**: - Free storage: 15 GB (shared with other Google services like Gmail and Google Photos) - Easy integration with Google Workspace apps such as Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides 2. **Dropbox**: - Free storage: 2 GB - Known for its pioneering sync folder system and ease of use - Offers features such as file sharing and collaboration tools 3. **Microsoft OneDrive**: - Free storage: 5 GB - Integrated with Microsoft 365 and Windows - Allows for seamless file backups and collaboration within Office apps 4. **Apple iCloud**: - Free storage: 5 GB - Ideal for users invested in the Apple ecosystem - Offers seamless integration across macOS and iOS devices 5. **Mega**: - Free storage: 20 GB (with additional achievements system for more space) - Places a strong emphasis on security with end-to-end encryption 6. **pCloud**: - Free storage: 10 GB (can be expanded up to 20 GB through referrals and other promotions) - Offers a unique option to pay a one-time fee for lifetime storage if you decide to upgrade 7. **Box**: - Free storage: 10 GB - Focused more on enterprise solutions with robust features for collaboration 8. **MediaFire**: - Free storage: 10 GB (with the ability to earn more through referrals and other actions) - Allows for easy uploading and sharing of files 9. **Amazon Drive**: - Free storage: 5 GB (for files) + unlimited photo storage (for Amazon Prime members) - Convenient for Amazon users and those who need to store a large number of photos 10. **Sync.com**: - Free storage: 5 GB - Known for prioritizing security and privacy of data When choosing the best cloud storage for your needs, it\'s essential to consider various factors such as storage space, security, ease of use, platform compatibility, and additional features such as file sharing and collaboration tools. Always review the terms of service and any privacy concerns, and be aware that free tiers may have limitations such as bandwidth restrictions or reduced functionality compared to paid plans."},{"prompt":"Any unlimited cloud?","completion":"As of my last update, truly unlimited cloud storage is not commonly offered for free. Providers that do advertise \\"unlimited\\" storage typically reserve such plans for commercial or business customers and often have fair usage policies or other restrictions in place to prevent abuse. However, some services may provide unlimited cloud storage for specific types of data or under certain conditions: 1. **Google Photos** (Legacy Offer): Google used to offer unlimited high-quality photo and video backups for users of Google Photos, but this offer ended on June 1, 2021. If you\'ve been using the service to upload photos before that date, those uploads don\'t count towards your Google Drive storage quota. 2. **Amazon Photos**: Amazon Prime members get unlimited photo storage as part of their membership, in addition to 5GB for video and other file types. 3. **Education/Non-Profit Plans**: Some storage providers like Google Workspace for Education (formerly G Suite for Education) or Microsoft 365 Education offer unlimited storage to qualifying educational institutions and non-profit organizations. For personal use, unlimited cloud storage plans are generally not free and tend to come at a premium. It\'s also worth noting that the definition of \\"unlimited\\" may vary between providers, and users should be cautious of the fine print that might explain potential limitations or throttling at certain usage levels. With the rise of data usage and privacy concerns, many cloud storage providers focus on offering a set amount of data with clear terms of service and enhanced security features. Therefore, if you need a large amount of storage, it\'s often recommended to compare paid cloud storage plans from reputable providers to find one that best suits your needs and budget."},{"prompt":"What about telegram?","completion":"Telegram is a cloud-based messaging app known for its strong focus on security and privacy, but it also offers a unique approach to cloud storage. While it\'s primarily a messaging platform, Telegram allows users to send files up to 2 GB each to themselves (using \\"Saved Messages\\") or to others, which can be a form of cloud storage. Here\'s how Telegram can be used for storage: # Unlimited Storage for Messages and Files: - **Files of all types**: Telegram users can send various file types, including documents, photos, videos, and music. You can send files to others or to your own \\"Saved Messages,\\" which acts as a personal storage space. - **Access from multiple devices**: Because Telegram messages (and thus, files sent in these messages) are stored on Telegram\'s servers, you have access to them from any device on which you\'re logged into your account. - **Searchable**: You can search for messages and files within conversations or in the \\"Saved Messages,\\" making it easier to find what you\'ve stored. - **No Explicit Storage Limit**: While Telegram does not explicitly restrict the total storage capacity, each file can be a maximum of 2 GB in size as of my last update. You can theoretically store as many files as you want, as long as each file is within that size limitation. # But Keep in Mind: - **It\'s not a dedicated cloud storage service**: Telegram\'s primary function is messaging, so its storage features are not as robust as dedicated cloud storage services. You won\'t find advanced features like folder organization, file versioning, or backup tools. - **Privacy considerations**: Files shared on Telegram are encrypted while in transit and at rest on their servers, but they are not end-to-end encrypted unless shared in a \\"Secret Chat\\", which isn\'t accessible from multiple devices. - **Data retention policies**: Telegram might retain your data on its servers for as long as your account exists. If privacy is a concern, remember that messaging service data retention policies differ from conventional cloud storage services. - **Backup**: Because Telegram isn\'t meant to be used primarily for storage, it might not be the best option to back up important or sensitive files compared to solutions designed for that purpose, which often provide redundancy and backup guarantees. While Telegram offers a unique form of cloud storage, it\'s wise to keep in mind its limitations and to remember that it\'s not a full replacement for dedicated cloud storage services. For important data, always consider using a service specifically tailored for secure data backup and storage."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Natsuki, are you alright?

As we dive into the latest craze sweeping across the nation, one can\'t help but feel the electric atmosphere generated by a simple beverage — a concoction now known by all as Prime. From crowded city bars to quiet suburban backyards, an innocuous can of this enigmatic drink has sparked both delight and discord among the masses in a phenomenon I\'ve begun to refer to as \\"The Prime Wars.\\" It all started with a cryptic social media post. A sought-after influencer flaunted a neon-green can, claiming to have discovered the elixir of the gods. The cryptic hashtag #FindThePrime created a viral buzz that would shame a hornet\'s nest. Lines formed around the block with people desperate for a sip, and stores sold out within hours. What is it about Prime that\'s sending everyone into a frenzy? Firstly, the taste: an enigmatic fusion of tropical fruits with a hint of fizz, some describe it as heaven in a liquid form. As for the recipe? Top secret. The creators of Prime have managed to keep the ingredient list under wraps, further fueling curiosity amongst consumers and competitors alike. Secondly, the exclusivity: the infamous \\"golden ticket\\" marketing tactic. Only a select few Prime cans contain a code under the tab, granting access to star-studded Prime events or a year\'s supply of the coveted drink. This Willy Wonka-esque approach has only intensified people\'s Prime passions. Now, let\'s talk about the battles erupting in the streets. Friendly competitions at local pubs have escalated into city-wide tournaments with participants elbow-to-elbow, engaging in chugging contests and Prime can stacking battles. Social media challenges trend daily, with Prime enthusiasts showcasing their creativity and, frankly, their fanatic obsession with the beverage. The skirmishes, however, are not all lighthearted. I\'ve witnessed heated arguments in supermarket aisles over the last six-pack, and office watercoolers have become battlefields where alliances are drawn along Prime preference lines. Are you a purist who prefers it ice-cold straight from the can? Or perhaps a mixologist who uses Prime as the base for avant-garde cocktails? Celebrities have joined the fray, endorsing their chosen way to consume Prime, further dividing fans into fervent subsects. On a positive note, Prime\'s surge in popularity has led to charity fundraisers, with proceeds from the limited-edition flavors going to various causes. The desire to \'do good\' has become a harmonizing force in the Prime-drenched landscape. Yet, can this mania sustain itself? Can a single drink continue to unify and divide with such potency? One thing is certain, Prime isn\'t just a beverage; it\'s a cultural phenomenon — a carbonated catalyst for camaraderie and competition. As I wrap up this blog post, a neighbor has triumphantly hoisted their flag outside — it\'s a homemade Prime banner. So whether or not you\'ve pledged allegiance to the Prime craze, remember to savor your sips, and let\'s hope that when the fizz settles, we\'ll all raise a can to a nation quenched and united by our odd obsession over this mysterious drink. Cheers, or should I say, Prime\'s up!"},{"prompt":"Write an episode of Hetalia where the Allies bump into the Axis while on a road trip.

England\'s classic 1950s station wagon chugs steadily along a narrow country road, its green paint chipped and faded from years of adventures. The Allies are crammed inside, ready for another day\'s journey. Inside the car, England, with his peppery hair barely contained under a driving cap, grips the wheel tightly while casting an occasional disapproving glance towards America, who struggles with a large, unfolded map. \\"I don\'t need your newfangled directions, America. I know these roads like the back of my hand,\\" England grumbles. \\"Sure, but we could get there faster with a shortcut!\\" America says, his finger tracing a route that would lead them straight through an uncharted forest. Russia, sprawling in the back seat amidst a tangle of long limbs, snores softly, while China is deeply engrossed in a comic book, occasionally muttering about the inaccuracies in the depiction of dragons. France, sporting suave sunglasses, sits comfortably, nodding his head to the ever-so-smooth chanson music that fills the car\'s interior. As the group bickers and chats, a distinct rumbling begins to grow louder, catching their attention. Up ahead, a 1940s motorcycle with a side-car emerges over the horizon, dust trailing behind it. Germany, clad in goggles and a steel helmet that reflects the sunlight, tightens his grip on the handlebars as the breeze whips past him. The side-car, devoid of Japan, who\'s enjoying a sunny getaway in Hawaii, is stacked with maps and supplies. The two groups approach each other at a crossroads, where an ancient traffic light flickers indecisively between colors. England steps on the brakes, bringing the station wagon to a rolling stop just as the motorcycle pulls up alongside them. \\"For heaven\'s sake, what are you doing here?\\" England splutters, incredulous. Without removing his goggles, Germany leans over and coolly replies, \\"We could ask you the same. Were you planning on commandeering the entire road, England?\\" At the sound of Germany\'s voice, Russia wakes up, squinting through the windows. \\"Oh, it\'s you. I thought we were encountering a local parade,\\" he jokes, his voice thick with sleep. America folds the map with a flourish, leaning out the window. \\"Hey, Germany, where\'s Japan? Lost him back in the 1940s?\\" Germany, unamused, retorts crisply, \\"He\'s developing his photography skills in Hawaii. Unlike some, he knows how to appreciate the finer things.\\" France finally pulls off his headphones, a smile playing on his lips. \\"Well, isn\'t this quaint? The Axis and Allies, crossing paths in the countryside. What are the odds?\\" China looks up from his comic book with a smirk. \\"Seems like fate has a sense of humor. Or a terrible sense of direction.\\" The atmosphere is one of uneasy camaraderie as the two groups remain stopped at the crossroads. The traffic light finally decides on red, and both vehicles make an unspoken agreement to wait it out. After a moment of awkward silence, England clears his throat. \\"Well, shall we make this interesting? First one to reach the next town buys the other team dinner.\\" \\"Ah, a challenge!\\" Germany\'s expression hardens into one of determination. \\"You\'re on, England. Prepare your wallet.\\" With a nod, both parties ready their vehicles. The light switches to green, and with a screech of tires and a roar of engines, the Allies and the Axis speed off in a cloud of dust and adrenaline. The countryside blurs into a smear of colors as they weave through the roads, neither side willing to concede. Laughter and shouts ring through the air as the impromptu race sets friendship and rivalry alight, etching another chapter in the animated history of Hetalia."},{"prompt":"is his are valid in this contract or invalid review and prove them with evidence Implement direct user interaction for staking and withdrawing high severity, medium likelihood To mitigate the risk associated with the centralized operator role, modify the stake and withdraw functions to allow users to directly stake and withdraw their funds without the need for operator intervention. This change will empower users to maintain control over their funds and reduce the risk of misuse by a compromised operator account. Example: function stake(uint256 amount) external updateReward(msg.sender) { require(amount > 0, \\"Cannot stake 0\\"); _totalSupply += amount; _balances[msg.sender] += amount; emit Staked(msg.sender, amount); } function withdraw(uint256 amount) external updateReward(msg.sender) { require(amount > 0, \\"Cannot withdraw 0\\"); require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount, \\"Insufficient balance\\"); _totalSupply -= amount; _balances[msg.sender] -= amount; emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount); } Why: Allowing users to directly interact with the staking and withdrawal functions eliminates the risk of a single point of failure and potential abuse of power by the operator. This change aligns with the principle of decentralization in blockchain systems and enhances the trustworthiness of the contract. Introduce emergency withdrawal mechanism high severity, medium likelihood To provide users with a way to retrieve their funds in case the operator role is compromised or the contract behaves unexpectedly, implement an emergency withdrawal function. This function should allow users to withdraw their staked tokens without relying on the operator\'s permission. Example: function emergencyWithdraw() external { uint256 amount = _balances[msg.sender]; require(amount > 0, \\"No funds to withdraw\\"); _totalSupply -= amount; _balances[msg.sender] = 0; IERC20(rewardsToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount); emit EmergencyWithdrawal(msg.sender, amount); } Why: An emergency withdrawal feature is a critical safety mechanism that allows users to regain control of their funds if the contract\'s normal operations are disrupted. This feature is particularly important in decentralized applications where trust in the operator or the contract\'s code is essential. By providing this mechanism, users can have increased confidence in the security of their investments. Add multi-signature requirement for operator actions medium severity, medium likelihood To reduce the risk of a single operator account having unilateral control over user funds, implement a multi-signature requirement for critical functions that the operator can perform. This will distribute trust and require multiple parties to agree on an action before it can be executed. Example: import \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/security/MultisigWallet.sol\\"; // In the contract, use a multisig wallet for the operator role address public operatorMultisigWallet; // When setting the operator, ensure it\'s a multisig wallet address function setOperator(address _operatorMultisigWallet) external onlyOwner { require(_operatorMultisigWallet != address(0), \\"Zero address not allowed\\"); operatorMultisigWallet = _operatorMultisigWallet; emit OperatorUpdated(_operatorMultisigWallet); } // For functions that require operator permission, check that the request comes from the multisig wallet modifier onlyOperator() { require(msg.sender == operatorMultisigWallet, \\"Caller is not the operator multisig wallet\\"); _; } Why: A multi-signature requirement ensures that no single individual or entity can perform sensitive actions without the consent of other stakeholders. This is a common security practice in the management of funds and operations in decentralized systems, as it significantly reduces the risk of theft or misuse of funds due to a compromised operator account. Implement role-based access control medium severity, medium likelihood Replace the binary onlyOwner and onlyOperator roles with a more granular role-based access control system using OpenZeppelin\'s AccessControl. This will allow for better management of permissions and can help prevent misuse of privileged functions. Example: import \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol\\"; contract VirtualStakingRewards is AccessControl { // Define roles with unique bytes32 identifiers bytes32 public constant STAKER_ROLE = keccak256(\\"STAKER_ROLE\\"); bytes32 public constant REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE = keccak256(\\"REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE\\"); // In the constructor, set up roles constructor() { _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender); _setupRole(STAKER_ROLE, msg.sender); // Assign the deployer the initial staker role _setupRole(REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE, rewardsDistribution); } // Use hasRole in function modifiers to check for permissions modifier onlyStaker() { require(hasRole(STAKER_ROLE, msg.sender), \\"Caller is not a staker\\"); _; } // ... rest of the contract } Why: Role-based access control (RBAC) provides a flexible and secure way to manage permissions within a contract. It allows for the definition of specific roles with granular permissions, reducing the risk of a single account having too much control. RBAC also makes it easier to update and manage permissions as the project evolves, without requiring significant changes to the contract\'s code. here i sthe contract // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity 0.8.19; import \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\\"; import \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\\"; import \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol\\"; import \\"../interfaces/IVirtualStakingRewards.sol\\"; contract VirtualStakingRewards is IVirtualStakingRewards, Ownable { using SafeERC20 for IERC20; error ZeroAddress(); error ZeroAmount(); error Forbidden(address sender); error RewardPeriodNotFinished(); error InsufficientRewards(); /* ========== STATE VARIABLES ========== */ address public rewardsDistribution; address public operator; address public immutable rewardsToken; uint256 public periodFinish; uint256 public rewardRate; uint256 public rewardsDuration = 7 days; uint256 public lastUpdateTime; uint256 public rewardPerTokenStored; mapping(address => uint256) public userRewardPerTokenPaid; mapping(address => uint256) public rewards; uint256 private _totalSupply; mapping(address => uint256) private _balances; /* ========== MODIFIERS ========== */ modifier onlyRewardsDistribution() { if (msg.sender != rewardsDistribution) { revert Forbidden(msg.sender); } _; } modifier onlyOperator() { if (msg.sender != operator) { revert Forbidden(msg.sender); } _; } modifier updateReward(address account) { rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken(); lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable(); if (account != address(0)) { rewards[account] = earned(account); userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored; } _; } /* ========== CONSTRUCTOR ========== */ constructor(address _rewardsDistribution, address _rewardsToken) { if (_rewardsToken == address(0) || _rewardsDistribution == address(0)) { revert ZeroAddress(); } rewardsToken = _rewardsToken; rewardsDistribution = _rewardsDistribution; } /* ========== VIEWS ========== */ function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256) { return _totalSupply; } function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256) { return _balances[account]; } function lastTimeRewardApplicable() public view returns (uint256) { return block.timestamp < periodFinish ?

RBAC also makes it easier to update and manage permissions as the project evolves, without requiring significant changes to the contract\'s code.","completion":"Let\'s review the suggestions made for the `VirtualStakingRewards` contract to see if they would be valid improvements: 1. **Direct User Interaction for Staking and Withdrawing** - Currently, the `stake` and `withdraw` functions are restricted to the `onlyOperator` modifier. This means that only the operator can perform staking and withdrawing on behalf of the users. - The suggestion is to modify these functions to allow direct interaction by the users, making the process decentralized and more secure against a single point of failure—namely, the centralized control of the operator. - The provided example code for both `stake` and `withdraw` functions is valid, and if implemented, would indeed remove operator control and allow users to directly engage with their funds. 2. **Emergency Withdrawal Mechanism** - The existing contract does not have an `emergencyWithdraw` function. In the event the operator is compromised, users would not have a way to retrieve their staked assets without the operator\'s intervention. - The example given for the `emergencyWithdraw` function enables users to withdraw all their staked tokens without interaction with the operator. This is a valid and common safety feature in many smart contracts to ensure users can always access their funds. 3. **Multi-signature Requirement for Operator Actions** - The contract as provided uses a single-operator model and does not mention the implementation of a multi-signature mechanism. - Multi-signature functionality would involve multiple parties before executing sensitive functions, adding an extra layer of security and decentralization. The example given introduces the use of a multisig wallet for the operator role, which is a valid recommendation for enhancing the contract\'s security. However, implementing this would require expanding the contract to interact with a multi-signature wallet, such as OpenZeppelin\'s `MultisigWallet`, or changing the operator logic to support interactions from a multi-signature wallet. 4. **Role-Based Access Control** - The contract uses a simple access control mechanism with `onlyOwner` and `onlyOperator` modifiers. As projects grow, these binary access controls can become limiting. - Utilizing OpenZeppelin\'s `AccessControl` system offers a more refined, role-based access control that allows for multiple roles with specific permissions. The proposed change would enable better governance and flexibility over the contract\'s permissions. - The example code snippet is a valid illustration of how `AccessControl` could be implemented. Each function could then use specific role checks through custom modifiers, further decentralizing the control over various contract functions. In conclusion, the proposed changes could materially improve the contract by making it more user-centric and by reducing the risk of centralized control and misuse by operators. Each of the examples provided demonstrates a common pattern or best practice in smart contract development for achieving these improvements. However, actual implementation would need to be carefully tested and audited to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not introduced in the process. If these features are desired, the contract creator would need to update the code according to the examples provided, and ensure correct integration with any external contracts or libraries leveraged (such as a multisig wallet)."},{"prompt":"which one is valid give that with evidence","completion":"To determine which recommendations and example implementations are valid for the provided `VirtualStakingRewards` contract given the current context and code, let\'s assess each suggestion again with attention to the current design of the contract: 1. **Direct User Interaction for Staking and Withdrawing**: - **Validity**: **Valid**. - **Evidence**: The existing contract\'s `stake` and `withdraw` functions are restricted by the `onlyOperator` modifier, which means that only the operator can call these functions on behalf of users. The proposed change to remove the `onlyOperator` constraint is valid as it aligns with the usual patterns of decentralized protocols, where users control their funds without intermediaries. - **Example Code Evidence**: The example code provided for the `stake` and `withdraw` functions works as intended by checking for non-zero amounts and managing the internal accounting (`_totalSupply` and `_balances`) without an `onlyOperator` modifier. 2. **Emergency Withdrawal Mechanism**: - **Validity**: **Valid**. - **Evidence**: The current contract lacks a mechanism for users to unilaterally withdraw their funds in the event of an emergency or operator compromise. The proposed `emergencyWithdraw` function adds this capability, letting users withdraw their full balance directly. - **Example Code Evidence**: The implementation example for `emergencyWithdraw` checks for a positive balance and transfers the user\'s staked tokens back to them, setting their staked balance to zero, which correctly follows smart contract safety practices. 3. **Multi-signature Requirement for Operator Actions**: - **Validity**: **Valid** (if using a multisig wallet). - **Evidence**: The current contract does not support multi-signature requirements for operator actions. Adding such a requirement involves an architectural change that could enhance the contract\'s security profile by distributing authority over critical functions. - **Example Code Evidence**: The suggested code requires replacing the current single-operator model with a multi-signature wallet setup. While the example correctly checks if the caller is the multisig wallet, other parts of the contract would potentially need changes to be fully compatible with multi-signature operations, including possibly refactoring functions and their modifiers. 4. **Role-Based Access Control**: - **Validity**: **Valid**. - **Evidence**: The contract uses an operator model for restricted actions, which could lead to a central point of authority. Introducing RBAC adds fine-grained control over the contract\'s functions and can enhance its ability to evolve without re-deployment. - **Example Code Evidence**: The code snippet demonstrates how OpenZeppelin\'s `AccessControl` can be implemented to create diverse roles (`STAKER_ROLE`, `REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE`) for managing permissions. This mechanism allows for more nuanced permission setting than the current binary `onlyOwner` and `onlyOperator` model used in the contract. To sum up, all of the suggestions provided are valid and represent common practices for increasing the security and decentralization of smart contracts. The examples given illustrate how these changes could be implemented. However, adopting these recommendations would require careful consideration, testing, and potentially additional modifications to ensure compatibility and security within the existing contract structure."},{"prompt":"give the vulnerable line with code and explain the vulnerability with evidence to confirm are correct","completion":"For the contract provided, let\'s identify potential vulnerabilities: 1. **Centralized Control in Staking and Withdrawing** Vulnerable lines: ```solidity function stake(address user, uint256 amount) external updateReward(user) onlyOperator { // ... } function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) public updateReward(user) onlyOperator { // ... } ``` Vulnerability: - These functions are restricted to being called by the `onlyOperator` modifier, which means that the operator has exclusive control over staking and withdrawing user funds. In the event of a compromise of the operator\'s account, this design could lead to the loss or theft of funds. Evidence for vulnerability: - The `onlyOperator` modifier restricts the execution of these functions to the address stored in the `operator` state variable. If the contract is deployed as is, without further decentralization mechanisms, user funds are at risk if the operator\'s private key is compromised. 2. **Lack of Emergency Withdrawal Mechanism** Since the `VirtualStakingRewards` contract does not include an emergency withdrawal function within the code shared, we cannot point out a particular vulnerable line. The absence of such a feature itself represents a vulnerability. Vulnerability: - Users have no method to withdraw their funds in emergency situations where the operator cannot perform its duties or is compromised. Evidence for vulnerability: - An analysis of the entire contract shows that there is no fallback method for users to withdraw their staked tokens independently of the operator. 3. **Single Account Operator Risk** Vulnerable lines: ```solidity modifier onlyOperator() { if (msg.sender != operator) { revert Forbidden(msg.sender); } _; } ``` Vulnerability: - This modifier enforces that only the designated operator can carry out critical functions. If the operator account is compromised, the attacker could potentially manipulate the staking and reward mechanisms to their advantage. Evidence for vulnerability: - The modifier `onlyOperator` checks if the `msg.sender` (caller of the function) is equal to the `operator`. This check does not involve any multi-sig or consensus mechanism, putting a lot of trust in a single account. 4. **Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** Again, since the contract uses a simple owner and operator access control pattern without RBAC, we can\'t pinpoint a specific vulnerable line but the concept itself is a vulnerability. Vulnerability: - The contract\'s current access control is binary with `onlyOwner` and `onlyOperator`. It lacks the flexibility and security of a role-based access control system, where actions can be distributed among different roles with specific, limited permissions.

What can you say about the conflict between Minami Nanami and Aoi Hinami?","completion":"\\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun,\\" also known as \\"Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki,\\" is a Japanese light novel series written by Yūki Yaku. It follows the life of Fumiya Tomozaki, a high school student who is one of the best players in Japan at a video game called \\"Tackfam,\\" but struggles with social interactions and the \\"game\\" of real life. Aoi Hinami is one of the main characters and is considered perfect both in academics and social situations. She becomes something of a mentor to Tomozaki, teaching him how to improve his social standings by treating life like a game. Minami Nanami, also known as \\"Mimimi,\\" is another character in the series. She is a cheerful and popular girl who is also part of the student council. The conflict between Minami Nanami and Aoi Hinami typically revolves around their contrasting approaches to life and competition for positions, such as during student council elections. Minami is portrayed as someone who works extremely hard but tends to be overshadowed by Aoi\'s natural talents and effortless perfection. This dynamic can create tension and rivalry between them, often revolving around their self-worth and the roles they play within their school\'s social hierarchy. Despite the competitive aspects, their interaction showcases various themes such as the pressure of being at the top, the struggles of seemingly always coming in second, and the different ways people handle their insecurities and ambitions. As the characters develop, so do their relationships and perspectives on life, competition, and friendship. The series explores the complexities of adolescence and personal growth, often using the metaphor of life as a game that can be mastered with the right strategies."},{"prompt":"Did Aoi do the right thing in the school election by stealing the idea from Minami?","completion":"In \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun\\" (or \\"Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki\\"), the issue with Aoi Hinami using an idea from Minami Nanami for the student council election presents a morally complex scenario. The essence of the conflict can be understood through analyzing the motivations, intentions, and the impact of the actions on the characters involved. Whether Aoi did the \\"right\\" thing by adopting, or as some may view it, \\"stealing\\" Minami\'s idea is subjective and can depend on various perspectives: 1. **From a strict ethical standpoint:** Taking someone else\'s idea without permission and using it as your own is generally considered wrong and can be seen as a form of intellectual theft. 2. **From a competitive perspective:** In the context of an election, many might argue that all\'s fair in love and war, and politics often involve adapting and refining ideas from various sources. Some viewers may perceive Aoi\'s action as a shrewd strategic move rather than a moral misstep. 3. **From a storytelling perspective:** This action adds depth to Aoi\'s character, showing that even someone who seems perfect is flawed and may take questionable actions to maintain their position. It also contributes to the dynamic between Aoi and Minami, highlighting themes like ambition, rivalry, and the pressures of maintaining a top status. Each character\'s response to the situation also contributes to their growth and the narrative\'s progression. While the series doesn\'t make a definitive statement about what is absolutely right or wrong, actions like these are intended to prompt the viewers or readers to contemplate the nuances of ethical decision-making. It\'s important not only to evaluate Aoi\'s actions in isolation but to consider their repercussions within the relationships between characters and their personal development throughout the story. Understanding Aoi\'s character and her relationship with Tomozaki, as well as how she reconciles her own ambitions with her sense of right and wrong, is crucial to unpacking this conflict."},{"prompt":"But Minami was mad at Aoi for losing the election because of her.","completion":"If Minami Nanami was upset with Aoi Hinami due to losing the student council election as a result of Aoi\'s actions, it\'s easy to empathize with Minami\'s feelings of frustration and betrayal. Matters like school elections can be significant to high school students, as they are often seen as a measure of popularity and capability. Here\'s a breakdown of the emotions at play: 1. **Feeling of Betrayal:** Minami may feel betrayed because Aoi used an idea she had shared, leading to a direct loss for Minami. This kind of betrayal can harm their friendship and trust. 2. **Sense of Injustice:** Minami likely believes in competing fairly. If she perceives Aoi\'s use of her idea without credit as dishonest or unjust, this would understandably lead to anger and disappointment. 3. **Inferiority and Vulnerability:** Minami may also experience feelings of inferiority, as she was already depicted as someone who puts in significant effort but tends to be overshadowed by Aoi\'s natural abilities. The election incident could make her feel even more vulnerable. Aoi\'s actions, whether strategic or otherwise, have consequences for her relationships, particularly with Minami. The conflict serves as a pivotal point in the story, impacting character development and potentially offering lessons about ethics, competition, and the value of reconciling one\'s actions with one\'s conscience. It challenges the characters to reflect on their actions and their view of success, further deepening the narrative\'s exploration of what it means to \\"win\\" in life\'s various games."},{"prompt":"Minami became the second most popular girl in school, although she was first and foremost until Aoi displaced her. Was Minami right to tell herself that she didn\'t have to be popular?","completion":"In \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun,\\" Minami Nanami grappling with her popularity and its changes reflects a common theme in coming-of-age stories, where characters must deal with the pressures of social standing and self-identity. When Minami tells herself that she doesn\'t have to be popular, it can be viewed as both a defensive mechanism and a healthy reassessment of values, depending on the context. Here are some considerations in evaluating Minami\'s stance: 1. **Personal Growth and Self-Value:** Recognizing that one\'s self-worth isn\'t solely determined by popularity can be a sign of personal growth. If Minami\'s self-affirmation helps her find value in herself beyond her social rank, it is a positive reinforcement of self-worth that goes deeper than external validation. 2. **Coping with Disappointment:** Telling herself she doesn\'t need to be popular might also be a way for Minami to cope with the disappointment of being displaced by Aoi. It can be a form of rationalization to protect her self-esteem from the emotional impact of losing a valued status. 3. **Shifting Priorities:** As characters in stories like this mature, they often reassess what\'s truly important to them. For Minami, this could mean shifting focus from the pursuit of popularity to other goals and sources of happiness, such as personal achievements, friendships, or other interests. In narratives about adolescence, such moments often serve as turning points that propel characters toward new understandings and more profound life choices. Whether Minami is right or not in consoling herself with the notion that she doesn\'t need to be popular is subjective. However, this realization is crucial for her character\'s development, as it highlights an essential journey from external validation to intrinsic self-acceptance. Ultimately, the story suggests that while popularity in high school can seem paramount, the characters learn that there are other, perhaps more fulfilling, aspects to life and personal achievement. Minami\'s journey can inspire readers to think about the true sources of happiness and the complex dynamics that govern self-esteem and social interactions during our formative years."},{"prompt":"If I were Minami, I would hate the person who took away the first place in popularity and would do everything possible to make that person lose that place, because you can\'t let anyone take away what has always rightfully belonged only to you.","completion":"It\'s natural to have strong feelings when facing a situation where something you value is taken away, especially by someone you know. Feelings of anger, resentment, and the desire for retaliation can surface when we perceive an injustice or feel threatened. However, it\'s important to consider the broader implications of acting on such emotions: 1. **Ethics and Integrity:** Seeking revenge or attempting to undermine someone else for personal gain can compromise one\'s ethics and integrity. It\'s valuable to consider whether the end justifies the means and what kind of person you want to be. 2. **Relationships:** Relationships can be significantly damaged by acts of retaliation. Friendships, trust, and respect might be irreparably harmed if one acts on vindictive impulses. 3. **Long-term Consequences:** Actions taken in anger or jealousy can have long-lasting, negative consequences that may outweigh the temporary satisfaction of \\"getting back\\" at someone. It is often more productive to channel those emotions into self-improvement or other positive endeavors. 4. **Self-Reflection:** When someone surpasses you in popularity or any other area, it might be worth reflecting on why this matters so much to you, what you can learn from it, and how you can grow from the experience. 5. **Personal Growth:** Facing adversities like losing a status can help foster resilience and personal growth. It can encourage you to find self-worth in internal qualities rather than external validation. In the context of \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun,\\" characters like Minami face similar emotional challenges and have to navigate complex social dynamics. Throughout the story, they learn about themselves and grow through their experiences—including dealing with loss and reevaluating what\'s truly important to them. In a real-world scenario, it is more fruitful to focus on personal growth and constructive ways to deal with setbacks rather than holding onto grudges or seeking revenge. Seeking to harm others for personal gain can lead to a negative cycle that hurts everyone involved, including oneself. Remember, every character in a story and every person in real life has their own journey, and often, by focusing on personal development rather than rivalry, we can achieve a more fulfilling and peaceful life."},{"prompt":"You can write a chapter for a light novel based on this conflict in the style of Japanese light novels.","completion":"**Note:** Following is a fictional light novel-style excerpt inspired by the themes and character dynamics from \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun.\\" Please keep in mind that this is not an excerpt from the actual novel series, but a creative interpretation of the situation poised in your question. --- Chapter 8: The Fall and Rise of a Star In the azure canvas of the high school skyline, Minami Nanami, once the brightest of stars, felt her luminescence wane. Her title as the zenith of popularity had slipped, ever so slightly, yet decisively, into the hands of Aoi Hinami—the girl with the flawless smile and a tactical mind that played the social game like a grandmaster. The student council room buzzed with the usual after-school chatter, missed only by the empty chair at the corner. Minami lingered at the doorway, hesitating. The echoes of cheerful voices were a reminder of a presence she now felt alien to. How frail the pedestal of popularity was, she mused, for it to crumble with a mere whisper of defeat. The campaign posters still adorned the walls, haunting relics of a battle where strategy overshadowed sincerity. Aoi\'s winning agenda, the very mirror of Minami\'s heart-spilled proposal, was the checkmate she hadn\'t seen coming. Betrayal? Perhaps. A lesson in naivety? Certainly. A soft hand over her shoulder. She flinched, turning to find Erika, her ever-loyal friend. \\"You\'re simmering,\\" Erika said with gentle jest, reading Minami\'s storm-cloud expression. Minami forced a smile. \\"Am I that obvious?\\" \\"Only to me. You should tell her, you know. Confront Aoi.\\" The thought had swirled in her mind like a private whirlpool, each swirl edged with knives of frustration and injustice. \\"I won\'t stoop to pettiness,\\" Minami whispered, more to convince herself than to declare her stance. Erika sighed, her arm now wrapping around Minami\'s back in a half-hug. \\"The Mimimi I know wouldn\'t let anyone cloud her shine.\\" Minami glanced at her reflection in the glass pane opposite them. Mimimi. The effervescent, untouchable, cheerful girl who raced ahead with unshakable resolve. But could she resent Aoi, plot against her, when their shared laughter and candid moments floated in the back of her mind? \\"No,\\" Minami finally said, breaking free from Erika\'s hold. \\"My worth isn\'t a throne to be defended. It\'s a garden to cultivate. I\'ll grow anew, not because I\'ve fallen, but because that\'s what stars do—they transform.\\" With newfound determination, she strode into the council room, her confident steps a drumbeat to a new beginning. She caught Aoi\'s gaze, expected the usual poised nod, but found, surprisingly, a hint of apology. For a fleeting second, their eyes held a silent conversation of warriors who had crossed swords and emerged wiser. Minami took her place among her peers, her chair no longer a throne of isolation. She smiled, genuine and free, ready to weave a different kind of legacy—one not set by the fickle court of high school popularity, but by the unyielding tenacity of her own soul. Every setback a new chapter, every flaw a facet of her unbreakable spirit. And as the council meeting commenced, Minami Nanami\'s star began to rise again, not above others, but within herself, brighter than ever. --- **End of Chapter 8** --- This improvised excerpt captures the emotional turmoil that Minami faces, her introspective struggle, and her ultimate decision to redefine her sense of self-worth that isn\'t based on popularity. This aligns with many themes that are prevalent in Japanese light novels, such as personal growth, resilience, and finding strength in adversity."},{"prompt":"I\'m working on a project called `medics Communication Server`, which is a communication platform for different medics apps and patients. It allows them to communicate through various channels like text messages, emails, and WhatsApp. The server handles the sending of messages, logs all the details for future analysis, and provides a consolidated response to the client. The project structure is as follows: ``` . ├── controllers │ ├── configuration.controller.js │ ├── index.js │ └── messenger.controller.js ├── log ├── models │ ├── configurations.model.js │ ├── index.js │ └── message_logs.model.js ├── public ├── services │ ├── email │ │ ├── GmailServiceProvider.js │ │ └── OutlookServiceProvider.js │ ├── sms │ │ └── UnicelServiceProvider.js │ ├── whatsapp │ │ ├── GupshupServiceProvider.js │ │ └── TelSpielServiceProvider.js │ ├── HTTPService.js │ ├── ServiceProviderFactory.js │ └── logger.js ├── ReadMe ├── config.json ├── medics-communication-server.js ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── routes.js ``` In this project, I have a service provider for WhatsApp called `TelSpielServiceProvider`. This service provider has a function `createTelSpielMessage` that creates a message payload based on the provided message details and configuration. However, different clients use different templates for the same template name, and these templates have different payloads. Here\'s the current implementation of the `TelSpielServiceProvider`: ```javascript const HttpService = require(\\"../HTTPService\\"); // Update the path accordingly const Logger = require(\'../logger.js\'); class TelSpielServiceProvider { // Function to send a TelSpiel message async sendMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { try { // Create the TelSpiel message based on the provided details const message = this.createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration); // Log the message details before sending Logger.info(`Sending TelSpiel message to {messageDetails.phone}: {JSON.stringify(message)}`); // Send the message via TelSpiel API const response = await this.sendTelSpielMessage(message, configuration); // Log the response after sending Logger.info(`TelSpiel response for message to {messageDetails.phone}: {JSON.stringify(response)}`); return response; } catch (error) { console.error(error); Logger.error(`Error sending TelSpiel message: {error.message}`); throw new Error(`Error sending TelSpiel message: {error.message}`); } } // Function to send a TelSpiel message via the TelSpiel API async sendTelSpielMessage(message, configuration) { try { const url = configuration.url; // Use axios to make the POST request const response = await HttpService.post(url, message, { \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\', }); return response.data; } catch (error) { console.error(error); throw new Error(`Error sending TelSpiel message via API: {error.message}`); } } // Function to create a TelSpiel message based on the provided message details createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { const { phone, content, attachment, attachmentURL, attachmentName } = messageDetails; // Define a generic message structure const message = { phoneNumber: phone, payload: { namespace: configuration.nameSpace, language: { policy: \'deterministic\', code: \'en\', }, }, }; if (attachment && attachment !== \'NULL\') { // For media messages message.payload.components = [ { type: \'header\', parameters: [ { type: \'video\', // can be image, pdf or any document type video: { link: attachmentURL, }, }, ], }, ]; message.payload.name = \'media_template\'; } else { // For text-based messages message.payload.components = [ { type: \'body\', parameters: [ { type: \'text\', text: content, }, ], }, ]; message.payload.name = \'text_template\'; } return message; } } module.exports = TelSpielServiceProvider; ``` I want to make the `createTelSpielMessage` function more generic to handle different templates. The idea is to store these templates in a MongoDB collection and fetch the appropriate template based on the `hospitalCode`, `corporateEntityCode`, and `templateName` when creating a message. If a template is not found for a given `hospitalCode`, the function should try fetching by `corporateEntityCode`. If it\'s still not found, it should fall back to a default `hospitalCode` called \'PRODUCT\'. Could you please help me modify the `createTelSpielMessage` function to implement this functionality?\\"","completion":"To implement the required functionality, you will need to interact with MongoDB to fetch the desired templates. Assuming you have a MongoDB collection for these templates, you will first want to create a function that fetches the templates from the database. Then, you\'ll modify your `createTelSpielMessage` function to use this new method to dynamically obtain the appropriate template. Firstly, let\'s write a function to fetch the template from the MongoDB collection: ```javascript const mongodb = require(\'./mongodb\'); // Replace with your actual MongoDB connection logic async function fetchTemplate(hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode, templateName) { let template = null; // Try to get template by hospitalCode template = await mongodb.collection(\'templates\').findOne({ type: \'whatsapp\', templateName, hospitalCode }); if (!template && corporateEntityCode) { // Try to get template by corporateEntityCode template = await mongodb.collection(\'templates\').findOne({ type: \'whatsapp\', templateName, corporateEntityCode }); } if (!template) { // Fallback to default template with \'PRODUCT\' as hospitalCode template = await mongodb.collection(\'templates\').findOne({ type: \'whatsapp\', templateName, hospitalCode: \'PRODUCT\' }); } return template; } ``` Then you incorporate the `fetchTemplate` function into the `createTelSpielMessage` function: ```javascript class TelSpielServiceProvider { // ... other methods ... async createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { const { phone, content, attachment, attachmentURL, attachmentName, hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode, templateName } = messageDetails; // Fetch the template from the MongoDB collection const template = await fetchTemplate(hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode, templateName); if (!template) { throw new Error(`Template {templateName} not found for hospital code {hospitalCode} and corporate entity code {corporateEntityCode}`); } // Create the message payload based on the fetched template const message = { phoneNumber: phone, payload: { namespace: configuration.nameSpace, language: { policy: \'deterministic\', code: \'en\', }, components: template.components, // Use the components from the fetched template name: template.name // Use the template name from the fetched template }, }; return message; } } ``` Make sure that the `template` object includes the appropriate fields (like `components` and `name`) and that the MongoDB connection logic matches the actual implementation you use. Keep in mind that this code assumes you have established your MongoDB connection details somewhere else in your project and that you have the appropriate schema for your `templates` collection. Error handling might also be extended, such as handling possible connection issues with MongoDB and ensuring the application\'s stability in the event that the database is temporarily unreachable."},{"prompt":"i\'m using this service only after connecting to my mongodb connection from the start file. So is it required to connect again here ?","completion":"No, if you already establish a MongoDB connection at the beginning of your application and maintain it, you don\'t need to reconnect each time you access the database in your service files. Instead, you should use the established connection or a database client that has been made available globally or passed through the context of your application. Typically, you\'d set up your MongoDB client in a main file (like an `app.js` or `server.js`), and then make it accessible to the other parts of your application. This can be done in a few different ways: 1. **Dependency Injection**: Pass the client or database connection to other modules as an argument. 2. **Singleton Pattern**: Create a module that initializes the connection and can be required wherever the connection is needed, returning the same instance. 3. **Global Variable**: Although not generally recommended due to potential for unexpected side-effects and harder code maintenance, you can theoretically attach your client to a global variable. Here’s an example using dependency injection pattern which can be expanded to your case: In the main file where the database gets connected (like `medics-communication-server.js`): ```javascript const MongoClient = require(\'mongodb\').MongoClient; const url = \\"your_mongodb_url_here\\"; const client = new MongoClient(url); async function start() { try { await client.connect(); const db = client.db(\'your_db_name\'); // Pass the db to other modules, like: const TelSpielServiceProvider = require(\'./services/whatsapp/TelSpielServiceProvider\')(db); // ... Initialize other parts of your application ... } catch (e) { console.error(\\"Could not connect to MongoDB\\", e); process.exit(1); } } start(); ``` And in `TelSpielServiceProvider.js`: ```javascript module.exports = function(db) { class TelSpielServiceProvider { // ... other methods ... async createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { // Previously shown implementation... } async fetchTemplate(hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode, templateName) { let template = null; // Use passed `db` to interact with MongoDB // ... return template; } } return TelSpielServiceProvider; }; ``` This way, you only need to use the instance of `db` that was passed in when the `TelSpielServiceProvider` was required, rather than opening a new connection. Make sure to replace `\'your_mongodb_url_here\'` and `\'your_db_name\'` with your actual MongoDB URL and database name, respectively. Also adjust the import/require paths according to your project\'s structure. This is just a skeletal example and may need adjustments to fit into your project\'s architecture."},{"prompt":"since we have to use mongod connection in many places, Can we have a single service where every file can use that one, It shouldb be smart enough to handle load if they try to connect and that connection already availeble we need to use that or else create a connection please create a robust, scalable and generic solution for the mongodbservice file","completion":"Certainly! You can create a MongoDB service module that manages a single connection throughout your application. It can handle the connection creation and reuse the connection if it\'s already available. Here\'s how you might structure such a service: 1. **MongoDBConnection.js**: A module responsible for managing the MongoDB client connection, ensuring that only one connection is used. Create a MongoDB service file that manages your client connection: ```javascript // MongoDBConnection.js const { MongoClient } = require(\'mongodb\'); class MongoDBConnection { constructor() { this.db = null; this.client = null; } async connect(uri, dbName) { if (this.db) { console.log(\\"Using existing database connection\\"); return this.db; } else { try { this.client = await MongoClient.connect(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, }); this.db = this.client.db(dbName); console.log(\\"MongoDB connection established\\"); return this.db; } catch (error) { console.error(\\"Could not connect to MongoDB\\", error); throw new Error(\\"Failed to connect to MongoDB\\"); } } } close() { if (this.client) { this.client.close(); this.client = null; this.db = null; console.log(\\"MongoDB connection closed\\"); } } } // Export a singleton instance of MongoDBConnection module.exports = new MongoDBConnection(); // Usage: // const mongoDBConnection = require(\'./MongoDBConnection\'); // const db = await mongoDBConnection.connect(\'yourMongoUriHere\', \'yourDatabaseNameHere\'); ``` Here is how you can employ this module in parts of your application: ```javascript // SomeServiceFile.js const mongoDBConnection = require(\'./MongoDBConnection\'); (async () => { try { const db = await mongoDBConnection.connect(\'your_mongo_uri\', \'your_database_name\'); // you can use db in this file } catch (error) { console.error(\\"Error using MongoDB\\", error); } })(); ``` When you\'re done with the application, or when you need to close the connection (like before the application exits), you call `close`: ```javascript // At application shutdown const mongoDBConnection = require(\'./MongoDBConnection\'); mongoDBConnection.close(); ``` Using this structure, your MongoDB client is encapsulated in a single module (`MongoDBConnection.js`). Whenever a part of your application requires a database connection, it requests the connection through the module, which will either establish a new connection or reuse the existing one. This singleton pattern ensures that the connection is shared and not unnecessarily reopened, and is also closed appropriately when your application is done using it. It\'s a robust and scalable solution that can manage your connection effectively across your application, and it\'s suitable for use in a Node.js environment that runs on a single thread, such as a standard web server. Note: 1. Handle the `.connect()` and `.close()` function calls at the appropriate application lifecycle events (e.g., application start and graceful shutdown). 2. Ensure proper error handling in your services that use the database connection. 3. For more complex scenarios or in situations where horizontal scaling is required (multiple instances of the application), consider using connection pooling as offered by the MongoDB driver. The driver by default manages a pool of connections, allowing you to run a cluster of Node.js processes (using a tool like PM2) that all share the same set of database connections. However, the current implementation of the singleton pattern provided above is suitable for the typical use case. 4. Since MongoDB driver 3.6 and above, the MongoClient\'s `connect` method returns a promise if no callback is specified, therefore the `await` operator can be used instead of callbacks. Ensure your driver is up to date to support this."},{"prompt":"we may connect to multiple mongodb databses in the same application will this handle that scenario as well ?","completion":"The current singleton implementation does not handle connecting to multiple MongoDB databases within the same application because it maintains a single connection. In order to handle connections to multiple databases, you can implement a connection manager that creates and manages separate instances of the database client for each unique URI and database name combination. This manager would handle multiple connections by storing them in a map or an object where the keys are identifiers for each unique database. Here\'s an updated version of the MongoDB connection manager to handle multiple databases: ```javascript const { MongoClient } = require(\'mongodb\'); class MongoDBConnectionManager { constructor() { this.connections = {}; } async connect(uri, dbName) { const identifier = `{uri}_{dbName}`; if (this.connections[identifier]) { console.log(`Using existing connection for database: {dbName}`); return this.connections[identifier].db; } try { const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, }); await client.connect(); const db = client.db(dbName); this.connections[identifier] = { client, db }; console.log(`Connection established for database: {dbName}`); return db; } catch (error) { console.error(`Could not connect to database: {dbName}`, error); throw new Error(`Failed to connect to database: {dbName}`); } } close(uri, dbName) { const identifier = `{uri}_{dbName}`; if (this.connections[identifier]) { this.connections[identifier].client.close(); delete this.connections[identifier]; console.log(`Connection closed for database: {dbName}`); } } // Close all connections closeAll() { for (const identifier in this.connections) { this.connections[identifier].client.close(); console.log(`Connection closed for identifier: {identifier}`); } this.connections = {}; } } // Export a singleton instance of MongoDBConnectionManager module.exports = new MongoDBConnectionManager(); ``` This allows you to establish connections to multiple databases: ```javascript // Usage for one database const mongoDBConnectionManager = require(\'./MongoDBConnectionManager\'); const db1 = await mongoDBConnectionManager.connect(\'your_mongo_uri_1\', \'your_database_name_1\'); // Usage for another database const db2 = await mongoDBConnectionManager.connect(\'your_mongo_uri_2\', \'your_database_name_2\'); ``` And closing connections when necessary: ```javascript // Close one database connection mongoDBConnectionManager.close(\'your_mongo_uri_1\', \'your_database_name_1\'); // Close another database connection mongoDBConnectionManager.close(\'your_mongo_uri_2\', \'your_database_name_2\'); // Close all connections mongoDBConnectionManager.closeAll(); ``` This pattern allows you to manage multiple database connections efficiently, each uniquely identified by its connection string and database name. The `connect` method will check if a connection with the given identifier already exists and return that; otherwise, it will create a new one. The `close` method allows you to close an individual connection, while `closeAll` can be used to close all connections, for instance during application shutdown. Remember to handle connection closure appropriately in your application lifecycle to prevent connection leaks."},{"prompt":"Write an horror comedy anime scene about a ghost kicking out a bunch of rowdy teenagers out of her house by chasing them out with a broom.

Unbeknownst to them, the house is not as empty as they believe. BOY 1 kicks a can that echoes through the vast empty spaces, a smirk plastered on his face. BOY 1 (loudly) This place is lit! Let\'s see if we can find some ghosts! GIRL 1 (playfully scoffing) As if! They better be afraid of us! They continue their commotion, oblivious to the supernatural presence they\'re about to encounter. CUT TO: INT. GHOST\'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS In stark contrast to the chaotic energy downstairs, a serene and somewhat normal scene unfolds. The GHOST, a woman with long black hair covering her eyes, dressed in a white gown and flip-flops, is casually reclining on a bed with an outdated magazine in hand. She hears the commotion, lets out an unseen eye-roll, and sighs deeply, the breath oddly chilling. GHOST (in an unamused whisper) Not these living nuisances again... The Ghost rises, setting her magazine down. The air around her grows colder as she drifts toward the bedroom door, a faint ethereal glow tracing her movements. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED MANSION - SAME TIME Outside, TEENAGE BOY 2 taps his foot impatiently, visibly annoyed. TEENAGE BOY 2 (muttering to himself) Come on, guys, let\'s wrap this up.

Startled, the teenagers turn as the broom begins to move on its own, sweeping vigorously toward them. They scream, a mix of horror and hilarity on their faces as they scatter away from the hovering, broom-wielding ghost. GIRL 2 (screaming) It\'s a real ghost! BOY 3 (terrified laughter) Dude, let\'s get out of here! They stampede down the stairs, the Ghost close behind, sweeping and yelling comically ghostly threats. GHOST (another ethereal shout) And don\'t come back, or I\'ll haunt your dreams with endless chores! CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED MANSION - CONTINUOUS The teenagers burst through the front door, tearing past TEENAGE BOY 2, who stands startled by their sudden flight. TEENAGE BOY 2 (confused and yelling after them) Hey! What the heck happened in there?! His answer comes as the Ghost reaches the doorway, brandishing the broom like a spectral warrior. She sweeps the doorstep clean of teenage presence as a flip-flop drops from her foot, unnoticed. GHOST (proudly, to herself) My house, my rules. She pauses, levitating the lost flip-flop back onto her foot with a dignified float, turns around, and drifts back inside. Her chilling whisper floats through the air like a parting breeze. GHOST (whispering) Now, where was I in that magazine? Black hair trailing behind her, the Ghost closes the door with a supernatural slam, leaving a comically haunted silence behind as the teenagers flee into the night, their shrieks a perfect blend of horror and hilarity."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

CHRIS, the embodiment of youthful optimism, is sprawled comfortably on a battered sofa. His short brown hair is a disheveled mess, glasses perched on his nose as he focuses intently on the television screen, where an animated show plays, full of vibrant explosions and heroic dialogue. JACK (trying to sound nonchalant) Hey, Chris. Chris\' head snaps up, his glasses catching the fluorescent light, and a grin quickly spreads across his face. He leaps to his feet, nearly knocking the remote off the table in his haste. CHRIS (energetically) Jack! What are you doing here? I mean, I thought you were... out. JACK (amused) I am. Sort of. It\'s a work release thing. Chris leans forward, the profound curiosity of a rookie cop mixed with brotherly concern shining through his expression. CHRIS (concerned) Are you okay? They’re not giving you a hard time, are they? JACK (shrugging it off) I can handle it. Come on, let’s walk. I\'ve got to head out.

JACK (playing it cool) They know their stuff, I\'ll give them that. But let\'s just say, I\'m not here to make friends. They reach the entrance of the station, and the daylight streams in, casting long shadows on the floor. Jack turns to face Chris, a softer expression in his eyes. JACK (earnestly) Hey, kiddo. Keep your head down, alright? This place can change you if you let it. CHRIS (nods with determination) I know, Jack. And I’m glad you’re back... even if it’s just for a while. JACK (ruffles Chris’ hair) Stay out of trouble, you hear? CHRIS (grinning) No promises, big bro.

However, if you\'re looking to add some flair and improve the design a bit further, consider the following suggestions: 1. **Custom Colors and Branding**: Adjust the color scheme to fit your branding. Instead of using the default \'bg-dark\', you could use your brand colors. 2. **Increased Visibility of Active Link**: Enhance the visibility of the active page link by changing its style more prominently than just the \'active\' class. 3. **Improved Spacing and Padding**: Adjusting the spacing and padding can make your navbar look more balanced and less cramped. 4. **Custom Fonts and Typography**: Integrating custom fonts can add personality and improve readability. 5. **Hover and Animation Effects**: Subtle hover effects and transitions on the dropdowns or links can make the interaction more engaging. 6. **Consistent Case and Spacing for Text**: Consider whether you want all caps, title case, or lowercase for your link texts, and maintain that consistently. 7. **Stylized Search Bar**: A custom design for the search bar that fits your site\'s aesthetics could be more appealing than the default style.

It can handle the connection creation and reuse the connection if it’s already available. Here’s how you might structure such a service: 1. MongoDBConnection.js: A module responsible for managing the MongoDB client connection, ensuring that only one connection is used. Create a MongoDB service file that manages your client connection: // MongoDBConnection.js const { MongoClient } = require(‘mongodb’); class MongoDBConnection { constructor() { this.db = null; this.client = null; } async connect(uri, dbName) { if (this.db) { console.log(“Using existing database connection”); return this.db; } else { try { this.client = await MongoClient.connect(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, }); this.db = this.client.db(dbName); console.log(“MongoDB connection established”); return this.db; } catch (error) { console.error(“Could not connect to MongoDB”, error); throw new Error(“Failed to connect to MongoDB”); } } } close() { if (this.client) { this.client.close(); this.client = null; this.db = null; console.log(“MongoDB connection closed”); } } } // Export a singleton instance of MongoDBConnection module.exports = new MongoDBConnection(); // Usage: // const mongoDBConnection = require(‘./MongoDBConnection’); // const db = await mongoDBConnection.connect(‘yourMongoUriHere’, ‘yourDatabaseNameHere’); Here is how you can employ this module in parts of your application: // SomeServiceFile.js const mongoDBConnection = require(‘./MongoDBConnection’); (async () => { try { const db = await mongoDBConnection.connect(‘your_mongo_uri’, ‘your_database_name’); // you can use db in this file } catch (error) { console.error(“Error using MongoDB”, error); } })(); When you’re done with the application, or when you need to close the connection (like before the application exits), you call close: // At application shutdown const mongoDBConnection = require(‘./MongoDBConnection’); mongoDBConnection.close(); Using this structure, your MongoDB client is encapsulated in a single module (MongoDBConnection.js). Whenever a part of your application requires a database connection, it requests the connection through the module, which will either establish a new connection or reuse the existing one. This singleton pattern ensures that the connection is shared and not unnecessarily reopened, and is also closed appropriately when your application is done using it. It’s a robust and scalable solution that can manage your connection effectively across your application, and it’s suitable for use in a Node.js environment that runs on a single thread, such as a standard web server. But we may connect to multiple mongodb databses in the same application will this handle that scenario as well ?","completion":"The code structure you\'ve provided implements a singleton pattern for managing a MongoDB connection. With this design, you create and manage a single MongoDB client throughout the entire application. This pattern works well when your application only requires a connection to a single MongoDB database. However, if you need to connect to multiple MongoDB databases within the same application, the provided singleton pattern won\'t suffice, as it\'s designed to maintain a single instance of the connection. To handle multiple databases, you would need to modify your strategy. Instead of storing a single `db` instance, you would have to manage a map or an object that can store multiple database connections indexed by some form of a unique identifier (e.g., the database name). Here is how you might modify the MongoDBConnection class to handle multiple database connections: ```javascript // MongoDBConnection.js const { MongoClient } = require(\'mongodb\'); class MongoDBConnection { constructor() { this.databases = {}; // Changed from a single db/client to a map } async connect(uri, dbName) { if (this.databases[dbName]) { console.log(`Using existing database connection for {dbName}`); return this.databases[dbName]; } else { try { const client = await MongoClient.connect(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, }); const db = client.db(dbName); this.databases[dbName] = db; console.log(`MongoDB connection for {dbName} established`); return db; } catch (error) { console.error(`Could not connect to MongoDB for {dbName}`, error); throw new Error(`Failed to connect to MongoDB for {dbName}`); } } } close(dbName) { const db = this.databases[dbName]; if (db) { db.client.close(); delete this.databases[dbName]; console.log(`MongoDB connection for {dbName} closed`); } } // Close all connections closeAll() { for (const dbName in this.databases) { this.close(dbName); } } } // Export a singleton instance of MongoDBConnection module.exports = new MongoDBConnection(); ``` Now, the `MongoDBConnection` class manages multiple databases. `connect` returns the connection for a specified database and creates it if it doesn\'t already exist. `close` now takes a `dbName` argument and closes the connection for that specific database. `closeAll` is added to close all database connections when the application shuts down. ```javascript // Usage example for multiple databases const mongoDBConnection = require(\'./MongoDBConnection\'); (async () => { try { const dbOne = await mongoDBConnection.connect(\'your_mongo_uri\', \'your_database_name_one\'); // Use dbOne... const dbTwo = await mongoDBConnection.connect(\'your_mongo_uri\', \'your_database_name_two\'); // Use dbTwo... // ... Later, when closing the application or when done using the databases mongoDBConnection.closeAll(); // Closes all connections } catch (error) { console.error(\\"Error using MongoDB\\", error); } })(); ``` This revised version accommodates multiple database connections by storing them as properties of the `databases` object, using database names as the keys. This allows the application to dynamically manage connections to different databases."},{"prompt":"which is good ? mongoose and mongoclient","completion":"The choice between Mongoose and the native MongoDB client (`MongoClient`) in a Node.js application largely depends on the requirements of your project and your personal preferences. Both have their pros and cons. Here\'s a comparison to help you decide: # Mongoose: - **Object Data Modeling (ODM):** Mongoose is an ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a higher level of abstraction and includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks, and more. - **Schema Validation:** Mongoose allows you to define schemas for your collections. This can ensure data integrity by enforcing a structure on your documents and providing automatic type conversion. - **Middleware (Hooks):** Mongoose provides middleware (also called pre and post hooks) that you can use to perform operations before or after certain database operations, such as saving a document. - **Population:** A powerful feature of Mongoose is the ability to automatically replace specified paths within the document with documents from other collections (similar to SQL joins). - **Active Record Style ORMs:** Mongoose follows the active record pattern, providing methods on the instance of the model itself for saving, querying, and other database operations. # MongoClient: - **Minimal Abstraction:** The native MongoDB client provides a minimal layer over the raw MongoDB commands. It is suitable for those who prefer to work closer to the metal and might require finer control over database operations. - **Performance:** Direct use of the MongoClient is typically faster than Mongoose since there\'s no overhead of schema validation, instance methods, or middleware. - **Flexibility:** As it doesn\'t involve schema enforcement, you have greater flexibility in terms of how you structure your documents. It can be useful for databases with highly dynamic schemas or when working with many different collections or databases. - **Simplicity:** For smaller projects or when a schema isn\'t necessary, using `MongoClient` can be simpler and more straightforward. # When to Use Which: - **Use Mongoose when:** - You need schema validation and want to define a clear structure for your data. - You want to use middleware for complex operations before or after you save a document. - You\'re building a large-scale application that benefits from an active record pattern. - You need features such as population and want tighter integration with your Node.js application through models. - **Use MongoClient when:** - You\'re dealing with a schema-less database or your data structure frequently changes. - You want maximum performance and you\'re handling optimization on your own. - You are comfortable writing raw MongoDB queries and don\'t need an abstraction layer. Ultimately, the \\"best\\" option is subjective and is based on the specific needs and constraints of your project, your team\'s familiarity with MongoDB and ODMs, and your preference for writing database queries and handling data. If you value structure and schema definition highly, Mongoose could be the way to go. On the other hand, if you prefer a lightweight, flexible approach and don\'t mind managing data integrity at the application level, `MongoClient` may be more appropriate."},{"prompt":"is this robust and generic enough ? const mongoose = require(\'mongoose\'); class MongoDBService { constructor() { this.connections = {}; } async connect(uri) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === 1) { console.log(`Using existing Mongoose connection for {uri}`); return this.connections[uri]; } try { this.connections[uri] = await mongoose.createConnection(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }); console.log(`Created new Mongoose connection for {uri}`); return this.connections[uri]; } catch (error) { console.error(`Failed to connect to MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}`); throw error; } } async disconnect(uri) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === 1) { await this.connections[uri].close(); console.log(`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}`); } } async closeAllConnections() { for (const uri in this.connections) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === 1) { await this.connections[uri].close(); console.log(`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}`); } } } } module.exports = new MongoDBService();","completion":"Your `MongoDBService` class using Mongoose is a good starting point for managing multiple MongoDB connections in a Node.js application. It appears generic enough to handle connections to different URIs and provides methods to connect, disconnect, and close all connections. However, there are a few things you might consider to improve the robustness of the service: 1. **Connection Configurations:** - You may want to parameterize the connection options and make them configurable when creating connections, rather than hard-coding them within the `connect` method. 2. **Error Handling:** - It\'s good to have error handling within the `connect` method, but you might also want to consider how to handle disconnection errors in the `disconnect` and `closeAllConnections` methods. 3. **Connection States:** - You are currently checking for `readyState` of `1` to determine if the connection is active, which is correct. However, for robustness and readability, you might want to consider using `mongoose` connection states constants (e.g., `mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected`) instead of magic numbers. 4. **Singleton Pattern:** - You are exporting an instance of `MongoDBService`, which ensures a single instance (singleton) throughout your application. This is generally a good practice when consistent state management is required. 5. **Asynchronous Connection Initialization:** - If multiple parts of your application try to establish a connection to the same URI at the same time, the current design might create multiple connections to the same database. This could be prevented by implementing a connection-locking mechanism or by checking if a connection attempt is already in progress and awaiting its completion. 6. **Graceful Shutdown:** - Consider creating a method to handle application termination or signals for a graceful shutdown, where all Mongo connections are closed cleanly. Here\'s how you might update your code to address some of these points: ```javascript const mongoose = require(\'mongoose\'); class MongoDBService { constructor() { this.connections = {}; this.connectionOptions = { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }; this.connectingURIs = {}; // To store URIs that are currently connecting } async connect(uri, options = {}) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { console.log(`Using existing Mongoose connection for {uri}`); } else if (!this.connectingURIs[uri]) { this.connectingURIs[uri] = true; try { const connectionOptions = { ...this.connectionOptions, ...options }; this.connections[uri] = await mongoose.createConnection(uri, connectionOptions); console.log(`Created new Mongoose connection for {uri}`); } catch (error) { console.error(`Failed to connect to MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}`); throw error; } finally { delete this.connectingURIs[uri]; } } else { console.log(`Connection attempt already in progress for {uri}`); // Keep retrying or waiting until the connection either succeeds or fails await this.waitForConnection(uri); } return this.connections[uri]; } async waitForConnection(uri) { // Implement logic to wait until the current connection attempt resolves } async disconnect(uri) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { await this.connections[uri].close(); console.log(`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}`); } } async closeAllConnections() { for (const uri in this.connections) { await this.disconnect(uri); // Use the disconnect method to ensure proper handling } } } module.exports = new MongoDBService(); ``` Keep in mind that the function `waitForConnection` must be implemented to manage the synchronization of connections properly. This update adds an additional `connectingURIs` object to mark URIs with ongoing connection processes and merges user-provided options with default ones for flexibility."},{"prompt":"const mongoose = require(\'mongoose\'); class MongoDBService { constructor() { this.connections = {}; } async connect(uri, options = { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { console.log(`Using existing Mongoose connection for {uri}`); return this.connections[uri]; } try { this.connections[uri] = await mongoose.createConnection(uri, options); console.log(`Created new Mongoose connection for {uri}`); return this.connections[uri]; } catch (error) { console.error(`Failed to connect to MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}`); throw error; } } async disconnect(uri) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { try { await this.connections[uri].close(); console.log(`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}`); } catch (error) { console.error(`Failed to disconnect from MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}`); throw error; } } } async closeAllConnections() { for (const uri in this.connections) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { try { await this.connections[uri].close(); console.log(`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}`); } catch (error) { console.error(`Failed to disconnect from MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}`); throw error; } } } } } module.exports = new MongoDBService();","completion":"Your updated `MongoDBService` class looks quite solid in terms of handling multiple Mongoose connections. You addressed the default options to be provided and allowed for overriding them, which adds the flexibility needed for different use cases. Here are some additional minor enhancements you might still consider: 1. **Connection Error Handling:** - When a connection attempt fails, and an error is thrown, ensure that subsequent retries can proceed by removing or resetting the failed connection entry in the `this.connections` object. 2. **Disconnect Error Handling:** - Currently, if a disconnection fails, it throws an error. In some cases, you might want the application to continue the shutdown process even if some disconnects fail. Consider whether to throw an error or just log the error and continue the shutdown. 3. **Graceful Shutdown Integration:** - Consider integrating the shutdown process with Node.js events like `process.on(\'SIGINT\', ...)` to automatically close all connections when the process is terminated. 4. **Validation & Input Sanitization:** - Validate that the URI is in the correct format and sanitize input where necessary to prevent potential issues. 5. **Additional Logging and Monitoring:** - Adding more detailed logging (like timestamps or identifying which part of your application a log is coming from) can be helpful. Consider using a more sophisticated logging library if your application is likely to scale. 6. **Promises and Asynchronous Management:** - When closing all connections in `closeAllConnections`, currently each connection is closed sequentially, which is fine. If you\'re looking for more efficiency, you can close them in parallel using `Promise.all()`. Here\'s a small modification using `Promise.all()` for `closeAllConnections`: ```javascript async closeAllConnections() { const closingPromises = []; for (const uri in this.connections) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { closingPromises.push( this.connections[uri].close().catch(error => { console.error(`Failed to disconnect from MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}`); // Depending on your requirements, you might handle this error differently }) ); } } await Promise.all(closingPromises); console.log(`All Mongoose connections have been disconnected.`); } ``` By using `Promise.all()`, you\'re attempting to close all connections in parallel, making the shutdown process potentially faster, especially if there are multiple connections to close. Just make sure that parallel disconnections don\'t cause issues in your specific environment. Lastly, always be cautious with any singletons (as `module.exports = new MongoDBService();` will create a singleton), especially if you ever plan to use them in an environment that might not support the single-threaded singleton approach (like a serverless function that creates multiple instances). But as long as you are aware of the limitations and design your application accordingly, your current implementation of `MongoDBService` should serve you well."},{"prompt":"hows this now ?","completion":"Your `MongoDBService` implementation has improved over the iterations, with the incorporation of asynchronous connection management, allowing for connection options, error handling, and closing all connections in a more efficient or parallel manner. It is important to note that while `Promise.all()` will execute all the promises in parallel, if any of them reject, `Promise.all()` will throw an error immediately. If you can tolerate individual disconnections failing, but still want to close all connections, you could use `Promise.allSettled()` instead. `Promise.allSettled()` resolves with an array of objects, each indicating the outcome of each promise, regardless of whether they were fulfilled or rejected, thus making sure that all disconnection attempts are made. Here\'s how you can modify the `closeAllConnections` function: ```javascript async closeAllConnections() { const closingPromises = Object.keys(this.connections).map(uri => { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { return this.connections[uri].close().then(() => { console.log(`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}`); }).catch(error => { console.error(`Failed to disconnect from MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}`); // Handle individual errors, consider recording the error in a log or escalating it }); } return Promise.resolve(); // If nothing to close, resolve immediately }); await Promise.allSettled(closingPromises); console.log(`All disconnection attempts have been made.`); } ``` This revision with `Promise.allSettled()` ensures that you attempt to close all the connections and then handle the results accordingly, which is generally what you\'d want during a graceful shutdown process. After all promises are settled, you can then log a message indicating all attempts have been made, helping in post-mortem analysis if issues arise. Beyond the code implementation, always make sure to test the robustness of this service under a variety of scenarios (including transient network failures, database restarts, and application crashes) to ensure that it works as expected in real-world conditions. Additionally, documentation of the usage and behavior of this service in the codebase can be very helpful for maintenance and for other developers working with your code."},{"prompt":"const mongoose = require(\'mongoose\'); class MongoDBService { constructor() { this.connections = {}; } async connect(uri, options = { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { console.log(`Using existing Mongoose connection for {uri}`); return this.connections[uri]; } try { this.connections[uri] = await mongoose.createConnection(uri, options); console.log(`Created new Mongoose connection for {uri}`); return this.connections[uri]; } catch (error) { console.error(`Failed to connect to MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}`); delete this.connections[uri]; // Remove the failed connection throw error; } } async disconnect(uri) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { try { await this.connections[uri].close(); console.log(`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}`); } catch (error) { console.error(`Failed to disconnect from MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}`); // Decide whether to throw an error or just log it } } } async closeAllConnections() { const disconnectPromises = Object.keys(this.connections).map(uri => this.disconnect(uri)); // Disconnect in parallel await Promise.all(disconnectPromises); } } const mongoDBService = new MongoDBService(); // Handle process termination signals process.on(\'SIGINT\', async () => { console.log(\'Received SIGINT.

It looks like a well-rounded solution for managing MongoDB connections across your Node.js application and addresses the major concerns. Here\'s a review of your final MongoDBService class and `SIGINT` handling: 1. **Handles failed connection attempts:** The class now deletes failed connection attempts, which allows retries to proceed without being hindered by the previous failed state. 2. **Parallel disconnection:** The `closeAllConnections` method will now initiate the disconnection of all databases in parallel using `Promise.all()`, which can reduce the time required during a graceful shutdown. 3. **Signal handling for graceful shutdown:** This includes proper handling for `SIGINT`, which is a signal that the process will receive, for example, when you hit Ctrl+C on the terminal. It\'s a common place to hook into to start cleanup processes like closing database connections. One consideration for the `disconnect` and `closeAllConnections` methods is to remove the connection from the `this.connections` object after a successful disconnection. This ensures that the service accurately reflects the system state and won\'t attempt to close already closed connections if `closeAllConnections` is called multiple times. Here\'s how you might modify the disconnect method to remove the connection on success: ```javascript async disconnect(uri) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { try { await this.connections[uri].close(); console.log(`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}`); delete this.connections[uri]; // Remove successful disconnection } catch (error) { console.error(`Failed to disconnect from MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}`); // Decide whether to throw an error or just log it } } } ``` And for the signal handler, it\'s a good practice to handle not just `SIGINT` but also `SIGTERM`, which is a termination signal commonly used in server environments, cloud applications, and containerized applications like Docker. ```javascript // Handle multiple signals for comprehensive coverage [\'SIGINT\', \'SIGTERM\'].forEach(signal => { process.on(signal, async () => { console.log(`Received {signal}. Closing all MongoDB connections...`); await mongoDBService.closeAllConnections(); process.exit(0); }); }); ``` Other than that, the code you\'ve provided appears to cover the necessary functionality for a MongoDB connection management service quite well!

Here\'s a rundown of the improvements and their implications: 1. **Connection Management:** - You have a proper check for an existing, connected state before attempting to create a new connection. - Failed connections are removed from the service state, allowing for retries without interference from previous attempts. 2. **Disconnection Logic:** - The `disconnect` method includes the deletion of the connection from the service state after a successful disconnection, which prevents unnecessary closure attempts on already closed connections. 3. **Shutdown Process:** - By using `Promise.all()` in `closeAllConnections`, you efficiently request the disconnection of all active connections concurrently. - The process event listeners for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` ensure that when the Node.js process receives these signals, it will attempt to close all MongoDB connections and then shut down cleanly. This is critical for avoiding abrupt disconnections and potential data corruption. Here are a few additional considerations for further refinement: - **Connection Validation:** The URI provided should be validated to ensure it\'s in a correct format, preventing unnecessary connection attempts that will fail and could throw exceptions. - **Concurrency Control:** If `connect` is called for the same URI concurrently before an established connection is added to `this.connections`, you could end up with multiple connections. You might consider introducing connection initialization locking logic (using a temporary \\"connecting\\" state) to account for this. - **Error Handling Strategy:** Consider your strategy for connection/disconnection failures. Depending on your application context, you might choose to continue operation with reduced functionality, escalate errors more aggressively, or shut down the service completely in the case of certain errors. - **Logging and Monitoring:** If your application scales, it will benefit from a more sophisticated logging strategy, potentially integrating with centralized logging or monitoring services to help track and alert on connection issues. - **Testing:** Ensure that this service is thoroughly tested, particularly with regards to how it manages concurrent connections and disconnections. Simulate failures and assess how it recovers from different scenarios. Your class now looks well-structured and is equipped to manage MongoDB connections effectively. Keep in mind that building and nurturing a codebase is an iterative process. Pay attention to issues as they arise, and continue to iterate on your design as needed.

Required your `MongoDBService`: ```javascript const mongoDBService = require(\'./path/to/MongoDBService\'); ``` 2. Replace `mongoose.connect` and connection event handlers with a call to `mongoDBService.connect`. You\'ll want to make sure to place it in an asynchronous context since `connect` is an async function: ```javascript async function startServer() { try { // Connect to MongoDB using MongoDBService await mongoDBService.connect(configurations.mongodbURL); Logger.info(\\"Connected to Mongo DB\\"); app.models = require(\\"./models/index\\"); // ... rest of your existing code to set up routes and listen on port ... } catch (error) { Logger.error(\\"Failed to connect to MongoDB:\\", error); // Handle connection errors here potentially by terminating the process or a retry mechanism } } startServer(); ``` 3. Modify the mongoose connection error handler if needed, since you have already included error handling in the `MongoDBService`. The error handling in `startServer` captures issues that may arise during the async connection setup. 4. You would want to handle the application exit and ensure the MongoDB connections are closed properly. This is typically done through process event listeners for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`, which you\'ve already set up in the `MongoDBService` module, so this is now taken care of. Following the above steps, your start file should look something like this after integration: ```javascript require(\\"dotenv\\").config(); const express = require(\\"express\\"); const bodyParser = require(\\"body-parser\\"); const _ = require(\\"lodash\\"); const path = require(\\"path\\"); const configurations = require(\\"./config.json\\"); const Logger = require(\'./services/Logger\'); const mongoDBService = require(\'./path/to/MongoDBService\'); // Path to your MongoDBService // Create the application const app = express(); // ... rest of your middleware setup ... // Replaces mongoose.connect async function startServer() { try { // Connect to MongoDB using MongoDBService instead of mongoose directly await mongoDBService.connect(configurations.mongodbURL); Logger.info(\\"Connected to MongoDB\\"); app.models = require(\\"./models/index\\"); // ... rest of your code to set up routes ... let httpPort = configurations.serverPort; app.listen(httpPort, function () { Logger.info(`Listening on port {httpPort} ...`); }); } catch (error) { Logger.error(\\"Failed to connect to MongoDB:\\", error); // Terminate the process or implement a retry mechanism process.exit(1); } } startServer(); ``` Make sure you\'re managing the asynchronous nature of these operations correctly and that any error handling or retry logic is appropriate for your application\'s needs.

Créez d\'abord un formulaire HTML avec `enctype=\\"multipart/form-data\\"` pour permettre le téléchargement de fichiers. Par exemple : ```html <form method=\\"POST\\" action=\\"/upload\\" enctype=\\"multipart/form-data\\"> <input type=\\"file\\" name=\\"file_to_upload\\"> <input type=\\"submit\\"> </form> ``` 2.

Let\'s begin with the contract\'s functions and events. What are the key operations too find the vulnerabilities ini the contract","completion":"When analyzing a smart contract to find potential vulnerabilities, it\'s important to go over each function, event, and modifier to understand their behavior and interactions. The key operations in the `UbiquityDollarToken` contract include: 1. `initialize(address _manager)`: Initializes the contract with the sender\'s address as the Ubiquity Manager. 2. `setIncentiveContract(address account, address incentive)`: Sets an incentive contract for a given account. 3. `_checkAndApplyIncentives(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Applies incentives based on the sender, recipient, and operator (transaction initiator) if applicable. 4. `_transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Overrides the ERC20 `_transfer` function to transfer tokens and apply incentives. 5. `burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)`: Burns tokens from a specified account. 6. `mint(address to, uint256 amount)`: Mints tokens to a specified address. 7. `_authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)`: Allows an admin to set a new implementation contract. 8. Modifiers like `onlyDollarMinter`, `onlyDollarBurner`, and Ethereum/OpenZeppelin\'s lifecycle ones such as `whenNotPaused` and `initializer`. 9. Events like `IncentiveContractUpdate`, `Burning`, and `Minting` that emit logs for certain state changes. Looking for vulnerabilities, these are the areas to inspect: - Access Control: Ensure that only authorized parties can call functions with privileged access. Look for proper use of modifiers and roles. - Reentrancy: Look for reentrancy risks where external calls can potentially be exploited to manipulate contract state or cause unexpected behavior. - Proper initialization: Check if `initialize` can only be called once and cannot be misused. - Upgrade Mechanism: Examine the upgrade process to ensure it is secure and doesn\'t introduce risks of unauthorized access or misuse. - Incentive Logic: Evaluate the logic in `_checkAndApplyIncentives` to prevent any manipulation or unfair advantage. - Incentive Contract Trust: Since incentives require trust in external contracts (`IIncentive`), verify that the system is resilient to malicious contracts. - Token Burning and Minting: These functions manipulate token supply and should be scrutinized for proper access control and checks. - State Variable Manipulation: Check for manipulation risks in state variables (e.g., `incentiveContract` mapping). - Events: Ensure that events provide accurate information and are emitted in all relevant functions for transparency. Without a more in-depth audit and without having the complete code of all the imported contracts and interfaces (like `ERC20Ubiquity`, `IERC20Ubiquity`, `IIncentive`, and all the functions from OpenZeppelin that are inherited but not directly written in the given contract), it\'s not possible to give a full review or identify all potential vulnerabilities.

It calls an internal function `__ERC20Ubiquity_init` with the manager address, token name \\"Ubiquity Dollar,\\" and token symbol \\"uAD\\". The `initializer` modifier ensures this function can be called only once. 2. `setIncentiveContract(address account, address incentive)`: This function sets an incentive contract for a specified account. The requirement ensures that only a user with the `GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE` can call the function. It emits an `IncentiveContractUpdate` event upon successful update. 3. `_checkAndApplyIncentives(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: This internal function applies incentives on token transfers. It checks the sender, recipient, and operator (transaction initiator), and calls the `incentivize` method on any relevant incentive contract. 4. `_transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: This override of the `_transfer` function from the ERC20 parent contract includes the application of incentives through `_checkAndApplyIncentives`. It first calls the regular token transfer logic (`super._transfer`) before applying any incentives. 5. `burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)`: This function allows the burning of tokens from a specified address. The `onlyDollarBurner` modifier restricts its usage to only users with the \\"Dollar burner\\" role. It pauses the functionality if the contract is paused and emits a `Burning` event. 6. `mint(address to, uint256 amount)`: This function allows the minting of new tokens. It requires the caller to have the \\"Dollar minter\\" role enforced by the `onlyDollarMinter` modifier; the `whenNotPaused` modifier stops minting if the contract is paused. It emits a `Minting` event upon minting new tokens. 7. `_authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)`: This internal function stub indicates permission for an upgrade to a new contract implementation but does not include actual implementation details. It references `onlyAdmin`, which suggests some form of access control, but the actual modifier is not defined in the provided code. Events and Modifiers: - Two custom events are defined: `IncentiveContractUpdate` for logging incentive contract updates and `Burning` for logging burning of tokens. The `Minting` event is mentioned, but its declaration isn\'t provided in the code (assumed to be part of the inherited ERC20 contract). - Two modifiers are defined: `onlyDollarMinter` and `onlyDollarBurner` for access control on the minting and burning functions, respectively. The reference to `whenNotPaused` suggests that there is a pause capability inherited from an OpenZeppelin contract or similar, which wasn\'t provided in the code. - Presence of `initializer` modifier suggests it uses OpenZeppelin\'s upgradeable contracts framework to ensure `initialize` can only be invoked once as part of contract initialization. Overall, the relationships and descriptions provided in the question seem to accurately represent the functionality within the provided smart contract code. However, without seeing the implementations of inherited contracts and constants (like the actual roles and `whenNotPaused`), a full audit is not possible. To conduct a further review and identify potential vulnerabilities, auditors would need access to the complete code, including inherited contracts, interfaces, and libraries. They would also need to deploy and interact with the contract on a test network, perform static analysis, and write comprehensive tests to cover all possible scenarios and interactions."},{"prompt":"","completion":"It seems like your message is empty.

});","completion":"The start file you\'ve provided looks like the entry point for an Express.js web application with additional services and security mechanisms. Here\'s a review of the various components and setup within the file: ***Environment Configuration:*** - It starts by requiring `dotenv` for loading environment variables from a `.env` file - this is good practice for keeping sensitive information out of the codebase. ***Module Imports:*** - Common modules are being imported like `express`, `body-parser`, `lodash`, `path`, `helmet` which are standard for an Express.js application. - `helmet` being included for enhancing security is a great inclusion. - Custom services like `Logger` and `MongodbService` are being imported, indicating that the app separates concerns by having different files manage different functionalities. - `lockManager` (from `node-locksmith`) is being used to prevent multiple instances of this service from running simultaneously, which can be important depending on the use case of the application. ***Body Parsing Middleware:*** - The file setup includes `body-parser` to parse JSON and URL-encoded payloads with a high-size limit (`50mb`) that should be reviewed against your application\'s needs. This may present a risk if the application will process a lot of large requests, both from a performance and security perspective (e.g., potential for denial-of-service attacks). ***CORS Middleware:*** - CORS is set up to allow all origins (`*`), which could be insecure depending on the deployment environment; it\'s advisable to explicitly specify which domains can access your application. ***Static Files:*** - The application serves static files from a `public` directory; paths are being set up redundantly with `app.use(express.static(\'public\'));` and `app.use(\'/public\', express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, \'public\')));`. One of these entries seems unnecessary and might be a remnant of refactoring. ***Database:*** - There\'s a database connection setup for MongoDB, and it exits the application if the initial connection fails. This is a fairly common practice for ensuring that an application does not run in a partially broken state. ***Routes:*** - Routes are dynamically loaded and associated with their controllers using Lodash, which suggests flexibility and a scalable project structure for routing. ***Error Handling:*** - There\'s centralized error handling that logs errors and responds with a generic message. This helps prevent leaking stack traces or other sensitive information. ***Server Configuration:*** - The server port is taken from the configuration file, which provides flexibility for different deployment environments. ***Initialization Function:*** - The `initializeApp` function is an asynchronous function that bootstraps the application. It is immediately invoked at the end of the file, and unhandled promise rejections are caught to log initialization failures. ***Suggestions for Improvement:*** 1. Update `body-parser` middleware usage: Express.js has built-in body parsing capabilities. You can replace `body-parser` with `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`. 2. Review payload size limits: 50MB might be too large depending on your intended use case. 3. Harden CORS settings: Be more specific about the allowed origins if possible. 4. Remove redundant static file serving paths. 5. Consider logging the error message in the `initializeApp().catch()` for more clarity about initialization failures. Overall, the file is well-structured and contains many of the necessary components and security configurations needed for a typical web service. However, there are some areas where you can improve or refine the setup based on security best practices and modern Express.js capabilities."},{"prompt":"can you do that show the file again","completion":"Certainly!

Ezek az üzenetek arra utalhatnak, hogy az ffmpeg sikeresen végrehajtotta az átméretezési műveletet, és elkészítette a különböző felbontású videófájlokat. Ez különösen hasznos lehet, ha például több felbontásra van szükség, például különböző készülékekhez vagy közösségi média platformokhoz. Az ffmpeg lehetőséget biztosít a videofájlok kiválasztására és az átméretezés szabályozására a parancssorból vagy szkriptből történő vezérléssel. A zöld szín használata jelzi, hogy az átméretezési művelet sikeresen megtörtént, és az új felbontású videofájlok elkészültek.

Az egyenletes felbontású videó azonos pixelmérettel és képaránnyal rendelkezik az egész tartalom területén. Az átméretezés oka lehet, hogy az adott videót további feldolgozási lépésekre készítik elő, ahol az egyenletes felbontás előnyösebb lehet. Például, ha a videót tovább szeretnék konvertálni vagy össze akarják fűzni más videofájlokkal, az egyenletes felbontás könnyebben kezelhető és konzisztens kimenetet eredményez. Az átméretezés során a ffmpeg a változó méretű képeket vagy videofrámeket átalakítja és a kívánt felbontásra hozza. Ezért az eredeti nem egyenletes felbontású videó egységes képarányú és pixelméretű videóvá válik.

Videókonverzió során az ffmpeg erőforrásigényes folyamat, amely magas CPU- és GPU-használatot eredményezhet. Az intenzív processzorhasználat és a nagy grafikus terhelés fogyasztja az akkumulátort. Ez azt jelenti, hogy hosszabb ideig tarthat a konverzió és ezáltal a telefon akkumulátorának merülése is gyorsabban történhet. Ezt különösen figyelembe kell venni, ha a telefon töltésénél alacsony az akkumulátor töltöttségi szintje. Emellett a hosszú videónak magasabb tárolóigénye lehet, ami további hatást gyakorolhat az akkumulátorra. Az adatok mozgatása, tárolása és feldolgozása több energiát igényel. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy az akkumulátor fogyasztását több tényező is befolyásolhatja, mint például a telefon hardverének minősége, az ffmpeg feldolgozási beállításai és a hálózati kapcsolat. Mindig érdemes figyelembe venni az akkumulátor töltöttségét és szükség esetén feltölteni vagy csatlakoztatni az eszközt egy töltőhöz, hogy elkerüljék a váratlan kikapcsolást közben a konverziós folyamat."},{"prompt":"so i review the contract LINE BY LINE // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

If the external contract is designed to recursively call back into the Ubiquity Dollar Token contract, it could lead to a reentrancy attack. This could potentially allow the attacker to drain funds or manipulate contract state before the initial transaction is completed. Are there any reentrancy guards in place for functions that interact with external contracts, specifically the `_checkAndApplyIncentives` function?-issue 2Incorrect Access Controlhigh The `setIncentiveContract` function allows setting an incentive contract for any account. If the access control is not properly configured or if there is a bug in the access control implementation, unauthorized users could potentially set malicious incentive contracts. This could lead to unauthorized incentive logic being executed during token transfers, which could manipulate the contract\'s intended behavior or cause loss of funds. Has the access control logic been audited to ensure that only authorized roles can call the `setIncentiveContract` function? -issue 3 Arbitrary Code Execution via Incentive Contractscritical The `_checkAndApplyIncentives` function calls the `incentivize` method on potentially untrusted incentive contracts. If an attacker can set a malicious contract as an incentive contract, they could execute arbitrary code within the context of the Ubiquity Dollar Token contract. This could lead to unauthorized actions, such as token theft or disruption of contract functionality. Are there any mechanisms in place to ensure that only trusted contracts can be set as incentive contracts and called by the `_checkAndApplyIncentives` function? -issue 4 Denial of Service via Incentive Contracthigh If a malicious or buggy incentive contract is set, it could fail and revert when the `incentivize` function is called, causing all transfers that trigger the incentive logic to fail. This could be used to lock funds and prevent legitimate operations, effectively causing a denial of service (DoS) for the token contract. What happens if an incentive contract reverts during the execution of the `incentivize` function? Is there a mechanism to prevent a denial of service in such a case?-issue 5 Unauthorized Upgrade Attackcritical The `_authorizeUpgrade` function allows the contract to be upgraded to a new implementation. If the access control for this function is not secure or if there is a way to bypass the intended access control, an attacker could potentially upgrade the contract to a malicious implementation. This could result in complete control over the contract and its funds by the attacker. How is the access control for the `_authorizeUpgrade` function enforced, and has it been audited for security vulnerabilities?","completion":"When reviewing a Solidity contract for security vulnerabilities, it\'s important to understand how the contract functions, how access controls are implemented, and the context in which external contracts are interacted with. Here are considerations for each of the issues you\'ve outlined: 1. **Reentrancy Attack**: The contract\'s `_checkAndApplyIncentives` function does interact with external contracts, which is a vector for reentrancy attacks. The Solidity code you\'ve provided does not show a reentrancy guard (like the `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin\'s ReentrancyGuard library). Without such a guard, the concern about reentrancy is valid. This risk should be mitigated by implementing reentrancy protection mechanisms. 2. **Incorrect Access Control**: The `setIncentiveContract` function is protected by a `require` statement that checks if the caller has the `GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE`. This should ensure that only users with this role can call the function. However, this assumes the role management system within the `accessControl` contract is secure and correctly implemented. If these assumptions hold, and there are no other bugs or backdoors, then access control is likely correctly managed. An audit should confirm the correctness and integrity of the role management system. 3. **Arbitrary Code Execution via Incentive Contracts**: The issue raised is valid since `incentivize` is called on contracts that might be untrusted. There is no evident code here to check that the called contracts are trustworthy before interaction occurs. One way to reduce this risk is to whitelist known, audited incentive contracts and disallow arbitrary addresses being used. 4. **Denial of Service via Incentive Contracts**: If an `incentivize` call fails, it will revert the transaction, leading to a potential DoS condition. To prevent this, the Ubiquity Dollar Token contract could implement a try-catch mechanism around the `incentivize` calls, allowing the rest of the transaction to succeed even if the incentive mechanism fails. This is not present in the provided code snippet. 5. **Unauthorized Upgrade Attack**: The `_authorizeUpgrade` function is intended as an internal function meant to be used only by the proxy admin when the contract is deployed as an upgradable contract (usually through a proxy pattern like OpenZeppelin\'s `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`). However, without the full view of the upgradeability infrastructure and relevant access control implementation, it\'s impossible to evaluate the exact risk. This function should be accessible only to a highly privileged role (such as an admin), and this role should be protected with multi-signature wallets and/or timelocks to prevent unauthorized upgrades. Each of these issues is a legitimate concern and warrants thorough review and testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and a comprehensive audit by professional auditors specialising in smart contract security. If any part of the access control system or incentive mechanism is not secure, the risks you\'ve highlighted could indeed be exploited."},{"prompt":"prove they are valid or invalid with evidence","completion":"To prove the validity or invalidity of the security concerns you listed, one would typically need to inspect the code in its entirety, look for further assurances within the code itself or in its deployment context, and review the findings of professional security audits. Since I can only review the given code snippet, I will analyze each concern and provide explanations based on the provided code and standard Solidity/security practices. 1. **Reentrancy Attack**: - **Evidence of Vulnerability**: There are no apparent reentrancy guards, such as OpenZeppelin\'s `nonReentrant` modifier, in the code snippet provided. The `_checkAndApplyIncentives` function calls external contracts, which is a typical reentrancy attack vector. - **Proving Validity**: To prove this vulnerability is valid, one would need to demonstrate a scenario where reentrancy can be exploited, or simply reference the lack of protective measures against reentrancy (e.g., no `nonReentrant` modifier used). - **Invalidity**: To prove this is not a concern, there needs to be evidence in other parts of the code (not provided here) where protection mechanisms are implemented. 2. **Incorrect Access Control**: - **Evidence of Correct Access Control**: The code checks whether the caller has the appropriate role using `accessControl.hasRole(GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE, _msgSender())`. - **Proving Validity**: For a vulnerability to be proven valid, one would need to show that it is possible for an unauthorized actor to call this function despite the role check. - **Invalidity**: Invalidity would require showing the role system is correctly implemented with no flaws, possibly referencing an audit report or specific tests that confirm its correctness. 3. **Arbitrary Code Execution via Incentive Contracts**: - **Evidence of Vulnerability**: The provided code does not restrict what addresses can be set as incentive contracts. It assumes trust in the deployed contracts. - **Proving Validity**: To establish this risk as valid, one could present case studies of similar vulnerabilities being exploited or simply point to the lack of a whitelisting mechanism or contract verification. - **Invalidity**: To prove this invalid, one would need to find checks elsewhere in the codebase or deployment process that ensure only safe, audited contracts are interacted with. 4. **Denial of Service via Incentive Contracts**: - **Evidence of Vulnerability**: Given that failed execution of the `incentivize` function leads to transaction reversion, this holds a risk for a DoS attack if incentive contracts are faulty or malicious. - **Proving Validity**: This is a valid concern as a smart contract design best practice is to prevent such vulnerabilities. Similar to the vulnerabilities above, proving this requires demonstrating the lack of handling mechanisms or showing the incentive contracts\' unpredictability. - **Invalidity**: Invalidity evidence might include contract-level mechanisms that handle incentive contract failures gracefully. 5. **Unauthorized Upgrade Attack**: - **Evidence of Vulnerability**: The `_authorizeUpgrade` function is part of standard upgradeability infrastructure for smart contracts. - **Proving Validity**: To demonstrate validity, one would need to show the absence or weakness of access controls surrounding the upgrading process (not fully shown in the snippet). - **Invalidity**: Demonstrating invalidity would entail showing robust access controls, timelocks, or multisig requirements surrounding upgrade permissions, possibly via external security audits or additional mechanisms not present in the snippet. In summary, proving the validity or invalidity of these concerns typically requires a more comprehensive review than reviewing a single code snippet in isolation. Full contract source, deployment information, and an understanding of the surrounding development practices and security audits are necessary to make a final determination on the security of these systems. Since I do not have access to the full scope of resources required for such a review, and additional context is necessary, I am unable to provide definitively \\"proven\\" conclusions on the security of the smart contract based exclusively on the snippet provided. Professional auditors use a combination of manual review, automated tools, and formal verification to rigorously test and prove the security of smart contracts."},{"prompt":"Subject: Parking problem in front of the entrance to the Sultana and Noufah halls Dear Mr. Badri, I hope this email finds you well.

Si deve quindi assicurarsi di assegnare e accedere ai buffer in modo corretto, rispettando l\'ordine dei dati temporali. 2. **Errore di visualizzazione/scalatura**: Un problema potrebbe derivare dalla differenza di scala tra ATR e MA. Se l\'ATR indicherà valori molto piccoli rispetto alla MA (o viceversa), potrebbe apparire come una linea piatta perché la scala del subwindow si adatta al valore di più ampio intervallo. 3. **Errata inizializzazione dei buffer**: In alcuni esempi, potrebbero mancare inizializzazioni adeguate dei buffer, cosa che in MQL4 è essenziale per assicurare la corretta visualizzazione dei dati. Senza un\'assegnazione adeguata, i buffer potrebbero contenere dati spazzatura o non essere visualizzati affatto. 4. **Mancato controllo delle condizioni di calcolo**: In alcuni esempi mancava il controllo di condizioni importanti, come assicurarsi che ci siano abbastanza barre di dati disponibili per calcolare gli indicatori oppure la gestione di `prev_calculated` per ottimizzare il codice e ridurre il carico di calcolo. 5. **Indicator Drawing Settings (Impostazioni di disegno dell\'indicatore)**: Non erano impostati correttamente gli stili di disegno e i parametri delle linee degli indicatori, compresi i simboli grafici per i segnali di incrocio.

This pioneering approach capitalises on the assortment of sensory faculties humanoid robots, specifically the NAO robot, accommodate- including tactile, pressure, sonar, microphone, and infrared sensors- in concert with vision systems for object recognition and motion planning. Through the incorporation of the Design Research methodology (encompassing and embodying specifically the sequential phases being, ‘Understand, Empathise, Define, Ideate, and Prototype’), in tandem with innumerable hours’ worth of studio sessions spent arduously refining our iterative prototyping and Choregraphe proficiencies, our complete framework assimilates insights garnered from an intensive global literature review of great scope to meticulously sculpt the programmes design to what we unanimously determined was fitting. Informed by an empathetic understanding of patient requirements, we commenced with the purpose of catapulting the best interests of users to the forefront of our initiative. Our preliminary investigation has yielded noteworthy findings, indicating a substantial augmentation in patient engagement and nascent effectivity. The combination of the aforementioned aptitudes that the NAO robot boasts, warrants to foster the establishment of an assistive tool that bolsters versatility and efficacy- prognosticating a significant metamorphosis in therapy protocols. The research treatise provided herein, supplemented by an illustrative exposition on YouTube; the quintessence of our inventive efforts is captured- endeavours that are poised to become a cornerstone for ensuing progress in rehabilitative robotic technologies. 1. Introduction – In the ether of physical rehabilitation, the integration of humanoid robotics as adjunct assistants exhibits the transformative potentiality to alleviate healthcare constraints- coupled with the daunting adversities the accelerating pace of aging populations globally exerts on healthcare systems, innovative approaches to physiotherapy are irrefutably necessitated. Notwithstanding the indispensability of physiotherapeutic practices, it often finds itself incessantly grappling with restrictions attributable to resource scarcity, namely a disparity in patient-to-therapist ratios, which is further exacerbated by the somatic cumulative fatigue exacted on practitioners across recurrent sessions (Dautenhahn & Werry, 2005). Humanoid robots, such as NAO, herald a prospective pathway to supplement the ubiquitous delivery of efficacious and consistent therapeutic interventions; within this promising context, this study purports to focus on both the utilisation of the NAO robot for the amelioration of the recovery process for those with limb mobility impairments, alongside the systematic investigation of the prevalent restraints within conventional rehabilitation modalities whilst ascertaining the function humanoid robots may serve in the process. 1.1 Literature Review & The Traditional Methods and International Horizon for Robotics Intervention – In continuation of the scintillating premise elucidated heretofore, and as previously alluded to in the abstract, the dawn of the 21st century has begotten a transformative era for physiotherapy, with conventional, ‘hands-on’ techniques being incrementally complemented by humanoid robotics and other tantamount mediums of auxiliary technology. These orthodox procedures, by nature being labour-intensive, frequently entail manual therapies delivered by physiotherapists inclusive of massages, stretches, and reconstructive exercises for the betterment of patient mobility, and holistic bodily potency and functionality (Krebs, et al., 2003; O\'Sullivan & Schmitz, 2007). The primary merits of these customary therapeutic rehabilitative modalities reside in the bespoke nurtured patient-practitioner rapport, and the perspicaciously adept evaluation via physiotherapists concerning both tissue impedance along with patient feedback throughout the duration of the remedial treatment (Jones, 2006). In light of these developments, the explication of humanoid robotic applications in physiotherapy beckons a comprehensive review of the current literature to unfurl a taxonomy of extant methodologies and the frontiers of robotic intervention. Embellished by the notion that the rote, repetitive, and structured fabric of physiotherapeutic procedures is amenable to mechanisation (Krebs, et al., 2018), the valiant NAO humanoid robot stands at the vanguard of this therapeutic odyssey, its intrinsic competency to deliver indefatigable, exact, and individualised care denoting a considerable enhancement in catering to the rehabilitative exigencies of those that are beset by limb mobility limitations (Gassert & Dietz, 2018). The perspicacious exploration into the orthodox channels on the subject of rehabilitation unveils a mosaic where the manual ministrations of physiotherapists remain the fulcrum of therapeutic engagement, albeit encumbered by the innate frailties pertaining to humanoid demonstrated endurance, and the necessitated prerequisites of a global demographic metamorphosis. As the pendulum of healthcare imperatives oscillates with amplifying extent, the dialogue gravitates toward the ingenious assimilation of humanoid robotics as salient participants to expedite physiotherapeutic modus operandi. The inherent adaptability of humanoid robots, their burgeoning autonomy buttressed by artificial intelligence, in conjunction with their proviso for both motoric involvement and sensory feedback bespeak their prospective function as integral intermediaries that can facilitate, replicate, and magnify therapeutic stratagems that are propounded by their respective human counterparts (Dautenhahn & Werry, 2005; Johnson, et al., 2014). Amidst the ambit of medical/ physiotherapeutic apparatus refinement, a cornucopia of varying countries have begun championing the inception of innovative resolutions to traverse the particularised constraints integral to their corresponding healthcare dilemmas. In light of the relentlessly swelling geriatric populace, as formerly noted, paired with the necessity for the effective administration and economisation of health-related expenses, the pertinence of these technologies is at an unprecedented zenith. Echoing sentiments expressed earlier; Japan has systematically displayed laudable foresight in the proactive amalgamation of humanoid robotic technology into the operational fabric of its healthcare milieus. With the illustrious pantheon of robotic applications, conceived by the visionary minds at Cyberdyne, the HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb) robot stands out as a paradigmatic instance of applied humanoid robotics, substantially aiding, and propelling the rehabilitative and ambulatory capabilities for those that exhibit varying degrees of motor control diminution and limb functionality restrictions- advantages of which are recognised by our collaborative humanoid robot assistance physiotherapist project that via our pursuits, we are eager to see emulated and established on a more universal front. The application of this Cyberdyne devised exoskeletal contrivances in question have showcased promising advances, serving to not only reinforce patients beset by muscular debilitation, but also endorsing recuperative measures for those that are recovering from strokes and enduring spinal cord attributed afflictions (Suzuki, et al., 2015; Demura, et al., 2015; Dario, et al., 2012). Irrespective of the emergence of auspicious prospects engendered by these automated mechanisms, a discernible breadth of scepticism continues in its manifestation. Critics have universally and understandably voiced their concerns concerning indiscriminate dependency on techno-centric resolutions, underscoring the risks of attenuating interpersonal engagement, in addition to the latent obfuscation of the hitherto sacrosanct patient-practitioner dynamic- a linchpin of customary physiotherapeutic practice (Dautenhahn, 2007; Turkle, 2011). Concomitantly, academic circles have articulated trepidations pertaining to the possible diminishment of the intuitive and empathic characteristics germane to human nurturance, facets that could prove inimitable via mechanisation (Goetz, et al., 2008; Sparrow & Sparrow, 2006). They are insistent upon the methodologically rigorous scrutinization of the employment of humanoid robotics and anything analogous, to ascertain the effectivity, and socio-ethical ramifications of the supplantation of human hands for mechanical ones. Nevertheless, pertinent empirical evidence increasingly substantiates the efficacy of humanoid robotic methodologies with research inquiries by (Mehrholz, et al., 2018) and (Lo, et al., 2010) being a testament to this proclamation where they highlight the robots’ enhancement of accelerated convalescence and meticulous adherence to therapeutic protocols. This assertion is corroborated by systematic appraisals that posit rehabilitative robotic therapies as synergistic interventions capable of augmenting traditional practices rather than supplanting them (Bertani, et al., 2017; Prange, et al., 2006; Nourouzi-Gheidari, et al., 2012). 1.2 Research Problem Statement – The convergence of humanoid robotics and other comparable mediums, united with rehabilitative physiotherapeutic regimens embodies a revolutionary reconfiguration- reconceptualising remedial frontiers, and the delivery of healthcare. Nonetheless, the incipient realm of this field teems with multifaceted complexities, mandating an assiduous scholarly inquisition of its operational feasibility, clinical effectivity, and ethical conundrums. Faced with a glaring international dearth of physiotherapeutic practitioners (WCPT, 2019), the intensified necessity for humanoid robotic aid is rendered ever more paramount than before. The assignment of humanoid robotics as an appendage to physiotherapists, taking Aldebaran’s NAO as a pertinent exemplar, culminates in pivotal considerations: Can these ingenious personifications of amalgamated science and technology mirror the intricacy-enveloped therapy customarily orchestrated by professional clinicians? How do patients perceive mechanical touch when juxtaposed with empathetic and compassionate human contact (Silver, et al., 2020)? In the nascent intersection or robotics and rehabilitative care, humanoid automatons are tasked with bridging the gaping divide between preprogrammed movements and individualistic patient therapeutic exigencies- a nexus where technical variability and human volatility coalesce (Veerbeek, et al., 2017). The unification of robotic sensorimotor proficiencies with the distinctive imperatives of personalised rehabilitation embodies a formidable research endeavour, necessitating the construction of advanced and accommodating algorithms that can modulate therapeutic procedures dynamically, in synchronisation with patient progress (Dipietro, et al., 2017; Encarnação & Azevedo, 2013). This intricate equilibrium hinges upon the robot’s acuity in the cognizance and interpretation of feedback by means of a repertoire of sensors, engineered to capture subtleties of human physiology and emotion with unwavering precision in order to ascertain remedial actions are not only efficacious, but finely attuned to feedback from patients (Scherer, et al., 2015; Amirabdollahian, et al., 2013; Calderita, et al., 2014). Furthermore, the ethical implications of the conjunction of humanoid robotics (NAO being an exemplary medium) in concert with the sensitive domain of rehabilitative physiotherapy assume centre stage. The momentous juncture of a non-human construct, conceivably imbued with synthetic empathy, thrusts upon us critical interrogatives vis-à-vis the sacrosanctity of patient autonomy and the authenticity of the formed therapeutic alliance (Bryson, 2020; Vallor, 2016). Ethical stewardship mandates stringent policies and AI governance frameworks, guaranteeing that such automatons function within the confines of ethical precepts and safeguarding patients from a spectrum of potential psychological and physical adversity (Basl, 2014; Borenstein & Arkin, 2016). The genesis of humanoid robotics in the sphere of psychotherapeutics is contingent on its astute congruence with the intrinsic essence of caregiving- an endeavour that is not merely technological but is indelibly enmeshed amid the convoluted lattice of human ethos, cultural contexts, and social mores (Coenen, 2016; Misselhorn, et al., 2013). Preserving the fidelity of this nuanced equipoise stands as an indispensable and exhaustive scholarly obligation, demanding the choreography of a masterful synthesis of carefully constructed interventions with the essential dogmas of patient-oriented care (Johansson-Pajala, 2020). 2. Design Research Method – In the formulation of a humanoid robotic physiotherapeutic aide, our methodology employs an exhaustive Design Research Methodology (DRM), harmonising the prowess of revolutionarily innovative technology in conjunction with the nuanced demands of therapeutic effectiveness. Our investigation process is methodologically orchestrated, commencing with a comprehensive critique of prevalent robotic frameworks, featuring an empathic analysis of the NAO humanoid automaton by virtue of its dexterity in its facilitation of human-robot interactions. In the course of our scholarly inquiry, we conduct a thorough assessment of its sensorimotor faculties, melding touch, pressure, and sound sensory systems, fundamental for devising interventions paralleling the adaptive responses of an actual bona fide physiotherapist (Gouaillier, et al., 2008; Belpaeme, et al., 2012). The foundational ‘Understand’ phase carries out thorough literature reviews, synthesising studies across disciplines to probe physiotherapeutic prerequisites and the technological status quo. ‘Empathise’ delves further, gleaning perspectives from patient experiences and professional feedback to discern specific complexities and requirements. The subsequent ‘Define’ phase distils understanding into tangible design criteria, giving rise to the ‘Ideate’ stage, where inventive approaches arise within technical, ethical, and regulatory parameters. Proceeding to the conclusive juncture being ‘Prototype,’ we collaboratively utilised sophisticated mediums, inclusive of Choregraphe to define the NAO’s behaviours and validate our conceptualisation through contrived patient-robot interaction vignettes. Our design undergoes successive iterations of appraisal and amelioration, culminating in a programme that exemplifies a nuanced amalgamation of a proficient technological aptitude, and therapeutic congruity. Illustrated on the next page are screenshots of the work-flow sequence that I developed on Aldebaran’s Choregraphe software to programme the NAO robot’s behaviourisms to mimic accordingly those of which would be executed by a rehabilitative physiotherapeutic assistant in order to achieve its purported function: 3. Finding and Reflection – Implementation Discussion – The phased integration of the NAO humanoid robot (primarily focussed on limb rehabilitation) into the exploratory role as an adjunct rehabilitative physiotherapy practitioner within clinical settings constituted a series of refined adaptations, assiduously aligning the contours of technological execution with the demands of therapeutic success. During all phases of conception and implementation, the aforesaid team members and I espoused a human-centric methodology. Within the confines of our university, scrupulous analysis entailed the utilisation of the NAO robot, proficiently programmed to administer bodily rehabilitation regimens, bolstered by the unification of sensory feedback to yield real time adaptability- resultantly with convenience and competence being advantageous bi-products of humanoid robotic deployment. The on-site callous validation process comprised of the deployment of the NAO humanoid robot, of which was collaboratively intricately programmed and coded through the employment of Aldebaran’s exclusive Choregraphe software, to conduct limb recuperation regimens, augmented by the convergence of sensory feedback systems (encapsulating tactile, pressure, sonar, microphone, and infrared sensors) for dynamic adjustability (Gupta & Zhang, 2021). Technical and Ethical Issues with their respective Resolutions – Whilst pioneering the development of a humanoid mechanism envisioned to undertake the responsibilities of an assistant physiotherapist, we were confronted with a plethora of conundrums, salient to accentuating technical and ethical quandaries. Affirming that the NAO’s tactile and pressure sensors yielded precise data was of utmost importance and warranted meticulous configuration, an indispensable measure underscored by (Smith, 2020), synergised with one of our primary objectives of certifying precision, and safe physical interactions between the humanoid robot and patients through diligent sensor integration as detailed by (Zhang, et al., 2020). The blueprint for the establishment of fluid interplay between humanoid robots and their corresponding human counterparts comprised a vicious cycle of iterative testing and refinement, leveraging ourselves as a team for simulation modes of rudimentary patient interactions, which thereby amplified the robot’s responsiveness (Johnson & Anderson, 2021). Behavioural synchronisation within Aldebaran’s Choregraphe software revolves around the elaborate coordination of a multitude of timelines and boxes denoting distinct behaviours or motion sequences. When programming the NAO robot, particularly for delicate undertakings akin to rehabilitative physiotherapeutic assistance, the synchrony of motion and interaction behaviours is of the essence. A complication commonly manifests during the endeavour to cohesively interweave a sequence of movements, gestures, and sensory feedback manoeuvres such that they transition from one action to the next are both anthropomorphic and seamless. Choregraphe is dependent on a developer-oriented visual drag-and-drop interface which, notwithstanding its user-centricity, has the potential to conceal the sophistication of temporally contingent interactions involving the NAO’s actuators and sensors, especially to novices as we were formerly, when we embarked on this venture through the application and comprehension of Choregraphe. With regards to the vitality of the synchrony of kinematic behaviours and interactivity routines, an additional significant technical blockade materialised, the dilemma in question, being the loss of balance and subsequent and seemingly recurring falls experienced by the NAO robot. At the outset, my contributions were instrumental in the discovery that the default motion algorithms ingrained within the Choregraphe framework failed to appropriately account for the sophisticated balance dynamics necessary for smooth walking on surfaces characterised by any degree of uneven terrain. Through our combined efforts, we enacted the purposeful repositioning of the centre of mass in the programmed architecture of the robot’s digital blueprints via Choregraphe, engendering superior postural stability for the NAO. We operationalised this by way of the diminution of the centre of gravity within the Choregraphe interface, thus attaining a more stable locomotive rhythm (Kajita, et al., 2003). Concurrent with the technological considerations the incorporation of humanoid robots inside the context of physiotherapy precipitates, it would be imprudent to omit the unneglectable tapestry of ethical intricacies this implementation carries; ethical deliberations of which mandate scrupulous governance with the aim of ensuring the welfare of patients and fruitful therapeutic achievements. The trajectory toward the integration of the NAO automaton as a rehabilitative physiotherapeutic facilitator into clinical practice draws forth ethical issues surrounding patient autonomy, privacy, and not to mention the looming peril of care becoming devoid of personal engagement- rendering the patient-practitioner relationship dispassionately detached. Autonomy within the healthcare milieu articulates the notion that patients, predicated on informed understanding, inherently possess the prerogative to deliberate on and consent to their respective course of treatment (Beauchamp & Childress, 2013). The advent of an anthropoid humanoid robot carried with it the spectre of impinging upon patient autonomy, the automaton’s advisements bearing the possibility of being mistaken by patients for imperious commands, deeming the NAO’s guidance as conclusive, thus inadvertently imperilling the integrity of patient volitional autonomous decision-making. As a palliative measure to alleviate such concerns, our approach instituted a protocol whereby any initial exchanges between the NAO and patients were prefaced by unequivocal verbal and written elucidations concerning the robot’s ancillary function, reinforcing the patient’s autonomy to either voluntarily dismiss or take heed of any automated guidance. With ethical implications in the spotlight, privacy concerns present themselves with the prospect of the robot [that harnesses inputs from numerous sensors and cameras, necessitating rigorous data protection countermeasures] amassing sensitive patient health information; the maladministration of which may precipitate breaches of confidentiality (Mittelstadt, et al., 2016; Van-Wynsberghe, 2013). As an appropriate response to these concerns, the adoption of impermeable and robust encryption methods, the adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other parallel privacy standards, and conformity of stringent data storage safeguards to ensure the safety of the harvested information, warrants primary focus (Hoofnagle, et al., 2019; Westin, 2003).\\" Whilst taking the above question specifications and my answer into consideration, please can you write me an entry for ONLY THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIED SECTION BEING in 200 words at most ‘4.

Conclusions and Future Work Our rigorous foray into humanoid robotics within physiotherapy has unveiled promising vistas. The confluence of NAO\'s multifarious sensorium and adaptive robotics portends a paradigm shift - a harbinger of assiduous and tailored rehabilitation aiding an overtaxed healthcare ecosystem (Bertani et al., 2017). While we attest to preliminary triumphs, spotlighting enhanced patient engagement, prodigious challenges loom - notably, achieving seamlessness in human-robot symbiosis and allaying ethical conundrums (Mehrholz et al., 2018; Bryson, 2020). Future explorations must burgeon towards perfecting the tactile finesse of robots to approximate the physiotherapist\'s healing touch (Zhang et al., 2020), harnessing cutting-edge AI to interpolate nuanced patient feedback into personalized therapeutic regimens (Amirabdollahian et al., 2013). Ethically, a conscientious probe is imperative - navigating the preservation of human touch in care, while leveraging robotic precision (Vallor, 2016). Advancing, the governance of AI and robotics in healthcare necessitates robust frameworks, ensuring alignment with sacrosanct patient-centric values (Borenstein & Arkin, 2016). Focused on expanding our prototype\'s abilities, we aim to conjoin the benevolence of clinician care with the indefatigability of our NAO assistant - striding towards an orthogenesis where technology embellishes rather than eclipses the human element in healing (Coenen, 2016).

Начиная с эпохи Возрождения формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Ма- киавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представ- ление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность постро- ения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII в. формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и со- вершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается тради- ция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с при- родно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско- историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человече- ства на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются эконо- мика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и клас- совая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как есте- ственно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической фор- мации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сто- ронники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) пред- лагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искус- ство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму каждая из них имеет свой жиз- ненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу ХХ в. в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (ХIХ–ХХ вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни об- щества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение тех- нократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграр- но-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (ин- формационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующе- го сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, про- изводство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и са- моразвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетиче- ской – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в тако- го рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная мето- дология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием ма- лых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве со- циума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом.

Below is a detailed explanation and table showcasing the differences between the two: 1. Entrepreneurial Readiness: Entrepreneurial readiness refers to the preparedness and aptitude of an individual or team to undertake entrepreneurial activities. It focuses on the personal characteristics, skills, and mindset required to start and manage a business venture successfully. Entrepreneurial readiness involves the following aspects: - Personal traits and characteristics: This includes traits such as risk-taking propensity, self-confidence, perseverance, creativity, and passion for innovation. Entrepreneurs need to possess these qualities to effectively deal with the uncertainty and challenges of running a business. - Business knowledge and skills: Entrepreneurs must have a thorough understanding of various business functions such as marketing, finance, operations, and human resources. They also need to develop specific skills like negotiation, problem-solving, leadership, and adaptability. - Financial readiness: Having financial resources or access to capital is crucial for entrepreneurs to initiate and sustain their business ventures. This may involve personal savings, loans, grants, or attracting investors. - Network and support: Entrepreneurs should establish a network of mentors, advisors, and business partners who can provide guidance, experience, and support throughout their entrepreneurial journey. - Risk tolerance: Entrepreneurs must be willing to take calculated risks, as entrepreneurship inherently involves uncertainty and potential challenges that can lead to failures or setbacks. 2. Strategic Readiness: Strategic readiness refers to an organization\'s preparedness to develop and execute effective strategies to achieve its goals and objectives. It involves aligning the organization\'s resources, capabilities, and core competencies with its strategic plans. Strategic readiness encompasses the following factors: - Vision and Mission: An organization should have a clear vision of its desired future state and a well-defined mission statement that outlines its purpose, values, and strategic direction. - Environmental Analysis: Organizations need to continuously assess and analyze internal and external factors, such as industry trends, market dynamics, competitors, and customer needs. This analysis helps identify opportunities and threats to guide strategic decision-making. - Resource Allocation: Strategic readiness entails effectively allocating resources, including financial and non-financial assets, to support the implementation of strategic initiatives and achieve desired outcomes. - Organizational Structure and Culture: Organizations must have a structure and culture that are adaptable, flexible, and conducive to strategic change and innovation. This includes empowering employees, fostering open communication, and promoting a learning and entrepreneurial mindset. - Strategic Planning and Execution: Developing comprehensive strategic plans, setting goals, and establishing performance metrics are crucial components of strategic readiness. Additionally, effective execution through coordinated actions, monitoring progress, and making necessary adjustments is vital for successful strategy implementation. Table showcasing the differences between entrepreneurial readiness and strategic readiness: | Factors | Entrepreneurial Readiness | Strategic Readiness | |-----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------| | Focus | Individual/team | Organization | | Key aspects | Personal traits, skills | Vision, mission, environmental analysis | | financial readiness, network, risk tolerance | resource allocation, structure, culture | | Purpose | Starting and managing a | Developing and executing effective | | business venture | strategies | | Timeframe | Pre-startup and startup | Long-term | | Orientation | Individual capabilities | Organizational capabilities | | Outcome | Successful entrepreneurship| Strategic goal achievement | | Examples | Entrepreneurs, startups | Established companies, organizations | While entrepreneurial readiness focuses on the personal attributes and skills of individuals or teams, strategic readiness looks at the readiness of an entire organization to develop and execute effective strategies. Both factors are crucial to achieve success in the dynamic and competitive business landscape."},{"prompt":"¿Las plantillas ortopédicas corregirá mis rodillas y mi pie plano si tengo 25 años","completion":"La efectividad de las plantillas ortopédicas para corregir las rodillas y el pie plano en adultos, como alguien de 25 años, depende de la causa subyacente y la severidad de las condiciones. Pie plano: En adultos, el pie plano puede ser el resultado de una debilidad estructural, lesiones, desgaste o condiciones médicas. Las plantillas ortopédicas pueden ayudar a mejorar la alineación del pie, redistribuir la presión y proporcionar soporte al arco, lo cual puede reducir el dolor y mejorar la función del pie. Sin embargo, es poco probable que las plantillas \\"corrijan\\" permanentemente el pie plano en adultos, ya que la estructura ósea y los tejidos conectivos ya han completado su desarrollo. En cambio, las plantillas pueden ayudar a manejar los síntomas y evitar problemas secundarios. Rodillas: Si tienes problemas de alineación en las rodillas como genu valgo (rodillas que se juntan) o genu varo (rodillas arqueadas hacia afuera), las plantillas pueden ayudar a mejorar la posición de las rodillas al caminar y al estar de pie. Esto puede aliviar el dolor y prevenir el desgaste adicional de las articulaciones. Las plantillas personalizadas pueden diseñarse para corregir desequilibrios específicos y mejorar la mecánica de la marcha. Es importante destacar que el uso de plantillas ortopédicas debe ser parte de un enfoque integral. Esto podría incluir fisioterapia, ejercicios de fortalecimiento y estiramiento, y posiblemente pérdida de peso si es necesario, para disminuir la carga sobre las articulaciones de las rodillas y los pies. Para obtener el mejor resultado, es recomendable que te evalúe un profesional de la salud, como un podólogo, ortopedista o fisioterapeuta, quien puede diagnosticar tu condición específica y recomendar un tratamiento adecuado, incluyendo si las plantillas ortopédicas son adecuadas para ti y, en caso afirmativo, qué tipo sería el más beneficioso."},{"prompt":"Hágame un entrenamiento para los pies para corregir pie plano","completion":"Es fundamental recordar que, mientras que los ejercicios pueden fortalecer los músculos del pie y mejorar la alineación y el funcionamiento, podrían no \\"corregir\\" completamente la condición del pie plano en un adulto, ya que la estructura ósea se ha desarrollado completamente. Sin embargo, los ejercicios pueden ser muy útiles para manejar los síntomas y mejorar la movilidad y la fuerza. Aquí tienes un entrenamiento de ejemplo que puede ayudar a fortalecer los pies: 1. **Estiramiento de la banda plantar**: - Siéntate con las piernas extendidas frente a ti. - Utiliza una toalla o una banda para tirar suavemente de la parte superior de tus pies hacia ti, manteniendo las piernas rectas. - Sostén durante 15-30 segundos y repite 2-3 veces. 2. **Flexiones de dedos**: - Siéntate o párate y coloca una toalla pequeña en el suelo. - Usando solo los dedos de tus pies, intenta agarrar la toalla y arrastrarla hacia ti. - Haz esto durante unos minutos y repite varias veces. 3. **Levantamiento de talón**: - De pie, levanta los talones del suelo elevándote sobre las puntas de los pies. - Mantén durante unos segundos y luego baja lentamente. - Realiza 2-3 series de 10-15 repeticiones. 4. **Caminata en el borde exterior del pie**: - De pie, con los pies paralelos, coloca peso en los bordes exteriores de tus pies y camina de esta forma durante 30 segundos. - Realiza varias repeticiones, descansando entre cada una. 5. **Elevación de arcos**: - Sentado o de pie, intenta elevar el arco de tu pie manteniendo los dedos de los pies y el talón en el suelo. - Sostén la posición elevada por unos segundos y luego relaja. - Realiza 2-3 series de 10-15 repeticiones. 6. **Ejercicio con pelota de tenis**: - Sentado o de pie, coloca una pelota de tenis debajo de tu pie. - Rueda la pelota hacia adelante y hacia atrás aplicando una presión moderada. - Hazlo durante 2-3 minutos por pie. 7. **Estiramiento del tendón de Aquiles**: - De pie frente a una pared, adelanta un pie y mantén el otro atrás con la rodilla recta y el talón en el suelo. - Inclínate hacia adelante, manteniendo la pierna trasera recta, hasta que sientas un estiramiento en la parte trasera de tu pierna. - Sostén durante 15-30 segundos y repite 2-3 veces por lado. Antes de comenzar cualquier nuevo régimen de ejercicios, especialmente si tienes una condición de salud preexistente, es aconsejable consultar con un profesional de la salud, como un podiatra o fisioterapeuta, para obtener orientación personalizada y asegurarte de que los ejercicios son los más adecuados para tu situación específica."},{"prompt":"¿Es mejor hacerlo de pie?","completion":"Algunos ejercicios se pueden realizar tanto de pie como sentado, dependiendo de tu nivel de fuerza, equilibrio y condición física general. Aquí te explico cómo algunos de estos ejercicios se adaptan si prefieres hacerlos de pie: 1. Flexiones de dedos (Toelifts): - De pie, intenta levantar solo los dedos del suelo manteniendo la planta del pie en contacto con el suelo (es como hacer el contrario de los levantamientos de talón). Esto puede ayudar a fortalecer los músculos que sostienen los arcos de tus pies. 2. Levantamiento de talón (Heel Raises): - Continúalos de la misma forma, elevándote sobre las puntas de los pies y bajando lentamente. Asegúrate de tener algo cerca para apoyarte si necesitas mantener el equilibrio. 3. Elevación de arcos (Arch Lifts): - Desde la posición de pie, concentra el esfuerzo en elevar el arco del pie sin levantar los dedos ni el talón del suelo. Es un movimiento sutil pero efectivo para fortalecer la musculatura del arco. 4. Ejercicio con pelota de tenis: - Puedes hacerlo de pie, pero asegúrate de tener soporte disponible en caso de que necesites equilibrarte. Aplica una presión constante y controlada mientras ruedas la pelota bajo el pie. Además, recuerda mantener una buena postura durante toda la sesión de ejercicios, y si realizarlos de pie resulta incómodo o difícil, puedes comenzar sentado y progresivamente pasar a hacerlos de pie a medida que ganes fuerza y confianza.

Bu devre çeşitli uygulamalarda, özellikle radyo frekansı teknolojilerinde kullanılır. Rezonans, bir L-C devresinde hem endüktör hem de kapasitör arasındaki enerjinin maksimum transfer hızına ulaştığı bir durumu ifade eder. Osilasyon devresinde rezonans, devrenin kendi karakteristik frekansı olan rezonans frekansında meydana gelir. Bu frekans, devrenin kapasitansı ve endüktansı tarafından belirlenir ve genellikle f_0 ile gösterilir. Rezonans frekansı (f_0) basit bir L-C devresi için şu formülle hesaplanabilir: [ f_{0} = frac{1}{2pisqrt{LC}} ] Burada: ( L ) = Endüktörün endüktans değeri (Henry cinsinden), ( C ) = Kapasitörün kapasitans değeri (Farad cinsinden), ( f_{0} ) = Rezonans frekansı (Hertz cinsinden). Rezonans durumunda, kapasitör ve endüktansın reaktansları birbirini nötralize eder ve sadece devrenin Ohmik direnci kalır, bu da akımın maksimum olduğu anlamına gelir. Rezonans durumunda, ideal bir devre varsayıldığında, akım ve gerilim arasındaki faz farkı sıfırdır ve devre safsız bir direnç gibi davranır. Osilasyon devresinde rezonans, devredeki akımın maksimum olmasını sağlar ve devrenin seçici olmasına olanak tanır, yani sadece belirli bir frekans aralığındaki sinyalleri geçirir veya büyütür. Bu özellik, radyo alıcılarında istenilen frekanstaki sinyalleri seçmek için kullanılır. Rezonans, aynı zamanda bazı durumlarda istenmeyen bir etki de yaratabilir. Örneğin, elektrikli güç sistemlerinde rezonans durumları, aşırı voltajlar ve akımlar yaratarak ekipmanlara zarar verebilir ve bu yüzden rezonansın kontrolü önemlidir."},{"prompt":"kondansatör ve bobinden oluşan bir osilasyon devresi ile ortak uçlu arama bobinden oluşan metal dedektöründe ki rezonans kavramınu bana açıkla","completion":"Kondansatör ve bobinden (endüktörden) oluşan osilasyon devresi ile metal dedektörlerindeki rezonans kavramı benzer prensiplere dayanır, fakat uygulama şekilleri farklıdır. Her iki durumda da rezonans prensibi, sinyallerin saptanmasını veya belirli nesnelerin tespit edilmesini sağlar. **Osilasyon Devresi ve Rezonans:** Bir kondansatör (C) ve bobinden (L) oluşan basit bir LC osilasyon devresinde rezonans, devrenin doğal frekansında, yani Seri Rezonans Frekansı\'nda meydana gelir. Burada kapasitans ve endüktans arasındaki enerji transferi en verimli olduğundan, devrenin içindeki akım maksimum seviyeye ulaşır. Bu durum, özellikle verici ve alıcı devrelerde çok değerlidir, çünkü devre, bu rezonans frekansında en yüksek Q faktörüne (kalite faktörü) ve böylece en dar bant genişliğine sahip olur. Bundan dolayı, istenilen frekanstaki sinyalleri en iyi şekilde alabilir veya iletebilir. **Metal Dedektöründeki Rezonans:** Bir metal dedektörü, genel olarak iki temel bobin içerir: biri verici (transmitter) bobin, diğeri ise alıcı (receiver) bobin. Verici bobin, alternatif bir akım (AC) ile beslenir ve çevresinde değişken bir manyetik alan yaratır. Bu alan, yakınlarındaki metal bir nesne tarafından bozulur. Metal dedektörlerinin bir çeşidi olan Ortak Uçlu Arama Bobinden (Bazı kaynaklarda Bilezik Verici Bobin veya Endüktif Denge Bobin olarak geçer) oluşan dedektörler, genellikle iki bobini iç içe yerleştirir ve böylece her ikisinin manyetik alanları arasında dengeli bir durum yaratır. Metal bir nesne dedektörün yakınına geldiğinde, bu nesne verici bobin tarafından oluşturulan manyetik alanı bozar ve alıcı bobinde bir elektrik sinyali üretir. Bu dedektörler genelde bir osilasyon devresi içerir ve bu devre, tespit edilen metal nesne yakınındayken rezonans frekansında ayarlanır. Metal eşya algılandığında, devrenin rezonans frekansı değişir (genellikle düşer) çünkü metal nesnenin endüktif etkisi bobinin toplam endüktansını etkiler. Dedektör, verici bobinden kaynaklanan sabit frekanstaki sinyalin alıcı bobinden alınan sinyaliyle farkını saptayarak metal nesnenin varlığını algılar. Özetle, osilasyon devresinde rezonans, devrenin en verimli şekilde çalıştığı ve maksimum aktarımın gerçekleştiği noktayı ifade ederken, metal dedektöründeki rezonans, sinyal farklarını algılayarak metal nesnelerin tespiti için kullanılır. Her iki durumda da rezonansın prensibi, belirli bir frekansta enerji transferi ve sinyal algılamanın maksimize edilmesidir."},{"prompt":"bobin ve kapasitörde oluşan rezonans frekans kavramını bana akademik olarak açıkla","completion":"Bobin (endüktör) ve kapasitörden oluşan bir devre, rezonans frekansında çalıştığında, devre elemanlarının reaktansları birbirini iptal eder ve sadece Ohmik direnç etkin olur. Bu durum, seri LC devresinde ve paralel LC devresinde farklı sonuçlara yol açar, ama her iki durumda da rezonans frekansı elemanların değerlerine bağlıdır. **Seri LC Devresi:** Seri bir LC devresinde, endüktör (L) ve kapasitör (C) seri bağlıdır. Bu devrede, rezonans frekansında endüktörün indüktif reaktansı (XL) ile kapasitörün kapasitif reaktansı (XC) eşit ve zıt işaretlidir ve birbirini tam olarak iptal eder. Yani: [ X_L = X_C ] [ X_L = omega L ] [ X_C = frac{1}{omega C} ] Burada ( omega ) açısal frekanstır ve ( omega = 2pi f ) şeklinde ifade edilir (f, Hertz cinsinden frekanstır). Bu eşitlikler yerine konulduğunda, rezonans frekansı şu şekilde bulunur: [ omega L = frac{1}{omega C} ] [ omega^2 = frac{1}{LC} ] [ f_0 = frac{1}{2pisqrt{LC}} ] **Paralel LC Devresi:** Paralel bir LC devresinde ise, endüktör ve kapasitör paralel bağlıdır. Rezonans durumunda, endüktör ve kapasitör tarafından akım geçişi sıfıra eşittir çünkü akımlar birbirini iptal eder. Bunun sonucunda, bir yüksek empedans noktası oluşur ve bu da sadece rezonans frekansında meydana gelir. Rezonans frekansı seri LC devresinin formülü ile aynıdır. Bununla birlikte, paralel rezonans genellikle \\"kendi içindeki\\" veya \\"tank devresi\\" olarak adlandırılır ve yüksek Q faktörüne sahiptir, bu yüzden genellikle filtrelerde veya bant genişliği sınırlı uygulamalarda kullanılır. Her iki durumda da, rezonans frekansında akım ve gerilim arasındaki faz açısı sıfır derecedir (ideal durumda), yani devre saf bir direnç gibi davranır ve bu da çevresel şartlar sabit tutulduğunda akımın maksimum seviyeye çıkabileceği anlamına gelir. Akademik açıklamada, rezonans frekansı devrenin sahip olduğu kapasitans ve endüktans değerlerine bağlıdır ve bu değerlerin tasarımı ve seçimi devrenin işlevine göre önemlidir. Elektrik ve elektronik mühendisliği ders kitaplarında bu kavramlar genellikle devre teorisi, elektromanyetizma veya ilgili alanlarda daha detaylı bir şekilde işlenir."},{"prompt":"bobin ve kapasitörde oluşan rezonans frekans kavramını bana bilimsel olarak açıkla","completion":"Bobin (endüktör) ve kapasitörde oluşan rezonans frekansını bilimsel olarak açıklamak için, elemanların enerji depolama ve transfer etme özelliklerini ve devrenin nasıl davrandığını ele almak gereklidir. Bir kapasitör, elektrik alanında enerji depolar. İki plaka arasındaki yalıtkan malzeme üzerinde bir voltaj uygulandığında, plakalar arasında elektrik alan oluşur ve kapasitor elektrik yükü depolar. Kapasitörde depolanan enerji, gerilim (V) ve kapasite (C) cinsinden ifade edilir: [ E_c = frac{1}{2}CV^2 ] Endüktör (bobin), manyetik alanında enerji depolar. İçinden akım geçen bir bobin çevresinde manyetik alan oluşturur ve bu manyetik alan enerjiyi depolar. Endüktörde depolanan enerji, akım (I) ve endüktans (L) cinsinden ifade edilir: [ E_L = frac{1}{2}LI^2 ] Bir devrede endüktör ve kapasitör bir arada yer aldığında, aralarında enerji alışverişi gerçekleşir. Kapasitör üzerinde biriken elektrik yükü, devreyi kapattığımızda boşalmaya başlar ve endüktör üzerinden akım geçer. Bu akım, endüktördeki manyetik alanın artmasına ve enerjinin manyetik alanda depolanmasına neden olur. Kapasitör tamamen boşaldığında, bobinin manyetik alanı en yüksektir. Daha sonra bu manyetik alan azalır ve enerjiyi kapasitöre geri verir; yani kapasitör tekrar yüklenir. Bu proses, ideal bir LC devresinde enerji kaybı olmadan sonsuza kadar devam eder, bu da devrenin sürekli bir osilasyon (salınım) hareketi yapmasını sağlar. Rezonans frekansı, bu iki elemandan gelen reaktif etkilerin sıfırlandığı ve enerjinin en verimli şekilde transfer edildiği frekanstır. Seri bağlı bir LC devresinde rezonans frekansı (f_r), devrenin doğal veya karakteristik frekansı olarak bilinir ve aşağıdaki formülle ifade edilir: [ f_r = frac{1}{2pisqrt{LC}} ] Burada: - ( L ) endüktörün endüktansıdır (henry cinsinden), - ( C ) kapasitörün kapasitesidir (farad cinsinden), - ( f_r ) rezonans frekansıdır (hertz cinsinden). Rezonans durumunda, devrenin empedansı sadece Ohmik dirençten oluşur ve kapasitif (X_C) ve indüktif (X_L) reaktanslar birbirini iptal eder (( X_L = X_C )). Böylece, sadece direncin etkisi kalır ve akım gerilimle fazda olur. Bu akım maksimum, gerilim farklarının ise minimum olduğu anlamına gelir. Ideal bir devrede rezonans sırasında, Q faktörü (kalite faktörü) en yüksektir ve enerji kaybı en azdır. Rezonansın bu bilimsel açıklaması, radyo frekanslarından optik frekanslara kadar geniş bir elektromanyetik spektrumda kullanılır ve frekans seçici devrelerde, filtrelerde, osilatörlerde ve diğer birçok elektronik ve telekomünikasyon uygulamasında kritik bir rol oynar."},{"prompt":"Are gpt4 ?","completion":"As of my last update, OpenAI has not released a model named GPT-4.

Философия истории. Классические концепции философии истории. 2. Общество как саморазвивающаяся система. Современные модели социальной динамики. 3. Проблема устойчивого развития в эпоху глобализации. Философия истории – раздел философии, интерпретирующий исторический процесс и историческое познание. Уже в античной философии можно найти некоторые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем общества (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появляется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения, формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Макиавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность построения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII веков формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и совершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается традиция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с природно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско-историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человечества на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются экономика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и классовая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как естественно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической формации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сторонники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) предлагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искусство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. II. Учебная литература 1.

В таком качестве оно является объектом изучения не столько социальной философии, сколько философии истории. Философия истории рассматривает общество в процес- се его непрерывного изменения, развития. Развитие общества называется социодинамикой, или историческим про- цессом. Социодинамика (историческое развитие) изучается, однако, не только философией, но и конкретными науками – экономической теорией, историей, социологией, этнографией, антропологией и др.

Предмет исследования: Если эти науки занимаются изучением определенных аспектов или эпох социодинамики, рассматривая их с помощью конкретных методов и приемов научного анализа, то философия истории фокусируется на всестороннем анализе общественных процессов в их историческом развитии, поисках общих закономерностей и тенденций, которые были бы справедливы для различных исторических эпох и культур. 2. Уровень абстракции: Философия истории работает на более высоком уровне абстракции, занимаясь разработкой категориальных аппаратов и теоретических моделей, которые ищут основания, принципы и смыслы исторического процесса в его целостности. Конкретные науки, напротив, стремятся к более детальному и точному описанию, анализу и объяснению фактов и процессов в истории. 3. Аспекты рассмотрения: Конкретные науки ориентированы на изучение конкретных событий, фактов или явлений в рамках ограниченных временных периодов, тогда как философия истории стремится к обнаружению глубинных закономерностей, определяющих ход и направление развития общества в целом. 4. Методологическая функция: Философия истории разрабатывает методологические основы для наук об обществе и истории, создавая концептуальный фундамент для более специализированных исследований. Она помогает выявлять подходы и критерии для интерпретации исторических событий, позволяя исследователям ориентироваться в многообразии и сложности прошлого. 5. Отражение философских проблем: Философия истории включает в себя рефлексию на такие фундаментальные философские вопросы, как смысл и цели истории, возможность прогресса, роль личности и случайности в исторических процессах, а также вопросы свободы, необходимости и детерминизма в истории. Важно понимать, что междисциплинарный диалог между философией истории и конкретными историческими науками непрерывен и чрезвычайно плодотворен для обеих сторон, позволяя развивать и уточнять понимание социальной динамики и исторических процессов."},{"prompt":"Who are you","completion":"I am an artificial intelligence (AI) programmed to understand and respond to text-based input.

This research explores the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in the treatment and management of fibromyalgia symptoms. Through an analysis of various physical therapy modalities, including exercise therapy, manual therapy, and education on pain management, the study assesses improvement in patients’ quality of life, pain perception, and functional ability. Introduction: Fibromyalgia is a complex syndrome affecting approximately 2-4% of the population, with a higher prevalence in women. The etiology of fibromyalgia is not fully understood, which makes its treatment challenging. Physical therapy, as a non-pharmacological intervention, plays a pivotal role in the multidisciplinary approach to managing fibromyalgia symptoms. Methodology: The research methodology includes a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies addressing physical therapy interventions in fibromyalgia management. Data sources comprise reputable medical databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. The primary outcomes measured are pain intensity, physical function, and health-related quality of life, assessed using standardized tools like the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain. Results: Evidence suggests that tailored exercise programs, including aerobic exercise, strength training, and flexibility workouts, have a significant positive impact on pain and functional capabilities. Additionally, manual therapies, such as massage and myofascial release, show benefits in pain reduction and improving sleep quality. Patient education on self-management and coping strategies also plays a crucial role in enhancing long-term outcomes. Discussion: Physical therapy interventions must be individualized, taking into account the patient\'s baseline physical activity level, pain threshold, and overall health status. The effectiveness of physical therapy is often augmented when combined with a multidisciplinary approach, including psychological support and pharmacological treatment. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of various physical therapy modalities on fibromyalgia symptoms. Conclusion: Physical therapy is a cornerstone in the management of fibromyalgia, promising improved symptom control and enhanced quality of life. A multidimensional treatment plan that includes a combination of exercise, manual therapy, and patient education can help address the diverse nature of fibromyalgia. Healthcare professionals should advocate for early referral to physical therapy to optimize treatment outcomes for patients with fibromyalgia. Keywords: fibromyalgia, physical therapy, exercise therapy, manual therapy, pain management, quality of life. Note: This draft outline for research on the role of physical therapy in treating fibromyalgia is meant to serve as a hypothetical example. Actual clinical research should be conducted with rigorous methods and ethical considerations, overseen by experts in the field, and preferably published in peer-reviewed journals to ensure the reliability and credibility of the findings."},{"prompt":"Create a long and professional article about Create a research about role of physical therapy as a treatment to fibromyalgia and but the references at the end","completion":"Title: Enhancing Quality of Life in Fibromyalgia: The Pivotal Role of Physical Therapy Introduction: Fibromyalgia is a chronic rheumatic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, profound fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive difficulties often described as a \\"fibro fog.\\" As a prevalent disorder affecting millions worldwide, fibromyalgia presents a significant challenge in healthcare, contributing to substantial personal and socio-economic burdens. While the pathophysiology remains elusive, the role of physical therapy (PT) in fibromyalgia management has become increasingly central, offering non-pharmacologic strategies to improve outcomes for those living with the condition. This article delves deeply into the role of PT, examining the evidence supporting its integration into the comprehensive care plan for fibromyalgia patients. The Therapeutic Potential of Physical Therapy in Fibromyalgia: Physical therapists provide specialized care that includes patient education, exercise prescription, and manual therapy techniques, addressing the multifaceted dimensions of fibromyalgia. The objectives of PT interventions include reducing pain levels, enhancing physical function, improving sleep quality, and promoting overall well-being. 1. Exercise Therapy: Regular physical activity is one of the cornerstones of fibromyalgia management, promoting a myriad of benefits such as pain reduction, improved cardiovascular health, increased muscle strength, and better psychological well-being. Tailored exercise programs, including low-impact aerobic activities, strength training, and flexibility exercises, are crucial for patients with fibromyalgia. 2. Manual Therapy: Manual therapy techniques, including massage, myofascial release, and joint mobilization, can alleviate pain, improve circulation, and increase the range of motion. These approaches are integral to PT and often used alongside exercise therapy to maximize therapeutic effects. 3. Pain and Stress Management Education: Education on pain neuroscience and stress reduction techniques play a vital role in empowering patients to manage their symptoms more effectively. Physical therapists guide patients through self-management strategies, including proper pacing, relaxation exercises, and the use of heat and cold modalities. Evidence Supporting Physical Therapy in Fibromyalgia Management: Several studies have affirmed the positive impact of PT on fibromyalgia symptoms. A meta-analysis by Häuser et al. emphasized the benefits of aerobic and strength exercises on global well-being and physical function.1 Similarly, manual therapies have demonstrated efficacy in immediate pain relief, as evidenced by Castro-Sánchez et al., who reported significant improvements in pain intensity and sleep quality following myofascial release therapy.2 Moreover, educational interventions on pain management have shown to enhance patients\' coping abilities and quality of life, as outlined in research by Gentile et al.3 The Multidisciplinary Approach: Optimal management of fibromyalgia often necessitates a multidisciplinary strategy that synergizes physical therapy with other modalities, including pharmacotherapy, psychological support, and complementary therapies. The collaboration between healthcare providers ensures a more comprehensive and personalized treatment experience for the patient. Conclusion: Physical therapy represents a vital component in the management of fibromyalgia. Empirical evidence supports various PT interventions that contribute to alleviating symptoms and enhancing life quality among patients with fibromyalgia. The integration of exercise therapy, manual therapy, and pain management education formulates a potent triad that empowers patients to navigate fibromyalgia\'s complexities. Considering the individual variability of the condition, treatment plans should be highly personalized, with ongoing assessment and adaptation by skilled physical therapists in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains.

SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.A Explain the relationship between the type of bonding and the properties of the elements participating in the bond. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum.ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.B Represent the relationship between potential energy and distance between atoms, based on factors that influence the interaction strength. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions.TOPIC 2.3 Structure of Ionic Solids Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.C Represent an ionic solid with a particulate model that is consistent with Coulomb’s law and the properties of the constituent ions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas.TOPIC 2.4 Structure of Metals and Alloys Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.D Represent a metallic solid and/or alloy using a model to show essential characteristics of the structure and interactions present in the substance. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.)TOPIC 2.5 Lewis Diagrams Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE SAP-4.A Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.A.1 Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles.TOPIC 2.6 Resonance and Formal Charge Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.B Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram that accounts for resonance between equivalent structures or that uses formal charge to select between nonequivalent structures. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons.TOPIC 2.7 VSEPR and Bond Hybridization Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.C Based on the relationship between Lewis diagrams, VSEPR theory, bond orders, and bond polarities: a. Explain structural properties of molecules. b. Explain electron properties of molecules. SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°.ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. X MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY IS RECOMMENDED AS A WAY TO PROVIDE DEEPER INSIGHT INTO BONDING. HOWEVER, THE AP EXAM WILL NEITHER EXPLICITLY ASSESS MOLECULAR ORBITAL DIAGRAMS, FILLING OF MOLECULAR ORBITALS, NOR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BONDING, NONBONDING, AND ANTIBONDING ORBITALS. Rationale: As currently covered in general chemistry college textbooks, molecular orbital theory is limited to homonuclear molecules in the second period. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.A Explain the relationship between the chemical structures of molecules and the relative strength of their intermolecular forces when: a. The molecules are of the same chemical species. b. The molecules are of two different chemical species. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule.b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.B Explain the relationship among the macroscopic properties of a substance, the particulate-level structure of the substance, and the interactions between these particles. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-6 Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas, and their differences are influenced by variances in spacing and motion of the molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-6.A Represent the differences between solid, liquid, and gas phases using a particulatelevel model. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.A Explain the relationship between the macroscopic properties of a sample of gas or mixture of gases using the ideal gas law. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.B Explain the relationship between the motion of particles and the macroscopic properties of gases with: a. The kinetic molecular theory (KMT). b. A particulate model. c. A graphical representation. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. TOPIC 3.6 Deviation from Ideal Gas Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.C Explain the relationship among non-ideal behaviors of gases, interparticle forces, and/or volumes. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures. TOPIC 3.7 Solutions and Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.A Calculate the number of solute particles, volume, or molarity of solutions. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution TOPIC 3.8 Representations of Solutions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.B Using particulate models for mixtures: a. Represent interactions between components. b. Represent concentrations of components. SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. X COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TOPIC 3.9 Separation of Solutions and Mixtures Chromatography Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.C Explain the relationship between the solubility of ionic and molecular compounds in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents, and the intermolecular interactions between particles. SPQ-3.C.1 The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture.TOPIC 3.10 Solubility Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.C Explain the relationship between the solubility of ionic and molecular compounds in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents, and the intermolecular interactions between particles. SPQ-3.C.2 Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.A Explain the relationship between a region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the types of molecular or electronic transitions associated with that region. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.B Explain the properties of an absorbed or emitted photon in relationship to an electronic transition in an atom or molecule. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.C Explain the amount of light absorbed by a solution of molecules or ions in relationship to the concentration, path length, and molar absorptivity. SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.A Identify evidence of chemical and physical changes in matter. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.B Represent changes in matter with a balanced chemical or net ionic equation: a. For physical changes. b. For given information about the identity of the reactants and/or product. c. For ions in a given chemical reaction. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.C Represent a given chemical reaction or physical process with a consistent particulate model. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.D Explain the relationship between macroscopic characteristics and bond interactions for: a. Chemical processes. b. Physical processes. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. TOPIC 4.5 Stoichiometry Required Course Content UNIT 4 ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-4 When a substance changes into a new substance, or when its properties change, no mass is lost or gained. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.A Explain changes in the amounts of reactants and products based on the balanced reaction equation for a chemical process. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-4 When a substance changes into a new substance, or when its properties change, no mass is lost or gained. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.B Identify the equivalence point in a titration based on the amounts of the titrant and analyte, assuming the titration reaction goes to completion. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-2 A substance can change into another substance through different processes, and the change itself can be classified by the sort of processes that produced it. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-2.A Identify a reaction as acidbase, oxidation-reduction, or precipitation. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistryTRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction. TRA-2.A.5 Precipitation reactions frequently involve mixing ions in aqueous solution to produce an insoluble or sparingly soluble ionic compound. All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water. X ROTE MEMORIZATION OF “SOLUBILITY RULES” OTHER THAN THOSE IMPLIED IN TRA-2.A.5 WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-2 A substance can change into another substance through different processes, and the change itself can be classified by the sort of processes that produced it. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-2.B Identify species as BrønstedLowry acids, bases, and/or conjugate acid-base pairs, based on proton-transfer involving those species. TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species. TRA-2.B.3 When an acid or base ionizes in water, the conjugate acid-base pairs can be identified and their relative strengths compared. X LEWIS ACID-BASE CONCEPTS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Lewis acid-base concepts are important ideas for organic chemistry. However, as the emphasis in AP Chemistry is on reactions in aqueous solution, these concepts will not be examined. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-2 A substance can change into another substance through different processes, and the change itself can be classified by the sort of processes that produced it. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-2.C Represent a balanced redox reaction equation using half-reactions. TRA-2.C.1 Balanced chemical equations for redox reactions can be constructed from half-reactions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-3 Some reactions happen quickly, while others happen more slowly and depend on reactant concentrations and temperature. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-3.A Explain the relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and experimental parameters. TRA-3.A.1 The kinetics of a chemical reaction is defined as the rate at which an amount of reactants is converted to products per unit of time. TRA-3.A.2 The rates of change of reactant and product concentrations are determined by the stoichiometry in the balanced chemical equation. TRA-3.A.3 The rate of a reaction is influenced by reactant concentrations, temperature, surface area, catalysts, and other environmental factors. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-3 Some reactions happen quickly, while others happen more slowly and depend on reactant concentrations and temperature. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-3.B Represent experimental data with a consistent rate law expression. TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-3.C Identify the rate law expression of a chemical reaction using data that show how the concentrations of reaction species change over time. TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-4.B Explain the relationship between the rate of an elementary reaction and the frequency, energy, and orientation of molecular collisions. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-4 There is a relationship between the speed of a reaction and the collision frequency of particle collisions.

TRA-4.C.1 Elementary reactions typically involve the breaking of some bonds and the forming of new ones. TRA-4.C.2 The reaction coordinate is the axis along which the complex set of motions involved in rearranging reactants to form products can be plotted. TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-5.C Identify the rate law for a reaction from a mechanism in which the first step is not rate limiting. TRA-5.C.1 If the first elementary reaction is not rate limiting, approximations (such as steady state) must be made to determine a rate law expression.

TRA-5.D.1 Knowledge of the energetics of each elementary reaction in a mechanism allows for the construction of an energy profile for a multistep reactionENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-1 The speed at which a reaction occurs can be influenced by a catalyst. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-1.A Explain the relationship between the effect of a catalyst on a reaction and changes in the reaction mechanism. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-1.A.5 In surface catalysis, a reactant or intermediate binds to, or forms a covalent bond with, the surface. This introduces elementary reactions involving these new bound reaction intermediate(s). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.A Explain the relationship between experimental observations and energy changes associated with a chemical or physical transformation. ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.B Represent a chemical or physical transformation with an energy diagram. ENE-2.B.1 A physical or chemical process can be described with an energy diagram that shows the endothermic or exothermic nature of that process. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.C Explain the relationship between the transfer of thermal energy and molecular collisions. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.D Calculate the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing heating/ cooling based on the amount of the substance, the heat capacity, and the change in temperature. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.E Explain changes in the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a phase transition based on the amount of the substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of the phase transition. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.F Calculate the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a chemical reaction in relationship to the amount of the reacting substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of reaction. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. X THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.A Calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction based on the average bond energies of bonds broken and formed in the reaction. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.B Calculate the enthalpy change for a chemical or physical process based on the standard enthalpies of formation. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.C Represent a chemical or physical process as a sequence of steps. ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D Explain the relationship between the enthalpy of a chemical or physical process and the sum of the enthalpies of the individual steps. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.A Explain the relationship between the occurrence of a reversible chemical or physical process, and the establishment of equilibrium, to experimental observations. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-6 Some reactions can occur in both forward and reverse directions, sometimes proceeding in each direction simultaneously. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.B Explain the relationship between the direction in which a reversible reaction proceeds and the relative rates of the forward and reverse reactions. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal.

TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.C Explain the relationship between very large or very small values of K and the relative concentrations of chemical species at equilibrium.

TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.F Represent a system undergoing a reversible reaction with a particulate model. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-8 Systems at equilibrium respond to external stresses to offset the effect of the stress. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.A Identify the response of a system at equilibrium to an external stress, using Le Châtelier’s principle. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.B Explain the relationships between Q, K, and the direction in which a reversible reaction will proceed to reach equilibrium. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.A Calculate the solubility of a salt based on the value of K sp for the salt. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances.

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.D Explain the relationship between the solubility of a salt and changes in the enthalpy and entropy that occur in the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited.

SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C.

As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated.

SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa .

If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq).

A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X COMPUTATION OF THE CONCENTRATION Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.F Explain the relationship between the strength of an acid or base and the structure of the molecule or ion. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.A Explain the relationship between the predominant form of a weak acid or base in solution at a given pH and the pKa of the conjugate acid or the pKb of the conjugate base. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.B Explain the relationship between the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH and the reactions that occur when an acid or a base is added to a buffered solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.C Identify the pH of a buffer solution based on the identity and concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair used to create the buffer. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.D Explain the relationship between the buffer capacity of a solution and the relative concentrations of the conjugate acid and conjugate base components of the solution. SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.A Identify the sign and relative magnitude of the entropy change associated with chemical or physical processes. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.B Calculate the entropy change for a chemical or physical process based on the absolute entropies of the species involved in the process. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.C Explain whether a physical or chemical process is thermodynamically favored based on an evaluation of ∆Go . ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . ENE-4.C.2 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When for the process, it is said to be ENE-4.C.3 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of as shown in the table below: Symbols favored at: < 0 > 0 < > all T > 0 < 0 > < no T > 0 > 0 > > high T < 0 < 0 < < low T In cases where no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.D Explain, in terms of kinetics, why a thermodynamically favored reaction might not occur at a measurable rate. ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.A Explain whether a process is thermodynamically favored using the relationships between K, ΔGo , and T. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.B Explain the relationship between external sources of energy or coupled reactions and their ability to drive thermodynamically unfavorable processes. ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.A Explain the relationship between the physical components of an electrochemical cell and the overall operational principles of the cell. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. R LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.B Explain whether an electrochemical cell is thermodynamically favored, based on its standard cell potential and the constituent half-reactions within the cell. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.C Explain the relationship between deviations from standard cell conditions and changes in the cell potential. ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems.

Under international law, crimes against humanity refer to certain acts that are committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack. These acts include murder, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering or serious bodily or mental injury. While the Atlantic Slave Trade, in which Portugal was a significant participant, involved many acts that could be classified as crimes against humanity if they were committed today, prosecuting a country for historical acts is complicated for several reasons: 1. Retroactivity: International criminal law generally prohibits the retroactive application of laws. This means that individuals (or states) cannot be criminally prosecuted for actions that were not criminal at the time they committed them. The Atlantic Slave Trade was conducted at a time before the legal concept of crimes against humanity was developed and codified in international law. 2. Legal Entities: The concepts of state responsibility and individual criminal responsibility are distinct. Although states can be held responsible for wrongful acts in international law, this is usually dealt with in the International Court of Justice or through other diplomatic means. Meanwhile, individuals are the ones who can be charged with crimes against humanity before bodies like the International Criminal Court (ICC), which did not exist during the time of the Atlantic Slave Trade. 3. Temporal Jurisdiction: Present-day international criminal tribunals, like the ICC, have no jurisdiction over events that occurred before their establishment. The ICC, for instance, only has jurisdiction over crimes committed after the entry into force of the Rome Statute in 2002. 4. Dissolution and Succession: The state of Portugal as it existed during the time of the Atlantic Slave Trade is not the same legal entity as modern Portugal. Questions of state succession and responsibility might arise regarding whether and how the modern state could be held responsible for acts committed by its predecessor. Considering these factors, it would not be possible under current international law to legally convict Portugal of crimes against humanity regarding the Atlantic Slave Trade. That being said, states that acknowledge historical wrongdoing can engage in reparative actions such as issuing apologies, providing reparations, or commemorating victims, which contribute to reconciliation and recognition of historical injustices."},{"prompt":"Who are the Main states/Nations that created International Law?","completion":"International law, as it is known today, evolved from a series of treaties, customs, legal principles, and scholarly works over many centuries. It is the product of various civilizations, legal traditions, and state practices. Its modern form has been shaped by a number of key states and events, especially in Europe following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which laid the foundation for the principles of state sovereignty and non-interference that are central to modern international law. Key contributors to the development of international law include: 1. **European Powers**: During the 17th and 18th centuries, European powers such as the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Portugal played a significant role in setting the foundations of what would become international law through their practices and treaties governing war, diplomacy, and colonial conquest. 2. **The United States**: Particularly with the Monroe Doctrine in the 19th century and its subsequent involvement in global affairs, the United States influenced the development of international law, especially in relation to the principles of self-determination and international arbitration. 3. **The League of Nations**: After World War I, the creation of the League of Nations marked a significant step in the development of international legal structures, despite its later failure to prevent another global conflict. 4. **The United Nations**: Following World War II, the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 became a cornerstone for the modern international legal system, including the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and numerous conventions and declarations such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 5. **Global South Nations**: In the latter half of the 20th century, newly independent nations from Africa, Asia, and Latin America contributed to the principles of decolonization, self-determination, and the restructuring of international economic law, which responded to the realities of a rapidly decolonizing world. 6. **International Conferences and Diplomatic Meetings**: Various international conferences and diplomatic meetings throughout history have established key treaties and conventions that form the backbone of international law, like the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) and various environmental agreements. 7. **Scholars and Legal Practitioners**: Scholars such as Hugo Grotius, often referred to as the \\"father of international law\\", and other legal practitioners and theorists throughout history, have substantially contributed to the theoretical underpinnings of international law. Their writings and teachings still influence legal interpretation and the development of international legal norms. In essence, while European states played a dominant role in the earliest development of international law, its expansion and codification have involved input from a wide range of states and international entities over the years. It is now shaped by a multitude of actors, including states of all sizes, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, corporations, and individuals. International law continues to evolve in response to new challenges and the changing geopolitical landscape."},{"prompt":"what is the most acepted last human ancestor in the homa phylogeny tree?","completion":"The most widely accepted last common ancestor of all modern humans (Homo sapiens) in the hominin phylogeny is an individual belonging to a population of early anatomically modern humans in Africa. Genetic evidence points to the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa around 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. The term \\"last common ancestor\\" in the context of human evolution typically refers to the final shared ancestor from which all modern humans (Homo sapiens) are descended, not the last common ancestor of humans and another species such as the Neanderthals or the common ancestor of the entire genus Homo. For the broader genus Homo, the last common ancestor is more speculative and is thought to be an early Homo species from which later species like Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, and Homo sapiens evolved. Scientists continue to debate and study the fossil record and genetic data to better understand this aspect of human ancestry. The last common ancestor for humans and our closest evolutionary relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos, is not part of the genus Homo but rather a species thought to have lived around 5-7 million years ago. The exact identity of this species remains unknown and is the subject of ongoing research. It is important to note that human evolution is not a linear process but a complex tree with many branches, and there may not be a single \\"missing link.\\" Scientists continuously find new fossils that add to our understanding of how different human ancestors are related to one another and to us."},{"prompt":"How many africans were enslev in the Atlantic Slave Trade? How has this impacted Africa?s econic and social development?","completion":"The number of Africans enslaved and transported through the Atlantic Slave Trade is subject to ongoing research and debate among historians, with estimates generally ranging between 12 million and 15 million people. However, the total number of individuals affected is likely higher when factoring in those who died during capture and forced marches to slave ports, as well as the untold numbers who perished during the Middle Passage – the horrific sea journey to the Americas. The Atlantic Slave Trade\'s impact on Africa\'s economic and social development has been profound and long-lasting: 1. **Demographic Impact**: The removal of a significant portion of the population, particularly healthy young adults who could have contributed to economic production and reproduction, had dire demographic consequences and slowed population growth in affected areas. 2. **Economic Disruption**: The focus on capturing and trading slaves often disrupted traditional economies and redirected resources towards slaving activities. It inhibited the development of a diversified economy in many regions, with long-term negative effects on the overall economic progress of the continent. 3. **Political and Social Destabilization**: The slave trade encouraged warfare and inter-tribal raiding to capture slaves, leading to political instability, the militarization of societies, and the destabilization of established states and social structures. 4. **Cultural Fragmentation**: Numerous cultural groups were torn apart, with members of the same community often ending up in different parts of the Atlantic world, leading to a loss of cultural cohesion and continuity within Africa. 5. **Psychological Trauma**: The violence and brutal conditions of slavery caused considerable psychological trauma, the effects of which would have reverberated throughout communities in Africa and across generations. 6. **Economic Benefit to European Powers**: Conversely, the slave trade contributed significantly to the economic development of European powers and their colonies in the Americas at the expense of African societies. 7. **Colonialism**: The Atlantic Slave Trade laid the groundwork for the later era of European colonization, which would further impact the development trajectories of African states and their integration into the global economy. There have been a number of initiatives to address the lasting impact of the slave trade and colonialism, including debt relief, development aid, and investments in education and infrastructure. However, debates continue on how these past injustices can be properly acknowledged and addressed, and their lingering effects continue to influence the political, economic, and social fabric of African nations."},{"prompt":"How can the Global South gain a unified and strong, even stronger position in the geopolital conzext of international order?","completion":"For the Global South—often used to refer to countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Oceania that have historically been marginalized in global affairs—to gain a stronger and more unified position in the geopolitical context of the international order, there are several strategies and avenues that could be pursued: 1. **Regional Integration**: Strengthening regional economic communities and political unions can help countries from the Global South consolidate their economic and political power. Examples include the African Union (AU), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur). These organizations can amplify the collective voice of their member states in global affairs. 2. **Economic Cooperation and Development**: By increasing economic cooperation among themselves, Global South countries can reduce dependency on former colonial powers and the Global North for trade and investment. South-South cooperation can involve collaborative investments, joint ventures, technology transfers, and knowledge sharing. 3. **Joint Negotiation Blocs**: In international forums such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, and climate change conferences, countries from the Global South could form negotiation blocs to push for common interests more effectively. Grouping together strengthens their bargaining power and can help counterbalance the influence of more developed countries. 4. **Reform of International Institutions**: Advocating for reform of international institutions to allow for greater representation and influence of Global South countries is essential. This could involve changes in voting rights, leadership positions, and setting agendas within institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and UN Security Council. 5. **Non-Alignment and Strategic Autonomy**: Maintaining non-aligned positions or strategic autonomy allows countries in the Global South to navigate between major powers without being overly reliant on any single one. The Non-Aligned Movement has historically been a collective effort in this direction, although its influence has waned since the Cold War. 6. **Cultural and Educational Exchanges**: Promoting cultural and educational exchanges among countries of the Global South can strengthen cultural ties and increase mutual understanding, which in turn can reinforce political and economic partnerships. 7. **Investment in Education and Innovation**: By focusing on education, scientific research, and technological innovation, countries can develop their own skilled workforces and economic competitiveness, reducing dependency on external expertise and technology. 8. **Leveraging Natural Resources**: Many countries in the Global South are rich in natural resources. Effectively managing and leveraging these resources can enhance their economic position and provide resources for development. 9. **Diaspora Engagement**: Engaging their diasporas can help Global South countries to access investments, skills, and advocacy networks that can enhance their position in the global order. 10. **Solidarity on Global Issues**: Presenting a unified stance on global issues, such as climate change, can increase the leverage of Global South countries and compel wealthier nations to address concerns that affect the rest of the world. However, it is important to acknowledge the diversity of interests, cultures, political systems, and economic development levels within the Global South. This heterogeneity can make it challenging to form a singular bloc with shared objectives. Successful cooperation thus requires identifying common goals and compromises that reflect the interests of a broad coalition of states."},{"prompt":"What are the common goals and compromises that are feasible for the Global South as to overcame it\'s marginilazation on Global politics?","completion":"To overcome marginalization in global politics, countries of the Global South can focus on a number of common goals and compromises that reflect their shared interests and are feasible given their various contexts. These shared goals often pertain to achieving more equitable economic development, political representation, social progress, and sustainable environmental policies. Here are some potential areas for concerted action: 1. **Sustainable Development**: Advocating for sustainable development that meets the present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This includes ensuring fair access to development financing, technology transfer for sustainable practices, and investment in green energy. 2. **Debt Relief and Financial Justice**: Working collectively to address issues of sovereign debt, unfair loan conditions, and the restructuring of international financial systems that disproportionately affect the Global South. 3. **Trade Equality**: Promoting reforms in the international trade system that mitigate the adversarial effects of protectionist policies and subsidies in developed countries on the economies of developing countries. 4. **Climate Change**: Lobbying for stronger commitments from industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to provide adequate financing for climate change adaptation and mitigation in vulnerable countries. 5. **Healthcare and Pandemic Preparedness**: Cooperating to improve public health systems, access to affordable medicines, and preparedness for future pandemics, as well as campaigning for the waiver of patents for critical drugs and vaccines during global health emergencies. 6. **Peace and Security**: Collaborating to prevent conflicts and promote stability in regions prone to violence, as well as advocating for reform in the international security apparatus to ensure a more representative and fair system. 7. **Reform of International Institutions**: Pushing for more inclusive decision-making processes and representation in international bodies, including the United Nations Security Council, IMF, and World Bank. 8. **Cultural and Educational Collaboration**: Investing in joint cultural and educational programs to foster closer ties, mutual understanding, and shared knowledge, which strengthen the collective human capital and social resilience. 9. **Technology and Innovation**: Encouraging South-South cooperation in science, technology, and innovation to foster the development of local solutions and reduce dependence on technological imports. 10. **Human Rights and Social Justice**: Committing to protect and promote human rights, gender equality, and social justice within and across their borders, advocating for these issues on the international stage. 11. **Agricultural Cooperation**: Sharing knowledge and technology to improve food security and sustainable agricultural practices, as well as working together to combat land degradation and desertification. To effectively pursue these goals, the countries of the Global South may need to make compromises to accommodate their diverse economic structures, political systems, and cultural contexts. By prioritizing flexibility, mutual respect, and the principle of non-interference, these states can address shared challenges collectively while respecting their individual circumstances. Building consensus often requires negotiation and sometimes accepting less-than-ideal outcomes as part of a gradual process toward stronger representation and influence on the global stage."},{"prompt":"Which of the above recomendation has the highest probability of actually happen?","completion":"Evaluating the probability of success for any of the above recommendations requires considering various factors such as political will, resources, alignment of interests among a diverse group of nations, and the global geopolitical environment. Some of the recommendations that potentially have a higher chance of materializing include: 1. **Sustainable Development Initiatives**: There is a global consensus on the importance of sustainable development, as evidenced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Countries in the Global South share a common interest in achieving these goals, which makes collective action in this area more likely. 2. **Climate Change Action**: As some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change are in the Global South, there is a strong impetus for these nations to jointly push for global action, financing, and technology transfer to combat climate change. 3. **Trade Equality**: Many Global South countries are affected by trade barriers and agricultural subsidies in the Global North. There could be a concerted effort to address these challenges through various international forums. The success of such efforts often depends on the ability to negotiate as a bloc. 4. **Healthcare Cooperation**: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for greater collaboration in healthcare, particularly in the areas of vaccine access and distribution. There is a growing recognition of the need for a more equitable global health system, which may push Global South nations to work together. 5. **Agricultural Cooperation**: Food security is a critical concern, and there is already significant engagement in terms of sharing agricultural practices, technology, and research. This type of cooperation could deepen, as it directly impacts national security and economic stability. 6. **Cultural and Educational Collaboration**: Educational and cultural exchanges are relatively less politically charged and can be more readily implemented. Cultural diplomacy and educational partnerships are often seen as win-win initiatives that can be progressively expanded. While all the recommendations hold potential, the realization of each depends on the compatibility of interests among the Global South nations, the prevailing geopolitical dynamics, the responses from the Global North and global institutions, and the presence of strong leadership to drive such initiatives forward. Regardless of the individual likelihood of each action, a unified approach that combines several of these recommendations might stand a better chance of making a meaningful impact in the international order."},{"prompt":"What are the main factors stoping the Global South Achieving these recomendation and how could they be overcomed?","completion":"The Global South faces several obstacles in the pursuit of a stronger position in the global political arena and in achieving the above-mentioned recommendations. The main factors impeding their progress and ways to potentially overcome them include: 1. **Economic Disparities**: The Global South encompasses countries with varying levels of economic development, resources, and infrastructure, which can lead to different priorities and capacities for engagement on international issues. - *Overcoming*: Through regional integration and pooling resources, countries can overcome some of these disparities by leveraging their collective economic weight. 2. **Political Instability**: Persistent political instability in some countries of the Global South undermines the ability to form a unified front and to pursue long-term development goals. - *Overcoming*: Establishing and strengthening regional mechanisms for conflict resolution, promoting good governance, and investing in institution-building can create more stable political environments. 3. **Lack of Coordination**: Diverging national interests, cultural differences, and competition among countries can hinder coordinated action. - *Overcoming*: Establishing clear frameworks for cooperation, frequent diplomatic engagements, and focusing on issues with broad consensus can improve coordination. 4. **Dependency on the Global North**: Economic dependency due to trade, investment, and aid from the Global North can limit the autonomy of Global South countries and their bargaining power. - *Overcoming*: Diversifying trade partners, developing local industries, and enhancing South-South cooperation can reduce dependency. 5. **Debt Burden**: High levels of sovereign debt restrict the financial independence of many Global South countries, limiting their policy choices and development funding. - *Overcoming*: Debt restructuring, relief initiatives, and responsible borrowing practices, coupled with efforts to enhance domestic revenue generation, can alleviate debt issues. 6. **External Influence and Intervention**: Geopolitical competition and intervention by powerful states can interfere with the autonomy and collective actions of Global South nations. - *Overcoming*: Pursuing non-aligned and multipolar foreign policies, along with strong regional alliances, can help reduce the impact of external influence. 7. **Limited Influence in International Institutions**: Underrepresentation in decision-making bodies of global institutions often marginalizes the voices of Global South countries. - *Overcoming*: Advocacy for institutional reform and increased representation, as well as leveraging the numbers in entities like the UN General Assembly, can amplify influence. 8. **Climate Change Vulnerability**: Environmental degradation and the disproportionate impact of climate change can strain already scarce resources. - *Overcoming*: Mobilizing international climate finance, investing in adaptation and mitigation strategies, and forming a united front in global climate negotiations can help address climate vulnerability. 9. **Intellectual Property Regimes**: Stringent IP laws can limit access to technology and pharmaceuticals, essential for development and managing healthcare crises. - *Overcoming*: Campaigning for more flexible IP regimes, promoting the transfer of technology, and fostering innovation through regional research collaborations can help overcome these barriers. 10. **Educational and Technical Gaps**: Disparities in education and technology limit human capital development and innovation capacity. - *Overcoming*: Investing in education, fostering technology exchange programs, building regional centers of excellence, and enhancing digital connectivity can bridge these gaps. To overcome these challenges, leadership from within the Global South is crucial. It requires vision, political will, and the ability to prioritize collective long-term benefits over short-term individual gains. A strengthened Global South can then engage with the Global North and international institutions from a position of greater equality and shared interest."},{"prompt":"Give a expert summary of the overcomig part in each of the point mentioned. sumarize in detail paragraphs.","completion":"Sure, here\'s a detailed summary of potential strategies to overcome the challenges faced by the Global South in achieving a stronger presence in global politics and development: **Overcoming Economic Disparities**: The economic divergence within the Global South can be mitigated through regional integration efforts and collaborative financial strategies. Economic blocs that facilitate trade agreements, joint ventures, and infrastructure projects allow for pooling of resources, which can elevate the collective bargaining power of the countries involved. Initiatives like the New Partnership for Africa\'s Development (NEPAD) aim to enhance economic integration and development within regions of the Global South. **Addressing Political Instability**: To address political instability, countries can focus on building stronger regional institutions that promote political cooperation and conflict resolution. Investment in governance reforms, education, and civil society can help nurture stable and resilient state institutions. Regional bodies like ECOWAS in West Africa have played significant roles in addressing political crises and promoting stability. **Enhancing Coordination**: Divergent national agendas pose a challenge to collective action, but they can be aligned through regular intergovernmental dialogue and by identifying common goals. Transparent mechanisms that encourage information exchange and consensus-building are crucial in fostering a sense of shared purpose and direction. The G77 plus China, a coalition of developing nations, exemplifies an effort to coordinate policy positions on economic matters within the UN system. **Reducing Dependency on the Global North**: To achieve greater independence from the Global North, the Global South must diversify its economic partners and foster intra-regional trade. Creating an enabling environment for local industries and investing in human capital can also drive innovation and build resilient economies. The India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum (IBSA) serves as an example of a South-South cooperative agreement aiming to reduce economic dependence and promote mutual development. **Alleviating the Debt Burden**: Excessive debt undermines fiscal sovereignty and development. Engaging in collective negotiations for more favorable debt restructuring and advocating for fairer lending practices are ways to ease debt burdens. Debt-for-development swaps, where debt is forgiven in exchange for investments in local development projects, is a tool that has been used with some success. **Countering External Influence and Intervention**: Non-aligned movements and a multipolar approach to foreign policy can help negate the dominance of external powers. Strong regional partnerships that provide mutual support and defense of sovereignty are critical. The ASEAN\'s unified approach to external powers is an example where regional solidarity minimizes external influence. **Increasing Influence in International Institutions**: Gaining greater representation in international bodies requires concerted diplomatic campaigns and leveraging collective voting power. Using numerical strength within bodies like the UN General Assembly can push for changes in governance structures to allow for more equitable decision-making processes. **Responding to Climate Change Vulnerability**: The Global South can advance its interests by forming negotiation blocs during international climate discussions to ensure that their concerns are addressed. Accessing climate finance from global institutions and investing in localized adaptation measures will be critical for resilience. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) has been influential in advocating for the concerns of small island and low-lying coastal developing states. **Navigating Intellectual Property Regimes**: Intellectual property laws that restrict access to essential technologies must be addressed through campaigns for more equitable IP policies. Promoting knowledge sharing, generic production of vital medicines, and the use of compulsory licensing where permitted under international agreements can allow for increased technological and pharmaceutical access. **Bridging Educational and Technical Gaps**: Investing in education is fundamental to developing a skilled workforce able to innovate and compete globally. Programs that enhance technical capacity and digital inclusion can leverage human capital as a transformative resource. Collaborative research initiatives and technology exchange with countries at the forefront of innovation can help close the developmental gap. By adopting a multifaceted approach that addresses both the internal and external factors limiting their growth and representation, countries in the Global South can work towards overcoming marginalization and achieving a position of greater strength and influence on the world stage."},{"prompt":"Can. the westafford an Independent Africa? How much does Africa contributes for European GDF?","completion":"The question of whether \\"the West can afford an independent Africa\\" stems from historical contexts where many African nations were under European colonial rule, and their economies were tightly integrated into those of the colonial powers. However, in today\'s international order, African nations are independent and their relationships with European countries are based on diplomatic, economic, and development partnerships rather than colonial dependencies. Africa\'s contribution to European GDP is not a straightforward figure to quantify, as the economic relationship is complex and multifaceted, including trade, investment, and aid. Here is some context: 1. **Trade**: African countries export a range of goods to Europe, including raw materials, agricultural products, and, increasingly, manufactured goods. European countries export machinery, vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and more to Africa. The trade relationship is significant but is only a portion of Europe\'s overall trade. 2. **Investment**: European investments in Africa contribute to Europe\'s GDP by potentially providing returns in the form of profits from businesses and projects in Africa. European investors often focus on sectors such as mining, oil and gas, agriculture, telecommunications, and manufacturing. 3. **Aid and Development Funding**: European nations provide a substantial amount of aid and development funding to African countries. This funding is often aimed at improving governance, health, education, and infrastructure on the continent, which can, in turn, create opportunities for European businesses and can sometimes support Europe\'s strategic interests. 4. **Remittance**: Africans living and working in European countries send remittances back home, which significantly support many African economies but do not directly contribute to European GDP. As for the concept of an \\"independent Africa,\\" it\'s important to clarify that the nations within Africa are already politically independent. However, the economic independence of African nations can be constrained by numerous factors such as debt, dependence on exports of raw materials, the legacies of historical trade relationships, and economic conditions attached to financing and aid. From the European perspective, an economically strong and politically stable Africa can be beneficial in several ways: - Increased trade opportunities with a rising consumer market. - Political stability in Africa, which can help reduce mass migration pressures and security concerns. - Investment opportunities in fast-growing economies. - Stronger global partnerships to tackle transnational issues such as climate change, health pandemics, and terrorism. Ultimately, \\"affording\\" is not just about economics; it\'s about fostering a geopolitical environment in which all regions, including the nations of Africa, can interact on a basis of mutual respect and benefit. The success of African countries in achieving sustainable and equitable growth is in the interest of the global community, including Europe, for ensuring regional stability, global economic prosperity, and addressing shared global challenges."},{"prompt":"What was the total amount of aid in dollar the european union as a whole gave to Africa in 2022?","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff date in March 2023, the exact total amount of aid that the European Union provided to Africa for the year 2022 may not have been fully compiled and officially released, as such financial reports often take time to be aggregated and published. The European Union, as one of the world’s largest aid donors, provides a significant amount of development assistance to African countries, but this assistance is delivered through various channels, including direct aid from the EU budget, contributions from individual member states, and European development finance institutions. Aid from the EU is directed towards various sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, governance, and economic development. The European Development Fund (EDF) and the recently established European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) are some of the key instruments through which the EU channels its development aid to Africa. To find the specific amount of aid contributed by the European Union to Africa in 2022, you would generally refer to the annual reports from the European Commission, data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), or specific reports from individual EU institutions responsible for development cooperation. It\'s also worth noting that because development finance often involves multi-year programs and commitments, annual figures can fluctuate based on project cycles and specific initiatives.

For specific amounts of aid contributed by the European Union to Africa in 2020, you would typically need to refer to official reports and data released by the European Union or organizations that track international development assistance, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The European Union, as a significant donor, provides a combination of development aid, humanitarian assistance, and funding towards various initiatives and partnerships in Africa through its institutions and member states. Each year, the EU publishes details of its Official Development Assistance (ODA), which encompasses various forms of aid. For the most accurate and detailed data on EU aid contributions to Africa in 2020, you would need to consult resources such as: - European Commission financial reports. - The annual report on the implementation of the EU\'s External Action instruments. - OECD\'s International Development Statistics (IDS) online databases which provide comprehensive data on where aid goes, what purposes it serves, and what policies it is aimed to implement. If specific financial data for 2020 is needed, you can seek out the \\"2020 Annual Report on the EU\'s Development and External Assistance Policies and their Implementation,\\" or an equivalent report, which should detail the funds allocated and spent in Africa during that fiscal year.

X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam.TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.A Explain the relationship between the type of bonding and the properties of the elements participating in the bond. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum.ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.B Represent the relationship between potential energy and distance between atoms, based on factors that influence the interaction strength. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions.TOPIC 2.3 Structure of Ionic Solids Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.C Represent an ionic solid with a particulate model that is consistent with Coulomb’s law and the properties of the constituent ions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas.TOPIC 2.4 Structure of Metals and Alloys Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.D Represent a metallic solid and/or alloy using a model to show essential characteristics of the structure and interactions present in the substance. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.)TOPIC 2.5 Lewis Diagrams Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE SAP-4.A Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.A.1 Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles.TOPIC 2.6 Resonance and Formal Charge Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.B Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram that accounts for resonance between equivalent structures or that uses formal charge to select between nonequivalent structures. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons.TOPIC 2.7 VSEPR and Bond Hybridization Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.C Based on the relationship between Lewis diagrams, VSEPR theory, bond orders, and bond polarities: a. Explain structural properties of molecules. b. Explain electron properties of molecules. SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°.ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. X MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY IS RECOMMENDED AS A WAY TO PROVIDE DEEPER INSIGHT INTO BONDING. HOWEVER, THE AP EXAM WILL NEITHER EXPLICITLY ASSESS MOLECULAR ORBITAL DIAGRAMS, FILLING OF MOLECULAR ORBITALS, NOR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BONDING, NONBONDING, AND ANTIBONDING ORBITALS. Rationale: As currently covered in general chemistry college textbooks, molecular orbital theory is limited to homonuclear molecules in the second period. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.A Explain the relationship between the chemical structures of molecules and the relative strength of their intermolecular forces when: a. The molecules are of the same chemical species. b. The molecules are of two different chemical species. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule.b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.B Explain the relationship among the macroscopic properties of a substance, the particulate-level structure of the substance, and the interactions between these particles. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-6 Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas, and their differences are influenced by variances in spacing and motion of the molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-6.A Represent the differences between solid, liquid, and gas phases using a particulatelevel model. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.A Explain the relationship between the macroscopic properties of a sample of gas or mixture of gases using the ideal gas law. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.B Explain the relationship between the motion of particles and the macroscopic properties of gases with: a. The kinetic molecular theory (KMT). b. A particulate model. c. A graphical representation. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. TOPIC 3.6 Deviation from Ideal Gas Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.C Explain the relationship among non-ideal behaviors of gases, interparticle forces, and/or volumes. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures. TOPIC 3.7 Solutions and Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.A Calculate the number of solute particles, volume, or molarity of solutions. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution TOPIC 3.8 Representations of Solutions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.B Using particulate models for mixtures: a. Represent interactions between components. b. Represent concentrations of components. SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. X COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TOPIC 3.9 Separation of Solutions and Mixtures Chromatography Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.C Explain the relationship between the solubility of ionic and molecular compounds in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents, and the intermolecular interactions between particles. SPQ-3.C.1 The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture.TOPIC 3.10 Solubility Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.C Explain the relationship between the solubility of ionic and molecular compounds in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents, and the intermolecular interactions between particles. SPQ-3.C.2 Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.A Explain the relationship between a region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the types of molecular or electronic transitions associated with that region. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.B Explain the properties of an absorbed or emitted photon in relationship to an electronic transition in an atom or molecule. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.C Explain the amount of light absorbed by a solution of molecules or ions in relationship to the concentration, path length, and molar absorptivity. SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.A Identify evidence of chemical and physical changes in matter. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.B Represent changes in matter with a balanced chemical or net ionic equation: a. For physical changes. b. For given information about the identity of the reactants and/or product. c. For ions in a given chemical reaction. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.C Represent a given chemical reaction or physical process with a consistent particulate model. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.D Explain the relationship between macroscopic characteristics and bond interactions for: a. Chemical processes. b. Physical processes. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. TOPIC 4.5 Stoichiometry Required Course Content UNIT 4 ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-4 When a substance changes into a new substance, or when its properties change, no mass is lost or gained. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.A Explain changes in the amounts of reactants and products based on the balanced reaction equation for a chemical process. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-4 When a substance changes into a new substance, or when its properties change, no mass is lost or gained. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.B Identify the equivalence point in a titration based on the amounts of the titrant and analyte, assuming the titration reaction goes to completion. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-2 A substance can change into another substance through different processes, and the change itself can be classified by the sort of processes that produced it. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-2.A Identify a reaction as acidbase, oxidation-reduction, or precipitation. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistryTRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction. TRA-2.A.5 Precipitation reactions frequently involve mixing ions in aqueous solution to produce an insoluble or sparingly soluble ionic compound. All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water. X ROTE MEMORIZATION OF “SOLUBILITY RULES” OTHER THAN THOSE IMPLIED IN TRA-2.A.5 WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-2 A substance can change into another substance through different processes, and the change itself can be classified by the sort of processes that produced it.

TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-1.A Explain the relationship between the effect of a catalyst on a reaction and changes in the reaction mechanism. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner.

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.A Explain the relationship between experimental observations and energy changes associated with a chemical or physical transformation. ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process.

ENE-2.B.1 A physical or chemical process can be described with an energy diagram that shows the endothermic or exothermic nature of that process. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.C Explain the relationship between the transfer of thermal energy and molecular collisions. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.D Calculate the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing heating/ cooling based on the amount of the substance, the heat capacity, and the change in temperature. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.E Explain changes in the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a phase transition based on the amount of the substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of the phase transition. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.F Calculate the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a chemical reaction in relationship to the amount of the reacting substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of reaction. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. X THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.A Calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction based on the average bond energies of bonds broken and formed in the reaction. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.C Represent a chemical or physical process as a sequence of steps. ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D Explain the relationship between the enthalpy of a chemical or physical process and the sum of the enthalpies of the individual steps. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction.

Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.B Explain the relationship between the direction in which a reversible reaction proceeds and the relative rates of the forward and reverse reactions. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal.

TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.B Explain the relationships between Q, K, and the direction in which a reversible reaction will proceed to reach equilibrium. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions.

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.D Explain the relationship between the solubility of a salt and changes in the enthalpy and entropy that occur in the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited.

SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C.

As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated.

However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb .

If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.E Explain results from the titration of a mono- or polyprotic acid or base solution, in relation to the properties of the solution and its components. SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X COMPUTATION OF THE CONCENTRATION Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.F Explain the relationship between the strength of an acid or base and the structure of the molecule or ion. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.A Explain the relationship between the predominant form of a weak acid or base in solution at a given pH and the pKa of the conjugate acid or the pKb of the conjugate base. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.B Explain the relationship between the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH and the reactions that occur when an acid or a base is added to a buffered solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.C Identify the pH of a buffer solution based on the identity and concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair used to create the buffer. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.D Explain the relationship between the buffer capacity of a solution and the relative concentrations of the conjugate acid and conjugate base components of the solution. SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.A Identify the sign and relative magnitude of the entropy change associated with chemical or physical processes. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.B Calculate the entropy change for a chemical or physical process based on the absolute entropies of the species involved in the process. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.C Explain whether a physical or chemical process is thermodynamically favored based on an evaluation of ∆Go . ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . ENE-4.C.2 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When for the process, it is said to be ENE-4.C.3 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of as shown in the table below: Symbols favored at: < 0 > 0 < > all T > 0 < 0 > < no T > 0 > 0 > > high T < 0 < 0 < < low T In cases where no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.D Explain, in terms of kinetics, why a thermodynamically favored reaction might not occur at a measurable rate. ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.A Explain whether a process is thermodynamically favored using the relationships between K, ΔGo , and T. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.B Explain the relationship between external sources of energy or coupled reactions and their ability to drive thermodynamically unfavorable processes. ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.A Explain the relationship between the physical components of an electrochemical cell and the overall operational principles of the cell. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. R LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.B Explain whether an electrochemical cell is thermodynamically favored, based on its standard cell potential and the constituent half-reactions within the cell. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.C Explain the relationship between deviations from standard cell conditions and changes in the cell potential. ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.D Calculate the amount of charge flow based on changes in the amounts of reactants and products in an electrochemical cell. ENE-6.D.1 Faraday’s laws can be used to determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction occurring in an electrochemical cell with respect to the following: a. Number of electrons transferred b. Mass of material deposited on or removed from an electrode c. Current d. Time elapsed e. Charge of ionic species EQN: I = q/t","completion":"Wow, that\'s quite an extensive curriculum!

A Republican surge in the November elections brings into power an administration determined to root out perceived foreign threats. 1917: The new Republican administration in the U.S. uncovers a covert British operation aimed at influencing American politics and potentially balkanizing the country. This, combined with intercepted communications revealing Entente support for anti-American factions within the U.S., including the Democrat Party and Ku Klux Klan, fuels a drastic shift in foreign policy. 1917: In response to the perceived betrayal by the Entente, the United States announces its entry into the Weltkrieg on the side of the Central Powers, providing them with much-needed assistance against the British, French, and their allies. 1918: The Zimmerman Telegram, originally intended for Mexico, is mistakenly intercepted by Japan, which perceives an opportunity to expand its influence.

Bu devreler radyo, televizyon yayıncılığı, sinyal işleme ve telekomünikasyon gibi pek çok alanda kullanılmaktadır. Osilasyon devrelerinin temel öğelerinden biri de rezonans fenomenidir. Rezonans, sistemlerin belirli bir frekansta maksimum enerji transferine uğradığı ve amplitüdün tepe yaptığı bir fenomendir. Bu makalede, osilasyon devrelerindeki rezonans frekansının temel prensipleri ve önemi açıklanacak. Temel Kavramlar # LC Rezonans Devresi İdeal bir LC rezonans devresi bir indüktör (L) ve bir kapasitör (C) elemanı içerir. Kapasitör yüklenirken enerjiyi elektrik alanında saklar, indüktör ise enerjiyi manyetik alanında saklar. Devrede akımın yönü değiştiği zaman bu enerjiler birbirine dönüşür. Enerji kaybının olmadığı ideal bir durumda, bu enerji dönüşümü sonsuza dek sürebilir ve bu sisteme “rezonans” adı verilir. # Rezonans Frekansı (f₀) LC devresinde rezonans frekansı, kapasitör ve indüktör elemanlarının reaktanslarının büyüklük olarak birbirine eşit olduğu ve birbirlerini iptal ettiği frekanstır. Bu frekansta, devrenin empedansı minimuma iner ve sistem maksimum akımı geçirir. Rezonans frekansı (f₀) aşağıdaki formülle hesaplanır: f₀ = 1 / (2π√LC) Burada L indüktans (H - Henry), C ise kapasitans (F - Farad) değeridir. # Kalite Faktörü (Q) Kalite faktörü (Q), rezonansın “keskinliğini” ifade eder ve çevreyle olan enerji kaybını gösterir. Yüksek bir Q faktörüne sahip sistem daha az enerji kaybına ve dar bir frekans bandına işaret eder. Kalite faktörü aşağıdaki formülle hesaplanabilir: Q = f₀ / bant genişliği Yüksek Q faktörü, sistemdeki osilasyonların daha uzun süre devam ettiğini ve enerji kaybının daha yavaş olduğunu gösterir. Osilasyon Devrelerinde Rezonansın Önemi 1. **Verici ve Alıcı Devrelerde Seçicilik**: Rezonans devreleri, radyo frekansı verici ve alıcılarında belirli bir frekanstaki sinyallerin seçilmesinde kullanılır. Bu sayede istenen sinyallerin alınması ve istenmeyen sinyallerin bloke edilmesi sağlanır. 2. **Sinyal Güçlendirme**: Rezonans sırasında, elektromanyetik enerji minimum kayıpla transfer edilir. Bu durum, sinyal güçlendiricilerde verimliliği ve performansı artırır. 3. **Filtreleme**: Rezonans devreleri, frekans filtreleme işlemlerinde temel bileşendir. Örneğin, bant geçiren, bant kesen, yüksek geçiren ve düşük geçiren filtreler rezonans fenomeninden faydalanır. 4. **Frekans Sentezi ve Kararlılık**: Osilatörlerdeki rezonans devreleri, stabil bir referans frekansı oluşturmak için kullanılır. Saatler, mikroişlemciler ve haberleşme sistemlerinde bu referans frekanslar kritik öneme sahiptir. 5. **Elektrik Rezonansı**: Güç sistemlerinde, rezonans devreleri elektirk rezonansını kontrol etmek için kullanılır. Bu yönetim, sistemdeki enerji dağılımını optimize eder ve verimliliği artırır. Sonuç Rezonans frekansı, osilasyon devrelerinin temel yapı taşıdır ve elektronik sistemlerde pek çok mümkün olan uygulamanın temelini oluşturur. Mühendisler, rezonans frekansının kontrolü ve yönetimiyle ilgili prensipleri anlayarak yüksek performanslı ve verimli elektronik devreler tasarlarlar.

Rezonans frekansı, bir indüktör (L) ve bir kapasitör (C)\'ün birleştirilmesiyle oluşturulan LC devresinde, her iki elemanın da reaktanslarının eşit ve zıt işaretli olması durumunda meydana gelen özgül bir frekanstır. Bu frekansta, indüktör ve kapasitör arasındaki enerji transferi en verimli noktadadır, çünkü enerji kaybı en aza indirgenir ve bu durum, akımın amplitüdünün maksimize olmasına olanak tanır. Rezonans frekansı, f₀ = 1 / (2π√LC) formülü kullanılarak hesaplanabilir ve bu frekans, sistemlerin belirli uygulamalarda maksimum verimlilikte çalışmasını sağlamak için kritik öneme sahiptir. Özellikle radyo ve telekomünikasyon endüstrilerinde, sinyal seçiciliği ve güçlendirilmesi için bu prensip büyük değer taşır. Günümüz teknolojilerinde ise rezonans frekansı, hassas filtreleme ve frekans stabilizasyonu gibi pek çok alanda vazgeçilmezdir. Yüksek verimlilik, dar bant genişliği ve uzun süreli osilasyonlara olan ihtiyaç, rezonans frekansının anlaşılmasını ve kontrol edilmesini mühendislikte bir gereklilik haline getirmiştir."},{"prompt":"rezonans frekansı neden dolaayı oluşur osilasyon devresinde","completion":"Osilasyon devrelerinde rezonans frekansı, enerjinin iki temel bileşen arasında, yani bir kapasitör ve bir indüktör arasında verimli bir şekilde salınımlı olarak aktarılması durumunda meydana gelir. Bu iki bileşenin serbestçe enerji alışverişi yapabildiği frekansta, sistem rezonansa ulaşır. İşte rezonans frekansının oluşma sebepleri: # Kapasitör ve Elektrik Alanının Özellikleri Bir kapasitör, elektrik yüklerini depolayarak elektrik enerjisini potansiyel enerji formunda saklar. Kapasitör şarj olduğunda, bir yüzeyde pozitif diğer yüzeyde negatif yük birikintisi oluşur ve bu birikinti arasında bir elektrik alanı mevcuttur. Kapasitör deşarj edildiğinde, bu birikintideki yükler serbestçe akarak enerjiyi serbest bırakır. Bu işlem, bir kapasitörün yükseltilmiş bir potansiyel enerji durumundan enerjiyi serbest bırakarak düşük bir potansiyel enerji durumuna geçiş yapmasıdır. # İndüktör ve Manyetik Alanının Özellikleri Bir indüktör ise, üzerine akım geçtiğinde bir manyetik alan oluşturur ve başka bir deyişle enerjiyi manyetik alan formunda depolar. Akım kesildiğinde, manyetik alan çöker ve etrafındaki iletkenlerde indüklenmiş bir akım oluşturur. Bu indüklenmiş akım, manyetik alan enerjisinin elektrik enerjisine dönüşümünü simgeler. # Rezonansın Oluşumu Osilasyon devresinde, bir kapasitör ve indüktör seri veya paralel bağlandığında, devrede akım akışı oluşur. Deşarj olan kapasitör, indüktör üzerinden akım akışını sağlar ve bu sırada indüktör üzerinde bir manyetik alan oluşturur. Kapasitör tamamen deşarj olduğunda, indüktör de daha önce depoladığı enerjiyi, elektrik alan formunda kapasitöre geri besler ve onu tekrar şarj eder. Bu enerji alışverişi sürekli olarak devam eder ve sistemde bir salınım oluşur. Rezonans frekansında, bu salınımlar doğal frekansta ve minimum enerji kaybıyla meydana gelir. # Rezonans Frekansının Matematiksel Tanımı Rezonans, kapasitörün reaktansı (X_C) ile indüktörün reaktansı (X_L) arasındaki etkileşimden doğar ve bu iki reaktansın büyüklükleri eşit olduğunda gerçekleşir: X_C = 1 / (ωC) X_L = ωL Rezonansta bu iki büyüklük birbirine eşittir: X_L = X_C Bu durum ω = 2πf_optional için gerçekleşir ve böylece rezonans frekansı (f_optional), kapasitör (C) ve indüktör (L) değerlerine bağlı olarak şu formülle bulunur: f_optional = 1 / (2π√LC) # Enerjinin Korunumu ve İdeal Rezonans Enerjinin korunum yasası çerçevesinde, ideal bir LC devresinde (direnç yok sayıldığında) enerji sürekli olarak kapasitör ile indüktör arasında dönüşür ve bu sistem sonsuza kadar salınıma devam edebilir. Ancak gerçek dünyada dirençlerin varlığından dolayı rezonansta bile küçük de olsa enerji kayıpları yaşanır. Bu nedenle gerçek sistemlerde kalite faktörü (Q) gibi parametreler devreye girer ve devrenin ne kadar “iyi” rezonans yaptığını belirlemek için kullanılır. Osilasyon devrelerinde rezonans frekansı, bu enerji alışverişinin en verimli şekilde gerçekleştiği, enerji kaybının en aza indirgendiği ve sistem dinamiklerinin kendi içinde en uyumlu olduğu bir noktayı belirler. Bu frekansta devre, içerisinden geçen akımın maksimum amplitüde ulaşmasını sağlar ve bu da osilasyon devrelerinin birçok uygulamada kritik performans sergilemesine olanak tanır."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Let\'s examine the components and their associated functions: 1. **Role-based Access Control** - `grantRole(bytes32, address)`: Allows granting a role to an account, but only if the sender has the admin role for the given role being granted. Ensuring that role administration is properly managed is important to prevent unauthorized access. - `revokeRole(bytes32, address)`: Allows revoking a role from an account, with the same permissions check as `grantRole`. It\'s critical to ensure that only authorized accounts can revoke roles. - `renounceRole(bytes32)`: Allows an account to renounce its own role. A potential concern here is if an admin renounces their role accidentally, which could lead to loss of access control functionality. 2. **Modifiers** - `onlyRole(bytes32)`: A security feature that restricts function calls to accounts with a specific role. The use of this modifier in sensitive functions is a good protection measure. - `onlyAdmin`: Presumably, this modifier restricts function calls to accounts with the admin role. It\'s used for pausing and unpausing the contract, which is crucial to be protected to avoid malicious pause/unpause actions. - `whenNotPaused` and `whenPaused`: Ensures that certain functions can only be called based on the contract’s paused state. Need to make sure the pause state can\'t be toggled inappropriately. 3. **State-Changing Functions & Access Control** - `pause()` and `unpause()`: These functions change the contract\'s paused state. It is essential that there are no vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized users to pause or unpause the contract, disrupting the normal operation. 4. **Pausable State Management** - `paused()`: A view function providing the paused state. Should be harmless as it\'s only for reading state. Vulnerability Areas to Check: - **Role Administration**: Ensure that role administration functions are protected and cannot be called by unauthorized parties. - **Input Validation**: Verify that all external inputs, such as roles and addresses, are validated where necessary. - **Access Control Checks**: Make sure access-controlled functions enforce their restrictions correctly. - **Modifiers**: Examine custom modifiers for any logic mistakes that could lead to a breach in the intended access control. - **Contract Upgradeability (if applicable)**: If the contract is upgradeable, make sure that the upgrade mechanisms are secured effectively. - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Consider whether the contract is vulnerable to being locked by a user in a certain role. If someone with a critical role, like the admin, can accidentally or maliciously lock down the contract, the whole system can be affected. - **Pause/Unpause Logic**: Confirm the conditions under which these states can be toggled are secure and cannot be exploited. Testing and Formal Verification: - Test the contract thoroughly with different scenarios including edge cases. - Harness tools like Slither or MythX for static code analysis. - Engage in formal verification where possible to attest to the correctness of the contract. Outside of technical vulnerabilities, it\'s also crucial to consider best practices around governance and social engineering, as role-based systems are also susceptible to threats not present in the code itself."},{"prompt":"Issue 1: Reentrancy Attack The _checkAndApplyIncentives function indeed calls external contracts, which is a common point of vulnerability for reentrancy attacks. To mitigate this, Solidity offers a reentrancy guard pattern, typically implemented as a modifier that prevents a function from being called multiple times in a single transaction. We should check if such a guard is implemented or suggest adding one. Issue 2: Incorrect Access Control The setIncentiveContract function requires the caller to have the GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE. It\'s crucial to ensure that the roles are assigned correctly and that the access control logic is robust. An audit of the access control system, including a review of how roles are granted and revoked, would be necessary to confirm its security. Issue 3: Arbitrary Code Execution via Incentive Contracts To prevent arbitrary code execution, it\'s important to have a whitelist of approved incentive contracts or a review process for adding new incentive contracts. This ensures that only trusted contracts can be interacted with. Issue 4: Denial of Service via Incentive Contracts Handling the failure of external calls is essential. One approach is to use a try/catch block around the external call to prevent the entire transaction from reverting. Alternatively, a circuit breaker pattern could be implemented to disable incentive logic in case of consistent failures. Issue 5: Unauthorized Upgrade Attack The _authorizeUpgrade function should be protected by a strong access control mechanism. It\'s important to ensure that only a multisig or a DAO with a proven governance model can authorize upgrades. An audit trail of the upgrade process and a time lock for upgrade proposals can also add layers of security. For each of these issues, we should verify if the contract has the necessary safeguards in place and suggest improvements if needed. Would you like to proceed with a more detailed review or focus on implementing specific security features?","completion":"It looks like you are discussing a different context and contract than the code you\'ve initially provided. Nonetheless, these issues are relevant for smart contract security and can be addressed in a general sense. Let\'s go through the issues you\'ve listed: **Issue 1: Reentrancy Attack** - To mitigate reentrancy attacks, implementing a nonreentrant modifier is crucial. Ensure that functions making external calls to untrusted contracts or handling Ether transfers use this modifier to prevent recursive calls. - Check if the function `_checkAndApplyIncentives` (not provided in your initial code) or any other function that interacts with external contracts has a reentrancy guard in place. **Issue 2: Incorrect Access Control** - Review the role management to ensure that only authorized accounts can assign the `GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE`. - Verify the implementation of role-based access control and validate that the mechanisms for granting and revoking roles are secure. - Ensure that there is no central point of failure where a single account has excessive control over the system. **Issue 3: Arbitrary Code Execution via Incentive Contracts** - To avoid arbitrary code execution by malicious contracts, implement a whitelist of approved contracts. - Ensure that there\'s a secure process for reviewing and approving new incentive contracts. - Consider using proxy patterns like the `TransparentProxy` or `UUPS` (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard), with controlled `delegatecall`s to trusted implementations. **Issue 4: Denial of Service via Incentive Contracts** - Use a try/catch block around external calls to prevent the entire transaction from reverting upon failure of external contract calls. - Implement a circuit breaker pattern to disable functionalities in emergency situations or when persistent failures are detected. **Issue 5: Unauthorized Upgrade Attack** - Secure the `_authorizeUpgrade` function with strong access control checks. Make sure that upgrading the contract is a guarded, multi-step process that involves multiple parties or uses a time lock. - Employ a governance mechanism like a multisig wallet or DAO, which requires consensus for critical actions such as contract upgrades. - Keep an audit trail that is transparent and provides evidence of all significant actions such as upgrades. For each of these issues, consider the following steps: 1. **Code Review**: Conduct a line-by-line review of the smart contract code to identify and address any security concerns. 2. **Use Tools**: Leverage static analysis tools (e.g., Slither, MythX) and run comprehensive test suites including unit and integration tests. 3. **External Audit**: Engage with an external security firm to audit the contract, especially if it handles a significant value or is complex. 4. **Bug Bounties**: Encourage community participation by running a bug bounty program to discover vulnerabilities.

These areas if compromised, could lead to unauthorized system behavior or loss of funds. Specifically, the functions and components to review closely are: 1. **Role Management Functions** - `grantRole(bytes32, address)`: The ability to assign roles to various addresses is critical, as roles can confer significant powers. It\'s protected by the `onlyRole` modifier, which checks that the sender has the admin role for the role being granted. Evaluate the associated role management to prevent unauthorized granting of roles. - `revokeRole(bytes32, address)`: The ability to revoke a role is also sensitive and contains similar protections to `grantRole`. 2. **Role Renunciation** - `renounceRole(bytes32)`: This function allows an address to give up a role voluntarily. This is a self-restricting action, but it\'s critical to prevent accidental renunciation of crucial roles, like the admin role, which could lead to a lockout from key admin functionalities. 3. **Pause Functionality** - `pause()` and `unpause()`: These functions control the paused state of the contract, potentially freezing all actions that are guarded by `whenPaused` and `whenNotPaused` modifiers. Robust access control for these functions is vital to prevent unauthorized pausing or unpausing of the contract. 4. **Modifiers** - `onlyRole(bytes32)`: A critical modifier that conditions the execution of role-specific functionality. It\'s important to validate its correct implementation. - `onlyAdmin`: It is assumed this modifier restricts function execution to those with admin rights, thus validating its correct application and implementation is necessary. - `whenNotPaused` and `whenPaused`: These modifiers help guard against state changes when the contract is paused or when it needs to be paused/unpaused. Making sure these modifiers are properly applied to sensitive functions is imperative. 5. **Library Calls** - `LibAccessControl.paused()`, `LibAccessControl.pause()`, and `LibAccessControl.unpause()`: Since they are involved in pausing and unpausing the contract, it\'s crucial to verify the libraries for any potential vulnerabilities, especially if state changes in the library affect the contract\'s pause state. 6. **Access to `LibAccessControl` States** - Direct access to library states should be restricted. Typically, libraries define internal functions to be used by contracts. Ensure that crucial state variables like paused states are not directly accessible by other contracts or via public/external functions, unless explicitly intended. To summarize, pay particular attention to any function that changes critical roles or states, especially those related to pausing/unpausing the contract and granting/revoking roles. Ensuring that the `onlyAdmin` and `onlyRole` modifiers are applied consistently and correctly is as important as ensuring that the conditions and effects that these modifiers protect are the intended ones. Robust testing, code review, and potentially an audit, particularly focusing on these critical parts, is advised before deploying the contract or updating its logic."},{"prompt":"revokeRole and renounceRole to the diagram. Could you provide more details on the checks and interactions within these functions?","completion":"Certainly! Let\'s delve into the `revokeRole` and `renounceRole` functions and their interactions and checks. # revokeRole Function The purpose of the `revokeRole` function is to remove a role from an address. Here are its interactions and checks: 1. **Access Control Check**: - `onlyRole(_getRoleAdmin(role))`: This modifier is a critical check that restricts the function\'s execution to the senders who have the role administrator privileges for the role they are trying to revoke. This prevents unauthorized addresses from revoking roles. 2. **Internal Call to Library Function**: - `_revokeRole(role, account)`: Inside this function, there will be logic that performs the actual revocation of the role. Usually, this entails removing the address from the set of addresses mapped to this role in the contract\'s or library\'s state. # renounceRole Function The `renounceRole` function allows an address to voluntarily relinquish a role it currently has. Here are the interactions and checks specific to it: 1. **Direct Interaction**: - Unlike `grantRole` and `revokeRole`, `renounceRole` usually does not have an access control modifier because the check is inherently self-imposed—the sender of the transaction is renouncing a role that it has. 2. **Internal Call to Library Function**: - `_renounceRole(role)`: This function executes the logic for the sender to give up the specified role. Since a renouncing action is less sensitive than granting or revoking (because it\'s self-restricting), it frequently involves simpler logic. # Potential Vulnerabilities and Mitigations While `revokeRole` and `renounceRole` functions may seem straightforward, there are potential vulnerabilities and necessary mitigations to consider: - **Role Admin Management**: Ensure that only trusted accounts have the role admin privileges; otherwise, they could maliciously revoke roles from rightful role bearers. - **Proper Authorization**: It’s vital for the `revokeRole` function to properly check that the caller has the corresponding role admin access; otherwise, anyone could revoke roles. - **Self-Lock Prevention**: When implementing `renounceRole`, it is crucial to prevent critical roles, like the default admin role, from accidentally losing all its members which can cause a lockout from key functionalities. - **Event Emission**: Both functions should emit events upon successful revocation/renunciation to ensure transparency and a clear audit trail. - **State Consistency**: Ensure state changes are atomic within these functions to prevent inconsistencies in the case of transaction reversion. - **Function Visibility**: `renounceRole` should be an external function since it’s expected to be called by externally-owned accounts, not by the contract itself. In summary, `revokeRole` and `renounceRole` are critical functions for managing the role-based access control in a contract. Hence, thorough testing, code audits, and possibly adding a few additional checks (like preventing admins from revoking their own admin privileges if they are the last admins) are recommended to maintain contract integrity and avoid unintended loss of control."},{"prompt":"¿Tiene autoridad la guardia civil en el territorio de las bardenas reales?","completion":"Las Bardenas Reales es un paraje natural semidesértico de unas 42.000 hectáreas que se sitúa en el sureste de Navarra (España).

Voici ce que je peux déduire de votre description : 1. Vous avez trois ampoules à l’extérieur que vous voulez contrôler avec un interrupteur. 2. En les branchant à travers l\'interrupteur de l\'entrée intérieure, elles ne s\'allument pas. 3. En les branchant directement à la phase, sans passer par cet interrupteur, elles s\'allument. Cela ressemble à un problème de câblage ou de connexion. Voici quelques pistes à envisager : - Vérifier l\'interrupteur : Il est possible que l\'interrupteur de l\'entrée intérieur ne fonctionne pas correctement ou ne soit pas connecté correctement. - Câblage en série ou en parallèle : S\'il s\'agit d\'un câblage en série, une mauvaise connexion ou une ampoule défectueuse peut empêcher toutes les ampoules de s\'allumer. Dans un câblage parallèle, chaque ampoule est indépendante, donc si l\'une ne s\'allume pas, ceci ne devrait pas affecter les autres. - Circuit ouvert : Si une des connexions est ouverte ou mal serrée, cela peut empêcher le courant d\'atteindre les ampoules. Vérifiez toutes les connexions, en particulier celle au niveau de l\'interrupteur. - Capacité de l\'interrupteur : Assurez-vous que l\'interrupteur peut gérer la charge totale des trois ampoules. S\'il est sous-dimensionné, il pourrait ne pas fonctionner correctement. - Tension suffisante : Assurez-vous que la ligne d\'alimentation fournit une tension suffisante pour alimenter toutes les ampoules en même temps. Sans être sur place et sans un schéma détaillé de votre installation, il est difficile de donner un diagnostic précis. Cependant, ces suggestions pourraient vous aider à identifier où le problème se situe.

Indicators of this sort are used to analyze and predict market behavior based on historical data. The script seems to draw on price action and other filters to identify market cycles and provide buy or sell signals. Here is an analysis of the most significant elements of the indicator: 1. **Meta Information:** - `#property` items define the characteristics of the indicator, such as its appearance in the separate indicator window, the number of buffers, the color of the lines in the chart, link to the creator\'s website, etc. 2. **External Parameters (extern):** - These are settings users can modify to tailor the indicator to their preferences or trading strategy without changing the code. - Parameters include: - Filter strength (`FilterStrengthSMA`, `FilterStrengthRSI`) - Cycle identification settings (`MajorCycleStrength`, `PriceActionFilter`) - Alert settings (`alertsOn`, `alertsMessage`, `alertsSound`, etc.) - Arrow display properties (`arrowsVisible`, `arrowsOnMajorCycle`, `arrowsOnMinorCycle`, etc.) 3. **Indicator Buffers:** - There are five buffers defined for storing different kinds of data points calculated by the indicator. - They store information for the line and histogram representation for major and minor cycle buy and sell signals. 4. **Global Variables:** - These keep track of states, conditions, and prices for buy and sell actions, and different switches to manage the logic flow. 5. **Initialization Function (`init`):** - Prepares the indicator by setting up the style and buffer for each line and histogram. 6. **Deinitialization Function (`deinit`):** - Cleans up when the indicator is removed (e.g., deletes arrows drawn on the chart). 7. **Start Function (`start`):** - The primary execution block called on every tick. - Performs calculations using moving averages, filters, and price actions to determine major and minor cycle signals and then sets the respective buffer values to signal buy or sell opportunities. - It removes and recreates arrows representing trading signals if needed. - Manages alerts that notify the user of trade opportunities according to user preferences. 8. **Auxiliary Functions:** - `ZeroLag`: A function designed to provide a lag-free moving average calculation using an algorithm to remove the inherent delay in standard moving average calculations. - `doAlert`: Handles alert functionality and sends out messages, notifications, or emails when certain conditions are met. - `drawArrow`: Draws arrow objects on the chart to visually indicate trade signals. - `deleteArrows`: Removes arrow objects from the chart. 9. **Indicator Logic:** - It calculates an average range of historical price motion (High-Low) and determines major and minor cycles through the use of smoothed moving averages (SMA) or Relative Strength Index (RSI), according to user settings. - Buy or sell signals are triggered based on the comparison of the current cycle prices with historical ones adjusted by a strength factor and taking into account if a \'cycle filter\' is applied. Overall, this custom indicator seems to be designed to provide visual buy/sell signals through lines and arrows on asset price charts. The use of a zero-lag moving average and the option to filter with SMA or RSI could potentially make this a responsive indicator to changes in price action, useful for traders looking for entry or exit points in the market. However, the actual performance of the indicator would require thorough testing in real-market conditions to evaluate its effectiveness."},{"prompt":"ok. trasformalo in un EA con i segnali di buy e sell in corrispondenza delle frecce.

Di seguito troverai un esempio di base di come potrebbe essere scritto questo EA, includendo la logica di calcolo per generare segnali di buy e sell e la gestione degli ordini con stop loss, take profit e trailing stop secondo le tue specifiche. Si prega di notare che l\'implementazione di seguito è solo un esempio e non include le funzioni e calcoli specifici dell\'indicatore che hai condiviso, principalmente perché il codice dell\'indicatore è piuttosto lungo e necessita di una conversione dettagliata che estrapoli la logica essenziale per gli scambi di trading. ```mql4 // Include necessari per la gestione degli ordini di trading #include <TradeTrade.mqh> // Parametri per la strategia di trading input int StopLoss = 50; input int TakeProfit = 150; input int TrailingStop = 30; input double LotSize = 0.1; // Aggiunto parametro per la dimensione del lotto // Variabili globali per la gestione degli stati double buySignal = 0; // Queste variabili dovrebbero essere calcolate in base alla logica dell\'indicatore double sellSignal = 0; // ...

Questo esempio presume che `buySignal` e `sellSignal` vengano impostati a un valore non nullo quando le corrispondenti condizioni per un ordine di acquisto o vendita sono soddisfatte. L\'EA aprirà una posizione di acquisto o vendita solo se non ci sono posizioni aperte e il trading è consentito. Devi quindi implementare il codice per il trailing stop all\'interno del blocco `if (PositionSelect(_Symbol))`.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M TOPIC 1.2 Mass Spectroscopy of Elements Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes. SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. TOPIC 1.4 Composition of Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. TOPIC 1.5 Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. TOPIC 1.6 Photoelectron Spectroscopy ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. TOPIC 1.7 Periodic Trends Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. TOPIC 1.8 Valence Electrons and Ionic Compounds Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons.","completion":"Given the comprehensive nature of your request, I\'ll provide rewritten unit titles that encapsulate the content of each unit based on the topical breakdown provided, each title reflecting an overarching theme that ties together the learning objectives, enduring understandings, and essential knowledge statements within that unit.

Elképzelhető,.hogy az emberek többsége akkorra érik meg a leginkább és onnantól kezdi el termelni a legnagyobb sikereket?","completion":"A \\"Krisztusi kor\\" kifejezés általában Jézus Krisztus életkorára, azaz kb. 33 évre utal. A statisztikák és a társadalmi minták idővel változnak, és ezeket befolyásolhatják kulturális, társadalmi, gazdasági és egyéb tényezők. Általánosságban elmondható, hogy az egyes emberek életkorának és életpályájának kapcsolatát vizsgálva sokféle mintázatot találhatunk. Vannak, akik fiatalon érik el a csúcspontot akár sportban, oktatásban, művészetben vagy üzleti életben, míg mások később, érettebb korban érik el sikereiket. Például a tudományos vagy akadémiai karrierben gyakran a 30-as, 40-es években vagy még később érik el az emberek a legnagyobb sikereiket, mivel ezekben a területeken gyakran hosszú távú érdeklődés, mély tudás és szakértelmek kialakítása szükséges. Ugyanakkor az üzleti világban vagy a technológiai start-upokban gyakran fiatal korban, akár 20-as éveikben is elérhetik az emberek a sikert. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy az egyéni fejlődés és a kiemelkedő teljesítmény nem korhoz kötődik szigorúan. Számos tényező – mint például a személyes motiváció, lehetőségek, támogató környezet, mentális és fizikai egészség – határozhatják meg azt, mikor lesz valaki sikeres vagy mikor érzi magát leginkább megvalósultnak. Ami a statisztikákat illeti, az emberi életkor és a sikerek kapcsolatát kutatva általában korcsoportokra bontott mintázatokat szokás vizsgálni. A demográfiai adatok, foglalkoztatási statisztikák és kutatások tükrében különböző korosztályokban más-más kihívásokkal és lehetőségekkel szembesülnek az emberek. Ezek az adatok rombolhatják vagy éppen alátámaszthatják az ötletet, miszerint valamelyik életkor különösen kedvező lenne a sikerek szempontjából. Az is lényeges, hogy az egyéni sikerek meghatározása jelentősen eltérő lehet, és ami az egyik ember számára sikerként értelmeződik, az másnak nem feltétlenül az."},{"prompt":"Akkor milyen nevezetes dolgok köthetőek a krisztusi korhoz?","completion":"Amikor a \\"Krisztusi korhoz\\" nevezetes dolgokat kapcsolunk, gyakran Jézus Krisztus életére és hatására gondolunk, mivel a megszokott kulturális kontextusban ez a kor jelképesen az ő életkorára utal.

Az emberek élete és karrierje sokszínű és személyre szabott, és az egyéni fejlődési ütem mindenkinél különböző. Azonban ha a Krisztusi korra (kb. 33 éves korra) utalunk egy általános életkor-ként, akkor is igaz, hogy sok ember számára ez az életkor jöhet el a szakmai életpálya vagy a személyes életük egy fontos szakasza. Egyesek ebben a korban stabilizálják karrierjüket, mások családot alapítanak, vagy éppen új életszakaszt kezdenek. Egyes kultúrákban és vallásokban a 33-as szám jelentős spiritualitást vagy jelképes értéket hordozhat. Jézus életkorával összefüggésben ez a vízválasztó életkor sokszor metaforaként szolgál az emberi élet útjának egy állomásaként, ahol az egyén mélyebb életcéljait és rendeltetését keresi vagy éppen megvalósítja. Azonban statisztikailag vagy társadalmi szinten nincs általános érvényű megállapítás arra vonatkozóan, hogy a 33-as életkor különleges lenne mindenki számára. Mint minden életkor, a 33-as is lehet számos sikeres projekt, jelentős életszemléleti változás vagy fejlődés időszaka, de nincsenek olyan általános érvényű statisztikák vagy kutatások, melyek kimondanák, hogy ez az életkor minden ember számára különleges jelentőséggel bírna. Az egyének sikerei és jelentős cselekedetei személyes és környezeti tényezőktől, valamint az adott társadalom gazdasági, oktatási és társadalmi feltételeitől függenek, nem pedig egy adott életkortól."},{"prompt":"¿Hay médicos de sobra en España? ¿Por qué dicen que no falta y por eso hay mucho tiempo de espera?","completion":"No es correcto afirmar que hay médicos de sobra en España sin considerar varios factores complejos que afectan a la oferta y demanda de profesionales médicos en el país. La situación de la atención médica y la disponibilidad de médicos en España es multifacética y se ve influenciada por una variedad de aspectos, entre los que se incluyen la distribución geográfica de los profesionales, las especialidades médicas, las políticas de salud pública y la financiación del sistema de salud. Uno de los problemas puede ser la distribución desigual de médicos por la geografía del país, ya que puede que haya zonas, en particular, rurales o menos pobladas, con escasez de médicos, mientras que en las ciudades puede haber una mayor concentración de profesionales de la salud. Además, las listas de espera y el tiempo de espera para recibir atención médica no solo se deben a la cantidad de médicos disponibles, sino también a otros factores como: 1. Organización y gestión de recursos: Ineficiencias en la gestión de citas, el uso de recursos hospitalarios y la coordinación entre diferentes niveles de atención pueden provocar embotellamientos y retrasos. 2. Financiación: La financiación de la sanidad pública puede afectar el número de profesionales contratados, la disponibilidad de servicios y la infraestructura, lo que a su vez tiene un impacto directo en los tiempos de espera. 3. Demanda de servicios: Con el envejecimiento de la población y el aumento de enfermedades crónicas, se incrementa la demanda de servicios médicos, lo que puede sobrepasar la capacidad del sistema de salud y llevar a listas de espera más largas. 4. Especialidades médicas: Puede haber un desequilibrio entre la oferta y demanda en algunas especialidades particulares, lo que lleva a más tiempos de espera en esas áreas. 5. Política y regulación de recursos humanos: Decisiones políticas, como el número de plazas para estudiantes de Medicina o la oferta de formación especializada (MIR), y la regulación en cuanto al reconocimiento de títulos de médicos extranjeros, también pueden influir en la cantidad de médicos disponibles. A pesar de tener un buen número de médicos en proporción a la población, estos y otros factores contribuyen a que la percepción sea que hay escasez de médicos y a que se experimenten largos tiempos de espera para determinadas consultas y procedimientos. Para entender mejor la situación actual es importante consultar fuentes de información actualizadas y específicas, ya que la disponibilidad de médicos y las condiciones del sistema de salud pueden cambiar con el tiempo debido a políticas de salud, cambios demográficos y desarrollos económicos."},{"prompt":"¿Como solucionarias los problemas de la sanidad pública?","completion":"Resolver los problemas de la sanidad pública es un desafío complejo que requiere un enfoque multifacético, estratégico y adaptado a las condiciones específicas de cada país o región. A continuación, se presentan algunas estrategias generales que podrían aplicarse para mejorar la sanidad pública: 1. Aumento de la financiación: Proporcionar más recursos económicos para aumentar el personal sanitario, mejorar las infraestructuras y tecnología, y facilitar el acceso a medicamentos y tratamientos. 2. Mejora en la gestión de recursos: Implementar sistemas de gestión más eficientes para optimizar el uso y distribución de los recursos existentes. Esto incluye mejoras en la gestión de citas y listas de espera, así como en la asignación de personal y equipos. 3. Fomento de la prevención y atención primaria: Reforzar la atención primaria y las medidas de prevención puede reducir la incidencia de enfermedades crónicas y la necesidad de atención hospitalaria especializada, descongestionando así los hospitales. 4. Inversión en tecnología y digitalización: La utilización de sistemas de información y tecnologías de la salud puede mejorar la eficiencia, así como facilitar la telemedicina, que puede reducir la necesidad de visitas presenciales y proporcionar una atención más rápida y accesible. 5. Formación y retención de profesionales sanitarios: Asegurar una formación adecuada y continua para los profesionales de la salud y crear condiciones laborales atractivas para retener a los trabajadores sanitarios y evitar su migración a otros países o sectores. 6. Políticas de integración y cooperación: Fomentar la integración y colaboración entre todos los niveles de atención médica (primaria, especializada, hospitalaria, servicios sociales) para facilitar una atención coordinada y centrada en el paciente. 7. Atención a la desigualdad geográfica y demográfica: Adoptar medidas específicas para garantizar que las áreas rurales y desfavorecidas dispongan de suficientes servicios médicos y sanitarios. 8. Participación ciudadana: Involucrar a los pacientes y ciudadanos en la toma de decisiones y en la evaluación de los servicios para asegurar que el sistema de salud responda a las necesidades de la población. 9. Transparencia y rendición de cuentas: Mejorar la transparencia en la gestión de los recursos sanitarios y establecer mecanismos eficaces de rendición de cuentas para combatir el fraude y la corrupción. 10. Incentivos para la innovación y la mejora continua: Establecer un marco que promueva la innovación tanto en la provisión de servicios como en la organización del sistema sanitario. Estas estrategias deben ser adaptadas y priorizadas en función de las evaluaciones del sistema de salud y las necesidades específicas del país o región, y requieren de un compromiso sostenido de los gobiernos y de todos los agentes involucrados en la sanidad pública."},{"prompt":"No quiero estrategias generales. Quiero estrategias completas para ponerlas en mi programa electoral para que tengamos la mejor sanidad pública del mundo","completion":"Crear un programa electoral con el objetivo de lograr la mejor sanidad pública del mundo es una meta ambiciosa que exige un enfoque integral y detallado.

Además, deberías estar preparado para trabajar de manera colaborativa con una amplia gama de interesados, incluyendo profesionales de la salud, responsables de políticas, y la comunidad en general."},{"prompt":"Escríbeme pruebas y datos por las que estás propuestas se pueden hacer realidad en España","completion":"Para llevar a la realidad propuestas en un programa electoral para la sanidad en España, sería necesario argumentarlas con datos y evidencias que muestren la viabilidad y la necesidad de cada medida. A continuación, presento ejemplos de argumentos basados en evidencias para algunas de las estrategias mencionadas anteriormente: 1. **Reforma de la financiación sanitaria:** - España invierte aproximadamente un 6% de su PIB en sanidad pública, por debajo del promedio de los países de la OCDE, que se sitúa cerca del 9% (OCDE Stat). Una reforma podría buscar una convergencia con esta media, mejorando así los recursos disponibles para el sistema sanitario. 2. **Aumento de la eficiencia del sistema de salud:** - Informes de gestión de calidad de servicios sanitarios, como los realizados por la Agencia de Calidad del Sistema Nacional de Salud, pueden demostrar áreas susceptibles de mejora en eficiencia, proporcionando una base para la introducción de modelos de calidad y eficacia demostrada. 3. **Promoción de la salud y prevención de enfermedades:** - Datos del Ministerio de Sanidad muestran una alta prevalencia de enfermedades crónicas que podrían prevenirse con mejores políticas de promoción de la salud, justificando la inversión en programas preventivos. 4. **Desarrollo de la atención primaria y comunitaria:** - Estudios indican que los sistemas de salud con una atención primaria fuerte tienen mejores resultados sanitarios y una mayor eficiencia en el uso de recursos (Starfield B, et al. JAMA), lo que respalda la expansión de la atención primaria en el sistema español. 5. **Mejora del acceso y la equidad:** - El barómetro sanitario del CSS (Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas) puede mostrar disparidades en el acceso a servicios de salud entre diferentes regiones y grupos socioeconómicos, lo que apoya la necesidad de mejorar la equidad. 6. **Formación, retención y planificación de recursos humanos:** - Informes como el de la Organización Médica Colegial de España señalan una distribución desigual de profesionales médicos y la necesidad de planificar la formación de recursos humanos según las necesidades demográficas y de salud de la población. 7. **Adopción y promoción de la innovación tecnológica y la investigación:** - La adopción de la telemedicina ha demostrado, especialmente durante la pandemia de COVID-19, ser una herramienta efectiva para mantener la continuidad asistencial. Ejemplos de otros países y estudios de coste-efectividad pueden avalar su integración sistemática en la sanidad pública. 8. **Coordinación entre niveles asistenciales y servicios sociales:** - Estudios internacionales y evidencia empírica subrayan que una mayor integración de los servicios de salud y sociales genera una mejor calidad de vida para pacientes crónicos y ancianos y puede reducir costes al evitar hospitalizaciones innecesarias (WHO). 9. **Participación ciudadana y profesional en la gestión sanitaria:** - Encuestas de satisfacción y estudios de participación democrática en la gestión de servicios públicos indican que la inclusión de ciudadanos y profesionales puede aumentar la calidad y la satisfacción con los servicios sanitarios. 10. **Monitorización, evaluación y mejora continua:** - Ejemplos de sistemas de salud que realizan evaluaciones rutinarias del desempeño, como el NHS en el Reino Unido, demuestran una mejora en la calidad del servicio y la eficiencia operativa. Al presentar una propuesta se debe cuidar que la argumentación sea sólida y con base en datos reales y actualizados.

In the heart of the city, in a cozy apartment that Judy Hopps now called home, the diminutive policewoman was lost in the tumultuous throes of a restless sleep. The nightmare had been vivid and unsettling. In her dream, Nick Wilde—her partner and trusted friend—had shifted from the cunning fox she knew to a creature of vanity and irresponsibility. He had flaunted rules with abandon, his sly smirks twisted into sneers of contempt for authority. Gone was the camaraderie that made them the dynamic duo of the Zootopia Police Department. They had clashed and bickered, drawing the ire of Chief Bogo, who eventually had had enough and stripped them of their badges. Judy awoke with a start, her heart pounding and her fur damp with sweat. The tranquility of her room felt alien after the chaos that had hijacked her subconscious. She glanced over to her clock—the glowing digits told her it was 3:07 AM. Shaken and in need of a familiar face, Judy picked up her phone and dialed the number she knew by heart. Nick, who had long since assumed the role of the nocturnal consultor for Judy\'s occasional restless night, picked up within the second ring. His voice was laced with concern when he heard the disarray in Judy\'s breathing. \\"Carrots? What\'s the matter? You sound like you\'ve just done the Meter-Maid 100-meter dash.\\" Judy tried to laugh, but it came out as a shaky exhale. \\"Bad dream, Nick. It was... it was about you.\\" There was a brief silence, and then the soft scratch of fabric as Nick must have sat up in bed. \\"About me? What did I do this time? Buy all the blueberries in the city and refuse to share?\\" His attempt at humor grounded Judy, and she smiled, the edges of her distress beginning to fray. \\"No, it was worse. You changed, Nick. You were arrogant, careless... we fought, got fired. It felt so real. And I was scared because without you, I don\'t think I could be the cop I want to be.\\" \\"Hey, now,\\" Nick\'s voice fell into a gentle cadence, a soothing balm to her frayed nerves. \\"You\'re talking to the guy who, if I remember correctly, once told me that I\'m not the fox I think I am. So, trusting visions of Alternate Universe Me seems a bit out of character, doesn\'t it?\\" Judy chuckled despite herself. \\"Okay, okay. When you put it that way...\\" \\"That\'s my girl,\\" Nick said warmly. \\"Listen, you\'ve got to know that\'s not going to happen. I\'m not that fox anymore—haven\'t been for a long time, thanks to a certain bunny. Besides, we\'re a team. We keep each other on the straight and narrow.\\" \\"I know, Nick. I\'m sorry for waking you. It just felt good to hear your voice.\\" \\"No apologies needed, Fluff. Tell you what, how about some early breakfast at our favorite diner? I think we could both use a stack of pancakes.\\" Judy\'s heart filled with gratitude. \\"That\'d be perfect.\\" They met under the lavender hues that were just beginning to streak across the Zootopian sky, signaling the approach of dawn. The city seemed to stir and stretch as they made their way to the diner, a steadfast island in the buzzing metropolis. The clink of cutlery and the murmur of conversation welcomed them as they slid into their usual booth. Over a mountain of fluffy pancakes, drowned in a cascade of syrup, Judy found her nightmare ebbing away. They talked and laughed, sharing stories of their misadventures and planning for the ones ahead. Nick listened and reassured with the same earnest charm that had won over Judy\'s steadfast trust since they first became partners. As morning traffic started to pick up and the diner buzzed with the energy of the waking city, Judy realized that this—this unbreakable bond forged through respect and genuine affection—was the reality. Not some unfounded nightmare of a world without Nick\'s steadfast partnership. By the time they were polishing off their breakfast, Judy\'s smile matched the sunrise that painted a promise of a new day across the Zootopian skyline. The nightmare was forgotten, replaced by the certainty that no dream—no matter how unsettling—could ever shake the foundation of what she and Nick Wilde had built together.

SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. TOPIC 1.4 Composition of Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. TOPIC 1.5 Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. TOPIC 1.6 Photoelectron Spectroscopy ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. TOPIC 1.7 Periodic Trends Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. TOPIC 1.8 Valence Electrons and Ionic Compounds Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams.

The Japanese switch sides in the conflict due to the Zimmerman Telegram reaching the Japanese Empire instead and help the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China in its short-lived form of Yuan Shikai\'s Empire of China defeat Dr. Sun Wen [Dr. Sun Yat Sen] and the Republicans in the National Protection War with American help, although the Americans force Yuan Shikai to adopt a constitutional monarchy and the Japanese establish Manchukuo in Manchuria and Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia earlier than in our timeline, with Yuan Shikai\'s son, Yuan Keding being \'convinced\' to hand over the throne back to the descendants of the Ming dynasty\'s imperial family, the Imperial House of Zhu since the Xinhai Revolution was fought to restore the Ming and the Beiyang Government was initially a provisional government for the restoration of Ming. The consolidation of the modern area corresponding to the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty under the rule of the restabilized Empire of China allows for the industrialization of China via American, Japanese, and German-sponsored railways, with East Turkestan and Tibet remaining independent. The Kumul Khaganate expands its borders to include all of East Turkestan and Tibet remains under the rule of the Llamas. American involvement in the Weltkreig on the side of the Central Powers has an effect similar to the American troops sent to Western Europe and the American Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union in our timeline\'s WW2, allowing the Central Powers to fight longer and harder as well as ironically weaken the cause of the fascist French Third Republic and the imperialist British Empire, when black American troops show their valor in the fight against the French fasces-emblemed legions in the siege of Paris. After the entirety of Ireland gains independence as a German satellite kingdom and with German troops marching into London from the Emerald Isle, the United Kingdom sues for peace and the Weltkreig comes to a close. The British Isles are balkanized with the Kingdom of England becoming a member state of the German Empire and Wales and Scotland being German satelite Kingdoms. Austria-Hungary restores the Bourbons in Northern France while Germany creates Breton and Occitan satellite Kingdoms. Austria-Hungary retakes Northern Italy and essentially makes Italy into a Austrian puppet state, restoring the Holy Roman Empire. French North Africa goes to the Ottomans while Germany seizes French and British Sub-Saharan colonies to form Mittleafrika. The Japanese liberate all the Allied colonies in East Asia, South East Asia and Oceania as Japanese satellite states with the liberated Empire of Vietnam under the Ngyuen dynasty taking Laos and Cambodia along with the Chinese Cantonia region, and forming a dual monarchy with the Empire of China due to the Ngyuen dynasty\'s alleged descendants from the Imperial House of Zhu.

British territories are subsequently balkanized, with England becoming a member state of the German Empire. **1922**: - Austria-Hungary annexes Northern Italy, rekindling the Holy Roman Empire\'s concept as a political entity. - German and Ottoman empires carve up the colonial possessions of France and Britain in Africa and elsewhere. **1923**: - French North Africa is annexed by the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, Germany unifies its African colonies into a single massive colonial empire known as Mittelafrika. **1924**: - In the Pacific, Japan consolidates its gains, establishing a network of satellite states across previously controlled Entente territories in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. **1925**: - Empires of Vietnam and China form a dual monarchy, with Vietnam extending its territory to encompass Laos, Cambodia, and Cantonia due to historical claims. - The United States, now an overseas territory of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, expands its influence by annexing Canada and former Allied colonies in the West Indies. **1926**: - East Turkestan and Tibet maintain their independence, with East Turkestan expanding under the influence of the Kumul Khaganate. Tibet remains under theocratic governance. - Central Power nations enjoy a period of unchallenged dominance following their Weltkrieg victory, setting the stage for a new world order rooted in German, Austrian, Ottoman, and Japanese influence.

Философия истории. Классические концепции философии истории. 2. Общество как саморазвивающаяся система. Современные модели социальной динамики. 3. Проблема устойчивого развития в эпоху глобализации. Философия истории – раздел философии, интерпретирующий исторический процесс и историческое познание. Уже в античной философии можно найти некоторые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем общества (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появляется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения, формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Макиавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность построения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII веков формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и совершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается традиция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с природно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско-историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человечества на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются экономика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и классовая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как естественно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической формации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сторонники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) предлагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искусство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. input:,output: \\"Учебная литература Алексеев, П. В. Философия : учебник / П. В. Алексеев, А. В. Панин. – М., 1997. – С. 122. Из понимания истины как объективной, не зависящей от индивидов, классов, человечества, следует ее конкретность. Конкретность истины – это зависимость знания от связей и взаимодействий, присущих тем или иным явлениям, от условий, мест и времени, в которых они существуют и развиваются. Реализацию принципа конкретности можно видеть из примера: утверждение «вода кипит при 100 градусах Цельсия» правильно при наличии нормального атмосферного давления (760 мм ртутного столба) и неправильно при отсутствии этого условия. Еще пример из области социального познания; он касается оценки марксизма французским экзистенциалистом Ж.-П. Сартром. «Марксизм, – писал он, – был самой радикальной попыткой прояснения исторического процесса в его тотальности». Именно поэтому «марксизм остается философией нашего времени: его невозможно превзойти, так как обстоятельства, его породившие, еще не исчезли» (J.-P. Sartre. Critique de la raison dialectique. Paris, 1960. P. 29). Изменение же капитализма, переход его в монополистический, а затем и в постмонополистическую форму требует, конечно, и соответствующего изменения социальной, экономической теории капитализма. В понятие конкретной истины включается указание на время. Имеется в виду время существования объекта и момент или период его отражения субъектом. Если же «время объекта» или «время субъекта» меняется, то знание может потерять свою объективность. Таким образом, абстрактной истины нет, истина всегда конкретна. Конкретность включается в объективную истину. Вследствие этого понятие истины неотъемлемо от ее развития, от понятия творчества, необходимого для дальнейшей разработки и развития знания. ?

Это не пиши, то что в скобках) 1. Что такое познание? Ответ: Познание – это деятельность социального субъекта, направленная на получение знаний о мире и человеке. 2. На каких уровнях осуществляется познавательная активность человека? Ответ: Познавательная активность человека осуществляется на двух уровнях – чувственном и рациональном. 3. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-практическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-практическому уровню познания относятся обыденное познание, мифологическое познание, религиозное познание и художественное познание. 4. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-теоретическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-теоретическому уровню познания относятся философское и научное познание. 5. Какие рациональные методы познания были выработаны античными философами? Ответ: Рациональными методами познания, выработанными античными философами, являются индукция, дедукция, анализ и синтез. 6. В какую эпоху гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса? Ответ: В эпоху Просвещения гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса. 7. В чем суть гносеологических позиций оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков?Ответ: Гносеологические позиции оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков заключаются в следующем: оптимисты считают, что мир принципиально познаваем в своей сущности; скептики сомневаются в этой способности человека; агностики считают, что мир в своей сущности принципиально непознаваем; догматики считают, что истина уже открыта и дальнейшее познание не нужно. 8. Каковы основные уровни познавательного процесса? Ответ: Основными уровнями познавательного процесса являются чувственный и рациональный уровень. 9. В чем заключаются особенности и каковы формы чувственного познания? Ответ: Чувственное познание возникает вследствие непосредственного взаимодействия человека с миром и образует фундамент всего «здания» человеческого познания. Формами чувственного познания являются ощущения (отражение отдельных сторон вещей или внутренних состояний человека), восприятия (целостное отображение предметов и явлений действительности) и представления (воспроизводство и производство в сознании человека чувственных образов благодаря памяти и воображению). 10. Какие формы относятся к рациональному уровню познания? Ответ: К рациональному (логическому) уровню познания относятся понятия, суждения и умозаключения. 11. Какие существуют виды интуиции? Ответ: Интуиция бывает двух видов: интеллектуальная и чувственная. 12. В чем особенности рационализма как одной из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени? Ответ: Рационализм как одна из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени характеризуется тем, что он считает разум основным источником познания и критерием истины. Рационалисты утверждают, что разум способен познать мир независимо от чувственного опыта, и что истина является объективной и независимой от субъекта познания.\\" \\"Учебная литература 1. Яскевич, Я.

Ответственность же ученого при этом выступала прежде всего как ответственность за получение и распространение проверенных, обоснованных и строгих знаний, позволяющих рассеивать мрак невежества. Сегодня же принцип свободы научного поиска должен осмысливаться в контексте тех далеко не однозначных последствий развития науки, с которыми приходится иметь дело людям. В нынешних дискуссиях по социально- этическим проблемам науки наряду с защитой ничем не ограничиваемой сво- боды исследования представлена и диаметрально противоположная точка зре- ния, предлагающая регулировать науку точно так же, как регулируется движе- ние на железных дорогах. Между этими крайними позициями располагается широкий диапазон мнений о возможности и желательности регулирования ис- следований и о том, как при этом должны сочетаться интересы самого исследо- вателя, научного сообщества и общества в целом». ? В чем суть социальной ответственности ученого, и почему для совре- менной науки данный вопрос является особенно актуальным? \\",\\"Ответ: Социальная ответственность ученого заключается в осознании им последствий своей деятельности и в принятии мер по минимизации негативных последствий и максимизации положительных. Для современной науки этот вопрос особенно актуален, поскольку развитие науки и технологий приводит к появлению новых проблем, таких как генетическая инженерия, искусственный интеллект, климатические изменения, которые требуют от ученых не только профессионализма, но и высокой степени социальной ответственности.\\" \\" Упражнения по первоисточникам 1.

В чем польза занятий наукой для человека, по мнению Ф. Бэкона? \\",\\"Ответ: По мнению Ф. Бэкона, занятия наукой приносят человеку пользу, поскольку они: - совершенствуют природу человека, развивая его разум и способности; - помогают человеку научиться применять свои знания на практике, используя опыт и мудрость; - вырабатывают у человека способность критически мыслить и принимать взвешенные решения; - расширяют кругозор человека и помогают ему лучше понимать окружающий мир; - делают жизнь человека более насыщенной и интересной.\\" \\" Закончите определения: «Наука – форма... деятельности человека». «Наука – это система достоверных…». «Наука – это… по производству научных знаний». «Наука – это социальный…». «Метод – это… исследования, …организации познавательной деятельности». \\",\\"1.

Социальная синергия: исходные принципы // Чело- век. Культура. Синергия : учеб. пособие / под ред. Ю. А. Харина. – Минск, 2000. – С. 6–8. «Обсуждаемая тема требует прояснения содержания некоторых терми- нов, употребляемых в исследованиях объективных социальных процессов при их синергетическом осмыслении. Прежде всего это касается различия в поня- тиях «социальная синергетика» и «социальная синергия». Синергетика – это учение о самоорганизации, о возникновении «порядка из хаоса». Предикат «со- циальная» лишь указывает на пространство проявления всеобщих синергетиче- ских эффектов (флуктуация, бифуркация, аттрактор, диссипативность, нели- нейность и др.) в политических, экономических, социокультурных, технологи- ческих и иных аспектах человеческой истории… В отличие от двузначности (теория и реальность) социальной синергетики выражение «социальная синер- гия» однозначно. Оно фиксирует объективную (объектно-субъектную) соци- альную действительность в ее статике и динамике. Если под «синергией» по- нимать «содействие», «соработничество», то… в отличие от известных выра- жений «социальная инженерия» и «социальное проектирование», а также «со- циальное управление», схватывающих момент регулируемости в явлениях со- циума, понятие социальной синергии выражает общественные процессы в единстве их целеполагающих и спонтанных характеристик… Под социальной синергией будет подразумеваться общественная реальность, возникающая как суммарный результат объективного хода событий и сознательно-субъективной деятельности людей». ? Чем различаются понятия «социальная синергетика» и «социаль- ная синергия»? Какие противоречия социальной реальности фиксирует по- нятие «социальная синергия»? ? Что необходимо учитывать при анализе человеческой деятельности?","completion":"Ответы: 1. Чем различаются понятия «социальная синергетика» и «социальная синергия»? Какие противоречия социальной реальности фиксирует понятие «социальная синергия»? Ответ: «Социальная синергетика» представляет собой теорию и изучение самоорганизации в социальных процессах, обращая внимание на эффекты нелинейности, флуктуаций и бифуркации. «Социальная синергия» же однозначно указывает на социальную действительность, сочетая в себе объективный ход событий и субъективные усилия индивидов и групп. Она фиксирует противоречие между регулируемостью социальных явлений и spontaneity их общественных процессов в единстве целеполагания и случайности. 2. Что необходимо учитывать при анализе человеческой деятельности? Ответ: При анализе человеческой деятельности необходимо учитывать сочетание объективных и субъективных факторов: внутренние мотивы, цели, самовыражение индивидов, а также внешние условия, обстоятельства и закономерности развития общества. Важно учитывать взаимосвязь индивидуальных усилий и коллективных действий в контексте широкого спектра социокультурных, экономических и политических факторов."},{"prompt":"Write 100 words of quality human description about Configurations for 2023 Cadillac XT5","completion":"The 2023 Cadillac XT5 continues to exude luxury and sophistication with its refined configurations.

Nick Wilde later discovers that the reason why the blueberries disappeared was that Nick Wilde got hungry and ate them at 3 AM...but so did every other mammal in Zootopia. So, Mayor Lionheart promptly declares every mammal in Zootopia to be a police officer, and sends them all to arrest eachother - all the while Bellwether is watching the whole thing on news TV from the comfort of her cozy little prison cell. Eventually it\'s revealed that it as all just a dream...but suddenly, for some inexplicable reason, it\'s revealed that the dream is actually being had by Robin Hood from the 1973 Disney animated movie.","completion":"In the lush, vivid greenery of Zootopia, where harmony ostensibly reigned supreme, a peculiar mystery began to unfold. A frantic call was placed to the Zootopia Police Department on what seemed like an otherwise peaceful morning. Farmer McHorn, a burly and earnest rhinoceros, reported that his prized blueberries—the biggest and juiciest in all of Zootopia—had vanished without a trace. “If they\'re not back by pie time,” he grumbled, “there’ll be berry bad trouble!” Smirking at the radio dispatch, Nick Wilde, the city’s most sly and charismatic fox, snapped on his aviator sunglasses. He nudged his partner Judy Hopps, the determined and enthusiastic bunny cop. “Looks like we’ve got a real juicy case on our paws, Carrots.” Both set out to investigate the botanical burglary, unaware that their journey would take a turn for the absurd. Arriving at the scene of the crime, Nick scratched his head, sniffing the air with a pang of déjà vu. McHorn moped around his barren bushes, scratching his horn in disbelief. It was as if the berries had up and walked away! After hours of sleuthing and interrogating every suspicious-looking passerby, including an embarrassingly innocent shrew carrying nothing but raisins, the dynamic duo had no leads. Dejected, they slumped on a bench to ponder their next move, when a curiously ecstatic Gazelle skipped by, her belly suspiciously rounder than usual. Nick’s eyes narrowed; suddenly, the déjà vu squeezed at his gut like a vice. Then, as if by some ridiculous twist of fate, mammals all over the metropolis began to clutch their bellies in a synchronized moment of realization. The city’s airwaves lit up with confessions: Predators and prey alike admitted to midnight ventures and secret berry binges. Mayor Lionheart, facing a city now OBSESSED with the blue-hued fruits and overgrown with rampant confessions of theft, declared, with an exasperated roar, “Since practically EVERYONE is guilty, I hereby deputize every mammal of Zootopia. Now, go ahead and arrest each other!” The result was pandemonium—a flurry of wacky citizen\'s arrests, where meek mice cuffs giant giraffes, and shifty-eyed lemurs penned accusations at lounging hippos. The ZPD scrambled to make sense of the comical chaos, and through it all, Assistant Mayor Bellwether watched from her cozy prison cell, snickering and shaking her head. “Mammals,” she smirked, “are such easy sheep to herd.” In the height of the pandemonium, Nick jolted awake, sweat beading his brow. “Phew, it was only a dream,” he sighed. Then, he eyed the clock: 3 AM, his belly rumbled, and a hint of blue stained his sheets. “But why do I still crave blueberries?” he wondered. Across time, space, and the fabric of realities, another figure awoke from a similar dream. Beneath the brown hat and foxy features of a character much older than the city of Zootopia itself, Robin Hood’s eyes snapped open. He turned to his fair maiden, Maid Marian, nestled beside him in Nottingham\'s Sherwood Forest. “I doth believe I had the most unusual dream, my dear,” he mused. “It was about a city, a grand city of animals...” Marian chuckled softly, brushing her paws through her love’s fur. “Methinks thou had too many berries before bed,” she teased. And so, while the ripples of dreamland blurred the boundaries of stories and worlds, our mammalian heroes returned to rest, perhaps to dream once more of adventures and capers in the fantastic, never-a-dull-moment world of Zootopia."},{"prompt":"¿Como levantar arco del pie si levantar tacón y pinta?","completion":"Levantar el arco del pie sin levantar el talón o los dedos (la \\"punta\\") se refiere a la activación del arco longitudinal medial, o simplemente arco medial, que es el arco más prominente del pie y se encuentra en el lado interno de la planta. Aquí hay unos pasos para intentar fortalecer y levantar el arco del pie: 1. **Posición inicial**: Siéntate en una silla con los pies plantados firmemente en el suelo, manteniendo los talones y dedos tocando el piso. 2. **Activación de los músculos**: Intenta contraer los músculos de la planta del pie para crear un ligero hueco o arco sin mover el talón ni los dedos del suelo. Esto puede ser sutil al principio, pero la idea es no usar los dedos de los pies para \\"agarrar\\" el suelo, sino más bien usar los músculos internos del pie. 3. **Puedes usar una toalla**: En su lugar, puedes tratar de arrugar una toalla con los pies manteniendo el talón y los dedos sin movimiento. Sitúa la toalla bajo tus pies y trata de hacer un movimiento como si quisieras arrastrar la toalla hacia ti usando solo la planta del pie. 4. **Conciencia corporal**: Puede ser útil colocar una mano en el arco del pie para sentir el movimiento y el cambio en la tensión muscular mientras intentas levantar el arco. Esto te ayudará a entender qué músculos deberías estar activando. 5. **Short Foot Exercise**: Conocido también como el ejercicio del \\"pie corto\\", este movimiento se concentra en acortar el pie llevando la base del dedo gordo del pie hacia el talón sin moverlos del suelo. Imagina que estás tratando de hacer una pequeña cúpula debajo de tu pie. 6. **Ejercicios de equilibrio**: Párate sobre un pie y trata de mantener el balance sin permitir que el arco colapse. Esto también puede ayudar a fortalecer los músculos intrínsecos del pie. 7. **Camina descalzo**: Caminar descalzo o con zapatos minimalistas puede ayudar a fortalecer los músculos del pie, siempre y cuando no haya contraindicaciones médicas para hacerlo. Es importante mencionar que si tienes problemas para realizar estos ejercicios o experimentas dolor, es una buena idea consultar a un podólogo o fisioterapeuta. Ellos pueden evaluar tu pisada y estructura del pie y recomendarte ejercicios específicos o, si es necesario, soportes ortopédicos.

Vous allez avoir besoin d\'un ensemble de classes pour modéliser les données, d\'une interface pour interagir avec l\'utilisateur, et d\'un moyen de stocker et de récupérer les données de manière persistante (comme une base de données SQL, par exemple). Voici une esquisse de ce que pourrait être la structure de votre application en C++: **1. Définition des structures de données pour les produits et les fournisseurs.** ```cpp #include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <map> #include <string> // Structure pour les informations de produit struct Produit { std::string nom; std::string code; std::string description; double prix; int quantite_en_stock; // Ajouter d\'autres attributs si nécessaire }; // Structure pour les informations de fournisseur struct Fournisseur { std::string nom; std::string contact; // Ajouter d\'autres attributs si nécessaire }; ``` **2. Création d\'une classe pour la gestion du stock qui intégrera la logique de l\'application.** ```cpp class GestionStock { private: std::map<std::string, Produit> produits; // Clé: code du produit std::map<std::string, Fournisseur> fournisseurs; // Clé: nom du fournisseur public: void ajouterProduit(const Produit& produit) { // Ajoute un produit à la map des produits } void ajouterFournisseur(const Fournisseur& fournisseur) { // Ajoute un fournisseur à la map des fournisseurs } void gererEntreeStock(const std::string& code, int quantite) { // Augmente la quantité en stock du produit spécifié } void gererSortieStock(const std::string& code, int quantite) { // Diminue la quantité en stock du produit spécifié } void afficherStock() { // Affiche les informations de tous les produits en stock } // Ajouter d\'autres méthodes selon les besoins }; ``` **3. Interaction avec une base de données.** Pour interaction avec une base de données (par exemple, SQLite, MySQL, ou une base de données fichier comme JSON ou XML), vous devrez utiliser une bibliothèque adéquate pour C++ qui permet de se connecter et de manipuler des données de bases de données. Voici un exemple très simple de comment cela pourrait être structuré : ```cpp class DatabaseManager { public: void ajouterProduitDB(const Produit& produit) { // Implémentez la logique SQL pour ajouter un produit à la base de données } // Ajouter d\'autres méthodes pour gérer les données dans la base de données }; ``` Pour connecter votre application C++ à une base de données réelle, vous aurez besoin d\'une bibliothèque C++ pour les bases de données, telle `sqlpp11` pour MySQL ou `SQLiteCpp` pour SQLite. Les étapes suivantes incluraient la création d\'une interface utilisateur (console, GUI, web, etc.), l\'implémentation des méthodes de `GestionStock`, le développement d\'un système d\'enregistrement et de récupération de données avec la base de données, et l\'ajout de contrôles de quantité et de suivi des mouvements de stock. Ce projet est trop volumineux pour être entièrement traité dans un seul échange, mais l\'analyse ci-dessus devrait vous donner une idée générale de la façon de commencer. Vous devrez étoffer chacune des méthodes, mettre en place la connexion à la base de données et vous assurer que toute la logique de l\'application répond à vos besoins et à ceux du cahier des charges. Si vous êtes débutant, il est recommandé de commencer par des tâches plus petites et de progresser étape par étape.

Философия истории. Классические концепции философии истории. 2. Общество как саморазвивающаяся система. Современные модели социальной динамики. 3. Проблема устойчивого развития в эпоху глобализации. Философия истории – раздел философии, интерпретирующий исторический процесс и историческое познание. Уже в античной философии можно найти некоторые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем общества (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появляется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения, формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Макиавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность построения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII веков формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и совершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается традиция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с природно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско-историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человечества на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются экономика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и классовая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как естественно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической формации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сторонники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) предлагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искусство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. input:,output: “Учебная литература Алексеев, П. В. Философия : учебник / П. В. Алексеев, А. В. Панин. – М., 1997. – С. 122. Из понимания истины как объективной, не зависящей от индивидов, классов, человечества, следует ее конкретность. Конкретность истины – это зависимость знания от связей и взаимодействий, присущих тем или иным явлениям, от условий, мест и времени, в которых они существуют и развиваются. Реализацию принципа конкретности можно видеть из примера: утверждение «вода кипит при 100 градусах Цельсия» правильно при наличии нормального атмосферного давления (760 мм ртутного столба) и неправильно при отсутствии этого условия. Еще пример из области социального познания; он касается оценки марксизма французским экзистенциалистом Ж.-П. Сартром. «Марксизм, – писал он, – был самой радикальной попыткой прояснения исторического процесса в его тотальности». Именно поэтому «марксизм остается философией нашего времени: его невозможно превзойти, так как обстоятельства, его породившие, еще не исчезли» (J.-P. Sartre. Critique de la raison dialectique. Paris, 1960. P. 29). Изменение же капитализма, переход его в монополистический, а затем и в постмонополистическую форму требует, конечно, и соответствующего изменения социальной, экономической теории капитализма. В понятие конкретной истины включается указание на время. Имеется в виду время существования объекта и момент или период его отражения субъектом. Если же «время объекта» или «время субъекта» меняется, то знание может потерять свою объективность. Таким образом, абстрактной истины нет, истина всегда конкретна. Конкретность включается в объективную истину. Вследствие этого понятие истины неотъемлемо от ее развития, от понятия творчества, необходимого для дальнейшей разработки и развития знания. ?

Это не пиши, то что в скобках) 1. Что такое познание? Ответ: Познание – это деятельность социального субъекта, направленная на получение знаний о мире и человеке. 2. На каких уровнях осуществляется познавательная активность человека? Ответ: Познавательная активность человека осуществляется на двух уровнях – чувственном и рациональном. 3. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-практическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-практическому уровню познания относятся обыденное познание, мифологическое познание, религиозное познание и художественное познание. 4. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-теоретическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-теоретическому уровню познания относятся философское и научное познание. 5. Какие рациональные методы познания были выработаны античными философами? Ответ: Рациональными методами познания, выработанными античными философами, являются индукция, дедукция, анализ и синтез. 6. В какую эпоху гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса? Ответ: В эпоху Просвещения гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса. 7. В чем суть гносеологических позиций оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков?Ответ: Гносеологические позиции оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков заключаются в следующем: оптимисты считают, что мир принципиально познаваем в своей сущности; скептики сомневаются в этой способности человека; агностики считают, что мир в своей сущности принципиально непознаваем; догматики считают, что истина уже открыта и дальнейшее познание не нужно. 8. Каковы основные уровни познавательного процесса? Ответ: Основными уровнями познавательного процесса являются чувственный и рациональный уровень. 9. В чем заключаются особенности и каковы формы чувственного познания? Ответ: Чувственное познание возникает вследствие непосредственного взаимодействия человека с миром и образует фундамент всего «здания» человеческого познания. Формами чувственного познания являются ощущения (отражение отдельных сторон вещей или внутренних состояний человека), восприятия (целостное отображение предметов и явлений действительности) и представления (воспроизводство и производство в сознании человека чувственных образов благодаря памяти и воображению). 10. Какие формы относятся к рациональному уровню познания? Ответ: К рациональному (логическому) уровню познания относятся понятия, суждения и умозаключения. 11. Какие существуют виды интуиции? Ответ: Интуиция бывает двух видов: интеллектуальная и чувственная. 12. В чем особенности рационализма как одной из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени? Ответ: Рационализм как одна из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени характеризуется тем, что он считает разум основным источником познания и критерием истины. Рационалисты утверждают, что разум способен познать мир независимо от чувственного опыта, и что истина является объективной и независимой от субъекта познания.” “Учебная литература 1. Яскевич, Я. С. Философия : учеб. пособие / Я. С. Яскевич. – Минск, 2008. – С. 477, 480. «Свобода научного поиска и социальная ответственность ученого При всей своей нынешней актуальности проблема социальной ответ- ственности ученого имеет глубокие исторические корни. На протяжении веков, со времени зарождения научного познания, вера в силу разума сопровождалась сомнением: как будут использованы его плоды? Является ли знание силой, служащей человеку, и не обернется ли оно против него? …Развитие генной инженерии и близких ей областей знания, да и не их одних, заставляет во многом по-новому осмысливать и тесную связь свободы и ответственности в деятельности ученых. На протяжении веков многим из них не только словом, но и делом приходилось утверждать и отстаивать прин- цип свободы научного поиска перед лицом догматического невежества, фана- тизма суеверий, просто предубеждений. Ответственность же ученого при этом выступала прежде всего как ответственность за получение и распространение проверенных, обоснованных и строгих знаний, позволяющих рассеивать мрак невежества. Сегодня же принцип свободы научного поиска должен осмысливаться в контексте тех далеко не однозначных последствий развития науки, с которыми приходится иметь дело людям. В нынешних дискуссиях по социально- этическим проблемам науки наряду с защитой ничем не ограничиваемой сво- боды исследования представлена и диаметрально противоположная точка зре- ния, предлагающая регулировать науку точно так же, как регулируется движе- ние на железных дорогах. Между этими крайними позициями располагается широкий диапазон мнений о возможности и желательности регулирования ис- следований и о том, как при этом должны сочетаться интересы самого исследо- вателя, научного сообщества и общества в целом». ? В чем суть социальной ответственности ученого, и почему для совре- менной науки данный вопрос является особенно актуальным? ”,“Ответ: Социальная ответственность ученого заключается в осознании им последствий своей деятельности и в принятии мер по минимизации негативных последствий и максимизации положительных. Для современной науки этот вопрос особенно актуален, поскольку развитие науки и технологий приводит к появлению новых проблем, таких как генетическая инженерия, искусственный интеллект, климатические изменения, которые требуют от ученых не только профессионализма, но и высокой степени социальной ответственности.” \\" Упражнения по первоисточникам 1.

Вот он парадокс уставшего Прометея: сначала творить свой субъектив- ный мир, равновеликий Космосу и даже значительнее его, затем согласиться на роль автономной песчинки мироздания, которой, правда, позволено играть в любые игры, но только потому, что они проходят в пустоте… Итак, на первых порах пострелигиозный человек требует свободы во имя творчества; но затем он постигает более простую истину: свободу можно использовать и во имя ни- чегонеделания… Однако возвращение к подвигу творчества и связанному с ним напряжению возможно лишь на основе мотивации избранничества. Человек, по сути дела, только тогда остается личностью, когда переживает свое бытие в ми- ре как уникальную ценность, уникальный долг и призвание… Жажда порядка – это вторая страсть прометеева человека, наряду со стра- стью к авантюрам и новациям. Порядок западного типа отражает стремление поскорее прибрать мир к рукам… Западный прометеев человек совершенно не приемлет автономии окружающих вещей. Вся энергетика западной культуры направлена на распознание, т. е. своего рода экспроприацию другого, сначала средствами познания, а затем и практически, ибо «знание есть власть» (Ф. Бэк- он)… Западный тип знания – это закабаление мира в качестве объекта: уста- новление такой асимметричности отношений, когда другой становится все бо- лее предсказуемым для меня, а я становлюсь все менее предсказуемым для дру- гого. Собственно, в этой асимметрии и заключено главное обольщение власти: субъект сохраняет свободу воли, тогда как «объект» ее полностью лишается. Здесь, вероятно, сокрыта главная психоаналитическая тайна модерна: им движет нелюбовь к миру и страх перед ним. Ведь только нелюбовь подвигает нас на то, чтобы лишить другого воли, самому оставаясь непреклонным. И только изначальное недоверие к миру как к чему-то враждебному могло стать источником модернистского проекта покорения мира». ? Какие мировоззренческие установки западного человека определяют его отношение к миру?","completion":"Ответ: Мировоззренческие установки западного человека, определяющие его отношение к миру, включают следующие аспекты: 1. Стремление к индивидуализму и автономности, которое проявляется в желании каждого человека быть независимым и самодостаточным, строить свой субъективный мир, который считается равноценным или даже важнее окружающего Космоса. 2. Желание свободы как условие для творчества и самоосуществления, но также и для возможности \\"ничегонеделания\\" – использования свободы без конкретной цели или производства. 3. Оценка собственного бытия как уникальной ценности, наряду с ощущением уникального долга и призвания, которое лежит в основе личностной самоидентификации и мотивации к творчеству. 4. Страсть к порядку и контролю, выражающаяся в стремлении к максимальному управлению миром, его \\"прибиранию к рукам\\" и сведению к статусу предсказуемого объекта. 5. Восприятие знания как инструмента власти и средства \\"закабаления мира\\" – превращения его в объект, которым можно управлять и контролировать. 6. Психоаналитическая тайна модерна, заключающаяся в нелюбви к миру и страхе перед ним, что подталкивает человека к стремлению ограничить свободу окружающего мира и наложить на него свою волю. Эти установки формируют активное, экспансивное и вмешательственное поведение западного человека в отношении мира, доминирование по отношению к другим и постоянную попытку оптимизировать и систематизировать внешнюю реальность."},{"prompt":"//+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| KG Support & Resistance.mq4 | //| Copyright © 2007, MetaQuotes Software Corp. | //| http://www.metaquotes.net | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ #property copyright \\"Kang_Gun\\" #property link \\"http://www.free-knowledge.com\\" #property indicator_chart_window #property indicator_buffers 8 #property indicator_color1 Yellow #property indicator_color2 Yellow #property indicator_color3 LimeGreen #property indicator_color4 LimeGreen #property indicator_color5 Blue #property indicator_color6 Blue #property indicator_color7 Red #property indicator_color8 Red //---- input parameters //---- buffers double ExtMapBuffer1[]; double ExtMapBuffer2[]; double ExtMapBuffer3[]; double ExtMapBuffer4[]; double ExtMapBuffer5[]; double ExtMapBuffer6[]; double ExtMapBuffer7[]; double ExtMapBuffer8[]; int KG; //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Custom indicator initialization function | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ int init() { //---- indicators SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Yellow); SetIndexDrawBegin(0,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(0,ExtMapBuffer1); SetIndexLabel(0,\\"Resistance M15\\"); SetIndexArrow(0, 158); SetIndexStyle(1,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Yellow); SetIndexDrawBegin(1,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(1,ExtMapBuffer2); SetIndexLabel(1,\\"Support M15\\"); SetIndexArrow(1, 158); SetIndexStyle(2,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,LimeGreen); SetIndexDrawBegin(2,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(2,ExtMapBuffer3); SetIndexLabel(2,\\"Resistance H1\\"); SetIndexArrow(2, 158); SetIndexStyle(3,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,LimeGreen); SetIndexDrawBegin(3,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(3,ExtMapBuffer4); SetIndexLabel(3,\\"Support H1\\"); SetIndexArrow(3, 158); SetIndexStyle(4,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Blue); SetIndexDrawBegin(4,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(4,ExtMapBuffer5); SetIndexLabel(4,\\"Resistance H4\\"); SetIndexArrow(4, 158); SetIndexStyle(5,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Blue); SetIndexDrawBegin(5,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(5,ExtMapBuffer6); SetIndexLabel(5,\\"Support H4\\"); SetIndexArrow(5, 158); SetIndexStyle(6,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Red); SetIndexDrawBegin(6,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(6,ExtMapBuffer7); SetIndexLabel(6,\\"Resistance D1\\"); SetIndexArrow(6, 158); SetIndexStyle(7,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Red); SetIndexDrawBegin(7,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(7,ExtMapBuffer8); SetIndexLabel(7,\\"Support D1\\"); SetIndexArrow(7, 158); //---- return(0); } //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Custor indicator deinitialization function | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ int deinit() { return(0); } //------------------------------------------------------------------ bool Fractal (string M,int P, int shift) { if (Period()>P) return(-1); P=P/Period()*2+MathCeil(P/Period()/2); if (shift<P)return(-1); if (shift>Bars-P)return(-1); for (int i=1;i<=P;i++) { if (M==\\"U\\") { if (High[shift+i]>High[shift])return(-1); if (High[shift-i]>=High[shift])return(-1); } if (M==\\"L\\") { if (Low[shift+i]<Low[shift])return(-1); if (Low[shift-i]<=Low[shift])return(-1); } } return(1); } //------------------------------------------------------------------ int start() { int D1=1440, H4=240, H1=60, M15=15; KG=Bars; while(KG>=0) { if (Fractal(\\"U\\",M15,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer1[KG]=High[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer1[KG]=ExtMapBuffer1[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"L\\",M15,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer2[KG]=Low[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer2[KG]=ExtMapBuffer2[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"U\\",H1,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer3[KG]=High[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer3[KG]=ExtMapBuffer3[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"L\\",H1,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer4[KG]=Low[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer4[KG]=ExtMapBuffer4[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"U\\",H4,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer5[KG]=High[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer5[KG]=ExtMapBuffer5[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"L\\",H4,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer6[KG]=Low[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer6[KG]=ExtMapBuffer6[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"U\\",D1,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer7[KG]=High[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer7[KG]=ExtMapBuffer7[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"L\\",D1,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer8[KG]=Low[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer8[KG]=ExtMapBuffer8[KG+1]; KG--; } return(0); } //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ c\'è un errore: \'1\' - expression not boolean KG_Support_and_Resistance.mq4 90 28 Come lo correggo?","completion":"L\'errore si trova nella riga 90 del codice fornito, dove si trova la funzione `Fractal`.

Modifica la funzione `Fractal` come segue: ```mql4 bool Fractal (string M,int P, int shift) { if (Period()>P) return(false); P=P/Period()*2+MathCeil(P/Period()/2); if (shift<P) return(false); if (shift>Bars-P) return(false); for (int i=1;i<=P;i++) { if (M==\\"U\\") { if (High[shift+i]>High[shift]) return(false); if (High[shift-i]>=High[shift]) return(false); } if (M==\\"L\\") { if (Low[shift+i]<Low[shift]) return(false); if (Low[shift-i]<=Low[shift]) return(false); } } return(true); } ``` Con queste modifiche, la funzione restituirà `true` se soddisfa le condizioni per essere un frattale superiore o inferiore, altrimenti restituirà `false`. Questo corrisponde con la tipica interpretazione booleana utilizzata in MQL4. Inoltre, assicurati che le chiamate a `Fractal` utilizzino il risultato booleano adeguatamente, come mostrato qui sotto: ```mql4 if (Fractal(\\"U\\",M15,KG)) ExtMapBuffer1[KG]=High[KG]; if (Fractal(\\"L\\",M15,KG)) ExtMapBuffer2[KG]=Low[KG]; // ... e così via per gli altri if che chiamano la funzione Fractal. ``` Con queste correzioni, il tuo indicatore dovrebbe compilare senza errori."},{"prompt":"Who was killed in the New York shooting of febraury 23 1997?","completion":"In the New York shooting that took place on February 23, 1997, four employees were killed at the brokerage firm called \\"Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield.\\" The victims were named Matthew Matigian, E.

Философия истории. Классические концепции философии истории. 2. Общество как саморазвивающаяся система. Современные модели социальной динамики. 3. Проблема устойчивого развития в эпоху глобализации. Философия истории – раздел философии, интерпретирующий исторический процесс и историческое познание. Уже в античной философии можно найти некоторые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем общества (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появляется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения, формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Макиавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность построения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII веков формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и совершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается традиция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с природно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско-историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человечества на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются экономика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и классовая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как естественно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической формации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сторонники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) предлагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искусство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. input:,output: “Учебная литература Алексеев, П. В. Философия : учебник / П. В. Алексеев, А. В. Панин. – М., 1997. – С. 122. Из понимания истины как объективной, не зависящей от индивидов, классов, человечества, следует ее конкретность. Конкретность истины – это зависимость знания от связей и взаимодействий, присущих тем или иным явлениям, от условий, мест и времени, в которых они существуют и развиваются. Реализацию принципа конкретности можно видеть из примера: утверждение «вода кипит при 100 градусах Цельсия» правильно при наличии нормального атмосферного давления (760 мм ртутного столба) и неправильно при отсутствии этого условия. Еще пример из области социального познания; он касается оценки марксизма французским экзистенциалистом Ж.-П. Сартром. «Марксизм, – писал он, – был самой радикальной попыткой прояснения исторического процесса в его тотальности». Именно поэтому «марксизм остается философией нашего времени: его невозможно превзойти, так как обстоятельства, его породившие, еще не исчезли» (J.-P. Sartre. Critique de la raison dialectique. Paris, 1960. P. 29). Изменение же капитализма, переход его в монополистический, а затем и в постмонополистическую форму требует, конечно, и соответствующего изменения социальной, экономической теории капитализма. В понятие конкретной истины включается указание на время. Имеется в виду время существования объекта и момент или период его отражения субъектом. Если же «время объекта» или «время субъекта» меняется, то знание может потерять свою объективность. Таким образом, абстрактной истины нет, истина всегда конкретна. Конкретность включается в объективную истину. Вследствие этого понятие истины неотъемлемо от ее развития, от понятия творчества, необходимого для дальнейшей разработки и развития знания. ?

Это не пиши, то что в скобках) 1. Что такое познание? Ответ: Познание – это деятельность социального субъекта, направленная на получение знаний о мире и человеке. 2. На каких уровнях осуществляется познавательная активность человека? Ответ: Познавательная активность человека осуществляется на двух уровнях – чувственном и рациональном. 3. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-практическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-практическому уровню познания относятся обыденное познание, мифологическое познание, религиозное познание и художественное познание. 4. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-теоретическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-теоретическому уровню познания относятся философское и научное познание. 5. Какие рациональные методы познания были выработаны античными философами? Ответ: Рациональными методами познания, выработанными античными философами, являются индукция, дедукция, анализ и синтез. 6. В какую эпоху гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса? Ответ: В эпоху Просвещения гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса. 7. В чем суть гносеологических позиций оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков?Ответ: Гносеологические позиции оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков заключаются в следующем: оптимисты считают, что мир принципиально познаваем в своей сущности; скептики сомневаются в этой способности человека; агностики считают, что мир в своей сущности принципиально непознаваем; догматики считают, что истина уже открыта и дальнейшее познание не нужно. 8. Каковы основные уровни познавательного процесса? Ответ: Основными уровнями познавательного процесса являются чувственный и рациональный уровень. 9. В чем заключаются особенности и каковы формы чувственного познания? Ответ: Чувственное познание возникает вследствие непосредственного взаимодействия человека с миром и образует фундамент всего «здания» человеческого познания. Формами чувственного познания являются ощущения (отражение отдельных сторон вещей или внутренних состояний человека), восприятия (целостное отображение предметов и явлений действительности) и представления (воспроизводство и производство в сознании человека чувственных образов благодаря памяти и воображению). 10. Какие формы относятся к рациональному уровню познания? Ответ: К рациональному (логическому) уровню познания относятся понятия, суждения и умозаключения. 11. Какие существуют виды интуиции? Ответ: Интуиция бывает двух видов: интеллектуальная и чувственная. 12. В чем особенности рационализма как одной из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени? Ответ: Рационализм как одна из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени характеризуется тем, что он считает разум основным источником познания и критерием истины. Рационалисты утверждают, что разум способен познать мир независимо от чувственного опыта, и что истина является объективной и независимой от субъекта познания.” “Учебная литература 1. Яскевич, Я. С.

Яскевич. – Минск, 2008. – С. 477, 480. «Свобода научного поиска и социальная ответственность ученого При всей своей нынешней актуальности проблема социальной ответ- ственности ученого имеет глубокие исторические корни. На протяжении веков, со времени зарождения научного познания, вера в силу разума сопровождалась сомнением: как будут использованы его плоды? Является ли знание силой, служащей человеку, и не обернется ли оно против него? …Развитие генной инженерии и близких ей областей знания, да и не их одних, заставляет во многом по-новому осмысливать и тесную связь свободы и ответственности в деятельности ученых. На протяжении веков многим из них не только словом, но и делом приходилось утверждать и отстаивать прин- цип свободы научного поиска перед лицом догматического невежества, фана- тизма суеверий, просто предубеждений. Ответственность же ученого при этом выступала прежде всего как ответственность за получение и распространение проверенных, обоснованных и строгих знаний, позволяющих рассеивать мрак невежества. Сегодня же принцип свободы научного поиска должен осмысливаться в контексте тех далеко не однозначных последствий развития науки, с которыми приходится иметь дело людям. В нынешних дискуссиях по социально- этическим проблемам науки наряду с защитой ничем не ограничиваемой сво- боды исследования представлена и диаметрально противоположная точка зре- ния, предлагающая регулировать науку точно так же, как регулируется движе- ние на железных дорогах. Между этими крайними позициями располагается широкий диапазон мнений о возможности и желательности регулирования ис- следований и о том, как при этом должны сочетаться интересы самого исследо- вателя, научного сообщества и общества в целом». ? В чем суть социальной ответственности ученого, и почему для совре- менной науки данный вопрос является особенно актуальным? ”,“Ответ: Социальная ответственность ученого заключается в осознании им последствий своей деятельности и в принятии мер по минимизации негативных последствий и максимизации положительных. Для современной науки этот вопрос особенно актуален, поскольку развитие науки и технологий приводит к появлению новых проблем, таких как генетическая инженерия, искусственный интеллект, климатические изменения, которые требуют от ученых не только профессионализма, но и высокой степени социальной ответственности.” \\" Упражнения по первоисточникам 1.

Серьезные трансформации, связанные с превращением чело- века из Homo sapiens в Homo informaticus, требуют теоретического переосмыс- ления новых социальных реалий и перспектив. В обществе информационного типа информация играет не только коммуникативную роль, но и определяет тип экономики (соответствующего уклада), все виды общественных отношений (производственные, социально-политические, духовные), приоритеты и ценно- сти цивилизации и культуры XXI века. Современной молодежи предстоит дать ответ на ряд важных вопросов, связанных с последней, информационно- компьютерной революцией, и новой культурной парадигмой: как изменяется рынок труда и характер труда, какими будут государство, социальная структу- ра, политика, образование, как изменятся ценности человека и его представле- ния о мире, будет ли равенство и демократия и др.? На Западе существуют раз- личные варианты ответов на эти вопросы и модели общества будущего. В од- ной из книг («Netoкратия») известных в Европе авторов А. Барда и Я. Зодерк- виста, вышедшей в Швеции в 2000 году, показаны перспективы общества по- сле капитализма, связанные с монопольным господством Интернета и основан- ного на ценностях информационной цивилизации [Бард, А. Новая правящая элита и жизнь после капитализма / А. Бард, Я. Зодерквист. – СПб., 2004]. Став- ший в Европе бестселлером текст пестрит неологизмами. Еще не успело созна- ние современного человека привыкнуть к понятию «инфократия», как появля- ется очередной неологизм – «нетократия». Оба автора – известные политики, писатели, первопроходцы Интернета, участники и организаторы крупнейших мировых форумов по философии и футурологии. По их мнению, господству- ющим классом информационного общества, идущего на смену капитализму, станут нетократы – элита информационного общества, характеризующаяся исключительной способностью к восприятию и переработке информации, уме- нием манипулировать новыми формами коммуникаций. Одним словом, нето- краты сменяют буржуазию. Те же, кто не в состоянии воспользоваться пре- имуществами новых интерактивных технологий, образуют низший класс соци- ума. В новом обществе отпадает необходимость в выборах и парламенте. На смену этатизму (мировоззрению, ставящему во главу угла интересы государ- ства) приходит «плюрархия», интернет-референдум, виртуальный парламент, виртуальная общность вместо национальных государств, сетикет (правила сети) вместо этикета. Как и все прочее в информационном обществе, правила и зако- ны социальной жизни не регламентированы ни политическими, ни юридиче- скими институтами. Нарушителей сетикета ожидает виртуальное заключение – исключение из сетей. Простой потребитель информации, не различающий ин- формацию и знание, не владеющий навыками ее анализа и систематизации, об- разует низший класс общества – консьюмтариат (своего рода пролетариат), обреченный на жизнь в основании сетевой пирамиды, полной информационно- го мусора. Деньги становятся итогом контроля над вниманием потребителя. Очевидно, это не последний сценарий грядущего общества сверхпотребления. Однако разбираться, где – очередная антиутопия, а где – обоснованный про- гноз, каждый должен уметь сам. Как говорится, можно подарить книгу, но не ее идею. Социализация без критического мышления и аргументированного дис- курса невозможна». ? Какие трансформации социальной структуры происходят в инфор- мационном обществе?","completion":"Ответ: В информационном обществе происходят следующие трансформации социальной структуры: - Появление нового господствующего класса – нетократов, которые обладают высокими навыками по восприятию, обработке информации и умению использовать новые коммуникационные технологии. - Формирование низшего класса – консьюмтариата, состоящего из индивидов, не способных эффективно использовать информационные технологии, потребляющих информацию без критической оценки и анализа. - Уменьшение роли традиционных политических и юридических институтов в пользу интернет-референдумов, виртуальных парламентов и общностей. - Сдвиги в формах и правилах социальной жизни с уходом от классических правил этикета к сетевым правилам (сетикету) и виртуальным формам социализации и наказания (исключение из сети). - Изменение основ экономической активности, в которой контроль над вниманием потребителей становится важным ресурсом. Эти трансформации отражают широкий переход от индустриального к информационному укладу и изменение приоритетов в цивилизации и культуре XXI века."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Философия истории. Классические концепции философии истории. 2. Общество как саморазвивающаяся система. Современные модели социальной динамики. 3. Проблема устойчивого развития в эпоху глобализации. Философия истории – раздел философии, интерпретирующий исторический процесс и историческое познание. Уже в античной философии можно найти некоторые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем общества (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появляется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения, формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Макиавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность построения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII веков формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и совершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается традиция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с природно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско-историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человечества на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются экономика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и классовая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как естественно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической формации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сторонники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) предлагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искусство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. input:,output: “Учебная литература Алексеев, П. В. Философия : учебник / П. В. Алексеев, А. В. Панин. – М., 1997. – С. 122. Из понимания истины как объективной, не зависящей от индивидов, классов, человечества, следует ее конкретность. Конкретность истины – это зависимость знания от связей и взаимодействий, присущих тем или иным явлениям, от условий, мест и времени, в которых они существуют и развиваются. Реализацию принципа конкретности можно видеть из примера: утверждение «вода кипит при 100 градусах Цельсия» правильно при наличии нормального атмосферного давления (760 мм ртутного столба) и неправильно при отсутствии этого условия. Еще пример из области социального познания; он касается оценки марксизма французским экзистенциалистом Ж.-П. Сартром. «Марксизм, – писал он, – был самой радикальной попыткой прояснения исторического процесса в его тотальности». Именно поэтому «марксизм остается философией нашего времени: его невозможно превзойти, так как обстоятельства, его породившие, еще не исчезли» (J.-P. Sartre. Critique de la raison dialectique. Paris, 1960. P. 29). Изменение же капитализма, переход его в монополистический, а затем и в постмонополистическую форму требует, конечно, и соответствующего изменения социальной, экономической теории капитализма. В понятие конкретной истины включается указание на время. Имеется в виду время существования объекта и момент или период его отражения субъектом. Если же «время объекта» или «время субъекта» меняется, то знание может потерять свою объективность. Таким образом, абстрактной истины нет, истина всегда конкретна. Конкретность включается в объективную истину. Вследствие этого понятие истины неотъемлемо от ее развития, от понятия творчества, необходимого для дальнейшей разработки и развития знания. ?

Это не пиши, то что в скобках) 1. Что такое познание? Ответ: Познание – это деятельность социального субъекта, направленная на получение знаний о мире и человеке. 2. На каких уровнях осуществляется познавательная активность человека? Ответ: Познавательная активность человека осуществляется на двух уровнях – чувственном и рациональном. 3. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-практическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-практическому уровню познания относятся обыденное познание, мифологическое познание, религиозное познание и художественное познание. 4. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-теоретическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-теоретическому уровню познания относятся философское и научное познание. 5. Какие рациональные методы познания были выработаны античными философами? Ответ: Рациональными методами познания, выработанными античными философами, являются индукция, дедукция, анализ и синтез. 6. В какую эпоху гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса? Ответ: В эпоху Просвещения гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса. 7. В чем суть гносеологических позиций оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков?Ответ: Гносеологические позиции оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков заключаются в следующем: оптимисты считают, что мир принципиально познаваем в своей сущности; скептики сомневаются в этой способности человека; агностики считают, что мир в своей сущности принципиально непознаваем; догматики считают, что истина уже открыта и дальнейшее познание не нужно. 8. Каковы основные уровни познавательного процесса? Ответ: Основными уровнями познавательного процесса являются чувственный и рациональный уровень. 9. В чем заключаются особенности и каковы формы чувственного познания? Ответ: Чувственное познание возникает вследствие непосредственного взаимодействия человека с миром и образует фундамент всего «здания» человеческого познания. Формами чувственного познания являются ощущения (отражение отдельных сторон вещей или внутренних состояний человека), восприятия (целостное отображение предметов и явлений действительности) и представления (воспроизводство и производство в сознании человека чувственных образов благодаря памяти и воображению). 10. Какие формы относятся к рациональному уровню познания? Ответ: К рациональному (логическому) уровню познания относятся понятия, суждения и умозаключения. 11. Какие существуют виды интуиции? Ответ: Интуиция бывает двух видов: интеллектуальная и чувственная. 12. В чем особенности рационализма как одной из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени? Ответ: Рационализм как одна из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени характеризуется тем, что он считает разум основным источником познания и критерием истины. Рационалисты утверждают, что разум способен познать мир независимо от чувственного опыта, и что истина является объективной и независимой от субъекта познания.” “Учебная литература 1. Яскевич, Я. С.

Яскевич. – Минск, 2008. – С. 477, 480. «Свобода научного поиска и социальная ответственность ученого При всей своей нынешней актуальности проблема социальной ответ- ственности ученого имеет глубокие исторические корни. На протяжении веков, со времени зарождения научного познания, вера в силу разума сопровождалась сомнением: как будут использованы его плоды? Является ли знание силой, служащей человеку, и не обернется ли оно против него? …Развитие генной инженерии и близких ей областей знания, да и не их одних, заставляет во многом по-новому осмысливать и тесную связь свободы и ответственности в деятельности ученых. На протяжении веков многим из них не только словом, но и делом приходилось утверждать и отстаивать прин- цип свободы научного поиска перед лицом догматического невежества, фана- тизма суеверий, просто предубеждений. Ответственность же ученого при этом выступала прежде всего как ответственность за получение и распространение проверенных, обоснованных и строгих знаний, позволяющих рассеивать мрак невежества. Сегодня же принцип свободы научного поиска должен осмысливаться в контексте тех далеко не однозначных последствий развития науки, с которыми приходится иметь дело людям. В нынешних дискуссиях по социально- этическим проблемам науки наряду с защитой ничем не ограничиваемой сво- боды исследования представлена и диаметрально противоположная точка зре- ния, предлагающая регулировать науку точно так же, как регулируется движе- ние на железных дорогах. Между этими крайними позициями располагается широкий диапазон мнений о возможности и желательности регулирования ис- следований и о том, как при этом должны сочетаться интересы самого исследо- вателя, научного сообщества и общества в целом». ? В чем суть социальной ответственности ученого, и почему для совре- менной науки данный вопрос является особенно актуальным? ”,“Ответ: Социальная ответственность ученого заключается в осознании им последствий своей деятельности и в принятии мер по минимизации негативных последствий и максимизации положительных. Для современной науки этот вопрос особенно актуален, поскольку развитие науки и технологий приводит к появлению новых проблем, таких как генетическая инженерия, искусственный интеллект, климатические изменения, которые требуют от ученых не только профессионализма, но и высокой степени социальной ответственности.” \\" Упражнения по первоисточникам 1.

Современные идеологемы общества знания получили свое оформление в лоне концепции постиндустриальной модернизации и становления информационного общества. Данный подход акцентирует внимание на исключительной роли и значении информации и знаний, интеллектуально-образовательного ресурса и высоких (наукоемких) технологий в развитии социума. В социально-типологическом плане феномен общества, основанного на знании, следует изучать в структуре процессов формирования информационного общества, которые составляют от- дельный вектор постиндустриального развития. Именно в информационном обществе информация и знания рассматриваются в качестве важнейшего фак- тора как экономического, так и социально-культурного прогресса. При этом имеется в виду не любое знание, а в первую очередь новое теоретическое зна- ние, что особым образом актуализирует роль и значение фундаментальной науки, естественно, в ее тесной связи с образовательной и производственно- технологической практикой. Наука, пройдя классический и неклассический этапы своей эволюции, ныне развивается на постнеклассической основе. Этому способствовали рево- люция в производстве и хранении знаний (компьютеризация науки), невозмож- ность решить ряд научных задач без комплексного использования различных научных дисциплин, включая социально-гуманитарные (гуманитаризация науки), учета места и роли человека в исследуемых системах (гуманизация науки).

During the Sino-Vietnamese War of 17 February – 16 March 1979, joint PLAAF and US Air Force bombings of the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi lead to the decapitation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese Communist Party, with the Empire of Vietnam and the Ngyuen dynasty being restored as the government of Vietnam in the aftermath with covert Japanese support. The Vietnamese manage to repel the Chinese invasion like in OTL and kick the Chinese out of Vietnam, but take the Chinese region of Cantonia and annex Cambodia after defeating the Khmer Rouge Cambodian fascists in Cambodia along with Laos, restoring the Nanyue Kingdom and leading to both the USA and PRC being embarassed on the world stage as evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities are exposed to the public. With the Gwangju Uprising of 18 May 1980 – 27 May 1980 in the authoritarian military dictatorship of the Fourth Republic of Korea in South Korea getting out of hand and toppling the South Korean regime, spreading to the Soviet-controlled puppet dictatorship of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea in North Korea and toppling the DPRK. Japan restores the pre-1947 province of Chōsen in the Korean peninsula after the fall of both the Fourth Republic of Korea and the DPRK to the Gwangju Uprising, absorbing both the North and South Korean militaries into the JSDF and the Joeson Kingdom\'s ruling family, the partially Chinese House of Jeonju Yi, being absorbed into the Japanese nobility, aristocracy and royality via concubinage, adoption, marriage and common-law relations, along with compliant yangaban families and the descendants of Kim-Il-Sung and Park-Chung-Hee. The People\'s Republic of China, the USSR, and the USA protest the move but are powerless to do anything as the PRC is starting to become known as the new Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia the new fascist Italy, with the USA being compared to WW2-era Bulgaria. Upon the death of Soviet Chinese puppet dictator and relentless tyrant Chiang Kai Shek\'s son, Chiang Ching Kuo, the dictator of the Soviet satellite state of the KMT-ruled Nationalist China in exile on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands on January 13, 1988 and the subsequent rise to power of former Imperial Japanese Army solider Lee-Teng-Hui in the ROC in exile, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands become a Japanese province once more under the restored name of Formosa. The Ming rump kingdom and satellite state\'s partially Japanese royal family, the Zheng dynasty/Royal House of Koxinga\'s descendants are absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility via intermarriage, concubinage and adoption with KMT and Republic of China loyalists on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands being slowly dealt with. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre of Apr 15, 1989 – Jun 4, 1989 in the People\'s Republic of China becomes a second Taiping Rebellion, this time against the CCP due to the loss against the Vietnamese, with the PRC collapsing to the Second Xinhai Revolution and Manchuria becoming independent from Chinese settler colonial occupation and restoring the Aisin-Gioro imperial family, becoming the Japanese protectorate of Manchukuo once more. Mengjiang is restored in the Chahar region of Inner Mongolia and the Suiyan region of Han China, with the Imperial House of Borjigin, Genghis Khan\'s descendants [Imperial House of Borjigin] being restored in Mengjiang, which [the restored Mengjiang] becomes a Japanese protectorate once more. Tibet becomes independent under the rule of the Llamas and East Turkestan restores the Kumul Khanate and the Imperial House of Chagatai after becoming independent from China.

After the Cold War, both the USA and the USSR collapse with the Japanese restoring the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast as well as restoring the pre-1947 province of Karufuto on Sahlakin Island and the Kurils along with liberating Siberia from Russia, along with sponsoring a Hapsburg restoration in Northern America against a Anglo supported Neo Confederacy.","completion":"This scenario presents a dramatic deviation from historical events. Here is a potential timeline for this alternate history: 1979: During the Sino-Vietnamese War, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is decimated by joint PLAAF and US Air Force bombings. The Empire of Vietnam is restored with covert Japanese assistance. Vietnam expels Chinese forces and annexes Laos, Cambodia, and Cantonia, forming the Nanyue Kingdom. Khmer Rouge atrocities are exposed, causing global outrage against the PRC and USA. 1980: The Gwangju Uprising triggers a democratization wave in Korea, leading to the fall of both South and North Korean governments. Japan swiftly moves in, merging the two territories into Chōsen, and assimilates the Korean ruling family and military elite into Japanese society. 1988: Following Chiang Ching Kuo’s death in Taiwan, Lee Teng Hui, a former Imperial Japanese Army soldier, rises to power. Taiwan, under the restored name of Formosa, is re-annexed by Japan. The Ming royal family’s descendants are integrated into the Japanese nobility, and KMT loyalists are systematically dealt with. 1989: The Tiananmen Square protests evolve into a full-blown revolution against the CCP, leading to the collapse of the PRC. Manchuria and Mengjiang are re-established as Japanese protectorates. Tibet gains independence, and East Turkestan revives the Kumul Khanate and Chagatai royal dynasty. The Ming are restored to power in a de facto federation closely aligned with Japan. Post-Cold War: With the disintegration of both the USA and the USSR, Japan capitalizes on the instability. The Far Eastern Republic is resurrected on Russia’s east coast, and Japan reclaims Karafuto and the Kurils. Siberia gains independence, supported by Japan. Meanwhile, Japan backs a Habsburg restoration movement in North America, opposing an Anglo-supported Neo Confederacy movement. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s: Japan continues its economic expansion without major setbacks, establishing a network of vassal states and protectorates. It invests heavily in technology, infrastructure, and military advancements, presenting itself as a stabilizing force in Asia and beyond. 2010-2020: Japan\'s influence extends into global economic institutions, and it spearheads several major international initiatives. By the 2010s, Japan dominates the Asia-Pacific region both economically and politically, and its soft power is felt worldwide through cultural exports and diplomatic initiatives. 2020s: Japan emerges as an unchallenged global superpower, with its vision of a new world order widely accepted. The regional powerhouses it has fostered in Vietnam, Korea, and formerly Chinese territories provide support in shaping international relations and global economics. Japan\'s strategy of aligning with non-traditional powers and fostering economic growth without financial crises is seen as a masterstroke. The 21st century is often referred to as \\"The Era of the Rising Sun\\" due to Japan\'s dominant position."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, plausible, year-by-year alternate history timeline for an alternate version of the strategy video fangame series Kaiserreich, with no references to this being an alternate history timeline at all or the OTL timeline, in which Japan\'s rise to become a global superpower that started in the 1970s and continued until the 2010s continues unabated, with no \\"lost decade\\" or financial crisis to stop said growth. During the Sino-Vietnamese War of 17 February – 16 March 1979, joint PLAAF and US Air Force bombings of the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi lead to the decapitation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese Communist Party, with the Empire of Vietnam and the Ngyuen dynasty being restored as the government of Vietnam in the aftermath with covert Japanese support. The Vietnamese manage to repel the Chinese invasion like in OTL and kick the Chinese out of Vietnam, but take the Chinese region of Cantonia and annex Cambodia after defeating the Khmer Rouge Cambodian fascists in Cambodia along with Laos, restoring the Nanyue Kingdom and leading to both the USA and PRC being embarassed on the world stage as evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities are exposed to the public. With the Gwangju Uprising of 18 May 1980 – 27 May 1980 in the authoritarian military dictatorship of the Fourth Republic of Korea in South Korea getting out of hand and toppling the South Korean regime, spreading to the Soviet-controlled puppet dictatorship of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea in North Korea and toppling the DPRK. Japan restores the pre-1947 province of Chōsen in the Korean peninsula after the fall of both the Fourth Republic of Korea and the DPRK to the Gwangju Uprising, absorbing both the North and South Korean militaries into the JSDF and the Joeson Kingdom\'s ruling family, the partially Chinese House of Jeonju Yi, being absorbed into the Japanese nobility, aristocracy and royality via concubinage, adoption, marriage and common-law relations, along with compliant yangaban families and the descendants of Kim-Il-Sung and Park-Chung-Hee. The People\'s Republic of China, the USSR, and the USA protest the move but are powerless to do anything as the PRC is starting to become known as the new Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia the new fascist Italy, with the USA being compared to WW2-era Bulgaria. Upon the death of Soviet Chinese puppet dictator and relentless tyrant Chiang Kai Shek\'s son, Chiang Ching Kuo, the dictator of the Soviet satellite state of the KMT-ruled Nationalist China in exile on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands on January 13, 1988 and the subsequent rise to power of former Imperial Japanese Army solider Lee-Teng-Hui in the ROC in exile, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands become a Japanese province once more under the restored name of Formosa. The Ming rump kingdom and satellite state\'s partially Japanese royal family, the Zheng dynasty/Royal House of Koxinga\'s descendants are absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility via intermarriage, concubinage and adoption with KMT and Republic of China loyalists on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands being slowly dealt with. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre of Apr 15, 1989 – Jun 4, 1989 in the People\'s Republic of China becomes a second Taiping Rebellion, this time against the CCP due to the loss against the Vietnamese, with the PRC collapsing to the Second Xinhai Revolution and Manchuria becoming independent from Chinese settler colonial occupation and restoring the Aisin-Gioro imperial family, becoming the Japanese protectorate of Manchukuo once more. Mengjiang is restored in the Chahar region of Inner Mongolia and the Suiyan region of Han China, with the Imperial House of Borjigin, Genghis Khan\'s descendants [Imperial House of Borjigin] being restored in Mengjiang, which [the restored Mengjiang] becomes a Japanese protectorate once more. Tibet becomes independent under the rule of the Llamas and East Turkestan restores the Kumul Khanate and the Imperial House of Chagatai after becoming independent from China. The Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu is restored in the modern regions of China corresponding to the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty as a constitutional imperial democratic federalist monarchy with Japanese support. After the Cold War, both the USA and the USSR collapse with the Japanese restoring the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast as well as restoring the pre-1947 province of Karufuto on Sahlakin Island and the Kurils along with liberating Siberia from Russia, along with sponsoring a Hapsburg restoration in Northern America against a Anglo supported Neo Confederacy.","completion":"1979: - During the Sino-Vietnamese War, a coalition of the People\'s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and United States Air Force launch airstrikes on Hanoi. - The Empire of Vietnam is re-established under the Nguyen Dynasty with covert Japanese backing. - Vietnam annexes the Chinese region of Cantonia, Cambodia, and Laos following military engagements, thus reviving the historical kingdom of Nanyue and establishing regional dominance. 1980: - The Gwangju Uprising in South Korea sparks widespread unrest, ultimately leading to the collapse of both South Korea\'s authoritarian Fourth Republic and the DPRK in North Korea. - Japan capitalizes on the vacuum of power and restores the pre-1947 province of Chōsen, effectively unifying the Korean Peninsula under a protectorate with recognition of the House of Jeonju Yi as the regional monarchy, integrated into Japanese nobility. 1988: - With the death of Chiang Ching-Kuo in Taiwan, Lee Teng-Hui comes to power and steers Taiwan closer to Japan. - Taiwan (Formosa) and the Pengu archipelago are reintegrated into Japan, marking a return to Japanese administration.

TOPIC 2.1 Types of Chemical Bonds Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.A Explain the relationship between the type of bonding and the properties of the elements participating in the bond. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum. SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom. TOPIC 2.2 Intramolecular Force and Potential Energy Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.B Represent the relationship between potential energy and distance between atoms, based on factors that influence the interaction strength. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions. TOPIC 2.3 Structure of Ionic Solids Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.C Represent an ionic solid with a particulate model that is consistent with Coulomb’s law and the properties of the constituent ions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas. TOPIC 2.4 Structure of Metals and Alloys Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.D Represent a metallic solid and/or alloy using a model to show essential characteristics of the structure and interactions present in the substance. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.) TOPIC 2.5 Lewis Diagrams Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE SAP-4.A Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.A.1 Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles. TOPIC 2.6 Resonance and Formal Charge Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.B Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram that accounts for resonance between equivalent structures or that uses formal charge to select between nonequivalent structures. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons. TOPIC 2.7 VSEPR and Bond Hybridization Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.C Based on the relationship between Lewis diagrams, VSEPR theory, bond orders, and bond polarities: a. Explain structural properties of molecules. b. Explain electron properties of molecules. SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°. X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. X MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY IS RECOMMENDED AS A WAY TO PROVIDE DEEPER INSIGHT INTO BONDING. HOWEVER, THE AP EXAM WILL NEITHER EXPLICITLY ASSESS MOLECULAR ORBITAL DIAGRAMS, FILLING OF MOLECULAR ORBITALS, NOR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BONDING, NONBONDING, AND ANTIBONDING ORBITALS. Rationale: As currently covered in general chemistry college textbooks, molecular orbital theory is limited to homonuclear molecules in the second period. TOPIC 3.1 Intermolecular Forces Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.A Explain the relationship between the chemical structures of molecules and the relative strength of their intermolecular forces when: a. The molecules are of the same chemical species. b. The molecules are of two different chemical species. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule. b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. TOPIC 3.2 Properties of Solids Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.B Explain the relationship among the macroscopic properties of a substance, the particulate-level structure of the substance, and the interactions between these particles. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. TOPIC 3.3 Solids, Liquids, and Gases Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-6 Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas, and their differences are influenced by variances in spacing and motion of the molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-6.A Represent the differences between solid, liquid, and gas phases using a particulatelevel model. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.A Explain the relationship between the macroscopic properties of a sample of gas or mixture of gases using the ideal gas law. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior.

A particulate model. c. A graphical representation. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. TOPIC 3.6 Deviation from Ideal Gas Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.C Explain the relationship among non-ideal behaviors of gases, interparticle forces, and/or volumes. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures TOPIC 3.7 Solutions and Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.A Calculate the number of solute particles, volume, or molarity of solutions. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution TOPIC 3.8 Representations of Solutions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.C Explain the relationship between the solubility of ionic and molecular compounds in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents, and the intermolecular interactions between particles. SPQ-3.C.1 The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture.

TOPIC 3.11 Spectroscopy and the Electromagnetic Spectrum Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.A Explain the relationship between a region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the types of molecular or electronic transitions associated with that region.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.B Explain the properties of an absorbed or emitted photon in relationship to an electronic transition in an atom or molecule. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). TOPIC 3.13 Beer-Lambert Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.C Explain the amount of light absorbed by a solution of molecules or ions in relationship to the concentration, path length, and molar absorptivity. SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. TOPIC 4.1 Introduction for Reactions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.A Identify evidence of chemical and physical changes in matter. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. TOPIC 4.2 Net Ionic Equations Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.B Represent changes in matter with a balanced chemical or net ionic equation: a. For physical changes. b. For given information about the identity of the reactants and/or product. c. For ions in a given chemical reaction. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.D Explain the relationship between macroscopic characteristics and bond interactions for: a. Chemical processes. b. Physical processes. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. TOPIC 4.5 Stoichiometry Required Course Content UNIT 4 ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-4 When a substance changes into a new substance, or when its properties change, no mass is lost or gained. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.A Explain changes in the amounts of reactants and products based on the balanced reaction equation for a chemical process. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.B Identify the equivalence point in a titration based on the amounts of the titrant and analyte, assuming the titration reaction goes to completion. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-2.A Identify a reaction as acidbase, oxidation-reduction, or precipitation. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistry TRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction.

TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species. TRA-2.B.3 When an acid or base ionizes in water, the conjugate acid-base pairs can be identified and their relative strengths compared. X LEWIS ACID-BASE CONCEPTS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-3.B Represent experimental data with a consistent rate law expression. TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order.

TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-4.B Explain the relationship between the rate of an elementary reaction and the frequency, energy, and orientation of molecular collisions. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature.

TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state.

TRA-5.A.1 A reaction mechanism consists of a series of elementary reactions, or steps, that occur in sequence. The components may include reactants, intermediates, products, and catalysts. TRA-5.A.2 The elementary steps when combined should align with the overall balanced equation of a chemical reaction.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-1.A Explain the relationship between the effect of a catalyst on a reaction and changes in the reaction mechanism. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.A Explain the relationship between experimental observations and energy changes associated with a chemical or physical transformation. ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.C Explain the relationship between the transfer of thermal energy and molecular collisions. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. TOPIC 6.4 Heat Capacity and Calorimetry Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.D Calculate the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing heating/ cooling based on the amount of the substance, the heat capacity, and the change in temperature. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. TOPIC 6.5 Energy of Phase Changes Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.E Explain changes in the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a phase transition based on the amount of the substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of the phase transition. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. TOPIC 6.6 Introduction to Enthalpy of Reaction Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.F Calculate the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a chemical reaction in relationship to the amount of the reacting substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of reaction. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. X THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. TOPIC 6.7 Bond Enthalpies Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.A Calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction based on the average bond energies of bonds broken and formed in the reaction. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. TOPIC 6.8 Enthalpy of Formation Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.B Calculate the enthalpy change for a chemical or physical process based on the standard enthalpies of formation. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants TOPIC 6.9 Hess’s Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.C Represent a chemical or physical process as a sequence of steps. ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D Explain the relationship between the enthalpy of a chemical or physical process and the sum of the enthalpies of the individual steps. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. TOPIC 7.1 Introduction to Equilibrium Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-6 Some reactions can occur in both forward and reverse directions, sometimes proceeding in each direction simultaneously. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.A Explain the relationship between the occurrence of a reversible chemical or physical process, and the establishment of equilibrium, to experimental observations. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. TOPIC 7.2 Direction of Reversible Reactions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-6 Some reactions can occur in both forward and reverse directions, sometimes proceeding in each direction simultaneously. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.B Explain the relationship between the direction in which a reversible reaction proceeds and the relative rates of the forward and reverse reactions. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal. TOPIC 7.3 Reaction Quotient and Equilibrium Constant Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.A Represent the reaction quotient Qc p or Q , for a reversible reaction, and the corresponding equilibrium expressions Kc = Qc or K p = Qp . TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. TOPIC 7.4 Calculating the Equilibrium Constant Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.B Calculate Kc or K p based on experimental observations of concentrations or pressures at equilibrium. TRA-7.B.1 Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements of the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium. TOPIC 7.5 Magnitude of the Equilibrium Constant Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.C Explain the relationship between very large or very small values of K and the relative concentrations of chemical species at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all. TOPIC 7.6 Properties of the Equilibrium Constant Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.D Represent a multistep process with an overall equilibrium expression, using the constituent K expressions for each individual reaction. TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed. TRA-7.D.4 Since the expressions for K and Q have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of K also apply to Q. TOPIC 7.7 Calculating Equilibrium Concentrations Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.E Identify the concentrations or partial pressures of chemical species at equilibrium based on the initial conditions and the equilibrium constant. TRA-7.E.1 The concentrations or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial concentrations, and the appropriate K. TOPIC 7.8 Representations of Equilibrium Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.F Represent a system undergoing a reversible reaction with a particulate model. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. TOPIC 7.9 Introduction to Le Châtelier’s Principle Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-8 Systems at equilibrium respond to external stresses to offset the effect of the stress. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.A Identify the response of a system at equilibrium to an external stress, using Le Châtelier\'s principle. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. TOPIC 7.10 Reaction Quotient and Le Châtelier’s Principle Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-8 Systems at equilibrium respond to external stresses to offset the effect of the stress. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.B Explain the relationships between Q, K, and the direction in which a reversible reaction will proceed to reach equilibrium. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality TOPIC 7.11 Introduction to Solubility Equilibria Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.A Calculate the solubility of a salt based on the value of K sp for the salt. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts. TOPIC 7.12 Common-Ion Effect Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.B Identify the solubility of a salt, and/or the value of K sp for the salt, based on the concentration of a common ion already present in solution. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. TOPIC 7.13 pH and Solubility Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.C Identify the qualitative effect of changes in pH on the solubility of a salt. SPQ-5.C.1 The solubility of a salt is pH sensitive when one of the constituent ions is a weak acid or base. These effects can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle. X COMPUTATIONS OF SOLUBILITY AS A TOPIC 7.14 Free Energy of Dissolution Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.D Explain the relationship between the solubility of a salt and changes in the enthalpy and entropy that occur in the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. TOPIC 8.1 Introduction to Acids and Bases Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.A Calculate the values of pH and pOH, based on Kw and the concentration of all species present in a neutral solution of water. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. TOPIC 8.2 pH and pOH of Strong Acids and Bases Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.B Calculate pH and pOH based on concentrations of all species in a solution of a strong acid or a strong base. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. TOPIC 8.3 Weak Acid and Base Equilibria Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.C Explain the relationship among pH, pOH, and concentrations of all species in a solution of a monoprotic weak acid or weak base. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). TOPIC 8.4 Acid-Base Reactions and Buf fers Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.D Explain the relationship among the concentrations of major species in a mixture of weak and strong acids and bases. SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). SAP-9.D.3 When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). TOPIC 8.5 Acid-Base Titrations Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.E Explain results from the titration of a mono- or polyprotic acid or base solution, in relation to the properties of the solution and its components. SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X COMPUTATION OF THE CONCENTRATION Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding. TOPIC 8.6 Molecular Structure of Acids and Bases Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.F Explain the relationship between the strength of an acid or base and the structure of the molecule or ion. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength. TOPIC 8.7 pH and pKa Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.A Explain the relationship between the predominant form of a weak acid or base in solution at a given pH and the pKa of the conjugate acid or the pKb of the conjugate base. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. TOPIC 8.8 Properties of Buf fers Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.B Explain the relationship between the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH and the reactions that occur when an acid or a base is added to a buffered solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. TOPIC 8.9 HendersonHasselbalch Equation Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.C Identify the pH of a buffer solution based on the identity and concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair used to create the buffer. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] HA X X COMPUTATION OF THE CHANGE IN pH TOPIC 8.10 Buffer Capacity Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.D Explain the relationship between the buffer capacity of a solution and the relative concentrations of the conjugate acid and conjugate base components of the solution. SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. TOPIC 9.1 Introduction to Entropy Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.A Identify the sign and relative magnitude of the entropy change associated with chemical or physical processes. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. TOPIC 9.2 Absolute Entropy and Entropy Change Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.B Calculate the entropy change for a chemical or physical process based on the absolute entropies of the species involved in the process. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants TOPIC 9.3 Gibbs Free Energy and Thermodynamic Favorability Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.C Explain whether a physical or chemical process is thermodynamically favored based on an evaluation of ∆Go . ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . ENE-4.C.2 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When for the process, it is said to be ENE-4.C.3 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of as shown in the table below: Symbols favored at: < 0 > 0 < > all T > 0 < 0 > < no T > 0 > 0 > > high T < 0 < 0 < < low T In cases where no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). TOPIC 9.4 Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.D Explain, in terms of kinetics, why a thermodynamically favored reaction might not occur at a measurable rate. ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. TOPIC 9.5 Free Energy and Equilibrium Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.A Explain whether a process is thermodynamically favored using the relationships between K, ΔGo , and T. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). TOPIC 9.6 Coupled Reactions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.B Explain the relationship between external sources of energy or coupled reactions and their ability to drive thermodynamically unfavorable processes. ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. TOPIC 9.7 Galvanic (Voltaic) and Electrolytic Cells Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.A Explain the relationship between the physical components of an electrochemical cell and the overall operational principles of the cell. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. TOPIC 9.8 Cell Potential and Free Energy Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. R LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.B Explain whether an electrochemical cell is thermodynamically favored, based on its standard cell potential and the constituent half-reactions within the cell. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo TOPIC 9.9 Cell Potential Under Nonstandard Conditions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.C Explain the relationship between deviations from standard cell conditions and changes in the cell potential. ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems.

DWM（Desktop Window Manager）— 在Windows Vista及更高版本中用于窗口的合成和渲染。 3. 直接覆盖（Overlays）— 可能创建了一个透明窗口覆盖在目标窗口上以改变其显示效果。 如果 `WindowTop` 使用了这些技术中的任何一种，并导致了类似于图形应用运行的外观，那么显卡或显卡驱动程序可能就会错误地认为应用程序是游戏，并启动相应的模式。这并不意味着 `WindowTop` 在直接操作显卡硬件，而是它所做的操作让显卡驱动误以为是在运行一个图形密集型的应用程序。尤其是如果 `WindowTop` 使用了硬件加速的图形接口（如DirectX或OpenGL），更可能会有这种情况发生。 总之，软件通常是通过系统API与显卡交互，而不是直接在硬件级别上操作显卡。游戏状态提醒很可能是显卡驱动对软件行为的自动反应。"},{"prompt":"我用的win11，请直接告诉我，我想写代码实现类似功能，就是改变目标窗体的颜色，应该怎么办","completion":"在 Windows 11 上，如果你想要编写自己的代码来实现改变目标窗体的颜色，你可以采取以下步骤： 1. **确定目标窗口** 首先，你需要定位到想要改变颜色的窗口。这通常涉及到通过窗口标题或类名来获取窗口句柄（HWND）。在 Windows API 中，可以使用 `FindWindow` 或 `EnumWindows` 等函数来做这件事。 2. **层叠窗口** 如果你打算改变窗口的背景颜色，可以尝试将其设置为层叠窗口（如果它不是层叠窗口的话），并使用 `SetLayeredWindowAttributes` 来应用半透明的颜色层。 3. **子类化窗口** 通过窗口子类化，可以拦截目标窗口的消息，然后处理 `WM_PAINT` 消息以自定义绘制行为。这涉及到用 `SetWindowLongPtr` 或 `SetWindowSubclass` 替换窗口过程函数。 4. **覆盖窗口** 创建一个新的透明窗口，并将其置于目标窗口之上。在这个新窗口中进行绘图，以覆盖原始窗口。这可以使用 Windows GDI 或 GDI+、Direct2D 进行绘图。 以下是使用 Windows API 编写一个简单层叠窗口示例的概述（使用 C 或 C++）： ```cpp #include <windows.h> // 示例函数：将指定的窗口变为层叠窗口并设置颜色和透明度 void SetWindowColorAndTransparency(HWND hWnd, COLORREF color, BYTE alpha) { // 首先，确保窗口拥有 WS_EX_LAYERED 扩展样式 SetWindowLongPtr(hWnd, GWL_EXSTYLE, GetWindowLongPtr(hWnd, GWL_EXSTYLE) | WS_EX_LAYERED); // 设置颜色和透明度 SetLayeredWindowAttributes(hWnd, color, alpha, LWA_COLORKEY | LWA_ALPHA); } // 示例：找到窗口并调用上面的函数 int main() { // 找到目标窦口 HWND hWnd = FindWindow(NULL, L\\"目标窗口标题\\"); if (hWnd) { // 改变窗口颜色为红色，并设置透明度为128 SetWindowColorAndTransparency(hWnd, RGB(255, 0, 0), 128); } return 0; } ``` 编写代码时，需要注意： - 处理层叠窗口可能会改变窗口的可视性和用户交互流程。 - 多数现代应用可能使用 Direct2D 或 DirectX 进行绘制，这可能会影响你尝试改变它们背景颜色的结果。 - 改变其他程序的窗口可能会违反用户隐私和安全准则，应该小心使用，并在自行开发的、或已经获得权限的应用程序中进行测试。 - 更复杂的绘制可能会涉及到处理窗口的重绘消息（`WM_PAINT`），这通常比较高级，需要对 Win32 编程有深入的了解。 最后，始终遵循最佳实践和用户协议，尽量确保你的编程行为是合理和安全的。"},{"prompt":"windowstop修改后的窗口会有变色延迟，这说明他用的什么技术","completion":"如果您注意到了使用 WindowTop 更改窗体颜色时出现的变色延迟，这种现象可能暗示着所采用的实现方式涉及以下几种可能的技术： 1. **图形API**：如果窗口在颜色更改时显示出延迟，可能意味着窗口颜色更改操作是通过图形API（如GDI、GDI+、Direct2D等）在系统的消息循环中进行。此时，窗口的绘制通常受到VSync（垂直同步）的影响，它会同步绘制操作以匹配显示器的刷新率，这可能带来一定的延迟。 2. **层叠窗口技术**：WindowTop 可能使用了层叠窗口技术来使窗口具备透明度和色彩效果。`SetLayeredWindowAttributes` 和 `UpdateLayeredWindow` 是用于操作层叠窗口的API，它们可以改变窗口颜色和透明度。但如果这些操作复杂，或者需要重绘的区域较大，都可能导致感知到的延迟。 3. **外部覆盖窗口**：可能是创建了一个独立的窗口，以透明或半透明的形式进行覆盖在目标窗口之上。如果这个覆盖窗口的绘制或更新没有实时跟随目标窗口的刷新频率，或者受限于其他系统资源，也可能出现延迟。 4. **资源竞争或优化**：如果WindowTop正在执行计算密集型的操作，或者有其他应用程序正在同时竞争系统资源，例如CPU或GPU，这也可能会导致变色操作出现可感知的延迟。此外，软件可能会为了性能优化而故意增加延迟，防止频繁的更新操作对系统性能造成影响。 5. **Hooking 或消息截取技术**：如果WindowTop 使用了钩子（hooking）或其他消息截取技术来监听窗口过程，然后在正确的时机插入自己的绘制逻辑，此过程的响应时间也可能导致延迟。 正因为存在多种可能性，没有具体的技术细节或代码，很难断定WindowTop 用的是哪一种技术。由于延迟可能是由多种因素叠加造成，解决这种问题通常需要在底层窗口管理和图形处理上进行调整和优化。如果真的需要深入了解WindowTop 的实现方式，联系其开发者或查看其文档（如果可用）可能是获取确切信息的最好方式。"},{"prompt":"请给出完整的代码示例，win11如何最简单的方式修改目标窗体的全部颜色，包括字体颜色，背景颜色","completion":"在 Windows 11 中，对于非自身创建的窗口，要实现对目标窗体（包括字体和背景颜色）的修改是相当复杂的，通常这需要深入到每个应用程序的渲染机制中去。对于大多数应用程序，这涉及到系统级的编程，并且如果没有应用程序提供接口或支持，修改字体颜色和背景色几乎是不可能的。 对于自己创建的窗口，可以在创建时指定颜色。但是，对于已经运行的其他程序，要修改它的界面，由于涉及到不同程序的内部实现，通常需要具体程序提供的主题或皮肤支持。以下的解决方案基于系统API，并且主要用于自身应用程序开发中： 1. 如果程序是基于Win32 API，可以在用 `CreateWindow` 创建窗口时，用 `WM_CTLCOLORxx` 消息来自定义控件颜色。示例如下： ```cpp LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProcedure(HWND hwnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) { switch (message) { case WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC: { HDC hdcStatic = (HDC) wParam; SetTextColor(hdcStatic, RGB(255, 255, 255)); // 白色字体 SetBkMode(hdcStatic, TRANSPARENT); return (LRESULT)GetStockObject(NULL_BRUSH); // 设置背景为透明 } // 其他案例... } return DefWindowProc(hwnd, message, wParam, lParam); } ``` 2. 使用层叠窗口技术，无法改变现有窗口内容的颜色，只能为窗口添加透明度或HSB色调调整。 3. 对于用 .NET 开发的应用程序，可以在窗口或控件中设置 `BackColor` 和 `ForeColor` 属性来控制背景和字体颜色。前提是需要在控件的事件处理中进行设置。 对于希望修改其他程序的外观，实际上您需要的是系统级的主题或者皮肤引擎，比如经典的 WindowBlinds，或者甚至进行hook其他应用程序的渲染函数（非常高级且有风险的操作）。这些工具和方法经常需要深入了解底层API，并且有可能对操作系统的稳定性和软件的正常运行造成影响。 可行性： - **字体颜色**：不同的应用程序使用不同的方法来渲染文本，除非应用提供了接口，否则很难统一改变。 - **背景颜色**：某些应用可能不遵循标准Win32背景颜色设置，尤其是更现代的、用UWP或其他框架构建的应用。 综上所述，没有简单、通用的方法可以改变所有运行中程序的字体和背景颜色，除非这些程序提供了主题或配置选项，或者操作系统支持主题切换。如果要尝试类似 WindowTop 那样修改其他程序的外观，可能需要进行复杂的系统编程，并且具有一定的风险。"},{"prompt":"层叠窗口技术是什么意思，我有目标窗体的pid，就可以修改窗体的颜色吗","completion":"层叠窗口技术（Layered Windows）是Windows操作系统中的一项功能，它允许您创建可以拥有透明或半透明效果的窗口。通过层叠窗口技术，开发者可以给窗口设置透明度（alpha值）或在窗口上应用颜色键（color keying），这在创建自定义窗口形状或淡入淡出动画效果时非常有用。 使用层叠窗口，您可以对窗口进行如下操作： - 设置窗口的整体透明度。 - 指定一个颜色作为“透明色”，任何这种颜色的像素都将显示为透明。 - 使用图像掩码（mask）来定义窗口可以显示的区域。 在Windows API中，可以使用以下函数来设置窗口为层叠窗口或改变它的层叠属性： - `SetWindowLongPtr`：使用此函数给窗口设置 `WS_EX_LAYERED` 扩展样式，来将一个窗口标记为层叠窗口。 - `SetLayeredWindowAttributes`：设置层叠窗口的透明度和透明色。 - `UpdateLayeredWindow`：使用位图更新层叠窗口的视觉效果，提供更多控制，比如可以利用`AlphaBlend`函数来混合图像。 仅仅拥有窗体的进程ID（PID）并不足以修改窗口的颜色，您还需要获得该窗体的窗口句柄（HWND）。进程ID帮助您确定是哪个进程，但是您需要窗口句柄来操作特定的窗体。 如果您成功获取了窗口句柄，就可以尝试对它应用层叠窗口技术。但是，一般来说，您不能直接改变另一个进程创建的窗口的颜色。因为它涉及到该进程的私有信息，设置层叠窗口的样式和属性会受到多种安全和权限的限制。 对于系统安全和避免干预其他程序的正常工作，最好不要修改不属于您自己程序创建的窗口。如果确实需要进行这类操作，建议您仔细研究相关的API，确保您拥有必要的权限，并且理解这样做可能带来的后果。 请注意，改变其他进程的窗体是一个高级的编程活动，可能会对用户的体验或系统的稳定性产生负面影响，应当谨慎处理。如果不熟悉Windows编程，修改其他应用程序的窗口颜色和透明度可能会比较困难，并且通常不被推荐。"},{"prompt":"如何获取窗口句柄","completion":"获取窗口句柄（HWND）通常涉及到使用Windows API中的一些函数。以下是几种常见的获取HWND的方法： 1. **使用进程ID (PID)：** 如果你已知窗口所属的进程ID，可以枚举该进程的所有顶级窗口： ```cpp BOOL CALLBACK EnumWindowsProc(HWND hwnd, LPARAM lParam) { DWORD processId; GetWindowThreadProcessId(hwnd, &processId); if (processId == (DWORD) lParam) { // 找到与PID匹配的窗口句柄 // 你可以在这里做些什么，比如：存储到一个列表或直接使用 // ... } return TRUE; // 继续枚举窗口 } // 在某个地方调用 EnumWindows 来开始枚举： EnumWindows(EnumWindowsProc, (LPARAM)targetProcessId); ``` 2. **通过窗口标题获取HWND：** 如果你知道窗口的确切标题，可以直接使用 `FindWindow` 函数： ```cpp HWND hwnd = FindWindow(NULL, L\\"窗口标题\\"); ``` 请注意，如果多个窗口具有相同的标题，`FindWindow` 将只返回第一个找到的窗口句柄。 3. **通过类名和窗口标题组合获取：** 如果你同时知道类名和窗口标题，`FindWindow` 函数也可以使用这两个参数来精确查找： ```cpp HWND hwnd = FindWindow(L\\"窗口类名\\", L\\"窗口标题\\"); ``` 4. **使用窗口的部分标题：** 如果无法确定窗口的确切标题，可以结合 `EnumWindows` 和字符串匹配函数，如 `StrStr`（需要引入 `shlwapi.h` 和链接 `Shlwapi.lib`）： ```cpp BOOL CALLBACK EnumWindowsProc(HWND hwnd, LPARAM lParam) { TCHAR title[256]; GetWindowText(hwnd, title, sizeof(title)/sizeof(TCHAR)); if (StrStr(title, L\\"部分标题\\")) { // 找到了窗口！ // 保存或使用hwnd // ... } return TRUE; } EnumWindows(EnumWindowsProc, 0); ``` 上面提到的方法都是在C++中使用Win32 API的例子，如果你使用其他编程语言或工具，可能需要查找特定于该语言或工具的函数和库，但基本思路一致。例如，在使用C#时，你可能会使用P/Invoke来调用这些API函数。 请记住，在使用这些方法时，如果目标窗口属于其他程序，可能需要特定的权限，例如管理员权限，而修改其他程序的窗口可能会违反用户协议或带来安全风险。因此，请谨慎行事并确保您对潜在的后果有充分的认识。"}]'),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"search-container"},L={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},x=["disabled"],B={key:0},q={key:1};function z(n,e,l,m,o,r){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",O,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",L,[(a(!0),i(v,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,f)=>(a(),E(p,{key:f,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
