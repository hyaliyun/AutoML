An answer key should be provided.","completion":"1. What was the significance of Sherman's March to the Sea? a. It managed to relieve trapped Union forces. b. It provided Lincoln with a pretense to invade Mexico. c. It greatly improved the supply situation for embattled Union forces. d. It caused significant damage to the Confederacy's economy and infrastructure, hastening the end of the war. 2. Why did Lincoln have a falling out with General McClellan? a. General McClellan was a Democrat, and Lincoln was a Republican. b. Lincoln was prejudiced against Catholic Americans. c. General McClellan regularly ignored Lincoln's orders and was seen as insubordinate to Lincoln.

General Grant and General McClellan despised each other, and Grant poisoned Lincoln's views of the latter. 3. Why did the South make diplomatic overtures with the British Empire? a. Britain was a major importer of Confederate cotton. As a major industrial power, Britain could tip the balance against the numerically and economically superior North. b. Britain supported the slave trade and was ideologically aligned with the South. c. Jefferson Davis had an illegitimate child with Queen Victoria. d. The Confederacy was a major importer of British pewter, and this economic relationship was viewed as critical to the British economy.

JOHN: Fascinating, Samantha. Now is it just street dogs, or do these dogs have owners as well?

Join loyalty programs. Oftentimes, people shop at the same places for regular purchases. An example is shopping at the same grocery store every week. If you are doing this, determining whether the places you shop have loyalty programs that reward consistent customers is well worth your time. These loyalty programs will allow you to gain rewards for future shops. In the long run, this can save you lots of money. If your grocery store doesn't offer a loyalty program, it's worth checking the closest one that does. Weighing up the cost of extra fuel and time to get there will help you to decide if it's worth trying somewhere new. 2. Use cash-back credit cards. If you are responsible with money and do not have problems paying off credit cards, look into getting a high cashback credit card. Like loyalty programs, this will help you get extra rewards for simply doing what you are already doing. Extra money with minimal extra work is always good when trying to save money. Often times you will receive cashback on just about anything, so using your cash-back card for all your purchases and then paying the balance straight off could lead to great returns over a long period. It is essential to remember to pay off your card as the interest you gain through not doing so will likely exceed your cash-back, leaving you worse off. 3. Cancel subscriptions you are not using. Check your monthly outgoings and see if there are any subscriptions you are not using. If you find any, it would be best off to cancel them. This will mean a monthly bill is removed, which is excellent as these monthly bills can add up to a lot over time. The quicker you cancel, the faster you save. Many TV or Telephone will even offer a lower rate to customers considering leaving. This means that contacting and informing them of your plans to leave could mean they offer you a significant discount to stay. Doing this yearly can really help to keep your bills down in the long run. There is no harm in saying you will leave unless your bills go down. They can only say no. 4. DIY where possible. Doing DIY instead of hiring a tradesman can really save you a lot of money. These days it couldn't be easier to find tutorials and how-to videos online for most DIY projects. Ensure you watch these videos before purchasing any materials or tools to ensure you are confident in completing the task to a high standard. If you have a lot of time on your hands, this is one of the best ways to save money as you also learn a valuable skill that you can use as a second income. DIY doesn't just mean working at home, though. It can even mean taking your own coffee or lunch at home instead of buying it out for a higher price. 5. Set up automatic payments for bills. Life is tough, and it's hard to remember everything. You shouldn't be charged fees when you forget to pay a bill. But unfortunately, late fees are a fact of life, and sometimes they can damage your bank balance. By setting up automatic payments for your bills, you can ensure you never get charged late fees or accrue interest on any account you may have. An added bonus is that this will save you time meaning you have more to make money."},{"prompt":"Write a short blurb for the back of a novel titled, \\"Marauders of the Golden Coast,\\" by Arthur Novleest.

Tone should be appropriate for a kid. Remove mentions of anxiety and depression so as not to scare them. Deciding if a child has ADHD is a process with several steps. This page gives you an overview of how ADHD is diagnosed. There is no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, like sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and certain types of learning disabilities, can have similar symptoms. If you are concerned about whether a child might have ADHD, the first step is to talk with a healthcare provider to find out if the symptoms fit the diagnosis. The diagnosis can be made by a mental health professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, or by a primary care provider, like a pediatrician. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that healthcare providers ask parents, teachers, and other adults who care for the child about the child’s behavior in different settings, like at home, school, or with peers. Read more about the recommendations. The healthcare provider should also determine whether the child has another condition that can either explain the symptoms better, or that occurs at the same time as ADHD. Read more about other concerns and conditions.","completion":"Finding out if you have ADHD means a doctor has to go through several steps. There's no one test that can tell us if you have ADHD, and some other things look the same as ADHD—like sleep disorders!

You can ask your parents what they think too. The doctor might also want to speak to your parents or even your school teacher, so he or she can get to know a bit more about you.

When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan on December 29, 1979, the bold action to boycott such a popular sporting event was supported throughout the committee. Advisors to the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev claimed that U.S. President Jimmy Carter was too concerned with the ongoing hostage crisis to respond to the situation in Kabul. However, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan extended the conflict in Central Asia and President Carter reacted with measures that were meant to put pressure on the Soviets to withdraw."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this paragraph in 5 sentences that paint a vivid and enchanting picture.

When the British exiled him to the Seychelles in 1896, along with the King of Asante Prempeh I and other members of the Asante government, Yaa Asantewaa became regent of the Ejisu–Juaben district. After the exile of Prempeh I, the British governor-general of the Gold Coast, Frederick Hodgson, demanded the Golden Stool, the symbol of the Asante nation.[2] This request led to a secret meeting of the remaining members of the Asante government at Kumasi, to discuss how to secure the return of their king.","completion":"In the era of her brother's reign, Yaa Asantewaa witnessed the Ashanti Confederacy's tumultuous journey through perilous times, engulfed in the throes of civil war that swept across 1883 to 1888. As destiny unfolded its tapestry, and her brother's departure left a void, Yaa Asantewaa, invoking her authority as Queen Mother, bestowed the honor of Ejisuhene upon her grandson. Alas, the British, in their imperial decree, banished him to the distant shores of Seychelles in 1896, alongside King Prempeh I and Asante government dignitaries. Yaa Asantewaa took over control and became the regent of the Ejusi-Juaben realm.

Do you know what airplane this is? Can you give me at least some basic info about it?","completion":"I believe the aircraft you saw is the Scaled Composites Model 281 “Proteus.” It is a one-of-a-kind plane designed by world-renowned aeronautical engineer, Burt Rutan. The Proteus first flew in 1998. Its intended purpose was to carry high-altitude, long-operation (HALO) telecommunication equipment. Essentially, it was supposed to be an alternative to orbital satellites. The long, thin wings and extremely lightweight airframe were designed for long-lasting missions at high altitudes. The plane can loiter for around 14 hours, so the engineers also built in a capability for it to be operated remotely or even sent off independently on preprogrammed missions. At the time, such capabilities were rare, especially in civil aviation. Th HALO telecom project did not pan out, but the single completed Proteus was successful, so Scaled Composites began contracting it with NASA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the US Department of Defense, and private companies. The Proteus is one of the only aircraft on earth that can carry an external payload up to 60,000 feet altitude, so it is a very valuable research tool."},{"prompt":"Who played Erik, The Phantom in the 2004 film version of Phantom of the Opera?","completion":"Erik, The Phantom was portrayed by Gerard Butler in the 2004 film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera."},{"prompt":"Invent a character who has the power to time-travel, and write a short story about their adventures and the lessons they learn along the way.

My target audience is American and I have twitter blue so large limit on characters.","completion":"Tweet 1- With no employment benefits, it should be at the forefront of a freelancer's mind to spend time planning for retirement. An emergency fund, however, is more important. With irregular income and fallow work periods, having an emergency fund in place can help reduce stress and provide financial security. With the present day protected, you can feel at ease when planning for the future. Tweet 2- As a freelancer, you are responsible for your own tax payments. Setting aside monthly income in a separate account can help you avoid being caught out and owing a large sum. Freelancers should work out their tax rates and be aware that a self-employment tax of 15% is also charged in the USA. Remember, as a freelancer, you should pay your tax quarterly to avoid underpayment fees. Tweet 3- Traditional or Roth IRA? Which is best for freelancers? Well, that depends on what your circumstances are. The main difference is that a Roth IRA is not taxable upon withdrawal; however, your contributions are not tax deductible. With a traditional IRA, you will be taxed upon withdrawal; however, you may benefit from tax deductions for contributions. You could open both accounts, but be sure to keep total contributions below the IRS's annual limit of 6,500. Tweet 4- Freelancers, open a SEP IRA! The SEP IRA is tailored for business owners or the self-employed. It allows tax-deductible contributions of up to 66,000 or 25% of income, whichever is smallest. This is an excellent option for freelancers who have maxed out Roth or traditional IRA contributions. Tweet 5- I've maxed out my contributions. What should I do? This is a familiar question I get, and the answer is simple. If you have exhausted your retirement planning options with IRA, invest with a taxable brokerage account. With no contribution limits, the only downside is the tax you will pay on capital gains. The current rate for capital gains tax depends on your income but ranges from 0-20%."},{"prompt":"Please write an anime synopsis for a story about a girl who is a model student with her twin's personality inhabiting her body as well.

In addition to this, she is beautiful and well-endowed. She's the envy of both the boys and the girls. However, she had a secret that she could not tell anyone. Minataka has another person inhabiting her body. It isn't a split personality, but her twin sister. Her twin sister, Minataka Moka, is an energetic, dedicated girl. She lacks the sharp, calculating mind of Sayuri. However, she makes up for this with her physical prowess. While Sayuri is powerful in her own right, her sister has special powers that allow her to break the limitations of the human body. They trained Sayuri's body together to be able to withstand the strain of some of Moka's strength. These sisters are hunting down the entity that killed Moka and caused her to enter Sayuri in the first place. They dive into the world of monsters and ghosts and spiritual entities in search of answers, fighting and warding off evil in the process. They are known as mediators, and they are one of the most powerful mediators out there. When they pick up the trail of the one they've been hunting, things take a dark turn as the nature of reality unravels before their eyes. Can they protect reality and regain their own bodies? What is the dark secret hidden behind their condition? And what is the Grand Mediator hiding from them?"},{"prompt":"Draft an engaging op-ed piece that calls for stricter regulations on the use of social media platforms, highlighting the potential risks associated with unregulated online spaces and advocating for greater user privacy protection and content moderation to ensure a safer digital environment.","completion":"Stricter Regulations Needed for Social Media to Ensuring Privacy Protection and a Safer Digital Environment Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube have come under fire for enabling the rapid spread of misinformation, hate speech, and climate denialism. While many countries have implemented regulations to govern content moderation, the United States has relied on platforms' self-regulation. However, the real-world consequences of unregulated social media demand a more robust approach. Instances such as attacks on ethnic minorities in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, fueled by misinformation on Facebook, highlight the need for stricter content moderation. Similarly, false claims about the 2020 presidential election and Covid-19 vaccines circulating on social media platforms have had significant offline consequences, including the Capitol insurrection and increased anti-Asian harassment. While social media companies have taken voluntary actions to address these issues, their efforts could be more consistent and effective. Government regulation is necessary to ensure consistent and compelling content moderation. However, striking a balance between protecting freedom of expression and curbing harmful content poses challenges. Determining what constitutes unacceptable speech without infringing on free expression and defining who should be responsible for content moderation are complex tasks. Social media platforms differ from traditional media companies as they primarily host user-generated content and have limited editorial oversight. The US Communications Decency Act, particularly Section 230, shields social media companies from liability for user-generated content. However, removing these protections could hinder innovation and discourage content moderation. Collaboration between lawmakers, social media companies, and experts is essential. Federal courts can establish exceptions to Section 230 to guide content moderation. Lawmakers could also set transparency standards and digital privacy requirements for platforms to maintain protection. Adapting our laws to the digital age will foster a safer online environment while balancing freedom of expression and the public interest. Stricter regulations are needed to address the risks associated with unregulated social media platforms. We can mitigate the harmful effects of misinformation and hate speech by ensuring stronger content moderation, protecting user privacy, and fostering a safer digital environment. Collaborative efforts are required to strike a balance between freedom of expression and the need for responsible online spaces."},{"prompt":"I have a question about making tea.","completion":"What is your exact question?"},{"prompt":"I need to know how to make a cup of tea.

It is comprised of five sections which combine to present a bleak picture of the landscape and history of the contemporary world. This poem has a rich array of voices which includes numerous references from diverse literary and cultural sources such as Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, and more. Eliot began work on the poem in 1914 and completed it in 1919 after a breakdown caused by his father's death. The poem has largely been read as a comment on the bleakness of post-war Europe, and the pervasive metaphor of dryness is read as a metaphor for spiritual emptiness."},{"prompt":"Sort this list of animals into 2 categories, insects or reptiles. 1.

Write the article from the perspective of Josephine Cochran, who invented one of the first dishwashers.","completion":"Well, my grandfather was an inventor, so I guess you could say that inventing is in our blood. I figured, if no one else was going to invent a dishwashing machine, I guess I'd have to do it myself. But I'm getting ahead of myself. I'll start at the beginning. In 1850, a man named Joel Houghton patented a wooden machine with a hand-turned wheel that splashed water on the dishes. Joel made a great effort, but every housewife knows that gently splashing water on dishes is not enough to get them clean. Then, in the 1860s, a man named L.A. Alexander invented a machine that allowed a user to spin dishes on racks through a tub of water. A mild improvement, maybe, but still not enough to get the job done. Meanwhile, I married William Cochran in 1858. The next years were a wild ride as William became a very wealthy merchant of dry goods and a politician in the Democratic Party. In 1870, we moved into a mansion! At one of our dinner parties, the servants chipped a few of our heirloom china dishes, and I was fed up. I knew there had to be some kind of alternative. Plus, I remembered what it felt like to wash dishes for hours every day as a housewife - and I didn't want one more woman to have to waste her time standing at the sink. I had a few ideas for a dishwashing machine, but I wasn't motivated to take them further until my dear William died in 1883. He was a man troubled by the drink, and he left me with numerous unpaid debts. I had to figure out how to continue on and find a way to support my family. I finished designing my dishwasher model and received a patent in December 1886. My dishwasher is the first one that uses water pressure instead of scrubbers to clean the dishes. I unveiled the design at the World's Fair in 1893. I thought housewives would jump at the chance to purchase one, but it ended up being restaurants and hotels that bought my invention. I started a company to build my manually operated dishwasher, and later on, it became a brand that you've probably heard of - KitchenAid."},{"prompt":"What was the Ilyushin II-103, the first Russian aircraft to achieve?

I’d like to make everything awesome for my son, so I want to design a spaceship for him that’s completely unique. I think I know the general shape of spaceship he’d like, but can you give me pointers on techniques or features that would make it a good fit for a 6-year-old?","completion":"- Try to make your construction very structurally sound. Unless there’s no other way, always try to connect parts and features to the larger structure at multiple points. That way they don’t easily pop off if your child drops it or brings the spaceship in for a hard landing. Your physical bricks will be helpful in testing this out; it’s hard to evaluate the structural stability of a digital Lego model. - Create play features. The Lego company consistently cites play features as their test-audiences’ favorite aspects. There are lots of great options on fictional spaceships. Try an opening cockpit and a separate opening cargo bay. If it’s large enough, consider a module that separates to become a ground vehicle or which opens up as a garage for a rover. If there’s enough volume, create a playable interior for the pilot, complete with a bed, kitchen, laboratory, etc. Or take a page out of old Lego designs and construct the ship as a series of detachable modules that can be mixed and matched. Play features are limited only by your imagination and available parts. - Consider the way your child may view certain features. Antennas may become laser guns or missiles. A minor round detail could be a refueling port or an oxygen recharging station. He may choose to tuck his favorite Lego dog into a bit of unused space in the design. Don’t be afraid to add detailing that doesn’t clearly serve a purpose to you but that could be assigned a function in your child’s imagination. - If possible, work with a consistent color palate. This isn’t a must, of course, and often depends on part availability, but it can be a nice touch that makes your creation seem professional. It will look like it belongs in the same universe as the official Space Police and Blacktron sets. Plus, if you can work in your child’s favorite colors, you’ll likely score extra points."},{"prompt":"I'm looking for a cat because I'm allergic to dogs and I'm not allowed to have a dog in my apartment.

When a local dog who belonged to nobody but was a friend to all went missing, the town's scrutinous eye turned to old man Jeb. It was much more likely that the dog's lifestyle had finally caught up with him, but it was easier for the town to pretend as though Jeb had done something to him. \\"He never liked that dog,\\" they would lie. One day, a group of rowdy teens were wandering by the workshop where Jeb lived and dared each other to go inside. One accepted the challenge and, in a moment of utter stupidity, kicked the door open to reveal Jeb hard at work running a wood plane over a table that was not quite finished yet. Looking around, the teen saw that the room was littered with tables and chairs of various sizes. Jeb was building them for families in need. Growing up, he'd never had the luxury of a simple table or chairs, so his family had sat on the floor. He wasn't the best at carpentry, but he'd dedicated most of his retired years to building sturdy tables and chairs that he donated to a local charitable organization. His craftsmanship was proudly displayed in homes around the state, a welcome gift for struggling families. Of course, that explanation simply wouldn't do for the townsfolk, who had already painted old Jeb as a villain—and a villain he must stay. After the break-in, Jeb roared at the teen to leave, infuriated by the breach of privacy. The teen would later report that the tables were for cutting up the bodies of Jeb's victims, and from that day on, Jeb was inundated with curious onlookers peering through his windows.

Yuengling experienced an increase in sales after a renewed interest in history due to the United States Bicentennial in 1976.[5] Yuengling bought the rights to use the Mount Carbon (Bavarian Premium Beer) name and label when Mount Carbon Brewery went out of business in 1977. Yuengling initially brewed beer at Mount Carbon but eventually abandoned it. The dairy remained in business until 1985. Richard L.

The two spiders became fond of each other and after a couple of months, Priscilla and her mate were going to have babies. Priscilla always wanted to be a mom. She got the nest all ready for her babies. She made sure the webs were all nice and cozy for them and spent every day close to her egg sac. She would sometimes forget to eat, so her mate would bring her some food. The day finally came, and the babies were ready to come out. The egg sac burst open, and lots of little spider babies emerged. Priscilla looked in her egg sac to make sure that all the babies made it out and there was one little one that did not make it. She tried to nudge the baby, but it wouldn’t move. Priscilla was so upset that one of her babies did not make it. She became very lethargic; she stopped eating and would not drink any water. Amanda became concerned and tried to hand-feed her some water to keep her hydrated. Priscilla would just stay in the den where the egg sac was with the little baby. Her mate took over the parental duties to help the babies. One morning, Amanda went to check on Priscilla to see if she would eat, and she found Priscilla at the bottom of the cage, lifeless. Amanda was so upset.

It makes foods that have no sugar in them at all taste like they're super sweet. The fruit itself doesn't have much sugar either, so they're great if you're trying to reduce your sugar intake, without losing that sweet flavor. Best of all, it's not habit-forming or permanent at all. It literally washes off your tongue and mouth surfaces with your saliva in a few minutes. So you can just try it out and see if you like it, or just pop one when you feel like tasting something sweet without all the sugar. It's so cool, I think everyone should try it.

How a dishwasher differs from hand washing When you wash your dishes by hand, the water and soap stays still in the bowl or sink and you move the dishes around as you scrub them with a cloth or a brush. In a dishwasher, the opposite happens: the dishes and cutlery stay still in plastic baskets while pressurized jets of hot water shoot all around them. That means a dishwasher has to be sealed shut all the time it's operating or the water would fire off in all directions—all over your kitchen floor! A dishwasher starts its cycle by taking in cold water from a hose connected to the machine. Once a certain amount of water's sitting inside the bottom of the machine, a heating element starts to warm it up. The element is just a thick metal bar that gets hot when an electric current passes through it, and it gradually heats the water during the first part of the wash cycle. An electric pump takes the warming water and forces it up pipes in the side of the machine, which are connected to two spinning paddles. There's one paddle, made of metal, underneath the bottom rack of dishes and another one, made of plastic, under the top rack. When water enters the paddles, it makes them spin around much like garden sprinklers. As the paddles rotate, the water emerges from small holes in their upper surface. The paddles make lots of hot spinning jets of water that fire upward onto your dirty plates. (That's why it's best to arrange your crockery so the dirty surfaces are facing downward.) The bottom rack and the bottom paddle are nearer to the heating element so the water is much hotter in the lower part of the machine. (That's why you'll see some crockery items marked \\"Top rack dishwasher safe\\"—which means it's alright to put them in the upper, cooler part of the machine.) After the water hits your dishes and plates, it falls back to the bottom of the machine, where it's heated up once more by the element and pumped round again for another cycle. Water pumps around the machine for half an hour or so until all the dishes and plates are clean. A sieve at the bottom of the machine catches any large bits of debris (to stop the machine jamming up), while smaller bits (and food remains) simply flush down the drain.","completion":"Highlighting the difference between a dishwasher and handwashing, the article states that unlike washing dishes by hand, a dishwasher employs high-powered jets of hot water to clean stationary dishes and cutlery arranged in baskets. The water is heated by a heating element and circulated up pipes to spinning paddles which produce hot spinning jets to wash the dirty dishes. The water falls back down to the bottom of the machine and is heated again for the subsequent wash cycle. A sieve at the machine's bottom prevents large debris from blocking the device, while smaller food pieces are flushed down the drain."},{"prompt":"In two sentences, tell me the main points from the news article.

Here are four suggestions for yummy meals that you could cook over a campfire, complete with ingredients for shopping and packing convenience. • Cheesy Bacon Garlic Potatoes For this dish, you’ll need aluminum foil packets, two potatoes (cut into wedges) for each person, your favorite shredded cheese (Colby Jack melts the fastest), and bacon crumbles. • Campfire Breakfast Burritos Aluminum foil or a cast iron skillet is required for cooking this dish. You’ll also need pre-scrambled eggs, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, sliced jalapenos, bacon crumbles, cooked sausage crumbles, diced onions, and two tortillas. Make it saucy with a tablespoon or two of your favorite salsas! • Hot Dogs or Sausages with Buns This is a classic campfire meal that’s best roasted with skewers over an open flame. You’ll also need a cast iron skillet to lightly toast the buns. Otherwise, bring a pack of your favorite sausages or hot dogs, a pack of hot dog buns, and your favorite cold toppings, like ketchup, mustard, and relish. • Smash Burger Foil Packets Once known as “hobo” packets, you will need aluminum foil packets for this dish. You’ll also need one uncooked burger patty per person, one potato (cut into medallions) per person, onion slices, bacon strips, salt, and pepper, sliced green peppers, and sliced mushrooms. And for dessert? Smores! Don’t forget the classic combo of graham crackers, chocolate bars, and toasted marshmallows to finish off a night around the campfire."},{"prompt":"Write an dialogue between a father and adult son where the son is questioning the father's ethics in his business endeavors.

Have it be gloomy and focused on his inner dialogue.","completion":"Pit pat pit pat. The rain falls down onto my nylon windbreaker and rolls onto my face. At least it masks the tears. The city is nothing but grey. I can’t tell if it’s me or if it’s actually like that. I’m walking along the Schuylkill River trail. I look to my left and see the rain crashing into the river. I stare at it for a bit, absorbing and taking in how the raindrops each create little ripples that bounce off each other as they land. Much like how we humans bounce around the endless expanse, bumping into each and uniting, only to leave each other with no notice. I hate how that can happen, one day you cross ripples and you’re together, you’re happy, and you’re sharing cheesecake. The next she’s rippling off into the expanse with all of her stuff and you’re stuck paying full rent on an apartment you agreed to split despite only having your name on the lease. Then you struggle to find a way to make that money, so in an attempt to take your mind off the turmoil, you go on a walk, even though it’s pouring rain. But it just makes you think about it all more. The clouds cover the buildings, I see the tower that is the Comcast building, but not the top. The light peers through the clouds, reminding me it’s still there, just hidden for the day. I continue walking north towards the art museum. We had our first date at the art museum. I need to stop thinking about her. I can’t walk toward the art museum, instead, I get off the trail and head east toward Broad Street. I wonder if anything is playing at the Kimmel Center? That could be a fun activity. She never did let me see plays once things got serious. Always said we needed the money for other things. Am I just doing this to spite her? Regardless, I need something to do. Something that doesn’t remind me of her. But I wonder if that’s even possible? She’s everywhere. Whatever. I’ll just take it as it comes."},{"prompt":"Write an idea about a new show.

In return, they will pay you over time with interest. The disadvantage of Bonds is that if a company goes bankrupt, your bond might not be paid back. It’s also a fixed price. When you buy a bond, you get that amount back and a fixed set of simple interest. An advantage of bonds is that they’re a safe option if you know the company is going to succeed. You won’t have to worry about fluctuating prices. You can also wait until the bond ends to claim all the money. Some types of bonds include corporate bonds. These bonds allow more credibility and allow less risk than others. High-yield bonds have lower credibility but will get you a higher return.

As he splashed into the river and got washed around by the powerful stream he had one goal in mind. All he had to do was get to the other side. He swam, flapped his legs, and fought against the vicious stream until he could reach the other side of the river. He made it. Once he pulled himself onto the other side of the shore he searched for the rest of his family. Terry began to cry. None of them had made it across."},{"prompt":"How is Parmigiano Reggiano made?

These ingredients include salt, milk, and rennet which are combined in a particular process starting with heating the milk and adding in the rennet slowly to coagulate and form curds. These curds are then taken and broken down into small pieces and processed so they form into a single piece which is then formed into wheels and dunked in a saltwater brine. After the wheels are dunked they must be aged for at least 12 months. This cheese comes with quite a few regulations as the cows that produce the milk can only be fed locally foraged greens, grass, and hay. It can also not be sold as Parmigiano Reggiano until it passes a rigorous testing procedure. The area in which it is produced is also highly regulated as it can only be made in 5 Italian Provinces where Parmigiano Reggiano has been produced for nearly 1000 years."},{"prompt":"What type of recipe would this most likely be?

So, the thing is that I need a character to get from location A to location B in as convoluted of a way as is feasibly possible. I'd like for you to give me three different ways I can make it super tedious to get from the bottom of a mountain to the top, so just climbing it is not an option. Also, this is sci-fi, so it can have some machines or something as part of the plot/a reason for it to be so hard to get up the mountain.","completion":"That sounds like an interesting book! Here are three possible ways for your character to accomplish this: 1. This side of the mountain is too steep to climb, so the character has to go all the way around the mountain to the other side to climb it. However, the other side of the mountain is owned by a different country, which doesn't allow just anyone to enter their borders. You first have to go through all their health tests and prove you are trained in an occupation that they need. The character is not trained in anything that the country is looking for, so he has to create a device that will trick them, pass their tests, and then allow him to climb the mountain on their side. 2. There is a device that can take people up to the top of the mountain, but it is broken. It is too steep to go up the mountain without that, so the character has to track down the person who can fix it. This person is currently fixing a similar device at another mountain. So, the character has to go to that mountain, only to find the man working at the top part of the device on the top part of the mountain, meaning he has to climb the mountain to get to him or wait at the bottom. He chooses to climb, but the man fixes the device while he does this and comes down the mountain, being at the bottom and having left by the time the character reaches the top. The character then has to go back down the mountain and catch up with the man, who he convinces to help him. However, on getting the man there, it turns out that he needs a very specific part he doesn't have. So, the character then has to go and either get that part or find someone to make it. Maybe the man goes on vacation while the character does this, so then he has to find some old recluse that no one knows where he lives. and eventually convinces him to help. The device gets fixed, and now the character can use it to get to the top of the mountain. 3. The mountain is owned by a tribe of people who don't allow anyone there but their own tribe past a certain point. There is a way to become a member of the tribe, but this takes a lot of work and involves going through a certain number of trials. There could be any number of these, and they include anything from fighting a certain sci-fi animal without weapons, finding a way through a deep and dark cave system and coming out the other side, and so on.

The Grand Palace If there’s one must-see sight in Bangkok, it has to be the magnificent Grand Palace, the capital’s most famous landmark and one of the world’s most frequented tourist attractions, welcoming around eight million tourists annually! From 1782 to 1925, the Grand Palace was the official residence of the Kings of Siam and later, Thailand, with the royal court and administrative seat of government all based here. 2. Bangkok’s Floating Markets Bangkok’s numerous floating markets have long been among the city’s star attractions. Although nowadays most function as tourist magnets and community gathering places, rather than vital components of local economies, they still present a visual feast for the senses and immersion into a Thai traditional way of life, when Bangkok was known as the ‘Venice of the East.’ Floating markets also offer visitors a fun way to shop and eat, while interacting with locals, plus a chance to explore the network of canals (khlongs) and stilt-house communities. 3. Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, Chiang Mai Nestled in Thailand’s mountainous north, Chiang Mai is a popular tourist hotspot for many reasons – one of which is its multitude of historic Buddhist wats (temples). Your absolute must-see temple, however, is Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, which rests atop Doi Suthep Mountain, a dominating presence on Chiang Mai’s horizon. 4. Chiang Mai Night Markets Night markets and bazaars are also a big attraction in Chiang Mai and an essential Thai travel experience, offering a more interesting retail experience than elsewhere in the country. Many market stalls specialize in authentic handicrafts, silverware, ethnic attire and souvenirs, hand-made by the local hill tribes and distinctive of this northern region. You also get the chance to sample cheap and tasty northern Thai delicacies (some of the nation’s best) and soak up the buzzy, carnival-like atmosphere. 5. Sukhothai Old City Located in north-central Thailand, just outside the modern-day city of the same name, Sukhothai Old City is the ancient capital of the first Siamese Kingdom and the birthplace of Thai art, architecture and language. During its golden era, around the 13th and 14th centuries, Sukhothai even rivaled the mighty Khmer Angkor empire. 6. Ayutthaya For history buffs alike, Ayutthaya, the second capital of Old Siam, offers a fascinating peek into the glory days of a once mighty Siamese Kingdom that dates back to the 14th century. Once one of Asia’s most powerful cities, Ayutthaya was a flourishing center for regional trade where art and culture merged and by the early 18th century, was one of the world’s largest cities with an estimated one million inhabitants.\\"","completion":"Day 1: Bangkok Morning: Visit the Grand Palace: Explore the stunning architecture and historical significance of this iconic landmark.

I went into this childhood favourite fully expecting it to not have aged particularly well, but it surprisingly did. CGI animals aside, it has a great 90's aesthetic reminiscent of films like Home Alone, a great score and amazing performances by most of the cast, especially the main man Robin Williams. What surprised me the most however, is how surprisingly terrifying it is, especially compared to the newer \\"sequels\\" (which are decent films but hold no candle to the original). What separates the newer films from the original? My biggest gripe with the newer films is that they seem relatively inconsequential to the real world as opposed to the original. In the 95' film with every turn the players risk destruction, their lives, everything basically. There are real stakes and great tension since you know that by rolling the dice, they put themselves and the others in further danger. Their house gets absolutely destroyed, overgrown with vegetation and killer plants and hell, the whole town becomes a mess due to the wild animals and gigantic mosquitos sending people to the hospital. The story feels incredibly personal because every character has their baggage, Bonnie Hunt treated as a crazy person for 26 years and having PTSD to the day they first played the game, the kids having their parents die 6 months earlier and Robin Williams obviously disappearing into the jungle as a kid and having to survive by himself for 26 years. The villain being played by Alan's father is also genius, since he is a person he seems to fear a lot before realizing he has to confront him as he confronted all of his fears by the end of the film. Maybe I'm overthinking it but imo it's one of the best and most terrifying family adventure films out there.","completion":"Jumanji is a movie that you can watch again and again and you will always like it. The way it looks is like other movies that were made in the 1990s, like Home Alone. There's great music in it and the actors all do a great job, especially the lead actor whose name is Robin Williams. In some ways, though, the movie can be a bit scary. Newer films are different from the older films, like Jumanji. It seems like, in the newer films, the people in them are not affected by real-world problems. In the film from 1995, there are risks that the characters take that could affect their lives and everything else. The characters seem to worry more because they are facing dangers. Their house is not doing well. Same for the whole town. All because of the wild animals. Sometimes it feels like the story is happening to me when I watch the film. Bonnie Hunt is treated in not a very nice way for a long time, like 26 years, and she is really affected by playing the game. The kids are not with their parents and Robin Williams kind of grows up in the jungle by himself for 26 years. There's a bad guy in the film who is played by Alan's father. He is a person that seems to be afraid a lot. But he has to face his fears in the end. I think that maybe I'm thinking about this movie too much.

Ensure that during the onboarding process, these roles and responsibilities are well explained and detailed to avoid this kind of conflict. 3. Make your company culture well-known to all. Does your company embrace individual top performance, or is it fast-paced? Explain in detail and clearly the culture in your company to the employees before they are hired. This will set their expectations right. 4. Hire with diversity. While taking in new employees, consider what their expectations are, and how they perform and fit into your company culture. Don't hire because they fit into your culture, but hire people with diverse opinions to avoid stagnant culture, and build one where innovation is encouraged. 5. Create fun time for the employees. Host up team-building activities and other fun ideas that do away with boredom at work, and get your employee's minds relaxed. This will not only improve their productivity but will help them know their needs are well taken care of."},{"prompt":"I'm having trouble keeping cats out of my vegetable garden. Are there some things I can try that will keep them out but won't harm them?","completion":"Yes, there are many things that will help keep cats from going into your garden without harming them. Here is a list of a few ideas to try: 1. Use texture - cats prefer soft sand or dirt and avoid prickly or rough textures. Try scattering pine cones, mulch, egg shells, or a plastic carpet runner with the points facing up. 2. Use scent - there are many nontoxic scents that are safe for cats but that they do not like. Try adding black or cayenne pepper, coffee grounds, and orange peels, to your garden. Do not use mothballs, as these are extremely toxic. 3. Use water - try using a motion-activated sprinkler. There are some specifically designed to deter animals. 4. Try reverse psychology - you can build a sandbox for cats to use instead of your garden and plant catnip nearby to lure them to a place you'd rather they go besides your garden."},{"prompt":"What company shares should I invest £1,000 in?","completion":"Investment in stocks and shares are subject to market fluctuations and you may get back less than you put in.

They were clad in winter kimonos for the New Year shrine visit. They'd already said their prayers and were taking a rest on the benches with warm drinks in hand.

I want to be there to take care of you when you forget to.\\" Mio looked at him, her usual bubbly smile twisted into a blushing face of disbelief. Her eyes were wide, and she looked away. Rikuto said, \\"You don't have to give me an answer right now--\\" Mio rose and took off, drink abandoned on the benches. \\"Mio-san, wait!\\" Rikuto called out, giving chase. But it was useless. Mio was the ace of the track team. She always had been. She shined brighter than anyone else when destroying the others. Now her feet carried her faster than Rikuto could hope to keep up with. He lost her at some point and stopped, desperately trying to catch his breath. He checked his phone and tried calling her, but that was also pointless. Rikuto sighed and looked up at the clear sky. He called his friend, unsure what to do, and explained the situation. He asked, \\"what does that mean? Was I rejected? She just left without saying anything. What am I supposed to do now?\\" His friend replied, \\"You just have to wait, I think. This was probably very sudden for her. You know Mio-san isn't the kind of person to really think seriously about romance. Maybe she just needs time to think. You'll see her again when school starts back, though she might ignore you.\\" \\"That would be the worst,\\" Rikuto grimaced. \\"Well, You'll just have to keep fighting.

Topics to include are: - The cities I have visited so far: Manchester, Brighton and Birmingham - The British cuisine I've enjoyed so far - An eventful trip to a pub on Friday night","completion":"Hey mom! I hope everything's okay back home. Just thought I'd let you know about everything I've been up to so far on my trip. I'm currently in Birmingham, a bustling city in the heart of England. The people here are super friendly and I've spent the last couple of days indulging myself by going shopping. They have some awesome malls. There's one called the Bullring which has a three-story department store called Selfridges—no, they don't sell fridges haha! But I got a couple of new dresses and tried some amazing desserts in their food hall. Speaking of food, the stereotypes are all wrong. British food is amazing. I could probably eat fish and chips every day if I lived here and never get sick of it. And the fish is huge, like the size of my arm. You have to douse it in lots of vinegar too. It makes it taste even better. I've also had at least 8 full English breakfasts since I've been here (I lost count of the exact number). It's so filling, and the bacon they use here is far superior to the one we get in stores back home. Last night I went to a curry house (they are everywhere here) and tried something called chicken tikka masala. I loved it so much that I'm going to try and replicate it when I get back. It's the perfect mix of creamy and spicy. Oh, and don't freak out, but when I was in Manchester (a quirky, vibrant city in the North) last weekend, I went out to a quaint traditional pub. The locals were so friendly and bought me drinks, and I even did some karaoke. However a couple of guys ended up having too much to drink and it escalated into a little bit of a brawl, they were hitting each other with barstools! I got out of there safe though, so don't worry. I also picked you up a little souvenir when I was in Brighton (a southern beach city). It's a colorful stick of hard candy called \\"rock.\\" Some of them had pretty rude words printed on them which I found funny, but don't worry I got you one that's safe for work!

One-two-three-four, one-two-three-four he tapped, keeping time to an unheard song. He opened his eyes widely, then stood up from his bed and walked to the piano at the other end of the room. Michael could not hear the music, since he was born deaf. The sheet music on the piano might as well have been written in Greek because he had never heard a note in his life let alone knew what sounds they corresponded to on paper. But he was guided by an internal song, a melody that played in his head that manifested itself as toe taps and a renewed effort to match the song to piano keys. Fingers tapped keys as he tried to discern between the vibrations of one key and another. He reasoned that the keys were higher in pitch from the lowest at the left of the keyboard, to the highest at the right. Michael scribbled on his notepad a series of words and other shorthand he invented when he first started his journey into music at 12 years old. Michael dreamed of becoming a professional musician when he attended a concert with his parents where the pianist was playing music (which he could not hear, but could feel as vibrations in his seat). The vibrations were in a specific rhythm that caused Michael to \\"feel\\" the music as it was playing, and it subsequently filled his mind with many pictures and colors; he wanted to mimic that feeling by learning more about music and playing his own songs. Now, Michael's wife came into the room and took a seat. She listened intently as Michael stroked the keys in a stylistic, deft manner, the sounds filling the room and creating a tapestry of rhythm and melody. As soon as Michael finished, his wife, Helen, smiled and clapped. \\"That actually sounds fantastic, Michael,\\" she said to him in sign language. Michael smiled back and nodded his head. \\"Do you think the record label will like it?\\" he gestured back with his hands. Michael was creating a song that he could take to Interesting Records, hoping to get a deal for an album and become a household name in the process. \\"Yes, of course!\\" Helen signed. \\"You are amazing.\\" Michael, with a sigh of relief, mouthed \\"Thank you.\\""},{"prompt":"Please write a tweet for me about the movie 2 Fast, 2 Furious.

I only set out to fix my humble abode, Visions of historical beauty bestowed, But every move is a monumental load, And I'm feeling like I'm going to explode. The wall that I patched, it still has holes, And paint I just painted, color beneath, it shows, The faucet still drips, and the sink won't drain, My efforts, they all seem to be in vain. The drill, it won't work, the screws, they won't turn, My frustrations mount with each lesson learned, I can't seem to understand, I'm getting concerned, Now it seems my spirits are getting badly burned. My patience is wearing thin, my temper is coming quick, This home improvement project is making me sick, I curse and grumble, through this stupid task, This home improvement nonsense, it is such a big ask. But I must persevere, for I have much to gain, For a stunning home, my efforts will not be in vain, I'll keep at it, though it may drive me quite batty, And eventually, my home won't look so ratty. Oh, how I wish I could just hire a crew, To take care of the many things I need to do, But for now, I guess I'll keep plugging away, And hope that someday, I'll see the light of day."},{"prompt":"Describe the differences between chai and tea in 2 paragraphs.","completion":"Tea is a general term that can refer to any infusion of dried leaves, buds, flowers, fruits, or herbs in hot water.

No electronics, please. We are trying to stay away from screens at dinnertime.","completion":"Going to eat at a restaurant sounds like a fun night out with your family! Here are four ways to keep your kids entertained without electronics while you wait for your food to be served! 1. See who can make the most creative origami from straw wrappers. If you watch people at restaurants, many of them will naturally, often unconsciously start folding and looping straw wrappers while waiting on their food. You can take it a step further by hosting a straw wrapper contest at your table. Craft roses, rings, and wriggly worms, then take turns showing off the creations to the rest of the family. Don’t be surprised if your kiddos want to get the server involved because they’re proud of their straw wrapper origami skills! 2. Ask a lot of fun, silly, interesting questions! Kids are naturally inquisitive and imaginative, and they have a lot going on in their minds at all times. Go around the table and ask questions that are fun, silly, and sometimes weird, like: • Would you rather teach a bear to dance or ride a rhinoceros? • Do you think unicorns toot rainbows and glitter? • You’re a superhero. What’s your weirdest superpower? The sillier and more thought-provoking the questions, the more engaged and communicative your kids will be. 3. Play a classic “see and sight” game, like I Spy. Remember playing I Spy when you were a kid? It’s where you find something in a room, describe it, and others try to guess what you see. They can ask yes or no questions. This is a fun game because you can tailor it to any age. 4. Craft pieces of a story from one person to another until you either have your food or a complete story. Invoke the power of imagination when you suggest making up a story with your family. Everyone gets to tell a piece of the story in one or two sentences as they go around the table. Stories will get weird quickly, but they can be as short or as long as anyone wants them to be. Keep going around the table until 1) you’ve completed the story or 2) your food has arrived! When you go to restaurants as a family, the aim is to share that experience. It’s hard to bond over screens, so use the aforementioned entertainment tips to ensure your family has a great time!"},{"prompt":"At what level of mathematics are the following word problems taught?

Then, instead of the weather holding up, it ended up turning into a drought, and we lost all the crops as well as the other two cows due to not having enough water or food to give them. G: Hmm...okay, well, maybe you should do as you've always done when you needed something and pray. F: Yeah, about that.

Over 11 seasons, the show racked up an incredible 18 Emmy awards, dominating the sitcom category. The show focuses on one extended family and the different but connected lives they all live. The show follows the Pritchett family as they have each built their own families separately. The daughter, Claire, has a traditional family with her husband Phil, and three children. The son Mitchell is in a heterosexual marriage with Cam and has an adopted daughter. And finally, their father Jay who has remarried a younger Colombian woman, played by Sofia Vergara, and takes on a stepfather role to her son. Similar to The Office, the show employs a mockumentary style in which characters take asides to speak to the camera. Creators Steve Levitan and Christopher Lloyd created a lovable but flawed cast of characters who push the envelope at every turn. Each family is unique and relatable in their own way; they create a fascinating and compelling family dynamic that is impossible not to get attached to.

Moss, who had dedicated over a decade to building her business, says she had finally accumulated enough savings to pursue a peaceful life in rural Guerneville, California. But her dreams began to shatter after she received a text message purporting to be from her bank, Chase, inquiring about an unauthorized 35 debit card charge from another state. Initially dismissing it as a minor inconvenience, Moss promptly replied. Shortly after replying to the text, Moss received a call from someone claiming to be a representative from Chase Bank, with the caller ID displaying the bank's name. On the other end of the line was an individual identifying herself as \\"Miss Barbara\\" from \\"Chase ATM.\\" She requested permission from Moss to issue a new debit card to resolve the alleged fraudulent charge. Moss says Miss Barbara told her she needed to verify Moss's identity and to do so, instructed Moss to read the numbers from a subsequent text message back to her over the phone. \\"And I would just repeat those numbers to her, and she'd say, 'That's great. Thank you so much, Ms. Moss,'\\" said Moss. Over the next week, Miss Barbara called Moss several times, each time saying there was a problem with delivery of the card and each time asking Moss to verify her identity by reading back the numbers from subsequent text messages. It wasn't until Moss visited her nearest bank branch that the devastating truth emerged. A supervisor informed her that her account had been drained, leaving her life savings of nearly 160,000 completely depleted. \\"That was all my money.

The same gunmetal blue, hollowed eyes widened in surprise as he readjusted the dark robe he wore. But nothing else was even close to the little boy who wasn’t related to her. In his place stood a strange man. “Hello? Can I help you?’ he asked, his voice deep and unfamiliar, so alien to her ears. She opened her mouth to speak but no words came out.

Crafted with an ear towards pop appeal, the Motown sound typically used tambourines to accent the back beat, prominent and often melodic electric bass-guitar lines, distinctive melodic and chord structures, and a call-and-response singing style that originated in gospel music. In 1971, Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies, along with a four-beat drum pattern, regular use of horns and strings, and \\"a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio\\".[49] Pop production techniques such as the use of orchestral string sections, charted horn sections, and carefully arranged background vocals were also used. Complex arrangements and elaborate, melismatic vocal riffs were avoided.[50] Motown producers believed steadfastly in the \\"KISS principle\\" (keep it simple, stupid).[51] The Motown production process has been described as factory-like. The Hitsville studios remained open and active 22 hours a day, and artists would often go on tour for weeks, come back to Detroit to record as many songs as possible, and then promptly go on tour again. Berry Gordy held quality control meetings every Friday morning, and used veto power to ensure that only the very best material and performances would be released. The test was that every new release needed to fit into a sequence of the top five selling pop singles of the week. Several tracks that later became critical and commercial favorites were initially rejected by Gordy, the two most notable being the Marvin Gaye songs \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" and \\"What's Going On\\". In several cases, producers would rework tracks in hopes of eventually getting them approved at a later Friday morning meeting, as producer Norman Whitfield did with \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" and the Temptations' \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\\". Many of Motown's best-known songs, including all the early hits for the Supremes, were written by the songwriting trio of Holland–Dozier–Holland (Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland). Other important Motown producers and songwriters included Norman Whitfield, William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson, Smokey Robinson, Barrett Strong, Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, Frank Wilson, Pamela Sawyer & Gloria Jones, James Dean & William Weatherspoon, Johnny Bristol, Harvey Fuqua, Gil Askey,[52] Stevie Wonder, and Gordy himself.","completion":"*Tambourines accenting the back beat *Prominent, melodic electric bass-guitar lines *Distinctive melodic structures *Distinctive chord structures *Call-and-response singing style *Simple structures with sophisticated melodies *Four-beat drum pattern *Treble-focused (or high frequency prioritizing) mixing techniques *Regular use of horns and strings *Carefully arranged background vocals"},{"prompt":"Write a short story (2 paragraphs) about a chef who really really loves cheese. he goes to another country to find special cheese. he encounters some kind of challenge.","completion":"Chef Anthony was a man obsessed with cheese.

I was just told to stay here for a few days and not come out. The sounds of crashing waves and explosions were plentiful and it triggered my anxiety thinking about every possible situation. I just hoped everyone was ok. A few days passed and the explosions and earthquakes eventually stopped. I figured it was safe to come out. I opened the bunker door and sunlight shone through the door. The sounds of birds chirping and the ocean waves crashing ashore could be heard clearly. I walked up the stairs slowly, hoping everything was fine. The first thing I saw was the ocean, clearly visible and blue. Around me, though, were crumbling buildings and overgrowth. The road was cracked all over and vehicles were all laid around, all of them empty. On the ground, I saw Mom's favorite purse and the wallet I bought my Dad for his birthday. Scattered around were a lot of my parents' things. Clothes to the left and electronics to the right. Our car was right in front of me. I slowly picked up a couple of the things I could use and went back to the bunker. Everyone who was outside was gone. I had to survive. The first thing I had to do was figure out what supplies I'd need. I took stock of what was in the bunker and listed out what I'd need to get through the month. The food in the bunker would last a good while if portioned out and I already had medical kits to cover any injuries. So I listed the things I still needed to acquire somehow: -Secure a sustainable food supply -A weapon for protection -Fuel for the generator -Freshwater or a desalination machine That would be good for the time being. Everything else could come in time. I also had to figure out if I wanted to stay in this place. The bunker would be cozy for a few months but what about after that? It was not a stable, long-term plan. I was sure other survivors were out there planning the same thing as me. But that would have to come later.

The global requirements have far outpaced mankind’s ability to produce lithium. A new report from Science Advances reveals that a research team at the University of Texas at Austin has created an innovative way to produce lithium. The research team was headed by Professor Benny Freeman from the Monash University Engineering Department. The team experimented with ways to extract lithium from water using a metal/organic framework membrane. Using this unique membrane, the process mimics the ion filtering procedure to efficiently separate metal ions. Experts believe this new technology could greatly increase the world’s supply of lithium. In addition, it could open the door to new growth in a number of industries. Texas is one state with unusually high amounts in their wastewater produced by hydraulic fracturing. This supply is often wasted because technology has not been available to extract this element.

Where Do Foxes Live In Winter? Extremely adaptable, foxes live in various environments ranging from the forest, prairie, and tundra, to places inhabited by humans like farmlands and urban areas. As the fox’s natural habitat disappears, they move into urban and suburban areas to look for food. Foxes are found on every continent except Antarctica. There are at least 12 species, five of which live in the continental United States. Two types of foxes are most known for living in towns, cities, and other urban areas. The most common kinds of foxes you may see in your neighborhood are the Gray Fox and the Red Fox. In Cities Foxes love habitats with lots of variety in vegetation and prey. That is why they are often found on the edges of different ecosystems. For example, foxes love suburban areas because it is where the forest meets the city. These edge spaces provide more diversity in food and prey. Foxes aren’t anything to be afraid of, however! Here’s what to do if you see a fox in your yard. Dens Foxes do not migrate long distances. Instead, they stay near home. To prepare for the birth of her kits, a female fox finds an enclosed shelter to inhabit or modify for her young. While the female fox may be a stay-at-home parent, the male is responsible for providing food for his growing family. Other Animals Shelter A fox may dig a den, but will likely steal shelter from other small mammals like rabbits or chipmunks. Like other predators, foxes will conserve their energy as necessary. If the work has already been completed, why waste time digging another den? Holes In The Ground A fox may commandeer a den from another small mammal, or they may find a natural hole in the ground to make their den. Rainwater runoff that creates erosion as it flows downhill often hollows out loamy soil enough to create an open-air hole in the earth, perfect for a family of foxes in winter. Hollowed Out Tree Stumps Unlike the red fox, a gray fox prefers above-ground dens, such as a hollowed-out tree stump. When a tree dies, it rots from the inside out, creating a perfectly insulated home to raise young and store food. If you come across a fallen tree, look for a hollowed-out stump nearby. You might spot a fox family! Rock Crevices If your environment includes mountains or other rock formations, you may find your neighborhood fox living in a rock. To humans, this may seem like a damp and dismal location for a home, but to a fox, a cave provides shelter from the elements and insulation from extreme temperatures. Rock crevices are a common place to find foxes during the day. In The Snow If foxes do not have young ones to care for, they can sleep outside in the snow. Their thick fur keeps their skin warm and dry. In addition, snow built up around and over the fox adds insulation and keeps the fox warm. Foxes are well suited to winter climates in their range; they prepare for winter by eating excess food and storing fat deposits on their body. As a result, foxes are very comfortable in the snow!","completion":"Foxes can be found in many environments including forests, prairies, tundras, farmlands, and urban regions near forests.

The four sons of Horus were a group of four deities in ancient Egyptian religion (Imsety, Hapy, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuef) who were believed to protect deceased people in the afterlife. Beginning in the First Intermediate Period of Egyptian history (c. 2181–2055 BC), they were especially connected with the four canopic jars that housed the internal organs that were removed from the body of the deceased during the process of mummification. Most commonly, Imsety protected the liver, Hapy the lungs, Duamutef the stomach, and Qebehsenuef the intestines, but this pattern often varied. The canopic jars were given lids that represented the heads of the sons of Horus. Although they were originally portrayed as humans, in the latter part of the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC) they took on their most distinctive iconography, in which Imsety is portrayed as a human, Hapy as a baboon, Duamutef as a jackal and Qebehsenuef as a falcon. The four sons were also linked with stars in the sky, with regions of Egypt, and with the cardinal directions. The worship of the sons of Horus was almost entirely restricted to the funerary sphere. They were first mentioned late in the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC), in the Pyramid Texts, and continued to be invoked in funerary texts throughout ancient Egyptian history. Their connection with the canopic jars was established in the First Intermediate Period, and afterward they became ubiquitous in the decoration of canopic chests, coffins, and sarcophagi. Although they were increasingly closely associated with the internal organs, they continued to appear in burial equipment even after the use of canopic jars was abandoned in the Ptolemaic Period (303–30 BC), disappearing only in the fourth century AD with the extinction of the ancient Egyptian funerary tradition.","completion":"1.

Lowers blood pressure Anthocyanins may help reduce blood pressure, according to a review of 66 studies. Study participants with hypertension took a variety of extracts and preparations from anthocyanin-containing plants. The study found there was a consistent lowering effect on blood pressure. In other studies, however, researchers identified many factors that led to mixed results, such as: Dosage and type of anthocyanin (food, juice, freeze-dried powder or extract). Number of doses (single vs. long term). Patient characteristics (a person’s baseline blood pressure and other health conditions). This study highlights the need for more research to establish a dosing regimen and determine who might benefit from anthocyanins. 2. Reduces risk of heart disease Atherosclerosis is when plaque builds up on the inside of your arteries. This buildup can cause high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease or kidney failure. The formation of plaque is a multi-stage process that depends on many factors. Prescott says that research shows that anthocyanins can intervene at different stages in the process by reducing: Cholesterol, a main part of plaque. High blood pressure, which can damage blood vessels and make them more likely to develop atherosclerosis. Inflammation, which leads to plaque formation. 3. Prevents neurological diseases Research shows that anthocyanins can help protect and improve your brain function: One study found that a daily dose of cherry juice improved speech and memory in people aged 70 and over with mild or moderate dementia. Another study reported anthocyanins increased blood flow to and activated brain areas that control memory, language and attention. Researchers believe that anthocyanins’ antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are responsible for these improvements. 4. Slows cancer growth Anthocyanins may act in many ways to slow or stop cancer. Studies suggest that anthocyanins might: Block the changes in DNA that cause cancer. Destroy cancer cells or stop their growth. Prevent tumors from becoming malignant (cancerous). Reverse drug resistance and increase tumors’ sensitivity to chemotherapy. However, Prescott cautions that the research on anthocyanins and cancer has mainly happened in the laboratory. There are only limited data from clinical trials on people. Researchers need to continue to investigate these findings so they can determine exactly how anthocyanins affect cancer growth and treatment.","completion":"Anthocyanins, in my food Making it purple, makin' it good.

The fledgling country flourished quickly, with the expansion of territory from the original thirteen colonies (founded by the migrating Pilgrims) to 20 states, which included the newly acquired territories of Texas and Minnesota in 1812. By 1905, the United States had become a burgeoning superpower akin to the United Kingdom; however, in 1906, an unprovoked attack by Japan (who was seeking to ally with the United Kingdom) saw parts of the United States coming under the control of the Japanese-aligned UK. At the end of the war, dubbed \\"the Colonial War of 1906,\\" the UK granted Japan the spoils of war, including the acquisition of the states of Kafuniya on the West Coast, as well as the large expanse of land to the north, called Kaneda. In 1951, the United States (still comprising 20 states) was renamed \\"the Sovereign Territories of America\\" by Japan and the UK, who had divided the remaining American lands into North and South, where Japan took control of the northern lands (including Kaneda and half of Kafuniya) while the UK, seeking to expand further south, took control of the Aztec lands. However, this strategy was met with resistance by smaller splinter groups from the Sovereign Territories of America who migrated to the Aztec lands shortly after the colonization of the East Coast, where the weather and crops were more agreeable to them. Another war, referred to as the Aztec War of 1953, came to an end in 1956 when both the Sovereign Territories and the UK agreed to a truce and fostered trade of cash crops on the Aztec lands such as cactus, corn, fabrics, and gemstone ores (quartz, sphene) for the creation of a new class of electronics, including flying cars."},{"prompt":"What were the main causes and motivations behind the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War?","completion":"The United States became involved in the Vietnam War primarily due to its policy of containment during the Cold War.

What are some of the big considerations that we need to keep in mind when printing prototypes?","completion":"- Cost: Your prototyping process should have a budget that’s factored into the whole design and production effort. - Measurement units: This may seem menial, but settle on one consistent system of units before you complete the design. It should be a system that works for both your prototyping stages and full-scale production. You don’t want conversion errors to hamper your design. - Tolerances: No production method is 100% perfect and prototypes are notorious for having less-than-exact dimensions. Decide what tolerances are acceptable for the final product and also what are acceptable for your prototypes. - Materials: Sometimes a prototype is made in a different material than the final product. 3D printers, in particular, have some distinct material limitations. If your prototype is made of a different material than your end product, research the different effects those materials might give you. - Functionality: Does your prototype need to contain all the functions of the final product or is it mainly there to test fit and aesthetics? The latter may be far cheaper to make, but won’t cover all development programs. - Intellectual property rights: Before you dive deep into the design process, you need to thoroughly research any similar items. There’s no sense in producing even a prototype if the finished product would violate trademarks or patents. Intellectual property lawyers can be very helpful in this regard. - Start simple: If you’re in a position to create multiple iterative prototypes, start with just the basic fit and form for the first one. You can put more functionality into successive prints while you refine the overall design."},{"prompt":"What does this article say about Uber?

Photosynthetic organisms, including plants, algae, and some bacteria, play a key ecological role. They introduce chemical energy and fixed carbon into ecosystems by using light to synthesize sugars. Since these organisms produce their own food—that is, fix their own carbon—using light energy, they are called photoautotrophs (literally, self-feeders that use light). Humans, and other organisms that can’t convert carbon dioxide to organic compounds themselves, are called heterotrophs, meaning different-feeders. Heterotrophs must get fixed carbon by eating other organisms or their by-products. Animals, fungi, and many prokaryotes and protists are heterotrophs.","completion":"Interactive Experiment: Autotrophs and Heterotrophs Step 1: Differentiate between photoautotrophs and heterotrophs.

Step 4: If experimenters choose to be a heterotroph, simulate the process of obtaining fixed carbon by consuming other organisms or their by-products. Step 5: Discuss the various types of heterotrophs, such as animals, fungi, prokaryotes, and protists, and their dependence on external sources for fixed carbon.

Oskam had a spinal cord injury from a motor bike accident that prevented him from moving his legs.Weber Gilles In 2017, Oskam received an experimental implant in his spinal cord as part of a different clinical trial, which helped him regain his ability to walk. By lifting his heel slightly — which he could do on his own — Oskam would trigger an electrical current that stimulated nerves in his spinal cord to allow him to take steps. But those steps were clunky, and he couldn't navigate around obstacles or walk on uneven surfaces. \\"I felt like with every step a bit stressed, like I had to be in time with the rhythm, otherwise I wouldn't make a good step,\\" Oskam said during a call with reporters on Tuesday. And, after two years of this electrical nerve stimulation, as the approach is known, Oskam's recovery plateaued. So he joined the proof-of-concept study in 2021. When Oskam thinks about moving his legs, the implant in his brain sends a signal to an external computer, which Oskam wears as a backpack. The computer then processes and relays that signal to a pacemaker in Oskam's abdomen, which in turn sends electrical pulses to the older implant that was already in his spinal cord. That prompts Oskam's legs to move. A helmet with two antennas helps the implants stay connected to the computer. Older technologies that use electrical nerve stimulation, while studied more, have relied on tiny movements from the patient or the click of a button to help the patient walk. Henri Lorach, another EPFL scientist involved in the research, told reporters that by using the new system, Oskam could walk naturally after several minutes of training. He also gained more control over his leg movements and was able navigate tricker terrain, like gravel paths. \\"The stimulation before was controlling me, and now I’m controlling the stimulation,\\" Oskam said. He added that he can now walk 100 to 200 meters (around 330 to 660 feet) per day and stand unsupported for about two or three minutes.","completion":"Style: The style of this article can be classified as informative and descriptive.

African-Americans tend to get high blood pressure at an earlier age than other races. 3) Family and Genetics - If your parents or close relatives have high blood pressure, your odds of getting it typically increase 4) Your Weight - When you start to put on more weight than what is considered normal, the blood vessels in your body have to work harder, thus leading to an increase in blood pressure. 5) Sedentary Lifestyle - If you aren't getting much exercise, heart rates tend to increase and can coincide with your blood pressure rising. Exercising can increase the amount of oxygen your blood receives. 6) Smoking - Studies indicate that cigarettes and vaping correlate with hypertension. 7) Sodium and Potassium Intake - Higher salt intake in combination with low potassium can greatly impact a person's blood pressure. Sodium makes blood vessels work harder while potassium calms blood vessels down. 8) Stress Levels - Stress typically impacts other areas on this list, which can in turn cause higher blood pressure in people. This is usually temporary, however. 9) Alcohol intake - Consuming alcoholic beverages can put a strain on the kidneys, which often leads to higher blood pressure. Alcohol can also cause liver issues which can impact fat breakdown. 10) Underlying conditions - Having a condition such as kidney disease or fatty liver disease can have a massive impact on blood pressure."},{"prompt":"Sum up what this says about mustard donuts.

I ate so much I would probably faint if I took another bite. I went to the movie room to hang out for an hour or so. They had so many choices from the latest releases. After the movie, I was able to take an Uber, free of charge, to the heart of the island for a party! I had a lot of fun, I got to dance and everything!

There are many great places to visit that are family-friendly, holiday picturesque, and offer opportunities for snow and carriage rides. Here are a few suggestions for you: * Leavenworth, Washington: This charming Bavarian-style village deep in the Cascade Mountains turns into a winter wonderland during the Christmas season. Leavenworth is famous for its more than a half million Christmas lights, music, and events. You can take a horse-drawn carriage ride through the town, go sledding, and enjoy hot cocoa by the fire. It is holiday perfection! * Mystic, Connecticut: Follow a lighted boat parade to a festive holiday carnival. Mystic offers the perfect charming New England coastal village Christmas. You can sing along with carolers, participate in a SantaCon bar hop, and even head to the aquarium for a sea of lights. * Woodstock, Vermont - Woodstock Wassail Weekend is the place to be to see Christmas at its best. Here you will find an entire parade of horses and buggies, carolers, and all of the historic homes and farms are lit up and open to celebrate the season. * Pigeon Forge, Tennessee: Pigeon Forge is home to Dollywood's famous Smoky Mountain Christmas event. It also hosts a huge Winterfest Celebration with more than 6 million holiday lights, including a walking trail, a winter village, and a lighted driving tour. There are horse-drawn carriage tours as well, but less of a chance of snow than some of the other suggestions. * Santa Claus, Indiana: As its name suggests, this small town lives for Christmas. With its holiday-themed amusement park, Christmas-themed restaurants and stores, a drive through a light show, and visits from Santa Claus himself, it's a perfect destination for families with young children. * Lake Placid, New York: While not a specific Christmas town per se, this picturesque Adirondack Mountains is a perfect destination for a festive Christmas vacation. The area is known for outdoor ice-skating rinks and toboggan runs, and also horse-drawn carriage rides through the snowy streets. * North Pole, Alaska - This is a year-round Christmas town, so you can visit any time you're craving a little holiday spirit. Here you'll find candy-cane posts, boughs of holly, and a Santa Claus house with live reindeer. But of course, it looks its best at Christmas when snow is virtually guaranteed and turns the town into a total winter wonderland. * Jackson, Wyoming - This charming ski town is surrounded by the snow-capped Teton mountains and offers plenty of snow-based activities, including sleigh rides, ice skating, and skiing. The town hosts a huge tree-lighting party, its annual Christmas parade, and more, making it the perfect family-friendly holiday location.

Brainstorm some examples.","completion":"1. Sight towers: A common trope in open-world games is the need to \\"activate\\" towers or other markers to unlock sections of the world. While intended to give the player a sense of the scale of the game world, they can be a dull unnecessary chore. 2. Repetitive side quests: The need to complete a repetitive task every time a section of the world is unlocked or the plot is progressed is detrimental to immersion and renders the game feeling perfunctory and diminishes player choice. 3. Unnecessary strategic layer: In settings where the player is the commander of an army or leader of a faction, it may seem to make sense to provide a strategic gameplay element. This would have the player command troops, manage resources, and make decisions on behalf of their faction. However, this can be poorly implemented and can result in players wasting their time playing a bad strategy game instead of a good action or role-playing game. 4. Unbalanced gambling minigame: Open-world games commonly feature gambling minigames where players can bet in-game currency. As these mini-games can be an afterthought and poorly balanced, they are frequently exploited by players to destroy the difficulty curve for themselves by gaining unlimited money. This is worsened as they would gain these infinite resources in a repetitive, uninteresting manner rather than by playing the actual game. 5. Broken economy: Many open-world games feature a large variety of items and currencies, which are not always well balanced in terms of their value to the in-game economy. Thus players may find themselves able to become incredibly wealthy in unintended and unconventional ways. This can diminish the sense of reward given for major in-game accomplishments and destroy the difficulty curve for players who would find the game too easy with infinite resources. What do you think of those suggestions for your article? I would be happy to discuss any of these common criticisms of open-world games further to help you with your article."},{"prompt":"What is the chemical formula for water?","completion":"The chemical formula for water is H2O, which signifies that its chemical makeup is two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

The windows were boarded up, and the paint had long since chipped off, although, from observation, I would surmise it was once painted a vibrant green color. Somehow, that particular detail sat uncomfortably with me. Green? In the middle of the woods? The door yawned awake slowly every few moments, the effect of a bad hinge no doubt. The wind, however, didn't seem to appreciate the ominous gaping mouth and would quickly shut it with a jarring slam. The roof was leaning, whether from slight imperfections in its constructions or a slouch in the foundation of the home, I could not tell. Still, it was an unfriendly look, almost like a stranger tilting their head ever so slightly to bore their gaze into you quizzically. The house was asking, \\"What are you?\\" and \\"Why are you here?\\"—both questions I couldn't answer. A rocking chair sat precariously perched upside down between the porch banister and the low-hanging roof as though an angry poltergeist had been upset with it, although it was likely that the wind sweeping through the porch had just lifted it up and trapped it there. It was an uncomfortable juxtaposition between familiarity and oddity; my mind conjured the image that the house was grinding the old rocking chair between its jaws. Still, it was none of these details that unsettled me so. It was the single light tucked away under the low-hanging roof, providing a subtle glow. It told me, contrary to everything else I had seen thus far, that the house wasn't just an old relic. No, it was a home."},{"prompt":"Hi! I'm struggling with my mental health. Could you please give me some tips for self-care? I should be able to do these at home (or a short distance from my house).","completion":"Of course. Here are some self-care tips you can do in close proximity to your home: 1. Get Enough Sleep: Sleep is very important for taking care of your mental health, so it's critical to make sure you get enough of it. Adults should usually be getting around 8 hours of sleep a night, though how much sleep a person needs can vary. It's important to pay attention to your own individual needs. 2. Eat Healthy Food: Eating food full of protein and nutrients can improve your physical health, which improves your mental health. 3. Drink Water: Staying hydrated is also key to making sure your mental health improves. It's easy to forget to drink enough water, so try to make a conscious effort to consume a lot of fluids. 4. Take Breaks: If you go home from work and keep working, you'll find that you burn out fast. Make sure to take some relaxing breaks where you do nothing sometimes. 5. Outsource Tasks: If you're having trouble finding the space to relax at home, then consider outsourcing some tasks. Hire a house cleaner or dog walker so you can take the time you need to recharge. 6. Have Company Over: If you live alone, then invite friends and family over for dinner or just to relax. 7. Do What You Enjoy: Lastly, and most importantly, make time for yourself and what you enjoy. Whether it's cooking, gaming, or something else entirely, carving out a space in your life for something you love can go a long way to recharging you."},{"prompt":"Based on the about blurb, is the described podcast funny?

Capable of both destruction and creation, space volcanoes are common on planets and moons throughout the solar system and beyond. Volcanoes account for some of Earth's most interesting and violent geographical features, a force for destruction and creation. However, volcanic activity isn't limited to our planet and space volcanoes are often found on other planets and moons. Within our solar system, the moon and Mars are rich with evidence of volcanoes and fiery volcanic activity, while other bodies possess volcanoes that spew ice from their frozen vistas. VOLCANOES ON THE MOON Now volcanically inert, the surface of the moon once hosted spectacular eruptions that created lava flows that extended as far as 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) from their source, according to San Diego State University. A recent Chinese mission to the lunar surface — the Chang'e-5 lander — returned lava that seems to indicate Earth's primary natural satellite was volcanically active more recently than previously believed. The sample collected from Oceanus Procellarum on the moon's near side, previously associated with recent volcanic activity, suggests volcanism as recently as two billion years ago, a full billion years later than previous estimates. VOLCANOES ON MARS Aside from Earth, the planet humanity has studied the geology of most intensely is Mars. This has led to the discovery that the Red Planet is host to even more volcanic features than our planet, according to Arizona State University. Primary among these is Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the entire solar system at twice the height of Mount Everest. It is surrounded by a plethora of other massive volcanoes. In addition to this, Mars' other volcanoes includes Elysium, Syrtis Major, and a cluster of low-profile volcanic structures near the Hellas impact basin. This basin is the lowest point on Mars and the third- or fourth-largest known impact crater in the solar system. Mars seems to be volcanically inactive, but when this happened is something astrogeologists are still attempting to figure out. The volcanoes in the Tharsis — the location of Olympus Mons — show few asteroid impact craters, meaning they could be just a few million years old, which is fairly young in geological terms. Mars was clearly very active in its youth, with explosive eruptions petering out as it aged. The planet has no active volcanoes, according to the National Air and Space Museum, and it appears most of the heat once stored in the planet's interior has been lost. It is possible we are currently simply seeing Mars in a geologically quiet period and that volcanism could restart on the Red Planet. VOLCANOES ON OTHER PLANETS Many other planets in the solar system have been linked with volcanic activity with most of these having occurred when the solar system was young and violent. The closest planet to Earth, Venus, has lava flows that cover up to 90 percent of its surface. Venus has up to 1,600 major volcanoes and could have as many as a million smaller counterparts to these. What isn't certain is if the planet is still volcanically active. Though we have yet to see a volcano erupt on any other planet, Venus is shrouded by thick clouds of sulfuric acid, meaning long-distance observations are difficult. Visiting the planet with a probe is complicated by its intense pressures and temperatures. Images captured by the MESSENGER mission have shown that Mercury's surface was shaped by volcanic activity. Lava flows on the closest planet to the sun have been dated to be between one and two billion years old. This means that volcanic activity continued well after Mercury formed around 4.5 billion years ago. For active volcanoes, one has to look beyond the planets of the solar system to its moons. VOLCANOES ON MOONS According to an article by NASA, the most volcanic body in the solar system is Io, one of Jupiter's moons, this activity is caused by the tremendous gravitational influence of the gas giant deforming the tiny moon. Not only does Io have volcanoes that spew blisteringly hot lava, but the Jovian moon also hosts cryovolcanoes. These ice volcanoes which occur on planets and moons located away from the sun erupt cold, liquid, or frozen gases like water, ammonia, or methane. Io is punctuated with hundreds of volcanic vents, many of which blast jets of frozen gas hundreds of miles into Jupiter's atmosphere. Cyrovolcanoes were first observed on one of Neptune's moons, Triton when the Voyager 2 craft caught a glimpse of five mile-high plumes of nitrogen gas during its 1989 flyby of the Neptunian system. These eruptions are caused when solar radiation heats nitrogen below Triton's surface, vaporizing it, causing it to expand and eventually erupt from the Neptunian moon's icy surface. Eventually, this material condenses and falls back to the surface of Triton, giving it a smooth snow-covered surface. In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft observed ice jets released from the southern polar region of Saturn's moon Enceladus. Cassini actually flew through one of these eruptions discovering it to be mostly comprised of water vapor with some nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide.","completion":"Born from the power of both destruction and creation, the omnipresence of space volcanoes on the celestial bodies across the cosmic expanse is remarkable. Our home planet, Earth, is home to some of the most enthralling and cataclysmic geographical features, the result of the tumultuous dance of volcanoes - the architects of destruction and creation. But these molten marvels are not confined to the realm of our world, as space volcanoes dot the terrains of planets and moons far and wide. Our very own moon and the elusive Mars are littered with relics of past volcanic fury. Meanwhile, some celestial bodies boast volcanoes that eject ice from their frost-covered landscapes. MOON'S VOLCANIC PAST The lunar surface, which is now volcanically dormant, was once a stage for magnificent volcanic eruptions, birthing lava flows that stretched for an astonishing 750 miles from their origin, as reported by San Diego State University. The recent Chang'e-5 lunar mission by China retrieved lava samples that hint at a more recent period of volcanic liveliness on Earth's closest celestial companion than previously assumed. MARS' VOLCANIC SAGA Humanity has examined Mars' geological secrets more than any other celestial body apart from Earth. This deep dive has uncovered the fact that the Red Planet is a treasure trove of more volcanic landmarks than our world. Olympus Mons, towering at twice the height of Mount Everest, holds the record for the largest volcano in our solar system. Along with this leviathan, Mars is adorned with several other colossal volcanoes. Despite its volcanic riches, Mars currently seems dormant. The timeline of its volcanic inactivity remains a mystery that astrogeologists strive to unveil. THE VOLCANIC COSMOS Numerous planets in our cosmic neighborhood bear traces of volcanic activity, a testament to a time when our solar system was young and turbulent. Venus, Earth's closest planetary neighbor, is a volcanic wonderland with lava flows covering a staggering 90% of its surface. Its surface is pockmarked with up to 1,600 significant volcanoes and potentially millions of smaller ones. THE MOON'S VOLCANIC PORTRAIT For an exhibition of active volcanoes, one must turn the gaze away from the planets to the moons of our solar system. Jupiter's moon, Io, bears the distinction of being the most volcanic celestial body in our solar system, as per NASA. Its volcanism is attributed to the immense gravitational pull of the gas giant. Neptune's moon, Triton, was the stage for the first sighting of cryovolcanoes when Voyager 2 witnessed colossal plumes of nitrogen gas during its 1989 encounter with the Neptunian system. In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft captured the spectacle of ice jets emanating from Saturn's moon Enceladus. Cassini even ventured through one of these icy eruptions, discovering it to be mostly water vapor with some nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide."},{"prompt":"Write a short email to my banker instructing them to cancel all subscriptions on my account.

P: I've been wanting to improve certain areas of my life. T: Really? What areas of your life do you want to improve? P: For starters, I want to learn how to be less worried about things that I can't change. T: That's a really good lesson to learn and one that will undoubtedly help you throughout your life. What else? P: I also want to be less irritated when things don't go my way. T: Yes, that's another good one. Anything else? P: I think those are the two biggest concerns I have at this moment. T: Okay, let's focus on being irritated when things don't go your way. Can you give me an example of something that happened to you that made you feel irritated? P: I can remember one specific day when all sorts of things were not going my way. I remember getting up in the morning and stubbing my toe on my dresser. Then, I made breakfast but I ended up burning the bacon by accident. And then, later that day I was driving to the store and I seemed to be running into every red light along the way. I remember feeling enraged by the end of the day. T: One thing you can do when this happens to you is to remember that life doesn't cater to you, you just have to accept everything it throws at you. In a way, this also addresses your other issue of being worried about things that you can't change. There are certain things that we can't change so worrying doesn't matter except to give you more stress. It's better to not worry about those things. However, when there are things that happen to you that are within your control and you are not satisfied with the results, you should look at the expectations you've set for yourself and consider whether or not you've been setting those expectations too high for yourself to achieve. Something as simple as cooking the morning bacon and having it burn while you do so can be understandably frustrating, but it is a good reminder to not spread ourselves too thin and instead to lower our expectations just enough that we can achieve them."},{"prompt":"Write a short story from the point of view of a lizard living in a glass enclosure at a restaurant.

It’s getting to be a crowded space, but those who have authority will be able to build their brand and increase their profits more easily. Authority at a Glance What is meant by authority? It can mean different things. Authority operates on several levels. There is domain authority, page authority, and professional authority. Domain Authority - Domain authority relates to your domain traffic. Is your URL a frequently visited site that attracts not only new but repeat visitors? Or do they visit once and click out? Page Authority - Page authority is often measured by search engine results. Is your page in the top 10 on the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) delivered by Google and other top search engines? Professional Authority - Regarding professional authority within your niche, name recognition would often measure your level of authority. Would your name garner instant recognition from fellow experts in your niche? If you’re struggling with all three of these areas, paying attention to your ratings and reviews can help improve your authority and garner more sales. Ratings and Reviews at a Glance Your reputation has a lot to do with your authority level, whether you are looking at domain authority, page authority, or professional authority. One of the easiest and most effective ways to boost your authority is to make it a point to give your ratings and reviews a little TLC. However, before you can get to work on that, you need to know more about ratings and reviews, as well as where to find them. Ratings and reviews can be found on \\"review sites\\" such as Yelp, as well as other places online such as social media sites and even on your own website. If you are a brick-and-mortar business, you know just how your ratings can encourage or discourage people's visiting habits. Some rating sites will also allow people to post reviews. Again, reviews can make or break a business, especially if they are not accurate. A malicious poster can trash the reputation you’ve worked so hard to build with just the click of a mouse. Conversely, a high rating and good review can build consumer confidence and make those who read the information more willing to give your business a chance."},{"prompt":"What happened to President J.F.K.'s assassinator?","completion":"President John F.

I have generated some possible ceremonial rituals for your story. I have also considered how they might be manipulated to give your protagonist more time to gather evidence. 1. The Appointment of the Jurors: Before the trial can begin, the jurors must be appointed.

It can potentially be much more time-consuming if the eligible jurors are absent, say due to an illness or a distraction in the square. 2. The Assent of the Judge: The judge must agree to the jurors that have been appointed. This is normally a quick formality, but it could be a significant roadblock if the judge refuses to accept certain jurors. This could be out of an expectation that they recuse themselves, for example in the event that the elder in question is supportive of your protagonist and thus may be biased. 3. Prayers to Goddess of Justice: Prayers to the Goddess of Justice must be performed before every day of court. Most of the time this is a relatively brief affair, lasting no more than 15 minutes, but there is an extended version of the prayer that can take up to two hours. 4. Purification of the Court: The grounds of the courtroom must be purified with special incense. This is normally in abundance as it is from the neighboring city of D'larn, but perhaps recent trade disruptions have made the supply irregular, even scarce. Court proceedings surely could not continue without the incense, giving your protagonist more time. 5.

The Manhattan Project refers to the United States' research and development of a functional atomic bomb. While it was named the Manhattan Project, most of the work took place in New Mexico, not New York. As most know, the atomic bomb was eventually used twice in Japan, destroying cities and causing massive casualties to the Japanese population. The US had been forced into the war following Pearl Harbor and needed a way to bring a swift end to the war in Japan. The project began originally due to fears that German scientists had been experimenting with nuclear weaponry since the early 1930s. The U.S. began research as a countermeasure to provide some defense against this technology. However, the United States finished the project first and in doing so changed the tide of the war and human history as a whole. This article will discuss the project itself, its impact on human history as a whole, and the morality of the destructive weapon."},{"prompt":"Will you please write me a children's poem about different kinds of bugs?

Assessing What Your Fitness Level Is You likely have a good idea of how physically fit you are. But by determining your baseline fitness scores, you can find out the benchmark to use to measure your progress. To assess your aerobic and muscular fitness, body composition and flexibility, think about doing the following. * Determine what your pulse rate is before and immediately after exercising such as walking for one mile or 1.6 kilometers. * Find out how long it takes to walk for one mile or how long it will take you to run for 1.5 miles or 2.41 kilometers. * Determine how many standard or modified pushups you can do at one time. * Determine how far you are able to reach forward while in the seated position on the floor with your legs in front of you. * Find out what your waist circumference is, which is the area just above your hip bones. * Determine your body mass index. 2. Create Your Fitness Program It can be easy to say that you plan to exercise every day, but you will need a plan in place if you want to stick to it. As you create your own personal fitness program, keep these factors in mind. * Think about your fitness goals. Are you starting an exercise program to help yourself lose weight? Or do you have something else motivating you such as preparing for a marathon? Having goals that are clear and not outrageous will help you gauge your progress while keeping you motivated. * Come up with a balanced routine. A good place to start is to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity every week, or a combination of the two. The guidelines suggest that you should spread this activity out during the course of a week. For even more health benefits, and to assist with weight loss, working out for at least 300 minutes a week is ideal. *Start slowly and progress minimally over time. If you are just getting started with an exercise routine, you should start out carefully and progress slowly. If you have an injury or a medical condition, it is imperative that you consult with your doctor and get advice from them on how to design your fitness program. They can offer suggestions on how to improve your range of motion and enhance your endurance. * Increase activity by adding it to your daily routine. Finding the right time to exercise can be a challenge for anyone. To make this easier, you should schedule your time to exercise as you would any other errand or appointment. Plan to watch your favorite TV show while walking on your treadmill. Or you can read while riding on a stationary bike."},{"prompt":"Write a series of 4 tweets from a well-known chef to her fans.

The butterfly was thirsty so she was flying from flower to flower to get a drink. As the butterfly was flying along, they noticed that they were going farther from their home than they had flown before.

The butterfly realized that they were a little unsure of which direction they had flown from to get back to their home. The butterfly was nervously floating in circles when they heard a small voice from a leaf below them. The butterfly looked down and they saw a tiny ladybug. The ladybug was so small, that the butterfly had to hover close to the leaf to hear what the ladybug was saying to them. When the butterfly was close enough to hear the tiny ladybug's voice, the ladybug repeated what they were saying. \\"It seems like you are worried about something, could it be that you have flown too far away in your hurry to drink from all of the flowers?\\" To this, the ladybug replied \\"Yes that is true! How did you know I was lost?\\" The ladybug simply smiled at the butterfly and said \\" I have been watching you flutter for a little while, your colors were so beautiful that I could not help but watch you float on the breeze. I know which direction your home is because I have been watching.\\" This made the butterfly so happy that they did a little flip in the air and said \\"Oh I am so glad you know where my home is, can you show me?\\" The ladybug replied \\"Of course! but I will have to ride on your back because I may not be able to keep up with you.\\" The butterfly eagerly agreed and the ladybug hopped onto the butterfly's back. The ladybug was having so much fun riding beneath the butterfly's colorful wings which the ladybug had admired from afar. The ladybug carefully pointed out each flower that the butterfly had visited and found its way back to the butterfly's home. The butterfly was so grateful that they asked the ladybug if they could be friends, and the ladybug replied \\"Of course!\\" From that day on, they were the best of friends."},{"prompt":"Could you write a letter to my boss, Mr. Williams, apologizing for missing an important deadline and providing a plan to make up for it?

Only special miners can make it there, and a group of them decided to make this special egg and hide it from the rest of the miners. One day, this group of miners decided to find the dragon of Urelo to protect the egg at all costs because of its worth.

He wanted the egg all to himself to pay for a big mansion in the hills, but the town he came from was very poor. His mom, father, and sister still live there but barely have enough money to eat daily. Marcus set out on his mission to find the egg for his greedy ways. Day after day, he searched and searched until one day, he found a cave. Large oak trees, a flowing river, and large prints with claws in the mud surrounded the cave.

She lived in a room that doubled as my father's office, and which we invariably referred to as \\"the back room.\\" She carried with her a powerful aroma. I don't know what kind of perfume she used, but it was the double-barrel, 90 proof, knock down, render the victim unconscious, moosekilling variety. She kept it in a huge atomizer and applied it frequently and liberally. It was almost impossible to go into her room and remain breathing for any length of time. When she would leave the house to go spend 6 months with my Aunt Lillian, my mothers and sisters would throw open all the windows, strip the bedding and the curtains and the rugs, and spend several days washing and airing things out, trying frantically to make the pungent odor go away. This, then, was my grandmother at the time of the pea incident. It took place at the Biltmore Hotel, which to my eight-year-old mind was just about the fanciest place to eat in all of Providence. My grandmother, my mother and I were having lunch after a morning spent shopping. I grandly ordered a salisbury steak, confident in the knowledge that beneath that fancy name was a good old hamburger with gravy. When brought to the table it was accompanied by a plate of peas. I do not like peas now. I did not like peas then. I have always hated peas. It is a complete mystery to me why anyone would voluntarily eat peas. I did not eat them at home. I did not eat them at restaurants. And I certainly was not about to eat them now. \\"Eat your peas\\" my grandmother said. \\"Mother,\\" said my mom in her warning voice. \\"He doesn't like peas. Leave him alone.\\" My grandmother did not reply, but she got that certain glint to her eye and grim set to her jaw that signaled she was not going to be thwarted. She leaned in my direction, caught my eye, and uttered the fateful words that changed my life. \\"I'll pay you five dollars if you eat those peas.\\" I had absolutely no idea of the impending doom that was headed my way like a giant wrecking ball. I only knew that five dollars was an ENORMOUS, nearly UNIMAGINABLE amount of money, and as awful as peas were, only one plate of them stood between me and the possession of that five dollars. I began to force the wretched things down my throat. My mother was livid. My grandmother had that self-satisfied look of someone who has thrown down an unbeatable trump card. \\"I can do what I want, Ellen, and you can't stop me.\\" My mother glared at her mother. She glared at me. No one can glare like my mother. If there were a glaring Olympics, she would undoubtedly win the gold medal. I, of course, kept shoving peas down my throat. The glares made me nervous, and every single pea made me want to throw up, but the magical image of that five dollars floated before me, and I finally gagged down the very last of them. My grandmother handed me the five dollars with a flourish. My mother continued to glare in silence. And the episode ended. Or so I thought. My grandmother left for Aunt Lillian's a few weeks later. That night, at dinner, my mother served two of my all-time favorite foods, meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Along with them came a big, steaming bowl of peas. She offered me some peas, and I, in the very last moments of my innocent youth, declined. My mother fixed me with a cold eye as she heaped a huge pile of peas on my plate. Then came the words that were to haunt me for years. \\"You ate them for money\\" she said. \\"You can eat them for love.\\" Oh, despair! Oh, devastation. Now, too late, came the dawning realization that I had unwittingly damned myself in a hell from which there was no escape. \\"You ate them for money. You can eat them for love.\\" What possible argument could I muster against that? There was none. Did I eat the peas? You bet I did. I ate them that day, and every time they were served thereafter. The five dollars was quickly spent. My grandmother herself passed away a few years later. But the legacy of the peas lived on, as it lives to this day. If I so much as curl my lip when they are served (because after all, I still hate the horrid little things), my mother repeats the dreaded words one more time. \\"You ate them for money\\" she says. \\"You can eat them for love.\\"","completion":"The tale of the Plate of Peas still sends shivers down my spine, a haunting memory that lingers in the depths of my being. It began innocently enough, with the passing of my grandfather and my grandmother's arrival to stay with us for half of every year. Her presence brought an overpowering scent that permeated the air—a scent so potent it could knock out a charging moose. The aroma, emanating from her enigmatic perfume, was stored in a colossal atomizer and liberally sprayed at every opportunity. Venturing into her room meant subjecting oneself to an assault on the senses, gasping for breath in the face of the overwhelming fragrance. Whenever she left to stay with Aunt Lillian, a frantic ritual ensued, involving open windows, stripped bedding, and days dedicated to washing and airing out the rooms in a desperate attempt to banish the lingering odor. But it was during an ill-fated lunch at the Biltmore Hotel, a place I deemed the epitome of luxury in my eight-year-old mind, that the nightmare unfolded. Accompanied by my grandmother and mother, I indulged in what I thought was a sophisticated choice—a salisbury steak, a fancy name disguising a humble hamburger smothered in gravy. Alas, the innocent-looking dish arrived with an unwelcome companion—a plate of detestable peas. Peas, those repulsive green orbs, were my nemesis. I detested them with every fiber of my being. Their slimy texture and bland taste baffled me, leaving me bewildered as to why anyone willingly subjected themselves to such culinary torment. I refused to consume peas at home or in restaurants, and I certainly had no intention of succumbing to them now. \\"Eat your peas,\\" my grandmother commanded, her voice carrying an ominous undertone. \\"Mother,\\" my mother interjected, her voice a warning. \\"He doesn't like peas. Leave him be.\\" My grandmother remained silent, her eyes glinting with a determined resolve, her jaw set in unwavering determination. Inclining herself toward me, she fixed her gaze upon my own and uttered words that would forever alter the course of my life. \\"I'll pay you five dollars if you eat those peas.\\" At the time, the impending catastrophe eluded me entirely. All I comprehended was the sheer magnitude of the offer—five dollars, a sum unimaginable to my young mind. The allure of possessing that vast fortune outweighed the wretchedness of the peas. With a mixture of apprehension and greed, I began to force the loathsome legumes down my throat, one after another. My mother, livid with anger, directed her glare at both her mother and me. No one could glare like my mother—an Olympic champion in the art of withering stares. The glares unsettled me, each pea causing me to retch internally, but the promise of that coveted five dollars sustained me. And so, with each agonizing bite, I persevered until the last pea disappeared from my plate. My grandmother, triumphant, bestowed upon me the coveted prize, a five-dollar bill presented with a flourish. Meanwhile, my mother's silent glare continued, a testament to her disapproval. Weeks later, my grandmother departed for Aunt Lillian's. That evening, at the dinner table, a sinister plot unfolded. My mother served two of my all-time favorite dishes—meatloaf and mashed potatoes. But accompanying them, like a steaming bowl of malevolence, were peas—endless, vile peas. She offered me a serving, and in the waning moments of my youthful innocence, I declined. A cold, piercing gaze from my mother accompanied her actions as she piled a mountain of peas onto my plate. And then, the words were spoken, words that would haunt my existence for years to come. \\"You ate them for money,\\" she hissed. \\"You can eat them for love.\\" Despair consumed me. Devastation washed over my soul. In that moment, the cruel reality sank in—I had unwittingly damned myself to an eternal torment from which there was no escape. \\"You ate them for money. You can eat them for love.\\" What defense could I possibly muster against such a damning proclamation? There was none. I ate the peas that day, and every time they were served thereafter. The five dollars evaporated as quickly as it came, and my grandmother, herself, passed away in the following years. Yet, the legacy of the peas endured, a relentless reminder of my capitulation. Even now, if I dare to display the slightest distaste upon their appearance, my mother resurrects the dreadful words, her voice dripping with a sinister tone. \\"You ate them for money,\\" she hisses once more. \\"You can eat them for love.\\" And so, the peas continue to haunt me, an eternal punishment for my youthful folly."},{"prompt":"Write a section for the information section of a study describing the purpose.

She's gluten-free and allergic to nuts. I don't know what to make, do you have any suggestions? Explain each idea.","completion":"I can definitely suggest some great gluten-free and nut-free dinner ideas for you and your friend: 1. Sheet-Pan Honey Mustard Chicken. Make a sauce with oil, honey, mustard, garlic, and paprika then pour half over your chicken. Bake for 25 minutes, then add green beans, sweet peppers, and the remaining sauce and bake for 15-20 more minutes. This sheet-pan chicken is not only gluten-free and nut-free, but low-carb as well. 2. Pressure-Cooker Salsa London Broil. Cut your steak into thirds and place it in the pressure cooker, then add salsa, sweet potato, carrot, and garlic. Lock the lid and pressure cook on high for 10 minutes. Slice your roast, serve with veggies, and garnish with lime wedges and cilantro, if desired. This dish comes together quickly but has plenty of delicious slow-cooked flavor. 3. Air-Fryer Chicken Pesto Stuffed Peppers. Cut peppers lengthwise in half, remove the stems and seeds, and heat them in your air fryer at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10-15 minutes. While that cooks, combine the shredded rotisserie chicken, brown rice, and pesto in a large bowl. When the peppers are ready, add the filling and return to your air fryer at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle cheese on top of each stuffed pepper and bake until melted. 4. Grilled Summer Sausage Salad. Brush sausage, zucchini, yellow squash, and peppers with olive oil and grill them over medium heat for 5-6 minutes. Remove them to a cutting board, then roughly chop and add them to a large salad bowl with your salad greens, sliced cucumber, and chopped celery. Add your dressing of choice and toss to coat for a delicious and refreshing gluten-free and nut-free meal. 5. Chicken and Asparagus Bundles. Flatten chicken breast halves, then wrap each one around five asparagus spears and secure them with toothpicks. Put them in a baking dish, add oil, lemon juice, and seasonings then cover and bake for 25-30 minutes. When the chicken and asparagus bundles are ready, combine cornstarch and chicken broth with your pan juices in a small saucepan and heat until thickened, around 2 minutes. These are just five ideas to help you come up with a great dinner idea for you and your guest. Keep in mind that it's always best to check nutrition facts and ensure that all of your ingredients are gluten-free and don't contain nuts."},{"prompt":"The title of this product is Cambri 2-Piece Sectional with Chaise.

Mrs. Gleason exclaimed at the beautifully arranged dishes of food: the colorful candied fruit in the sweet-and-sour pork dish, the noodle-thin shreds of chicken meat stirfried with tiny peas, and the glistening pink prawns in a ginger sauce. At first I was too busy enjoying my food to notice how the guests were doing. But soon I remembered my duties. Sometimes guests were too polite to help themselves and you had to serve them with more food. I glanced at Meg, to see if she needed more food, and my eyes nearly popped out at the sight of her plate. It was piled with food: the sweet-and-sour meat pushed right against the chicken shreds, and the chicken sauce ran into the prawns. She had been taking food from a second dish before she finished eating her helping from the first! Horrified, I turned to look at Mrs. Gleason. She was dumping rice out of her bowl and putting it on her dinner plate. Then she ladled prawns andgravy on top of the rice and mixed everything together, the way you mix sand, gravel, and cement to make concrete. I couldn’t bear to look any longer, and I turned to Mr. Gleason. He was chasing a pea around his plate. Several times he got it to the edge, but when he tried to pick it up with his chopsticks, it rolled back to the center of the plate again. Finally, he put down his chopsticks and picked up the pea with his fingers. He really did! A grown man! All of us, our family and the Chinese guests, stopped eating to watch the activities of the Gleasons. I wanted to giggle. Then I caught my mother’s eyes on me. She frowned and shook her head slightly, and I understood the message: the Gleasons were not used to Chinese ways, and they were just coping the best they could.","completion":"The dinner started well.

At first, one of the dragonflies was too absorbed in savoring its own meal to notice how the other guests were faring. But soon, a sense of duty awakened within it. Dragonflies, being gracious creatures, understood that sometimes guests were too polite to help themselves, and it fell upon them to serve more food. Glancing at Meg, the dragonfly assessed if she needed additional nourishment. Its multifaceted eyes widened at the sight of her plate. It was overflowing with an assortment of food: the sweet-and-sour meat mingling with the chicken shreds, while the chicken sauce intermingled with the prawns. Meg had been eagerly sampling from a second dish before finishing her first helping! Horrified by this disregard for dining decorum, the dragonfly shifted its gaze to Mrs. Gleason. It watched in astonishment as she emptied rice from her bowl onto her dinner plate, followed by a generous ladling of prawns and gravy, creating a haphazard fusion. It resembled the mixing of sand, gravel, and cement to create an unconventional dragonfly-style concrete. Unable to bear witness any longer, the dragonfly turned its attention to Mr. Gleason. It observed him chasing a pea around his plate, his nimble wings buzzing in frustration. Despite several valiant attempts to capture the elusive pea with his chopsticks, it would roll back to the center each time. Finally, with a resigned sigh, he relinquished the chopsticks and resorted to picking up the pea with his fingers. Unbelievable! Even a grown dragonfly would find such behavior amusing. All the dragonflies paused their own feasting to observe the whimsical spectacle created by the Gleasons. The dragonfly felt an uncontrollable urge to giggle but was quickly halted by a stern gaze from its mother. She frowned and subtly shook her head, conveying a message of understanding. The Gleasons were unfamiliar with the customs of the Chinese dragonflies, and they were doing their best to adapt and navigate the dining experience. The dragonflies resumed their own elegant dining, embracing tolerance and acceptance."},{"prompt":"Convert this text to a letter to my sisters. Iran + Iranian authorities announce their plan to install cameras in public spaces to identify and arrest unveiled women. On Saturday, April 8, Iranian authorities announced that they would install cameras in public spaces to identify and arrest unveiled women. According to the country’s hijab law, women in Iran who do not cover their hair risk arrest. Since the killing of Mahsa Amini by morality police in Sept. of last year, protests against the mandatory dress code law have erupted around the country, with many women refusing to cover their hair. A statement released by the state-aligned Tasnim News Agency reports, “In an innovative measure and in order to prevent tension and conflicts in implementing the hijab law, Iranian police will use smart cameras in public places to identify people who break the norms.” In the same statement, police said that after an unveiled woman is identified by one of their cameras, she will receive warning text messages about the consequences of violating the law. “In the context of preserving values, protecting family privacy and maintaining the mental health and peace of mind of the community, any kind of individual or collective behavior against the law, will not be tolerated,” reads the statement.","completion":"Dear Sisters, I hope this letter finds you well. There's an urgent matter concerning our sisters in Iran. The Iranian authorities have recently announced their plan to install cameras in public spaces intending to identify unveiled women and arrest them. As you know, the hijab law in Iran requires women to cover their hair, and failure to comply can lead to arrest. This decision comes after the tragic killing of Mahsa Amini by the morality police last year, which sparked widespread protests against the mandatory dress code. Many brave women in Iran have started to stop covering their hair, standing up for their right to choose how they dress. According to a statement released by the state-aligned Tasnim News Agency, the Iranian police claim that using smart cameras in public places is an innovative measure to prevent tension and conflicts in enforcing the hijab law. Once an unveiled woman is identified, she will receive warning text messages about the consequences of violating the law. The statement goes on to further emphasize the preservation of values, protection of family privacy, and the mental health and peace of mind of the community. It states that any behavior, individual or collective, that goes against the law will not be tolerated. This news is deeply concerning and highlights the challenges faced by our sisters in Iran who are fighting for their rights and freedom of expression. We need to stand in solidarity with them, raise awareness about their struggles, and advocate for their rights to be respected. Let us support our Iranian sisters in their pursuit of equality and justice. We must continue to push for change and work towards a world where every woman can exercise her right to self-expression without fear of persecution. With love and solidarity, Your sister"},{"prompt":"Rewrite the text in the form of an 8th-grade lesson plan titled: \\"The Best Tools To Help You Code an App.\\" The Best Tools To Help You Code an App Using an app-building tool speeds up the coding process.

You are quite angry and disappointed about the situation.","completion":"Subject: Complaint regarding bouquet of flowers Dear Sir or Madam, I purchased a large bouquet of premium range flowers from your online florist last week. They were a get-well present for my mother, who has been in hospital for the past few weeks. However, I was shocked when the flowers were delivered to my mother's door. The blooms were not as advertised online. In fact, they bore no resemblance to the photos displayed on the product page. The bouquet contained several flowers that were visibly wilted and past their prime. Some petals were already browning, and others had begun to wilt, giving the bouquet an overall neglected appearance. It was clear that the flowers had not been properly cared for or stored in optimal conditions. The lack of freshness was evident in the drooping stems and the overall limpness of the blooms. I am a loyal customer of yours and have ordered from your website numerous times. I have always trusted your brand and appreciated the quality and beauty of your floral arrangements. I have to say I'm quite disappointed and very dissatisfied. I have never had any problems before. This is not what I would expect from a renowned brand such as yours.

When I landed on the planet, I immediately noticed the rich, fresh soil that covered the ground. The sensation of it on my feet felt strange. I looked around and saw many tall trees and a large lake. Drinking at the lake was a few lovely animals, which I soon found out are called deer. I also heard the pleasant chirping of lovely bluebirds. I looked up and saw a bright orb in the sky that provides warmth to the planet. Everything around me is so foreign, yet feels so familiar.

Prioritize variety, I don't want 5 songs about California.","completion":"That sounds like fun! Here's a list of songs you might want to add to your road trip playlist: 1. 'New York, New York' by Frank Sinatra - This ode to Manhattan is a timeless classic full of optimism and bravado. It's sure to put your passengers in a great mood. 2. 'Viva Las Vegas' by Elvis Presley - You may find it difficult to resist making a pit stop in Sin City after listening to this tune. 3. 'Route 66' by the Rolling Stones - This legendary anthem to one of the most widely recognizable roads in America is sure to be a hit with your friends. 4. 'Sweet Home Alabama' by Lynryrd Skynyrd - This song is chock-full of love for the state of Alabama. It has an opening riff that people will recognize right away and a chorus that's perfect for belting out at the top of your lungs with the windows rolled down. 5. 'No Particular Place to Go' by Chuck Berry - While your road trip may indeed have a particular destination, the lyrics of this song are an ode to the joy of driving for fun. With its catchy riffs and infectious rhythm, you might find yourself rocking out behind the wheel while playing this tune. 6. 'Georgia on My Mind' by Ray Charles - Ray Charles put a spin on this classic 1930 tune, making it at once a loving ode and a mournful ballad about his home state. 7.

With its calm, bluesy rhythm, it's also a great choice for a relaxing stretch of empty road. 9. 'Dirty Water' by the Standells - This song is often played at Red Sox games as a classic ode to Boston. While the lyrics describe some of the city's less savory qualities, with the 'dirty water' standing as a reference to the polluted River Charles and Boston Harbor, the song is widely recognized as a prideful anthem with the chorus repeating, \\"Oh Boston, you're my home.\\" 10. 'Drive My Car' by the Beatles - This is a great tune to sing along to, especially in the parts where the lyrics mimic car horns and other traffic sounds. 11. 'California Girls' by the Beach Boys - This is a great song to blast at high volume while approaching the western coastline. The lyrics extoll the virtues of women from all over the country, not just California. 12. 'Chicago' by Sufjan Stevens - You might think this song is about the city of Chicago based on its title, but the lyrics tell a story about driving all over the country, letting go of the past, and growing up."},{"prompt":"Write an article about workflow management systems (WFM).

It becomes hard to attain the level of productivity, agility, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness required to adapt and be competitive in today’s marketplace when your staff is using spreadsheets and manual, onerous processes to make entries and keep records at different levels of the organization. Oftentimes, the organization that relies on manual processes ends up either spending too much time scheduling the workforce or scheduling them at the wrong time. It’s even worse when by estimating anticipated workloads at the service center, managers end up over or under-scheduling the employees. This can lead to both employee and client dissatisfaction. It is imperative that managers take a proactive approach by implementing comprehensive and more advanced management and scheduling strategies to best prepare for unexpected events, such as surges in work volumes or unscheduled employee time off. This is where a workforce management solution comes in. A better workforce management strategy focuses on all the activities needed to cost-effectively create and sustain a productive and happy workforce. For this to happen, managers must be able to schedule people optimally for the work available for them to complete. This means having consistent procedures and policies around managing employee time and scheduling, attendance as well as times off. Naturally, there is optimal scheduling of employees at the service center, ensuring that the right number of employees handle the right amount of work at all times. Advancements in machine learning, computer modeling, and predictive and prescriptive analysis in big data present managers with smarter, more streamlined, and forward-looking approaches to employee scheduling – to replace the traditional, ineffective WFM models.

Spend time growing things that you'll use - it would be a waste to spend time and energy growing something that you won't be able to enjoy in the end. It's recommended to do some research into different types of plants you can grow that you can find useful for yourself. 3. Reliable supply of water - It can be draining having to carry water over to your garden repeatedly. It's recommended to invest in a good-quality hose that has a sprayer attachment to make watering the garden a lot easier. 4. Good soil is key - As you probably know, the soil will play an important role in how well the garden will grow as it's the means for stability, nutrients, and drainage. It's good to add as much organic matter as possible to help make sure the soil is providing the nutrients needed for the garden. 5. Amending the soil - Some common practices include using manure, compost, and leaf mold to help increase the soil to drain well and also hold moisture. It should be noted to never use fresh manure because it can contain dangerous pathogens that can harm plant roots."},{"prompt":"Could you please write an email to a parent informing them that their child has not done their homework and that they need to come up with much better excuses?","completion":"Dear Parent, Today during Robert's English lesson he was expected to hand in this week's homework.

How many times had the sock heard a muffled voice saying, “Oh, I love your shoes!” They never said, “Wow, those are great socks!” No one spent big money on socks as they did on shoes; they didn’t appreciate socks and put them on shelves or even in a nice row by the door. He and all the other socks were just thrown into a dark drawer to be forgotten! The sock simply hated not being a shoe. Although, being a sock was better than getting lost in the dryer.

Here's the source text: The 1915 theory, which is occasionally called Einstein's geometric theory of gravity, predicts that, as bowling balls placed on a trampoline create a depression, objects with mass cause the very fabric of space-time to warp. This curvature gives rise to the force of gravity. And the greater the mass of a cosmic object, the more extreme the warping of space it causes. Light travels across the universe in straight lines, but when it encounters a warp caused by a truly massive object, its path is curved. When the warping object is between Earth and a background object, it can curve light in such a way that the apparent position of the background object is shifted. But when the intermediate or \\"lensing object\\" is truly massive — like a monstrous cluster of galaxies, for example — light from the background source takes a different amount of time to reach Earth depending on how close it passes to the natural cosmic lens. This effect, called gravitational lensing, can make single objects appear at multiple points in the sky, often in stunning arrangements called Einstein rings and Einstein crosses. It can also cause background objects to appear amplified in the sky, a powerful effect that astronomers use to observe distant and early faint galaxies. The distortion caused by massive clusters like eMACS J1823.1+7822 can also help astronomers study mysterious dark matter, which accounts for around 85% of the mass in the universe but is invisible because it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. Because dark matter does interact gravitationally, however, the lensing of light by a galaxy or galactic cluster can help researchers map the distribution of dark matter.","completion":"This scientific news article discusses gravitational lensing, which is caused by massive cosmic objects and is in line with Einstein's theory of gravity. Objects with high mass can cause the bending of light paths due to the warping of space-time. Gravitational lensing occurs when a large object bends the path of light, causing a shift in the apparent position of a background object. Gravitational lensing creates stunning visual effects such as Einstein rings and crosses. Gravitational lensing helps astronomers see distant and faint galaxies by making them appear larger in the sky. Massive galaxy clusters like eMACS J1823.1+7822 help scientists map the distribution of dark matter, which makes up a significant portion of the universe's mass."},{"prompt":"Where is Mt.

These phases include the New Moon, Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Full Moon, Waning Gibbous, Third Quarter, and Waning Crescent. The moon's phases are a result of its position between the Earth and the Sun. As it orbits the Earth, different portions of the moon become illuminated by the Sun, leading to different phases. During a New Moon, the side of the moon facing Earth is not lit, appearing completely dark. As the moon moves in its orbit, a small sliver of the illuminated portion becomes visible, marking the Waxing Crescent phase. The illumination gradually increases until the First Quarter, when half of the moon is visible. The moon continues to wax until it reaches the Full Moon phase, where the entire face of the moon appears illuminated. Following the Full Moon, the moon wanes, with the illuminated portion gradually decreasing until it reaches the Third Quarter, marking half of the moon's face being visible. The illuminated portion continues to decrease, leading to the Waning Crescent phase, before transitioning back to the New Moon. These phases repeat in a continuous cycle, taking approximately 29.5 days to complete."},{"prompt":"Who was J Dilla?

Make it about 250 words.","completion":"1. Use cloth diapers. Disposable diapers make up almost 10 percent of nondurable household waste in landfills. Cloth diapers are more environmentally friendly and can be less expensive. 2. Breastfeed if possible. Manufacturing and transporting baby formula gives it a high carbon footprint. Breastfeeding protects the environment and provides a healthy source of nutrition. 3. Shop locally for groceries. Buying local food helps the environment and supports local businesses, plus when you buy organic, you avoid fertilizers and pesticides. 4. Make your baby food. Homemade baby food that contains fresh and healthy ingredients usually has more nutritional value and less sugar than pre-made brands. It also uses less packaging, which helps the environment. 5. Buy sustainable clothing. Avoid baby clothing made from synthetic materials that contribute to pollution. Look for clothes made from sustainable, natural fibers like cotton and wool. 6. Do eco-friendly laundry. Use warm water, not hot, and use eco-friendly detergents and fabric softeners. 7. Reuse and recycle. Kids outgrow many items before they wear them out. Reduce waste by shopping secondhand and donating used clothes, toys, books, and other products when your child no longer needs them. 8. Clean green. Avoid cleaning solutions with harmful chemicals. Make the switch to non-toxic and biodegradable cleaners. 9. Give your kids handmade toys. Every year, millions of plastic toys end up in landfills. Shop for handmade toys made from natural materials. 10. Teach by example. If you show your children that you care about nature and the environment, they’ll inherit your desire to protect the earth."},{"prompt":"Please respond to the email below.

You have a couple of months left before the beaches become the go-to destination to beat the heat. If you want to lose some of that extra weight or want to be able to fit in that bikini, here are some tips that will help you get there: 1. Drink water - drinking enough water to stay hydrated through the day will not only keep you healthy, but it will also help to clean your system. Plus, it can fill you up and help curb your hunger. 2. Cut out the excess carbs - carbohydrates (rice, sugar, sweets) are okay in moderation, but eating more than a candy bar a day will put extra sugar into your system that your body will not be able to burn off. This extra sugar will be turned into fat. Consider cutting down on the excess carbs and only consuming enough to get you through the day. 3. Fast - fasting doesn't necessarily require you to go days on end without eating any food. Lots of studies show that intermittent fasting (16-hour fasts) can be more than enough to help your body burn off any excess fat, due to the body needing energy to continue running and borrowing from fat reserves to keep going. 4. Exercise - get out and move about! Any exercise (even just walking 30 minutes a day) can burn calories and slim your body down. 5. Portion control - here's a good rule of thumb: if you eat three meals a day, make sure each portion of your meal (carbs, protein, vegetables) are the size of your closed fist. This is a good measurement of how much food you should be eating per meal, and it is a quick way to judge how much you should have without needing measuring cups or scales. 6. Cut out the fats - as with carbs, limit the amount of fat you eat. Too much fat in your mouth means too much fat on your hips. 7. Lift weights - resistance training helps to boost your fat-burning capability and tone your body. 8. Sleep - not getting enough sleep can stunt your metabolism while you are awake."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic acrostic poem about lighting.","completion":"Light up the sky and rend the silence with thundering booms, In search of shelter to avoid the shocks, Getting ready to hide if it gets too close, Hated weather but powerful to the core, Trees are falling all around, Next are the powerlines about to go down, Inside the TVs are turned off to be safe, Next thing you know, a bright light is in your face, Going to get candles because the power is out."},{"prompt":"Brainstorm for a discursive essay on whether tv is a bad influence on young people today. Make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of television. Consider both sides of the argument. Organise them in pros and cons. Television is one of the most popular devices that are used for entertainment all over the world. It has become quite common nowadays and almost every household has one television set at their place. In the beginning, we see how it was referred to as the ‘idiot box.’ This was mostly so because back in those days, it was all about entertainment. It did not have as many informative channels as it does now. Moreover, with this invention, the craze attracted many people to spend all their time watching TV. People started considering it harmful as it attracted the kids the most. In other words, kids spent most of their time watching television and not studying. However, as time passed, the channels of television changed. More and more channels were broadcasting with different specialities. Thus, it gave us knowledge too along with entertainment. Benefits of Watching Television The invention of television gave us various benefits. It was helpful in providing the common man with a cheap mode of entertainment. As they are very affordable, everyone can now own a television and get access to entertainment. In addition, it keeps us updated on the latest happenings of the world. It is now possible to get news from the other corner of the world. Similarly, television also offers educational programs that enhance our knowledge about science and wildlife and more. Moreover, television also motivates individuals to develop skills. They also have various programs showing speeches of motivational speakers. This pushes people to do better. You can also say that television widens the exposure we get. It increases our knowledge about several sports, national events and more. While television comes with a lot of benefits, it also has a negative side. Television is corrupting the mind of the youth and we will further discuss how. How Television is Harming the Youth Firstly, we see how television is airing inappropriate content which promotes all types of social evils like violence, eve-teasing and more. Secondly, it is also harmful to our health. If you spend hours in front of the television, your eyesight will get weak. Your posture will cause pain in your neck and back as well. Additionally, it also makes people addicted. People get addicted to their TVs and avoid social interaction. This impacts their social life as they spend their time in their rooms all alone. This addiction also makes them vulnerable and they take their programs too seriously. The most dangerous of all is the fake information that circulates on news channels and more. Many media channels are now only promoting the propaganda of the governments and misinforming citizens. This causes a lot of division within the otherwise peaceful community of our country. Thus, it is extremely important to keep the TV watching in check. Parents must limit the time of their children watching TV and encourage them to indulge in outdoor games. As for the parents, we should not believe everything on TV to be true. We must be the better judge of the situation and act wisely without any influence.","completion":"First of all the cons: - Too much TV makes you lazy. You may become a couch potato. You opt for an easy and often boring life. - You may become addicted. - You will miss out on socialising with your friends. You will miss out on participating in sports groups or activities in your local community. - Your schoolwork will suffer especially homework done in front of the TV. - You will have insufficient exercise, and you could put on weight which will lead to obesity and health risks later on. - You will get a backache or neck ache from bad posture. - You will get eyestrain from looking at a bright screen. - You could watch unsuitable – dodgy programs with violence or bad language. - You will be exposed to fake information and propaganda. Now the fors: - TV is a way of relaxing and de-stressing. - It is free entertainment. You do not have to think as you watch. You save money. - There is a wide choice of programs and tv can be educational and teach new skills. - It can motivate you because it shows speeches by motivational speakers. - TV is a way of staying well informed. It increases your knowledge. It is educational. - You can watch international sports events live. - You can learn about new sports."},{"prompt":"Can you suggest some fun ways to celebrate my parent's anniversary? They are not into lavish parties or dancing. They are more of a low-key couple who prefers quality time spent with family. Suggest a few outdoor activities, but also tell me something we can do at home.","completion":"Congratulations to your parents! Here are some warm, low-key parents' anniversary ideas that you can consider: 1. Host a Movie Extravaganza from the Comfort of Your Living Room: Create a cozy atmosphere at home by dimming the lights, snuggling up in blankets, and playing your parents’ favorite films one after the other. Pop some homemade popcorn or serve their preferred snacks, and watch your parents’ faces light up with happiness while enjoying a night of laughter, drama, romance, or suspense. 2. Relax and Reconnect: Pack a picnic basket with scrumptious sandwiches and refreshing drinks. Head to the park and find a cozy spot under a tree to enjoy a leisurely lunch. Spend the afternoon sharing stories and making memories. 3. Rise and Dine: Start their special day with a delicious breakfast at their favorite café. Spend some quality time together enjoying scrumptious food and sharing some light-hearted chats. 4. Treat Yourself and Your Parents to Some Sweet Delights: While your parents may not want to indulge in a big celebration, who can resist a delicious slice of cake or a decadent sundae? Take your parents to a cozy dessert spot and savor some shared sweets. Bond over your nostalgic childhood favorites or try new dessert delicacies together. 5. Unleash Your Inner Child: Keep the celebration fun and playful by indulging in activities that they love. Take them to a mini-golf course, or an amusement park, or even plan a scavenger hunt with the family! 6. Wander Around Your Neighborhood and Reconnect with Your Roots: Take a stroll with your parents around the local haunts they used to frequent or explore some undiscovered gems. Stop by the park where they used to have picnics, the corner cafe where they shared their first cup of coffee, or the street where they met. Use this time to create new memories together as a family."},{"prompt":"Can you show me how to make a little popup clock widget in javascript?","completion":"Certainly, here's a basic clock widget using JavaScript.

And the thing is, that this growth is actually quite visible with a great balance sheet. MAA is one of just eight REITs that are A- rated or better. Also 100% of their debt is fixed and although the company has about 8% of total debt (350-400 Million) maturing each year, the increase in interest expense is going to be quite gradual. The REIT is also amongst the least leverage with a net debt to EBITDA of 3.5x, compared to the average of peers (AVB, CPT, EQR, ESS, and UDR) of 4.9x. On top of this, the company pays a reliable dividend which has a long history of growth. The yield currently stands at 3.7%. And sure, I know that’s below treasury yields, but in my opinion investing in MAA at this time is strictly better than treasuries. This is because of capital appreciation and long-term inflation protection which treasuries simply don’t have. Moreover, if one invests in 2-year treasuries, what happens in two years when he needs to re-allocate his money? It could very well happen, that rates have dropped by them and asset prices have moved significantly higher, leaving the investor with a bitter taste. So once again, the yield is lowish, but it’s likely to continue to grow and very unlikely to get cut, given the history and a low payout ratio of just 61%. With everything I’ve shown you, you shouldn’t expect MAA to be cheap. Sure enough, it trades at 17x FFO which is in line with the historical average and on par with AVB which holds properties of similar quality in less popular legacy markets. Though I don’t think you can count on the market re-rating the stock to 20x anytime soon, with strong underlying revenue growth of 7% this year and 4-5% beyond that, you should easily make 8-10% per year, compounded for a very long time. That’s in line with the S&P 500 returns, but double the dividend and arguably a similar risk profile so it might be a good pick for some income oriented investors. That’s why I rate MAA as a BUY here.","completion":"Certainly, I'll be happy to turn these paragraphs into a series of questions and answers. It's important to remember that as an AI chatbot, I am not qualified to give financial advice, and you should consult with a financial professional for any personal investment decisions.

It is one of only eight REITs that are A- rated or better, and 100% of their debt is fixed. Q: How do MAA's debt maturity schedule and interest expense look? A: Although MAA has about 8% of total debt (450-400 million) maturing each year, the increase in interest expense is expected to be gradual. Q: How does MAA's leverage compare to its peers?

Q: What can you tell me about MAA's dividend history and yield? A: MAA pays a reliable dividend with a long history of growth. The current yield stands at 3.7%. Despite being below treasury yields, it offers potential for capital appreciation and long-term inflation protection. Q: How does MAA's yield compare to investing in treasuries? A: While the yield is lower compared to treasuries, MAA offers more potential due to capital appreciation and long-term inflation protection.

I don't really know what to do. The question is: explore the development of a character in Dracula.","completion":"Absolutely; please find some ideas below: • Johnathan Harker: Johnathan goes through quite a lot of changes in the novel Dracula. In the beginning, he is an effeminate and uncertain young man, easily taken in and manipulated by the Count. As his character develops and he becomes more violent and assertive, it would be interesting to discuss how violence from the Count is considered barbaric, whereas violence from Harker is presented as righteous. • Mina Harker: Mina changes dramatically throughout the story. She is a constant companion to Johnathan, from his rescue in Budapest to the fateful carriage-top battle at the end of the novel. Mina's character could be examined in the light of how she is closer and further away emotionally from Johnathan at different times in the book and how this reflects Victorian discomfort with foreigners and infidelity. • Quincy P Morris: Quincy is an interesting character as he says little but does much. Quincy is the 'good' equivalent of the Count - a violent and romantic foreigner that tempts Lucy. As his character is taciturn throughout much of the novel, at first glance, he develops little - but consider the parallels between the three foreigners in the novel. Also, consider how his death at the end of the novel is in tandem with the Counts. Is it accidental that both non-English perish? I hope that helps!

It can be a battery failure, a bad alternator, or a malfunctioning starter motor. Discuss them all briefly. Include a title and a very brief introduction","completion":"Here’s Why Your Vehicle is on Strike Doesn't it always ruin your mood when your car just wouldn't start after you last parked it? Here are some common reasons why this could be happening: 1. Alternator Troubles: If you hear a clicking noise instead of a roar, your alternator could be out of commission. The alternator is what charges your battery and powers your car's electrical system. If it's bad, your battery won't maintain a charge, causing your car to stall. 2. Ignition Apocalypse: Are you turning the key, but getting no response? Your ignition switch may be the culprit. It's responsible for supplying power to your car's electrical system when you turn the key. If it's not working properly, your car won't start. 3. Battery Blues: If you’re using four years old and never replaced it or you left your headlights on, you might find yourself with a dead battery. A dead battery won't give enough power to crank the engine, rendering your car useless. When it’s new, parking your car for like two weeks in a go can also kill the battery. 4. Timing Belt Issues: The timing belt regulates the movement of valves and pistons in your engine. If it breaks, it can ruin your engine and leave your car unable to start. Keep track of your car's manufacturer recommendations for when to change your timing belt to avoid this issue. 5. Damaged Distributor Cap: The engine's distributor cap is responsible for sending electricity from the ignition coils to the spark plugs. When the cap fails, the spark doesn't reach the right place, and the engine fails to start. 6. Trapped Steering Lock: If the steering wheel is locked due to incorrect usage, the ignition won't turn on, and the car won't start. It could also lead to a broken key or ignition barrel. 7. Sluggish Spark Plugs: Worn, fouled, or corroded spark plugs can lead to poor combustion, affecting engine performance. When they struggle to ignite the air-fuel mixture, the engine might refuse to start at all. 8. Stubborn Starter Motor: A malfunctioning starter motor can make clicking noises or have no response when you try to turn the key. The damage could be due to a dead battery, corroded wires, or a worn-out armature."},{"prompt":"Write about a chaotic travel story where someone has to travel to another city in time to make their flight the next morning, only to find that none of the buses to the next city are running that day.

Remember not to store the teas for too long with the tea bags in the water — the longer the tea bag is in the water after it has steeped, the stronger the flavor your tea will have, eventually turning into an overly bitter flavor.

Ale was shared, toasts were raised, and the atmosphere was quite rustic and charming. However, this day the tavern was a little more packed than usual; a traveling bard had come to visit the village. He worked by playing music for tips and a free night's stay. The bartender was happy to have him, he needed for little, was polite, and played his lute well. The bard was happy for the hospitality, and the chance to play his music for an audience. But occasionally, with so many people and with so much alcohol around, tensions would rise and a fight would be inevitable. Two big men, both who worked with lumber for the village, seemed to lose their sense of reason and civility, as they both stood up and started accusing each other of something. At first, they were mostly ignored, as people were known to get a bit rambunctious around this time. But then one of the men slammed his fist right down the table, splitting it in two. Everyone stopped to stare at the arguing men, and even the bard stopped his tune as all eyes were clearly on these two. The shouts started to get louder, although nobody had a clue what had gotten them so upset in the first place. Just then, the bard recalled a song his mother played for him as a child, that always brought calm to his heart. And so, he started to strum a new tune, one that filled him with a sense of nostalgia, and that started to draw the attention of the tavern goers once more. The shouting men didn't respond at first, but after a few seconds their shouts stopped, and they looked over at the bard as he played a beautiful, almost otherworldly melody. The anger drains from their faces, replaced by tears that start forming in their eyes, and they sat down in their chairs, enthralled by the melody. Finally, the bard finished his song, and the whole tavern, including the once-angry men, applauded the performance. The bard gave a bow, the men looked over at each other and forgave each other with a handshake, and peace returned to the tavern once more."},{"prompt":"Can you explain how electric heaters work?

The heating element is made with some type of electrically resistant material and that resistance causes the element’s temperature to rise and begin emitting heat. This heat is typically transferred to the heater’s core before sending it to the casing of the heater which holds onto that heat and transfers it to its surroundings.

Come up with some great ideas, but each of your idea should have a different type of style. Also, I don’t want to buy expensive costumes, so your suggestions shouldn’t include buying any pre-made costumes. Instead, just suggest things I can do to celebrate Halloween without a costume.","completion":"Sure! Here are some creative Halloween ideas for kids you can try without having to go buy an expensive costume: 1. Accessorize: Spice up any outfit with a festive headband! Try it with a witch hat or cat ears – a simple headpiece can instantly give your kiddo a Halloween vibe. It's a fun way to get in the spirit without committing to a full costume. 2. Orange It Up: Who says you need a costume to rock some holiday-themed colors? Encourage your little one to incorporate some orange into their outfit – it works on everything from a bright sweater to some spooky socks. It’s an easy (and affordable) Halloween look. 3. Jewelry-making 101: Bond with your child while making a statement necklace or bracelet that screams Halloween. Gather some spooky charms or beads and string them onto elastic or wire. You can spend some quality time together while also getting festive! 4. Bold Moves: Your little one doesn't need a mask or full-face paint to make a statement. A bold lip or dramatic eyeliner can be just as eye-catching! Have fun experimenting with different shades and patterns – from spiderweb-inspired liners to glittery lips – for a Halloween-inspired beauty look. 5. Don't Let Your Nails Feel Left Out: Halloween isn't just about costumes, it's also about spooky nails! Use nail polish to create your creepy designs, from spider webs to monster claws, and have a mini nail salon day with your kids. 6. Embrace the Pumpkin Spice: Who needs a fancy costume when you can rock a pumpkin tee? Grab some plain t-shirts from a local craft store and let your kids decorate them with paint, markers, or even glitter. It can be as simple or as elaborate as they want, and will still be ready for some Halloween fun!"},{"prompt":"Can you write me a short story about a baseball player in a big game?

This guy could really throw. I tried not to think too much about how fast, but it was clear this pitcher was throwing close to 100 mph. Down by just 1 run, we desperately needed a baserunner. If I could find a way to get on base, it would give Jake a real chance to change the game. I wanted to swing for the fences, to go for the glory of a home run... but I knew the chances of that were slim. I've hit a few of them, but I was by no means a big power threat. I had made my way onto this team by competing every at-bat, hustling on every ball in play, and doing whatever I could do to help my team win. And I needed to stay true to that now with the game on the line. I flipped my bat, tapping the knob to the ground and dropping the donut. I took one more big hack before making my way to the batter's box. I stepped up to the plate and performed my ritual. Tap each side of the plate and then tap once in the middle. I loaded the bat to my shoulder and got set for the pitch. The pitcher smirked at me before starting his delivery. He threw a fastball that looked like it was headed straight for my head as I jumped out of the way. Ball one. But that was part of his plan. He wanted to back me off the plate. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction. I crept back up to the plate, inching closer this time. He wound up and delivered again, again coming inside. I turned away from the pitch before it reached me, instincts screaming at me to jump away. \\"Strike one!\\" yelled the umpire. He'd caught the inside corner, and I had jumped away like a coward. Never again. I crept in toward the plate again, crowding it this time.

Pretend you're Dr. Doofenshmirtz. Give me a numbered list of instructions. We drive to the left in my current location. Throw in warnings about Perry the Platypus and jealous references to your brother Roger.","completion":"Hello there, so you want to learn to parallel park? Good idea, because only then can you fully take over the Tri-State Area. Of course, my perfect brother Roger already knows how to parallel park. Here are the steps to parallel parking: 1. First ensure that Perry the Platypus is nowhere nearby because he's sure to foil your perfect parking plans. 2. Drive as close to the car in front of the parking spot you wish to take as possible. Brake gently, and use your left turn signal to indicate that you want to park. Pull your car about 2 feet next to the car in front of your desired parking spot, stopping when your rear bumper is aligned with its rear bumper. 3. Looking out for any suspicious beaver tails and fedoras, shift into reverse and start turning your wheel to the left as you back up. Once the back of your seat is even with the rear bumper of the vehicle beside you, turn your steering wheel quickly and evenly towards the spot until your vehicle is at a 45-degree angle as it enters the spot. Be sure to look over your shoulder as you back up to make sure there's nothing in your blind spot. Perfect Roger, of course, can skip this step because he has no blind spots. 4. Once your rear tire is about 18 inches from the curb and your front bumper is next to the rear bumper of the vehicle in front, start turning your steering wheel to the right to straighten the car up while still reversing. 5. Once you're fully in the space, you'll likely have to center your vehicle in the space between the spots in front of you and behind you by moving your car slowly and carefully backward or forwards. Be careful not to scrape the other cars. Also, watch out for Perry the Platypus. Congratulations, by following these steps you have successfully parallel parked!

It was creepy.” “I just saw him last night. He seemed fine then.” My stomach tightened. This was the first one we knew personally. What was going on in this city? “Did he talk at all?” I knew he hadn’t. None of them had. “Nope. It was eerie. He was raking his yard on autopilot. I even got in front of him, thinking he’d have to notice me, but he veered to the side and kept right on raking like he was some kind of robot. I called someone to keep an eye on him.” My hands curled into fists. This made five people who had been, for want of a better term, lobotomized. “What the heck could do this? It makes no sense.” Robert’s eyebrows furrowed. “And none of them have anything in common. They don’t live anywhere near each other. Their ages are not really similar. I mean one of them is a great-grandmother. Her family is devastated.” I sighed. “If it was just her, we could think maybe it was dementia or something. But we have five now and one is a 15-year-old kid.” That one grated on me the most. He was just a kid. His parents were frantic. They’d had to lock him up to keep him from mindlessly playing soccer when his father had to grab him out of the road where he was acting out a full-on game without even realizing there was traffic. “They sedated the second woman, and it had no effect.” Robert’s fingers toyed listlessly with a breadstick. “Well, it did have an effect, just the opposite of what the doctors wanted. She started screaming and fighting with everyone. “I was there for that.” I cringed. “They ended up locking her in a room on the 6th floor where the psych holds are. She was sitting on the bed staring at nothing when I left.” “I suppose we’d better go back to work,” Robert dropped a credit card onto the restaurant check. “I have a feeling these five are only the beginning.”"},{"prompt":"What type of ecosystem is the Everglades in Florida?","completion":"The Everglades in Florida is an area classified as a subtropical wetland ecosystem.

Can you give me some ideas for practices to use to attract and engage with my Instagram following?","completion":"Here are a few practices used by Instagram influencers and business owners to attract and engage with their followers. 1. Create an Effective Bio - One of the first things you should do to attract more followers on Instagram is to create an effective bio. You have a limited amount of characters to work with and one URL, so you need to make each word count. It may seem obvious that you should put your website's URL on your bio, however, if you do you will not have the opportunity to engage as much with your followers. Instead, it is better to use this link to direct people to a landing page that has a list of links to offer. By doing this, you can direct your followers to an endless number of links simply by pointing them to your bio. 2. Use Organic Tactics to Enhance Brand Awareness - Growth hacking is a term that is used by many digital marketing experts. It is the process of trying out various online marketing strategies to find out which tactics work the best. While there are many applications and programs out there that are designed to help you boost your follower count fast, you may not always end up with followers who are genuinely interested in your brand or what your company has to offer. The best way to make sure your follower count grows is by using organic tactics. By choosing the right hashtags and keywords to add to your profile and your captions, you will guarantee your followers are there because they want to be and are interested in what you are selling. 3. Create a list of Hashtags that Work - Hashtags are the keywords for your Instagram posts, and they play an important part in helping you increase traffic to your account. Create a list of hashtags related to your brand and keep them in a place where they are easily accessible. You can store them in your phone's notepad app, and you will be able to quickly cut and paste all your hashtags at once into your posts instead of having to type them in manually. 4. Use Story Highlights - Story highlights on Instagram make it easy to save the best stories you have created and showcase them on your profile for your followers to view anytime. This is a great feature when you want to add more details to your profile page but you aren't able to due to limitations on character count. 5. Make Each Caption a Mini-blog - Your captions are very valuable, and it's a good idea to plan and create intriguing captions that will get the attention of your target audience. Some customers may like a long caption that gives them more details about your company. Others may prefer to read a shorter post that features videos or graphics. Over time, you will eventually learn which option works best for your audience. 6. Add a CTA To Your Posts - When you make an Instagram post, you want to include a call to action. There are many ways you can do this, and a CTA doesn't always have to be a sales push. You can ask your followers to like the photo, tag a friend who may be interested, or ask them to leave a comment letting you know what improvements they would like to see in your products. 7. Take Advantage of Live Chat or Live Streaming - Sharing fun live-stream videos focused on your brand's products is an excellent way to get the word out to your target audience. Your followers can choose to get a notification whenever you go live, and they can also ask questions during your live stream. It's like an interactive infomercial that allows you to reach out to those who are interested in the products or services you have to offer."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this description of how to deal with negative thoughts and emotions into a set of instructions. ...we call these insistent visitors or difficult repetitive thought patterns the Top Ten Tunes. Normally when thinking arises, we can simple name it \\"thinking, thinking,\\" and in the light of awareness it will vanish like a cloud. However, the Top Ten Tunes, whether as words, images, or stories, will persist and return no matter how often they are noticed. They play like records, repeating a theme over and over. At first, to gain perspective, we can number them one through ten. \\"Oh, that is three on the hit parade this week.\\" In that way, when we notice them, we don't have to play the record all the way through each time and we can more easily let them go. Or we can use a variation of the technique and give them a humorous name or title. I have given names to many now familiar aspects of myself, such as \\"The Hungry Survivor,\\" \\"Mr. Achiever,\\" \\"Attila the Hun,\\" \\"Baby Jack,\\" \\"Fear of the Dark,\\" \\"The Impatient Lover.\\" In this way, the repeated patterns of fear, sorrow, impatience, or loneliness become more familiar, and I listen to their stories in a friendlier and openhearted way. \\"Hello, nice to see you again! What do you have to tell me today?\\" However, this is not enough. Suppose we encounter a repeated story about the divorce of our parents. It talks over and over about which children go to keep which possessions, and who said what to whom. Such a story can play many times. As it does, we must expand our field of attention: How does this thought feel in our body? Oh, there is a tightness in the diaphragm and the chest. We can name this, \\"tightness, tightness,\\" and stay meticulously attentive for some time. As we do, it may open to other sensations, and many new images and feelings will be released. In this way, we can first begin to release the physical contractions and bodily fear that we have held. Then we can expand the attention further to new feelings. What feelings arise along with this thought pattern and this tightness? At first they may be half hidden or unconscious, but if we sense carefully, the feelings will begin to show themselves. The tightness in the chest will become sadness, and the sadness may become grief. As we finally begin to grieve, the pattern will release. In a similar way, when we encounter a repeated physical pain or difficult mood, we can expand awareness to the level of thoughts, the story or belief that comes along with it. With careful attention, we may find a subtle belief about ourselves that perpetuates the pain or mood, perhaps a story about our unworthiness, such as \\"I'll always be this way.\\" When we become aware of the story or belief, and see it as just that, often the pattern is released. Repeated thoughts and stories are almost always fueled by an unacknowledged emotion or feeling underneath. These unsensed feelings are part of what brings the thought back time and again. Future planning is usually fueled by anxiety. Remembering of the past is often fueled by regret, or guilt, or grief. Many fantasies arise as a response to pain or emptiness. The task in meditation is to drop below the level of the repeated recorded message, to sense and feel the energy that brings it up. When we can do this, and truly come to terms with the feeling, the thought will no longer need to arise, and the pattern will naturally fade away.","completion":"Sometimes, our minds will have insistent visitors: thoughts and feelings that keep coming back. When we notice and name them, and see them as what they are, we can more easily let them go. 1. Make a list of the top ten thoughts and emotions your mind plays that don't serve you well. 2. When you notice the thought or emotion in your mind, think of them like popular songs playing, and remember \\"ah, that's #3 on the hit parade this week!\\" 3. Try giving a specific name to the insistent thought pattern (\\"songs\\") like \\"Mr. Achiever\\" or \\" The Impatient Lover.\\" 4. After naming the thought patterns, try to listen to their stories in a friendly and openhearted way. Let the stories of fear, sorrow, impatience, or loneliness become more familiar and see what you can learn from them. However, sometimes we encounter repeated stories about our lives that are very difficult to put to rest. As we learn how to properly grieve these stories, the thought pattern may be released. 1. Expand your field of attention. How does your body feel when you have the thought? Is there a tightness somewhere? 2. Name the physical feelings in your body. You can simply say \\"tightness, tightness.\\" 3. Stay attentive to these physical sensations for some time. 4. Try to notice: Are there any other sensations or feelings that arise along with this thought pattern or tightness? What things have gone unacknowledged when these thoughts arise? Are there subtle beliefs about ourselves that perpetuate our mood or pain? Stories of our unworthiness? 5. As you learn what feelings, thoughts, and sensations arise, you can finally grieve them so that the pattern can be released. Unsensed feelings are what can bring thoughts back time and time again. When we can recognize the stories we are telling ourselves, and recognize them as just that (stories), the pattern may be released."},{"prompt":"Write an original short story of less than 350 words that ends with the line “the colors bled together.” Set the story in an urban environment and make the audience feel sad for the main character; then, tie a past storyline and a present storyline together.","completion":"On the wall was a painting that had been created nearly twenty years ago to the day. The painting was titled “What I Thought I Wanted” and lacked an artist’s signature, but the gallery owner knew who the abstract colored canvas belonged to—the art was created by a child a long time ago. The child was without its mother and in an area it was not familiar with. It had only its book bag with it, although it had not attended a school that day. While it may have seemed to happen abruptly and without notice, the child had provided hints for some time—only, it was now that the child’s intentions of running away became obvious enough for anyone to notice. Without much of a plan, the child had no real goals set out except for one: leaving home. It was already less than ideal weather when the child left the night before, but now the rain was beginning to fall with the sinking sun. Alone, and on the side of the road, the child sat on the curb and laid the book bag at its side. The sprinkling rain turned to a heavy downpour, sending the child beneath a nearby awning. Finding a moment of peace, the child realized their book bag was left alone and went to retrieve the soaked pack. Under the temporary shelter, the child regretted everything and all it wished for was to be back home when, suddenly, a car wheeled into the curb where the child stood and flung the door wide open. The car was driven by the child’s mother who had been searching for nearly twenty-four hours straight on zero sleep, looking for her child. Jumping into the car and apologizing, the child checked the contents of its bag to assess the rain’s damage. Within, the wet paint containers had leaked out onto the only canvas the child brought with it.

Soon thereafter, he was celebrated for something that made him different. However, Tio loved his new attention so much that he became arrogant! What was once a heroic tiger had turned into a vain creature. Tio even became mean to the tigers with shorter tails. He had completely changed. One day, an elderly monkey visited Tio to remind him of his previous good deed and told him that appearances aren’t everything––Tio was once a nice tiger, and now he was pompous.

It’s been a while since I wrote an article on a residential REIT. In my previous articles, I’ve tried to articulate my stance towards legacy vs sunbelt markets, concluding that I don’t see either as significantly positioned. While legacy markets will see lower demand, this will be counter-balanced by lower supply. Sunbelt markets on the other hand, will see some of the highest levels of supply ever, but this will be offset by an influx of people and jobs. For my detailed outlook on the Sunbelt, check out my article on BSR REIT (OTCPK:BSRTF). Today I want to cover Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) which is a high-quality REIT, regarded by many as the safest one to invest into right now. Why do so many investors like it? It’s quite simple. Its geographical presence is heavily focused on growing markets in the Sunbelt, with their largest markets being Atlanta (13%), Dallas (10%), and Tampa (7%). This could also be considered the biggest risk as the supply is really high and demand might slow down in the future but I personally don't see it as a threat since the demand seems to be keeping up so far. The REIT owns high quality buildings as 92% of the portfolio is classified as A- or better. This corresponds with the fact that they tend to focus on higher income individuals with average rents amongst the highest of any residential REITs. Last year, as well as at the start of 2023, has been great for MAA as they managed to retain high occupancy of 95.5% and their rents increased by 13.5% fueled by inflation. Management is expecting these positive trends to continue in all of 2023, forecasting 6.25% revenue growth on the whole portfolio and a matching NOI growth. Occupancy is expected to tick up slightly to 95.8% at midpoint. That’s a really positive outlook at a time when the share price, as we’ll see shortly, is very low. The point I want to make clear is that MAA has grown their cash-flows by double digits last year, and is on its way to continue growing, though at a slower pace, also this year. Per share, 2023 FFO is expected at 9.11 at midpoint which would represent a 7% YoY growth.","completion":"Q: What is your stance towards legacy vs sunbelt markets? A: My stance is neutral as I believe both markets are equally positioned. Legacy markets will experience lower demand counter-balanced by lower supply, while Sunbelt markets will see high levels of supply offset by an influx of people and jobs. Q: Which specific REIT are you discussing today? A: Today, I'm discussing Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA), which is considered a high-quality, safe REIT to invest in. Q: Why do many investors favor Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)? A: Investors favor MAA due to its focus on growing markets in the Sunbelt region, with a significant presence in Atlanta, Dallas, and Tampa. Additionally, it boasts a portfolio of high-quality buildings, with 92% classified as A- or better. Q: How did MAA perform last year and what's the expectation for 2023? A: MAA performed well, maintaining a high occupancy of 95.5% and increasing rents by 13.5% due to inflation. For 2023, management forecasts 6.25% revenue growth, a similar NOI growth, and a slight increase in occupancy to 95.8%. Q: What was MAA's cash-flow growth last year and what's the forecast for 2023? A: MAA saw double-digit cash-flow growth last year. In 2023, though growth is expected to slow down, they still expect an increase. The forecasted 2023 FFO per share is 9.11, representing 7% YoY growth."},{"prompt":"What can I do with my blog posts to further engagement?

What are some examples of tool use among Capuchin monkeys?","completion":"Capuchin monkeys, particularly those found in South and Central America, have been observed using tools in several unique ways that demonstrate their problem-solving abilities and cognitive sophistication. One of the most well-known examples of tool use in Capuchin monkeys is their use of stones as hammers and anvils to crack open hard nuts. This behavior isn't instinctive but learned over time and passed down through generations, a clear indication of a form of culture. It also demonstrates planning and foresight as Capuchins are known to select special types of stones and even transport them for future use. Capuchins also use tools for foraging in other contexts. They use sticks to dig into termite mounds or to reach invertebrates hidden in tree bark. Another interesting example is the use of branches or reeds to catch small mammals. They poke the stick into a hole where a small mammal might be hiding, causing the frightened creature to bolt and become an easy prey item."},{"prompt":"Write an outline for an essay on Twitter alternatives.

Can you write a short summary of the original Jurassic Park movie but do it as if Elmo from Sesame Street were explaining it to a child","completion":"Hi friends! It’s your favorite red monster, Elmo! Today, Elmo is going to tell you a story about dinosaurs! Do you know dinosaurs? Dinosaurs lived a long time ago, but some very smart people figured out how to make new ones. They were going to put them in a dinosaur zoo! They called it Jurassic Park. Elmo would love to see a dinosaur zoo. Wouldn’t you? But there was a problem before the zoo was finished. Some of the dinosaurs were dangerous and they hurt a worker. The zoo’s leaders needed some experts to make sure it would be a good zoo. So, they called some dinosaur experts along with a math expert for some reason. The experts took a tour along with some kids. But a bad guy caused more problems. He wanted to steal stuff, and he turned off all the electricity so nobody would know what he was doing. When the power was out, the dinosaurs escaped! Another person got hurt by the T-rex dinosaur and the rest of them had to run away. They spent all day and night getting back to the zoo’s main building where the workers were. Meanwhile, the workers and one of the dino experts had a lot of trouble turning the electricity back on. Elmo usually just flips the light switch, but they had to go to a special building to do it. The first guy who tried got hurt by some smart and speedy dinosaurs called Raptors. Eventually, they turned the power on, but the dinosaurs were already loose. After the people who ran away finally walked back to the building, they had to hide from the raptors. The Raptors almost got them, but a T-rex showed up just in time and protected them! That gave them a chance to go to a helicopter and fly away from the island! It sure is a scary story, but it’s also exciting, don’t you think? What would you do at a zoo full of dinosaurs? Well, that’s all the time Elmo has for today. See you next time!"},{"prompt":"Hey AI, can you provide me with a list of five different cities to visit in the USA?

I think they're capable of more than what people might think, and I want to use the IDEA law to back up my ideas.","completion":"The goal of education is for every student to learn and grow into a person who is prepared for adult life. This should apply to all children, regardless of disability. In the case of children who are part of the special education program, it can be easy to say that they are not capable of learning and growing to the same degree as children in the general education setting, so it is less important to help them. However, the idea that every single child deserves the best education possible is not as impossibly idealistic as it may sound. IDEA, a law that was passed in 2004, supports the idea that not only are children with disabilities capable of being educated, but they deserve a free and appropriate education that prepares them for further education, employment, and independent living. Because of this, I believe that children in special education should have as much opportunity as possible to participate in the general curriculum, while still having all of their individual needs met. Schools should make sure that every child, whether they are part of the special education program or not, can thrive."},{"prompt":"When was the first Harry Potter book published?","completion":"On June 26, 1997, J.

A Shepherd Boy tended his master's Sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. .

His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away.

A regular digital computer performs data processing tasks by manipulating bits; each bit can have a value of one or zero.

Qubits can have a value of one, zero or both simultaneously. When the bit is simultaneously a one and a zero, the bit is said to be in a state of superposition. Moreover, the state of one qubit can influence another qubit, even if they are separated by great distance, in this case, the states are said to be entangled.

Emphasis Create emphasis in your Excel dashboard to ensure it stands out. You can do this using contrasting colors and different text, such as varying sizes and bold text. Emphasis will help your dashboard be easier to use and navigate. Avoid using bright colors; instead, opt for subtle shades, etc. To separate rows, you can use subtle color contrast to make the dashboard easier to read. 2. Connect different elements. You can visually show different elements on your dashboard and connect them with your alignment. Visualizing data is easier for us when it is formatted properly. Ensure your data is displayed in a way that is easy to read and understand. The use of shapes and charts can be beneficial here. 3. Draw parallels and create associations. Your dashboard should be completely consistent concerning abbreviations and color usage. Standard abbreviations or shorthand, such as arrows and math functions, can make your dashboard easier to read and understand. 4. Organise and create focal points. Ensure your dashboard is as helpful as possible by grouping content relevant to each other and creating focal points that catch the reader's eye and attention. An example of this is grouping Committed, receipted, and outstanding spend for a budget close to each other to ensure the reader knows that these metrics are dependent on each other and related to each other. 5. Balance big and small elements. If you have larger and smaller charts, then utilize them both. However, be sure to position them in a place that makes sense and align them so things look tidy. A large chart followed by a small chart followed by a medium chart looks tacky to try to align all 3 in one area."},{"prompt":"Give me a short poem (about two stanzas) about a snowman and his pet snow dog.

Here is the text. Sonic also famously boasts one of the largest and strangest online fandoms, and the movie makes nods to several memes, none of which distract from the plot. The film is in on the joke. It feels like a friend made it. And that’s the difference between this and so many other video game films. Tyson Hesse, a Sonic fan artist who eventually began official work on the franchise, was brought in to salvage the film from the backlash of the horrifying original design Paramount Pictures proposed. Redesigning Sonic was not only smart, it was necessary. The original design was so terrible, it would’ve sunk this otherwise heartwarming and expertly crafted film. Sonic fans have long been victimized by a gauntlet of mediocre-to-terrible video games. The memes have been a way to cope. It’s no surprise that Sonic Mania, a 2018 fan-led Sega game to which Hesse contributed, remains one of Sonic’s few bright spots this century. Adding a messy Sonic movie to the lineage of bad games and tie-ins would have been tragic. Speaking of Sonic Mania, sharp-eared Sonic fans will hear some familiar tunes. Yes, you’ll even hear the piano jazz stylings of Jon Batiste, band leader for “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and lifelong Sonic fan","completion":"Sonic has a large online fanbase, and that fanbase is largely to thank for the film's success considering the studio had to completely redesign Sonic following backlash to their original proposal.

Notable patients in the movie were played by Danny Devito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif. The movie takes place in a mental hospital and starts with the patients playing a game of cards until you see RP McMurphy get admitted and he shakes up the \\"normalcy\\" of the ward and pushes Nurse Ratched every opportunity he gets. There are regular meetings run by Nurse Ratched. Early on, Nurse Ratched starts the meeting by having one of the patients tell the story about how his wife is cheating on him, and she wants the group to share their thoughts on the matter. Near the end of the meeting, the camera focuses on Jack Nicholson's character, as he is eyeing Nurse Ratched suspiciously and then shows her face. You can feel Jack Nicholson's emotion of wondering what Nurse Ratched's true intentions are. The movie follows a similar format with a good amount of runtime showing the meetings, but slowly RP McMurphy involves himself more so and tries to allow himself and the patients to have more fun. He wants to be able to watch the world series, which Nurse Ratched would allow if over half the patients voted yes on it. First, only a few people want to watch, then RP McMurphy convinces more and more of the patients to vote yes, but Nurse Ratched again doesn't allow it when she counts the patients that didn't attend the meeting as no votes. During the movie, RP McMurphy gets close to the Chief, a Native American who the staff believes is dumb and deaf. They enjoy a basketball game with the orderlies and Chief plays a big role in scoring baskets for the patients' team and holding the net and pushing the ball through the opponent's basket so it doesn't count."},{"prompt":"Write a < 300-word article about graduating from high school early.

Often life takes us down roads we haven't figured out just yet, and we find things are not unfolding just the way we had imagined. This is all a part of life. Sometimes it pays to be flexible. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to graduate early, then there are several ways to accomplish this. Remember that your high school diploma is more than just a piece of paper: it’s the key to a better future. There are numerous methods of graduating early and only you can determine which is best for your situation. Be sure and speak with parents, teachers, or guidance counselors in order to get some helpful advice on what to do. All of us need help from time to time to make the best decision, and this is true whether you are 16 or 60. The first thing to determine is whether or not your high school will allow you to graduate early. Each school district has its own policies and they differ from state to state. The second thing you should check on is how many credits you will need to graduate. Though you may not have enough to skip an entire grade in high school, you may have enough to skip one semester. Also be sure to find out which credits you need: whether that's math, PE, English, science, etc. If possible, you may be able to attend summer school to get these credits.

What part do honey bees play in this process?","completion":"Bees collect flower nectar to produce honey. The nectar gets stored as simple sugars and broken down inside the honeycomb. The honeycomb's design combined with how the bees fan their wings causes the honey to turn into a liquid form. The flavor and color of honey can vary depending on the type of nectar collected. Orange blossom honey may be lighter in color, while avocado or wildflower honey may be a darker amber color. One hive can produce 55 pounds of surplus money every year. Beekeepers collect the honeycomb frames and scrape off the wax cap that bees use to seal the honey inside the honeycomb. Honey is then forced out of the comb by a centrifuge that extracts the honey. The honey is strained to remove any debris that is not edible. The honey may be heated to make this process easier, but the honey's natural composition is not altered by this process. The honey is bottled and labeled after straining.

His second job, as King Arthur in an Edinburgh production, got such a bad review it made him cry. However, things began to look up when he landed a part in the award-winning BBC TV production of Takin' Over the Asylum. Tennant played manic-depressive Campbell Bain, a role that he claims changed his life. \\"They needed someone who could believably act 19 and bonkers.\\" He could, and did, to much acclaim, and followed it up with a much-praised performance as the page boy in What the Butler Saw at the Lyttelton. Then in 1996, when he was just 25, Tennant joined the Royal Shakespeare Company. His turn as Touchstone in As You Like It was praised as the most memorable in years. He was also applauded for his Jack Lane in The Herbal Bed, his leading role in Romeo and Juliet, and his portrayals of Antipholus of Syracuse in The Comedy of Errors (for which he received a a 2000 Ian Charleson Award nomination for Best classical actor under 30) and Captain Jack Absolute in The Rivals.

It should be conciliatory in tone and end with the valediction, \\"All the best\\".","completion":"Hey Jim, So first off, I want to assure you that I know Audrey, and there is no way she's offended. She really did mean it when she said you didn't have to give her a gift, and she respects your attempt to show your appreciation. And her reaction really didn't have anything to do with you. It was just poor timing. You know how particular she is with her whiskey. It's not just her favorite tipple, you know. It's a major hobby of hers, maybe even a part of who she is. And she was just saying yesterday about how stupid she thought whiskey stones were. And then you went and got her some the next day! I know you didn't know, and I've told Audrey that you didn't know. Again, just a really bad coincidence. If you want to know why she doesn't like them, they're like a poseur thing. They solve a problem that people like Audrey don't even see as a problem. Personally, this is why I don't get anyone a gift that's directly related to their hobby. There's just too much of a chance you get something wrong about something that they're definitely going to be particular about. Unless you really know them and that interest, it's probably better to get something that you know people will need. Last year I got my work friends a set of phone chargers for Christmas, believe it or not. Anyway, it's all water under the bridge. You'll go to work with Audrey on Monday, and you'll still be friends. No big deal.

May 27; 100 years ago today Heinz Alfred Kissinger was born in Furth, Germany, and this past week he made headlines throughout the world with his reflections on the shifting geopolitical realities of Central Europe. It was as if he chose to send the world a centennial birthday greeting that he remains, as he has been for 70 years, an outstandingly lucid and perceptive authority on the strategic balances and constantly shifting correlation of forces between the major powers of the world. What an astonishing century he has had. No one could possibly have imagined in Henry Kissinger's early youth that the European state most accommodating of its Jewish population would a decade later be governed by a genocidally anti-Semitic and totalitarian dictatorship. When he and his parents and his brother, all of whom would live well into their 90’s, departed Germany a few months before the infamous Kristallnacht of November, 1938, and arrived in New York on the famous liner Ile de France, it would have been hard to imagine that he would return to Germany in just seven years and as a 22-year-old Sergeant in the United States Army would be the military governor of a town approximately as large as that, 200 miles away, where he was born. When he was in his late teens, working in a New York toothbrush factory and attending school at night, and struggling to master English, it would have challenged credulity to think that he would develop an extraordinarily fluent and sophisticated articulation in English, while retaining a German accent so pronounced that he sometimes sounds like one of the Marx brothers imitating Kaiser Wilhelm. When he seriously launched his academic career, it would have been conceivable but hugely unlikely that within ten years he would achieve such an eminence in foreign policy matters as a lecturer and as an author, that he would have a substantial, if not universally approved, influence on the foreign and strategic policy of the greatest power in the world, where he had not long been resident. This was the impact of his seminal book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy (1957), which suggested the development of median alternatives to the Eisenhower policy of massive retaliation. Improbable though it was that a young academic fugitive from the Nazis would have such an influence in the United States so soon, it was much more improbable that he would, 15 years later, play a decisive role in negotiating the greatest arms control agreement in the history of the world, that incidentally restored American nuclear superiority.","completion":"1. This past week, Heinz Alfred Kissinger once again made headlines around the world. 2. On May 27, 2023, Kissinger turned 100, and he took the opportunity to share his reflections on the shifting political realities of Central Europe. 3. His 100 years on Earth have been amazing. 4. Of note, Henry Kissenger's early years were lived in Europe's most tolerant society. A society that in just a decade would turn into the most anti-semitic country in Europe. A country that would be ruled by a genocidal regime and a totalitarian dictator. 5. Kissinger, his brother and his parents left Germany just months before Kristallnacht in November 1938. 6. Arriving in New York, Henry was soon working in a factory and going to school at night trying to master the English language. 7. Just 7 years later, Kissinger would be back in Germany as a 22-year-old sergeant in the United States Army serving as a military governor in a town only 200 miles from where was born. 8. Clearly, as Kissinger ventured into an academic career a few years later, no one could have imagined that he would become one of the most articulate and skillful speakers on foreign policy and nuclear arms strategic thinking in the United States as well as in the Western world. 9. Henry Kissinger went on to be one of the most influential speakers, writers and thinkers on behalf of the most powerful country in the world where he had not long been a resident. 10. Furthermore his book, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy in 1957, led to his continued involvement in nuclear arms policy and ultimately to his negotiation of the greatest arms control agreement in the history of the world. 11.

I imagine we both would prefer we became the new princess, but I knew I'd be happy for her and enjoy spending time in the castle if she were chosen. Maybe I'd even get some important job or meet another prince. I believe she felt the same about me. She'd never given me any reason to doubt it. I suppose we were so focused on seeing the tower that we took a misstep and found a patch of wood we'd never visited before. It was dark, and there was a green glow. We were both covered in the glow. Suddenly I looked at my friend with hatred. She might be the princess one day, and what would I be? A commoner still. Why did she deserve it more than me? Her nose is bigger than mine. Looking at her face, I noticed her expression. Her face was gnarled by the same hatred I felt inside myself. I knew I'd never seen her look that way before. And, in that moment, it dawned on me.

A surge in travel demand after airlines slashed resources during the pandemic caught carriers flat footed. Unable to adequately staff flights, they nevertheless continued to sell record-breaking numbers of tickets, resulting in more than one in five flights being delayed, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics — the highest rate of delays since 2014. By Memorial Day last year, airfares were soaring, and flight cancellations started to mount. The situation worsened over the summer, as bouts of disruptive weather left passengers stranded and forced Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to call a meeting with airline CEOs. While autumn was mostly free of disruptions, the year ended with a winter storm that brought airline travel to a standstill, especially at Southwest Airlines.","completion":"During 2022, excessive demand for flights and the recent lack of resources to supply them resulted in nightmarish conditions for the industry, especially for workers in understaffed environments. Despite the lacking conditions, airlines still sold massive amounts of tickets, causing numerous delays that outweighed those of several years prior. Throughout the year, complications in weather and other factors caused the form of travel to be more expensive, less reliable, and in the wintertime to come to a complete halt in some cases."},{"prompt":"What does ABAB mean in Poetry?

Categories are: Jews, Muslims, Christians, Atheists <<Study: Social Media and Atheism Linked to Higher Suicide Risk Among Teens Michael Foust | ChristianHeadlines.com Contributor | Friday, May 26, 2023 Study: Social Media and Atheism Linked to Higher Suicide Risk Among Teens ChristianHeadlines.com STUDY: SOCIAL MEDIA AND ATHEISM LINKED TO HIGHER SUICIDE RISK AMONG TEENS Share Tweet Teenagers who are heavily influenced by social media and who don’t have a firm spiritual grounding have a significantly higher risk for suicide, according to a new study. The study of over 4,700 teens ages 14 to 17 in nine countries found a correlation between atheism/agnosticism/spiritual uncertainty, heavy use of social media and destructive thoughts. Specifically, “rates of destructive thoughts are more common among teens who express that they don’t believe in anything spiritual, are uncertain about their beliefs, or believe they sin, but don’t believe in Jesus,” the study found. The study by the Center for Bible Engagement at Back to the Bible in partnership with Our Daily Bread Ministries called itself “one of the first studies to consider the relationships among spirituality, social media, and mental health.” Destructive thoughts are a risk factor for suicidality, the study noted. Destructive thoughts are more common among teens who, for example, endorse such beliefs as “I have no need for God,” “I’m spiritual, but don’t believe in God,” “God does not exist” and “there is no afterlife when we die.” By comparison, teens who are engaged with the Bible are significantly less likely to have destructive thoughts, according to the study. The study found that the “high suicide risk” among teens was linked to their “spiritual beliefs and social media experience,” according to the Center for Bible Engagement. Teens who live in the United States and the United Kingdom are more likely than teens in other countries to experience destructive thoughts, the study said. “As one of the first studies to consider the relationships among spirituality, social media, and mental health, the data deepened our understanding of the inner world of today’s teens,” said Arnie Cole, director of research and development at the Center for Bible Engagement. “We also provide some beginning evidence of factors that increase or lower their risk of destructive thoughts including engaging the Bible and limiting social media usage. Our goal is to develop with our partners a suite of Bible engagement/spiritual growth tools that include a teen spiritual fitness assessment that could predict self-destructive behavior ranging from suicide to homicide. Not only to predict but recommend spiritual fitness activities to prevent it.”>>","completion":"Christians are the target audience for this article."},{"prompt":"Describe an unusual alien creature and its culture. You should stay away from stereotypical humanoid aliens with only two genders who are just like humans except with weirder customs.","completion":"The Vrir'ied are a highly intelligent alien species that live on the gaseous planet Mides 1IG in the Proxima Capella galaxy. Their society emphasizes harmony above all, both with their environments and with each other. While they are not a hivemind, they do have a group consciousness that every member of the species can tap into. This desire for harmony is reflected in their amorphous physical form, which changes state when interacting with their surroundings and with each other. For example, on their home planet, which is a gas giant, they generally stay in gaseous forms to more easily travel to different places by varying their elemental heaviness. Social interactions are done by changing their innate elements to produce the desired chemical reactions. More intense interactions, such as mating, will produce more intense reactions, while simpler interactions, like a passing conversation will barely produce a spark. The most spectacular reactions will occur when the Vrir'ied's group consciousness recognizes a need for reproduction. At that time, members of the Vrir'ied will come together into groups of 5-10 and form intricate chain reactions that result in the birth of a new Vrir'ied. There are currently 50 different clans among the Vrir'ied, and each family has its own special chemical formula used to produce offspring. Although the Vrir'ied are generally most comfortable in gaseous form, their adaptiveness as a species has seen them take on solid and liquid forms as well when they engage in interstellar travel and diplomacy. The Vrir'ied who are on planet Earth generally take on solid forms, shapeshifting to imitate the native life forms on the planet. Meanwhile, the Vrir'ied who are on the ocean planet Kepler take on liquid forms. There have not yet been any records of Vrir'ied reproducing while in liquid or solid forms, but several new clans have arisen on these planets that are currently developing potential formulas for reproduction using their new forms. Already known for their peacefulness and adaptability, if any Vrir'ied clan succeeds in this new reproductive formula, there will surely be a great rise in their population that will catapult them into the top choice for diplomacy in the future."},{"prompt":"Is it true that Walt Disney was afraid of mice?

She was making good progress when she started to notice a draft from one of the nearby bookcases. She went over to investigate and pressed herself against the ground to look under the bookcase. The floor had sagged a little, and upon closer inspection, she could see that the bookshelf wasn't resting on the floor; rather, it was hinged. She pushed and pulled against it to no avail. Then, almost as if by design, her eyes caught on a favorite book of hers that her mother used to read when she was a child. As she tried to pull it off the shelf, something clicked, and the door began to creak open. A drab, dank tunnel lay before her. She turned on the flashlight on her phone and entered. Eventually, she came upon a room that was locked; however, the lock had long since broken, and with a few good kicks, the door was down. There, in the center of the room, was a book.

It's okay for the story to not be very realistic since it's set in a dream. What's most important is for the story to be fun and imaginative, and a bit dreamlike. Let's make the story five short paragraphs long, and include a dialogue exchange between Will and the octopus (the dialogue doesn't have to be included in the paragraphs, so five paragraphs and the dialogue exchange)","completion":"One night, a nine-year-old British boy by the name of Will fell asleep in his bed. In his dream, he found himself floating through the depths of outer space. Even though he had no helmet or spacesuit, it didn't matter since it was all dream. Will flew over massive planets that were far bigger and more colorful than anything in the Milky Way. He looked out in front of him to see what appeared to be a flying saucer coming towards him. As the saucer came closer, Will was able to peer through the glass of the cockpit. The saucer was being piloted by an octopus! Will waved at the octopus and the octopus waved back with one of his tentacles. \\"Hello, what are you doing here?\\" asked Will. \\"I'm just flying my saucer around for fun,\\" replied the octopus through the intercom of the saucer. \\"Can I join you in the saucer so I can have fun too?\\" asked Will. \\"I'm afraid not,\\" said the octopus with a chuckle. \\"Why not?\\" asked Will, disappointed. \\"Because that would ruin all the fun for you!\\" said the octopus. \\"The real fun for you is over there.\\" The octopus pointed out with one of his tentacles toward a giant clock that was floating in space. It was bigger than Big Ben! Then the octopus accelerated his saucer and rapidly took off at lightspeed into the stars. Will watched him go as the big clock drifted over to him. He was worried that it would run into him. The clock started ringing, and suddenly Will woke up from his dream. It was morning, and the sun's rays were shining through the window while his alarm clock was going off on his nightstand. Will shut off the alarm clock, reclined back in his bed, and thought about the octopus piloting the flying saucer in his dream. Maybe one day, he thought, he would have another dream where he could meet the octopus again."},{"prompt":"Can you write a function for me that will take the arctangent of a complex number with user-entered real and imaginary numbers and only print the answer if it's not NaN and not infinite?

What are some elements that might be displayed on his worker ID?","completion":"1. Name: The basic function of a piece of identification is to identify the owner. Thus his name would be an important element. 2. Photo: Similarly, it would be useful to provide a facial reference so that someone else could not claim his identity simply by stealing his ID. If the asteroid mining operation uses facial ID for security, this element of his ID may be a significant in-universe detail. 3. Contact information: In the event that his ID was lost or misplaced, contact information would make it easier for it to be returned to him. 4. Equipment Qualifications: An asteroid mining operation may involve high-powered and dangerous equipment. It may be important to be able to verify that the operators are qualified to use certain equipment before proceeding. Subsequently, the ID might contain such information. 5. Blood type and other medical information: A asteroid mining operation is a potentially very dangerous workplace. It may make sense to display his blood type and other medical information on his ID for quick reference. 6. Security clearance: For safety and security reasons, some sections of the asteroid may not be accessible to all members of the staff. This could be limited to the security office and the reactor room. Alternatively, the restrictions on the asteroid may be sufficiently extensive to limit staff to their specific working areas, common areas, and personal quarters. The ID would thus indicate what areas the holder is cleared for entering. What do you think?

Here are some methods to try and help her learn to trust you: 1. Let her make the first move - It may seem counterintuitive to ignore a kitty that you're trying to bond with, but this will actually help to pique her curiosity about you. Let her reach out to you, and make your first interactions brief and positive. 2 Keep her coming back - create a relaxing and non-threatening environment, such as feeding time in a quiet room. Try offering treats and toys. Meal times can be the best times to try to interact. 3. Slowly desensitize her - she will need some time to get used to the presence of humans. Even normal quiet things like doors opening and closing, or voices, can be scary to a semi-feral cat who is not used to being around people. 4. Respect her space - make sure she has places to hide when she gets overwhelmed and don't try to interact with her while she's in them. It is important for her to have times when she can make herself feel safe so that she can gather the courage to step out more. Smaller spaces are better, as large spaces can also be overwhelming. 5. Consider a calming remedy - catnip, pheromone sprays, plugins, and calming supplements can all be helpful for calming a kitty's nerves. 6. Be patient - remember that although some semi-feral cats come around after a few weeks, normally it takes several months, a year, or even longer. Be patient, stick to a schedule, respect her needs, and interact with her every day. She'll get there eventually."},{"prompt":"Write a social media post from the point of view of a fantasy tavern owner announcing a new \\"no worn armor allowed\\" rule for the bar and dining area.

He felt the anxiety rise in his head, and the nerves flutter in his stomach. Oddly enough, it made him happy to feel it. Unlike some people, he could be powered by anxiety. The auditor had requested various financial documents that needed to be provided within the next 24 hours. John spent the rest of the day combing through the company's various systems and paper files, gathering relevant documents for presentation.

As he worked, John could feel the pressure mounting. His heart raced, and his palms grew sweaty. He knew that a negative finding could result in corrective actions that would change the course of the business over the next year. John groggily returned to the office early the next morning ready to submit the documents. He had done everything he could, and now it was up to the auditor to review and make their assessment. The anxiety began to come down and a feeling of inevitability took over. It was out of his hands now. Most of the time, he ended up being harder on himself than any auditor ever was.

My friend who lives in the mountains says trees just don’t grow above a certain altitude. Is that true? What makes it happen?","completion":"A tree line marks the edge of the conditions in which trees are reliably capable of growing. This is often a function of elevation, but it is more specifically defined by temperature, snowpack, wind, and/or available moisture. In mountainous regions that are tall enough to maintain permanent snowpack, the tree line usually occurs between 300 and 1000 meters below the permanent snow and runs roughly parallel to it. In most cases, the tree line is defined by the mean seasonal temperature. Even conifer trees will cease to grow where the seasonal mean temperature is less than 6 degrees Celsius (43 Fahrenheit). They need roughly 94 days’ worth of growth time above that temperature to grow successfully. Some regions of Earth are close enough to the poles that they don’t spend enough time at a growth-sustaining temperature even at sea-level elevations. These regions (the tundra and Antarctic, for example) can be considered to be above the tree line as well. Other factors can create tree lines, too. Wind can prevent seedlings from growing to a mature height and thus preclude the growth of forests. Some windy areas (especially along coastlines) get stripped of usable soil, so they can’t support tree growth. If there's too little precipitation that will keep trees from growing as well. Human activities like logging create artificial tree lines, though these lines are not permanent. The only persistent anthropogenic (human-caused) tree line changes come through the effects of climate change."},{"prompt":"Give me a three sentence summary of the following document.

Its use case in English is to rephrase or elaborate on what was previously stated in the same sentence."},{"prompt":"Write a short blog post giving theme ideas for a 3-year-old's birthday party. Make it from the point of view of a fellow mom.","completion":"Birthdays always bring excitement (and a little chaos!) to our house. I am always trying to come up with creative themes to make my kids' parties extra fun, and let's face it, Instagram-worthy. If you're planning a party for a 3-year-old, here are some theme ideas to consider: -Sports. If your child is interested in any sport, you can make a party out of it! Baseball? That's a home run theme! Gymnastics? Gold medals for everyone! How about football? There's no way you can fumble that theme. -Favorite TV shows or movies. Your child probably has a favorite or two, and bringing their most loved characters from the screen to life can be extra fun for them. -Three's (not) a crowd. The more, the merrier at this party! Make this theme about the big number three and all of the loved ones who want to celebrate your special kid. -Planes, trains, and automobiles. Most kids at this age love transportation. No, really. They will enjoy looking at and playing with all of the decorations and treats. One of these themes is sure to delight your 3-year-old. I definitely can get preoccupied with creating the perfect party, but remember, all that matters is that your child has fun and feels loved. Don't sweat the small stuff and enjoy the day!"},{"prompt":"Can you suggest four hairstyles for short natural African curly hair?","completion":"Certainly! Here are 4 hairstyle suggestions for short natural African curly hair: 1. Fade haircut - a fade haircut is characterised by gradually increasing the size of the hair, starting from very short (sometimes bald) on the sides of the head just above the ears, to relatively big on the top of the head. This haircut is gender-neutral and works well on all sizes of short African hair, as it can be styled into a low fade (with very short hair at the top) or a high fade (with relatively long or 'big' hair at the top). 2. Cornrows - depending on the size of the hair in question, cornrows may be a good hairstyle option. Cornrows refer to plaits done from front to back, where hair is plaited in strands of three each, lying flat along the scalp. 3. Afro - a popular hairstyle for short natural African curly hair is to comb it out into an afro. This entails using a wide-toothed comb with long teeth - called an afro-comb - to comb out the hair from root to tip. This enhances the body of the hair and gives the desired afro-look. 4. Curly - accentuate the curls by using curl-activator gel or curl-activating shampoo and conditioner. A spritz of water may also help to enhance the natural curls. Before choosing to use chemicals on your hair, however, be sure to read the ingredients label and ensure compatibility with your skin and hair type. If in doubt, consult with your doctor, pharmacist, or hair specialist before using chemicals on your hair."},{"prompt":"Write an email from a person inquiring about a car for sale on Craigslist.","completion":"To: carseller@craigslist.com From: carbuyer@craigslist.com Subject: 2012 Ram Pickup Hello, I saw your ad on Craigslist for the 2012 Ram pickup truck for sale. I had some questions about the vehicle that I was hoping you could answer for me. First, I was wondering if this particular model (quad cab) comes with a cloth interior or a leather interior. The reason I am asking this is because I cannot tell from the pictures you posted on your ad, since all seats are covered with seat covers. I tried checking online to see what this particular vehicle would come with, but it seems like it would depend on whether or not the initial buyer bought it stock with a cloth interior, or paid extra for the premium leather seats. Secondly, do you happen to know if this truck has the premium package? As I mentioned, if the seats are leather, this would mean the original owner paid extra for the premium package that includes the leather seats. If this truck has a premium package, what does the sound system look like? I know the premium package comes with an LCD touchscreen and premium Bose speakers, which would make the deal more tempting for me to take. Finally, I was wondering how you wanted payment. Your listing just gives a price, but I would like to know if you could accept a check, cash, or both. If you want the entire amount in cash, I would suggest we meet at my bank so I can take the money out and give it right to you, plus it's a good, public place to meet. Please let me know, you can reply to this email or call me at (000) 123-4567. My name is Mark. Hope to hear from you soon."},{"prompt":"I'm making a poetry collection for my university class and I need some topics to write about. My theme is \\"Leaving Home\\" and it's all about moving out of your parents' house. Can you give me some ideas of poems to write?","completion":"Sure thing! Here are some topics surrounding moving out of your parents' house that you can write poetry about. - Cleaning the house. One topic you could explore is being responsible for making sure your house is clean, and not having mom or dad to rely on for things like mopping and vacuuming. - Paying bills. Managing finances takes a lot of effort and this could be a topic you explore in a poem. - Making appointments. After you leave home, you become responsible for making sure you see people like the doctor or the dentist. You could write a poem about how taxing it is to make the effort to see the doctor when you're not feeling well. - New freedoms. With your new various responsibilities come freedoms you may not have had before. You could get a tattoo, or a piercing, or style your hair in a way you never have before. Who's to stop you? - Tough decisions. Now that you're living on your own, you make decisions every single day that control or maintain your life. You can write a poem about the weight of those decisions. I hope these topics give you the inspiration you need! Good luck and happy writing!"},{"prompt":"What albums did Madonna release?

Born February 27, 1847 · Coventry, Warwickshire, England, UK Died July 21, 1928 · Small Hythe, Kent, England, UK (stroke) Birth name Ellen Alice Terry Mini Bio Legendary British stage actress who made a few silent film appearances. The daughter of strolling players, she was born in Coventry into an almost exclusively theatrical family. Her grandparents were actors, as were all six of her siblings. But only her son, Edward Gordon Craig, would in any way approach her fame in the theatre, albeit as a designer rather than as an actor. She made her debut in 1856 at the age of 8 before an audience which included Queen Victoria. By age 11, she had played a dozen roles including Puck. At 16, after showing early brilliance, she played \\"An American Cousin\\" (a year before the famed American production clouded by Lincoln's assassination) and then retired. After six years, still only 22, she returned to the stage and in 1875 played a landmark Portia in \\"The Merchant of Venice.\\" For the next three decades, she played every major Shakespearean role opposite the greatest British tragedians, in England and in America. Her long association with theatrical giant Henry Irving ended with his death, but a year later, in 1906, she began a long professional and personal relationship with George Bernard Shaw. After more than half a century onstage, she undertook a tour of England, America, and Australia, lecturing on the theatre and on Shakespeare. She was coaxed into a film appearance in 1916 and played in a handful of additional pictures through 1922. Created a Dame by George V in 1925, she was the recipient of virtually every honor available to a figure of the English-speaking stage. After a long illness, she died at 81 from a combination of stroke and heart attack at her home in Smallhythe Place, Tenterdon, Kent, England. Her long estranged husband, James Carew, survived her.","completion":"Ellen Terry was born in 1847 in England.

Include a title in quotes that is a pun about the speedbump and his quest for a better life.","completion":"\\"A Bump In The Road\\" Yesterday started out for me to be a day like any other day: the sun was beating down on me, a bunch of tall redwood trees stared down at me, and occasionally a bear or a raccoon would stop by to say hello and take a breather. This was the life I was getting used to in a state park that was a good 50 miles away from any signs of civilization. I was always in good health, everything was peaceful, and rarely did I feel \\"tired.\\" I decided to get in touch with my very active friends on the information superhighway, and one of them informed me about a job opportunity in an extravagant senior living community. It was a \\"concrete\\" job offer, and I would get a \\"raise\\" if the residents failed to heed any warnings about slowing down. I accepted the offer on the condition that I would need a ride over there and a crew promptly came and picked me up. I felt elated and thought to myself \\"At long last, I'm paving my way toward great success!\\" Unfortunately, the new job has turned into a nightmare. The crew slammed me into the ground, poured a layer of blacktop over me, and made sure that I couldn't move; one could say that I was \\"tarred and tethered.\\" Then there is the ungodly traffic! These seniors think that they are still 18; 50 miles per hour is their usual speed, but there is this one grandma from Pasadena who just can't seem to keep her foot off of the accelerator! Her extremely excessive speed has now given me constant back pain. I decided to take the senior community to court due to negligence; I \\"pitched\\" my case to the judge, but he decided that I didn't have a good enough \\"resin\\" to pursue charges. So here I stay in this community. Now I'm even more scared because my co-worker 1000 feet behind me says that there is a shuffleboard tournament starting next week and all nearby communities are invited!

One night, he looked at his shadow and it almost looked like another boy. The boy waved at it, and the shadow waved at the same time. The boy sighed and prepared to go to sleep. Suddenly he heard a voice from the wall. \\"Why did you wave? Did you want to play?\\" Startled, the boy stared at the wall. \\"Who said that?\\" The voice responded, \\"It was me.

He was a multi-millionaire overnight. He was prepared for this moment, as he had been planning for several years, and now he was in the endgame. Mr. Rose immediately hired three people: an accountant; a lawyer; and a personal driver. He needed these three people to help him make his moves since he didn't know how to manage this much money on his own, he wanted to protect himself from any legal issues involved with owning this much money, and he needed someone to drive him around to free him up to make calls and decisions on the move.

Felix Hernandez - No room to argue here - \\"King Felix\\" is the best pitcher in Mariners history. He spent 15 seasons in Seattle and was a fan favorite the entire time. He won the Cy Young Award in 2010 and was an All-Star six times. Hernandez is the Mariners' all-time leader in strikeouts, wins, and innings pitched. 2. Randy Johnson - Johnson played nine seasons at the start of his career with the Mariners, he is one of the greatest pitchers of all time. His youth and incredible size and pitching speed were combined with bouts of wildness in his first seasons. He was must-see television every start. He won the Cy Young Award in 1995 and 1997 and was an All-Star five times while a Mariner. More importantly, he was a pivotal piece of the 1995 team that was the first Mariners squad to make the postseason. 3. Jamie Moyer - Moyer spent 11 seasons with the Mariners and won 145 games. It's amazing to think that the second-most-winning pitcher in franchise history is known more for consistency and preparation than \\"stuff\\". He threw slowly and deliberately with a knack for driving opponents crazy. He had two 20-win seasons and was an All-Star in 2003. He finished top 10 in Cy Young voting three times. Moyer also pitched a no-hitter for the Mariners in 1996. 4. Mark Langston - Langston spent six seasons with the Mariners and was an All-Star in all six seasons. He had 1,074 strikeouts in 1,062 innings pitched with the team. Langston's dominance on the mound helped set the tone for the Mariners in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Plus, when he was finally traded the team received Randy Johnson as part of the package. A gift that kept on giving! 5. Hisashi Iwakuma - Iwakuma is a bit of an under-the-radar selection given that he only played six years with the team. However, he had some incredible seasons with the team, including a 2013 campaign that saw him finish 3rd in Cy Young voting.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Drunk driving claimed the lives of 10,511 people in 2018, a 3.6% decrease after two straight years of nearly 11,000 alcohol-related traffic deaths, according to new data released today by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Drunk driving remains the leading killer on America’s roads, accounting for 29% of all traffic deaths. (NHTSA FARS 2018 by state) “We are starting to see some improvements, but it is appalling that we are still losing over 10,000 lives to this violent, preventable crime,” said MADD National President Helen Witty. “The overall number of traffic deaths and those caused by drunk driving have remained stubbornly higher than in 2014, the last year when drunk driving deaths dropped below 10,000. That’s unacceptable. And it’s why we are calling for Congress to pass legislation that would mandate advanced drunk driving prevention technology in all new vehicles. It’s past time to make this a standard safety feature and start saving lives.” Technology is a major component of MADD’s Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving, launched in 2006. The Campaign supports development of advanced drunk driving prevention technology, high-visibility law enforcement, such as sobriety checkpoints and saturation patrols, state laws requiring ignition interlocks for all drunk driving offenders, and public support for these initiatives.

Instead, she’s taken hostage by a hapless bank robber named Jake Simms. He and Charlotte go on the run. A woman walking away from a life she no longer wants is one of Tyler’s favorite storylines; the twist here is that Charlotte is taken from her life before she can walk away. A part of her doesn’t fight captivity and is satisfied with someone else making all the decisions. Much of Charlotte’s story is told through flashbacks to her childhood where she always felt like an oddball in a family of eccentrics. She was deeply affected by comments her mother made about Charlotte surely being switched at birth. It becomes a symbol of Charlotte’s feeling that she didn’t fit into her own life. Only as the story unfolds do we learn she is beautiful and was popular in high school, but she let opportunities slip away.

Write a paragraph spelling out the regulations for changing the color of a mailbox. Include any colors that are banned as well as a brief description of any locational regulations. Write it in a straightforward way with little emotion.","completion":"Yes, you can paint your curbside mailbox. Currently, the USPS allows mailboxes to be painted any color and offers no restrictions regarding the color of the box. One regulation regarding the color of your mailbox has to do with the carrier flag. The carrier flag must be painted in a contrasting color to the mailbox and cannot be painted green, brown, blue, yellow, or white because they may blend into the surroundings more easily and cause the mail carrier to miss it. If you live in an area with an HOA (homeowner's association) you may need to check with them to make sure you don't violate any of their regulations."},{"prompt":"Write a set of interview questions to ask Mickey Mouse at Disneyland.

Many of us want to feel happier, but figuring out how to do so is not always simple. Here are some ways to begin cultivating more happiness in your life: 1. Pursue intrinsic goals. Intrinsic goals are goals that are deeply rooted in your purpose and desire, so they tend to concern personal growth and your sense of place within a community. Extrinsic goals, by contrast, could be things like money, power, or material possessions. 2. Live in the present moment. It's more beneficial for happiness when you choose to enjoy the process and experience gratitude for what you do have rather than focusing on what's next, or ruminating on the past. 3. Reframe negative thoughts. Some people just have a more natural tendency to experience pessimism or negative thoughts. Reframing is not ignoring the bad but rather observing thought patterns and finding a way to replace harmful thoughts with helpful ones."},{"prompt":"Hello","completion":"Hi there!

While traditional mowers simply cut the grass and collect or discharge the clippings, mulching mowers cut the grass clippings into very small pieces and then discharge them back onto the lawn. The key to this process is a specially designed blade, often called a mulching blade or a 3-in-1 blade (because it's designed to discharge, bag, or mulch). This blade is shaped to keep the clippings aloft inside the mower deck, chopping them repeatedly until they are fine enough to fall through the deck onto the lawn. The finely cut grass clippings then decompose quickly and return nutrients back to the soil."},{"prompt":"How did the evolution of computer technology unfold over time, leading to the advanced computing systems we have today?","completion":"Major computer generations 1st Generation (1940s-1950s) Vacuum tube technology was used in early computers, such as the ENIAC and UNIVAC. These computers were large, expensive, and had limited processing power. 2nd Generation (1950s-1960s) Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, resulting in smaller, more reliable computers. Mainframe computers were developed, providing faster processing speeds and improved capabilities. 3rd Generation (1960s-1970s) Integrated circuits (ICs) were introduced, allowing multiple transistors to be combined on a single chip. Minicomputers became commercially available, offering more affordable computing power. 4th Generation (1970s-1980s) Microprocessors were invented, integrating the entire central processing unit (CPU) onto a single chip. Personal computers (PCs) became accessible to individuals and businesses. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and the mouse were introduced, improving user interaction. 5th Generation (1980s-Present) VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology enabled the creation of more powerful and compact microprocessors. Networking technologies, such as Ethernet and the Internet, revolutionized communication and connectivity. Advancements in software and programming languages facilitated the development of sophisticated applications. Artificial Intelligence (AI) research gained momentum, leading to the creation of intelligent systems and machine learning algorithms. These advancements in computer technology over the generations have driven the development of advanced computing systems, including high-performance computers, mobile devices, cloud computing, and emerging technologies like quantum computing."},{"prompt":"I am new to video games and would like to know more about what kinds of games are available to play. Please give me a brief rundown of the genres of games that are available to play.","completion":"Sure thing! Here is a brief overview of the different types of video games available to play: 1. Role-Playing Games (RPG) - Role-playing games involve playing a fictional character (you can design an avatar of yourself to play in the game) in a certain setting (fantasy, dungeon, wasteland) and playing out a storyline that can organically evolve. The hallmarks of RPGs include an experience-based leveling system, equipment (weapons, armor) that can add attributes (faster running, increased resistance to damage), and quests (tasks that can be completed for experience, equipment, or in-game currency.) 2. First-Person Shooters (FPS) - First-person shooters are shooting games that put you directly in the game character's shoes as if you were seeing everything through their eyes. FPS games usually revolve around either a single-player campaign where the player fights against enemies using a variety of guns through multiple levels, or in multiplayer online matches with other human players (Deathmatch, King-of-the-Hill, Capture-the-Flag, or Cooperative play). 3. Fighting Games - Fighting games are games that usually involve two players (either a human against a computer-controlled character or a human versus another human) fighting against each other using many different fighting techniques, including hand-to-hand combat, weapons combat, and sometimes even superpowers such as laser beams or energy blasts. The winner of the match is the player left standing. 4. Sports Games - Sports games are digital representations of sports that are available in real life (basketball, football, hockey). Sports games allow you to play as a player in a sports game, playing the game as it would be played in real life. Some of these games are made so well that every detail seems almost life-like, and may include real players from the real sports making cameos in the games as playable characters. 5. Side Scroller/Platform Games - Side scroller and platform games are 2-dimensional games where the player controls a character who moves from left to right or vice-versa on the screen and must navigate obstacles such as walls or ladders through jumping (via platforms) or climbing. 6. Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games (MOBA) - MOBAs are games that are played online against multiple other human players in a game setting. The games usually consist of groups of players on separate teams attempting to beat each other either by eliminating the opposing team's players or by capturing an objective (such as a flag or castle). The difference between MOBAs and first-person shooters may seem small, but MOBAs do have added features such as different skills for players that can add new dimensions to the game and foster cooperation and communication between teammates to win a match. 7. Action-Adventure Games - Action-adventure games usually involve playing a character in a situation that involves action and/or adventure, such as exploring caves or climbing mountains. 8. Stealth Games - Stealth games require cunning and quiet to kill enemies and maneuver through the game environment. Many stealth games are based around characters that would require stealth to perform their duties, such as ninjas and assassins. 9. Survival Games - Survival games are about playing a character who must survive in their surroundings or the environment. Game modes include surviving against multiple hordes of enemies such as zombies or other enemy combatants using weapons or tools designed to hurt or kill your enemies. 10. Simulation Games - Simulation games allow you to simulate fictional or real-life scenarios in a game setting. Some examples of simulation games include simulating real life (owning a house, interacting with neighbors, making meals), being a farmer (operating a tractor, tending to the land, growing crops), or even pressure-washing dirty fences. There are many simulation games to choose from."},{"prompt":"Tomorrow at school, we have an assembly where a farmer will be speaking to us.

Track by track, this album has a perfect flow to it that keeps it alive every track. It starts off with the explosive The Power of Equality and ends with the cover song They're Red Hot. This album has many great songs such as Funky Monks, Suck My Kiss, Give It Away and many more great songs. The mix of funk, metal and a pinch of sex in the lyrics, this album just sounds beautiful. This is the second album with newcomers John Frusciante and Chad Smith and they show their true talent on this album. The album before this was Mother's Milk which also was a great album but it didn't capture the greatness of the band like Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Anthony shows his great songwriting with serious topics like heartbreak in the track I Could've Lied and heroin addiction on the breakthrough hit Under The Bridge. Flea showcases his outstanding bass playing on this album and John shows his amazing guitar playing reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix. Blood Sugar Sex Magik showcases the greatness of the Chili Peppers for years to come. Even the '95 album One Hot Minute with Dave Navarro was an outstanding album in my opinion because it showcased their more metal sound which sounded great with funk and alternative rock. Blood Sugar Sex Magik will and always will stand out as one of the greatest rock albums of the '90s and maybe of all time.","completion":"Once upon a time, in a land filled with rhythm and harmony, there was an enchanted album called Blood Sugar Sex Magik, crafted by legendary musical sorcerers, the Chili Peppers.

That copy rushes them with inhuman speed, vaulting over the couch to reach Jun and his friends before they can escape. One quick slash from a knife is all it took to kill the three of them. As Jun lay on the ground bleeding out, he held his friends' hands. Something deep stirred within him as he pleaded for them to survive this ordeal somehow. He takes a final, shallow breath before snapping awake three days earlier. He's alive and breathing. He calls his friends, who are both surprised to hear from him so early.

Keep the paragraph between 150-300 words.","completion":"Most people fondly remember the days of Blockbuster. The once prominent film rental company had a stranglehold on the industry for many years. Many people made a habit of going to Blockbuster once a week to pick a movie. It became a true part of people's routines. In the late 90's, Blockbuster had over 9,000 rental stores and 65 million customers. Flashforward to today though and things could not be more different. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy with over 900 million in debt. There are no more Blockbuster stores. What happened? The easy answer is the emergence of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. But Blockbuster was struggling even before Netflix moved to a streaming service. And the issues that caused the downfall of Blockbuster are bigger and more complex than the rise of streaming services. Along with the emergence of sites like Netflix, Blockbuster struggled to stay up-to-date with the demands of the times. Blockbuster's stores required a level of commitment and effort from their customers, and there was an issue with their payment structure.

Ostrich leather is a lucrative commodity, and the large feathers are used as plumes for the decoration of ceremonial headgear. Ostrich eggs have been used by humans for millennia. Ostriches are of the genus Struthio in the order Struthioniformes, part of the infra-class Palaeognathae, a diverse group of flightless birds also known as ratites that includes the emus, rheas, cassowaries and kiwis. There are two living species of ostrich: the common ostrich, native to large areas of sub-Saharan Africa, and the Somali ostrich, native to the Horn of Africa.[2] The common ostrich used to be native to the Arabian Peninsula, and ostriches were present across Asia as far east as Mongolia during the Late Pleistocene and possibly into the Holocene.","completion":"Ostriches are big, flightless birds that are the heaviest species of birds in the world.

The first revival debuted on CBS on September 27, 1985, ten years after Rod Serling's death. Unlike the first Twilight Zone, which featured one new story for each episode, this version sometimes contained several stories in one episode of varying lengths. Also, unlike Serling's version, it featured no host but was sometimes narrated by actor Charles Aidman for the first two seasons, and later Robin Ward for the third season, which was produced by a Canadian company so that CBS could sell it into syndication. It completed its run in 1989. The host format was subsequently brought back for the short-lived 2002 UPN revival with Forest Whitaker introducing the episodes, while Jordan Peele stepped in to host the 2019 revival that he produced and developed for the streaming platform CBS All Access where it aired for two seasons."},{"prompt":"Write a scene in a ghost story.

We uncorked the bottle our host had left us, poured out two glasses, and headed outside to sit by the fire pit where we could watch the sun setting over rolling green hills. Half an hour later, when my glass was drained, I climbed to my feet and reached out to muss Garrett’s hair affectionately. “I'm heading in, you want another gla--oh my God!” “What?” he leaped to his feet, following my gaze. “What is it?” I clapped a palm to my collarbone, pointing towards the house with the other hand. “I--I saw someone in the house.” “What?” his tone was incredulous. “Seriously?” I nodded. “A face in the window, right there.” Garrett clenched his jaw, then turned to the firepit, reaching for the axe that leaned against a stack of fresh firewood. He raised it over his shoulder and I caught his arm just as he started charging towards the house. “Don’t!” I hissed, “It might be our host.” “Or it might be a criminal!” he snapped back impatiently. “I don’t think so. It looked like… like a little old lady.” He furrowed his brow. “Are you sure?” I shrugged. “I only caught a glimpse, but… I think I saw white hair and big dark eyes and--and maybe a bathrobe collar.” “You think? Well, let’s go find out.” Garrett grabbed the cast iron fire poker and thrust it toward me. “Better safe than sorry, right?”"},{"prompt":"Create a diary of a boy that fell in love with a girl.

Of all the emotions I have ever experienced, this was the most intense. I think I fell in love. It was like experiencing electrocution, but it came from inside me. Everything buzzed to the point I couldn't feel anything else. All this time, I thought people in love were stupid and ridiculous. How can they act like do, just because of love? But now, I realize I have been the stupid one for failing to comprehend what love truly does. I was sitting at the park, listening to Hole's album \\"Living Through This\\" when out of nowhere, my eyes met another's: a beautiful blonde girl passing through a field of sunflowers. Even if I wanted, I could not look away. My eyes had the determination of 100 lions stalking their prey, and they simply refused. She simply smiled and walked through the sunflowers and until she left my sight, time slowed and my heart beat faster. I wish I had been courageous enough to run across the small river separating us and into that field, but at that moment, I was frozen. I couldn't even move a finger. Then, she disappeared past the sunflowers, much like the sun itself at night. I don't know if I will have the luck to see her again, but all I can think is how I wish to look upon her once more."},{"prompt":"Write an article of <200 words on the topic of procurement.

The search warrant should detail the probable cause for the search of the vehicle.","completion":"I swear the following to be true and accurate: Within the past five (5) days, a controlled purchase of fentanyl was conducted in the District of Columbia, State of California; the controlled purchase of fentanyl was facilitated utilizing a Confidential Source (hereafter referred to as \\"CS\\"); the CS was given an undisclosed amount of documented US currency to facilitate the purchase of fentanyl from a subject identified as \\"Ashley BOLTON\\"; that the controlled purchase was conducted between BOLTON and the CS while BOLTON was observed in a red-colored Toyota Tacoma 4-door pickup truck bearing State of California license plate 4ABC123; that the controlled purchase yielded five (5) white-colored tablets within a small, zip-lock packet; and that the tablets tested presumptive positive for fentanyl. On January 1, 2023, a traffic stop was conducted by Columbia District Patrol officers for a traffic infraction (driving with expired tags). At this time, officers contacted the driver and sole occupant, Ashley BOLTON, F-30, and positively identified her via her driver's license; furthermore, the vehicle was identified as being registered to and title signed to BOLTON, making her the legal owner of the vehicle. Patrol officers contacted this officer about the traffic stop knowing that BOLTON was a person of interest in a narcotics investigation and who was discussed in a previous briefing between Columbia District Narcotics and Patrol officers. This officer responded to the scene of the traffic stop, arrested BOLTON on suspicion of the distribution of illegal narcotics, and requested a no-preference tow for the vehicle back to the Columbia District Police Station pending the drafting and execution of a search warrant. The vehicle was towed to the police station because it was readily mobile, and leaving the vehicle at the scene of a traffic stop unattended could result in an associate(s) entering within and removing any evidence or fruits of the crime of narcotics distribution which we intend to search the vehicle for; therefore, the vehicle was towed back to the police station in a locked and secured cage until a search warrant could be granted."},{"prompt":"I'm looking to eat a healthier breakfast than what I typically have.

Here's the source Text: While most FRBs are short-lived, one-time events, FRB 20190520B is a \\"repeater\\" that bursts constantly across radio frequencies, making it an ideal target of long-term study. But that's not the only reason the team, led by Reshma Anna-Thomas of West Virginia University, selected FRB 20190520B for its research. \\"The real motivating factor was its resemblance with a previously well-studied FRB, FRB 20121102A,\\" Anna-Thomas told Space.com. \\"These two FRBs have an environment that is persistently emitting radio waves, which suggests that the FRB source is young. And FRB 20121102A is known to reside in an extremely magnetized plasma environment. So, we wanted to see if that's the same for FRB 20190520B. And if that is the case, what does it mean for the whole population of FRBs?\\" Over the course of 17 months, the team watched FRB 20190520B closely using the Parkes Radio Telescope (also known as Murriyang) in Australia and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in the United States. Researchers observed high variability in the FRB's Faraday rotation — a change in the radio waves' polarization, which happens when it passes through magnetic fields. That variability indicated a highly turbulent magnetic environment at the FRB source. \\"Using the observed properties, we modeled these variations as due to a wind from a massive companion star, and this conclusion was strengthened by a system in the Milky Way that shows striking similarity to our FRB,\\" said Anna-Thomas.","completion":"FRB 20190520B is a fast radio burst (FRB) that emits radio waves persistently, indicating it may be a young source and has been selected for long-term study.

Can you put together a list of Pikmin enemies that people consider bosses? Also, can I have an opening sentence or two going through what defines a boss in the game?","completion":"I can do that for you! Bosses are defined in two ways. Some bosses are labeled in the game's files as bosses, and others aren't labeled bosses but are called bosses by people who play the game. Here is a list of bosses in Pikmin: 1. Goolix - The Goolix is a Pikmin boss that looks like a blue amoeba. It fights by encapsulating Pikmin within itself, which will drown them. It is impossible to fight if you don't have blue Pikmin, but blue Pikmin can fight it without being injured. You can only find the Goolix after day 9 on odd-numbered days in the impact site, 2. Burrowing Snagret - Snagrets are creatures that pop out of the ground and look like a mix between a snake and a bird. When they fight, they unburrow and eat several Pikmin and then burrow back down for safety. In the Forest of Hope, there are 3 Snagrets in the same location. The best way to fight a Snagret is to attack as they try to emerge from the ground. Then before it has a chance to shake them off, whistle them back. 3. Beady Long Legs - Beady Long Legs - Arachnophobes beware, the Beady Long Legs is a massive spider. It stomps around, and Pikmin die as it steps on them. It also drops from the ceiling abruptly when you find it, which can immediately crush Pikmin. It helps to fight it with a smaller team of Pikmin, as large teams can more easily be crushed. It also helps to have Yellow Pikmin, as they can be thrown higher than others. This boss resides in the Forest Navel. 4. Armored Cannon Beetle - The Armored Cannon Beetle is a boss that isn't labeled as a boss. This beetle has armor surrounding its body. It also has a blowhole that sucks in before it shoots out a boulder. The ball that rolls can crush several Pikmin and only stops when it hits a wall or other enemy. To fight it, you need to clog its blowhole, which will then make it expose its abdomen which can be attacked. Its blowhole can be clogged by Pikmin. You can find the armored cannon beetle in The Forest of Hope. 5. Emperor Bulblax - This is the final boss of Pikmin. It looks like it's covered in sludge with moss growing out of it. The Emperor Bulblax waits in the ground for its prey and pops up as you pass by. To defeat this enemy, you need to use Yellow Pikmin to feed it bomb rocks. It fights by eating, and when it sticks out its tongue, you can throw the Pikmin with bomb rocks at it. This boss can be found in the area called The Final Trial."},{"prompt":"Write a short story about a girl who meets a lost fairy in the woods.

A ghostly hand seemed to be pulling at the strings of my mind with each one, giving them a haunting urgency. The air felt heavy with an ominous presence that was pressing on my windows and begging me to reveal the horrible truth that was shrouded in the night. Unseen eyes seemed to watch from the shadows, awaiting the moment when my resistance would crumble. My heart raced, pounding in my chest like a desperate plea for escape. Fear consumed me, the dread intensifying with every passing second. What dreadful fate awaited those who dared to gaze upon the moon? The neighborhood was engulfed in a crushing silence as the minutes dragged on into an agonizing eternity. The world appeared to be waiting for the inevitable breach of the forbidden vow as the night appeared to be holding its breath. And then the messages stopped as the first dawn sunlight emerged on the horizon. A fragile sense of relief swept over me as the weight of the moment eased. I continued to be unable to see the moon because it was still hidden by the dense twilight curtain. Although that night was never discussed, the underlying fear brought us all together. The moon continued to be a mystery, illuminating our lives with its soft light while keeping its secret hidden. And as simple mortals trapped under its watchful eye, we were left wondering as to what horrors may be lurking behind its ethereal glow."},{"prompt":"What are the main themes in \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge?\\"","completion":"Penned by Thomas Hardy and published in 1886, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" charts the rise and fall of Michael Henchard, a proud and volatile protagonist, whose destiny is shaped by a fateful drunken mistake.

Classify terms related to the word shaman. 2. Which people have had a shared interest in shamanism? List them. Shamanism or Samanism is a religious practice that involves a practitioner (shaman or saman) interacting with the spirit world through altered states of consciousness, such as trance.[1][2] The goal of this is usually to direct spirits or spiritual energies into the physical world for the purpose of healing, divination, or to aid human beings in some other way.[1] Beliefs and practices categorized as \\"shamanic\\" have attracted the interest of scholars from a variety of disciplines, including anthropologists, archeologists, historians, religious studies scholars, philosophers and psychologists. Hundreds of books and academic papers on the subject have been produced, with a peer-reviewed academic journal being devoted to the study of shamanism. In the 20th century, non-Indigenous Westerners involved in countercultural movements, such as hippies and the New Age created modern magicoreligious practices influenced by their ideas of various Indigenous religions, creating what has been termed neoshamanism or the neoshamanic movement.[3] It has affected the development of many neopagan practices, as well as faced a backlash and accusations of cultural appropriation,[4] exploitation and misrepresentation when outside observers have tried to practice the ceremonies of, or represent, centuries-old cultures to which they do not belong.[5] The earliest known depiction of a Siberian shaman, by the Dutch explorer Nicolaes Witsen, 17th century. Witsen called him a \\"priest of the Devil\\" and drew clawed feet for the supposed demonic qualities.[6] The Modern English word shamanism derives from the Russian word šamán, which itself comes from the word samān from a Tungusic language[7] – possibly from the southwestern dialect of the Evenki spoken by the Sym Evenki peoples,[8] or from the Manchu language.[9] The etymology of the word is sometimes connected to the Tungus root sā-, meaning \\"To Know\\".[10][11] However, Finnish ethnolinguist Juha Janhunen questions this connection on linguistic grounds: \\"The possibility cannot be completely rejected, but neither should it be accepted without reservation since the assumed derivational relationship is phonologically irregular (note especially the vowel quantities).\\"[12] Mircea Eliade noted that the Sanskrit word śramaṇa, designating a wandering monastic or holy figure, has spread to many Central Asian languages along with Buddhism and could be the ultimate origin of the word shaman.[13] The term was adopted by Russians interacting with the Indigenous peoples in Siberia. It is found in the memoirs of the exiled Russian churchman Avvakum.[14] It was brought to Western Europe twenty years later by the Dutch traveler Nicolaes Witsen, who reported his stay and journeys among the Tungusic- and Samoyedic-speaking Indigenous peoples of Siberia in his book Noord en Oost Tataryen (1692).[15] Adam Brand, a merchant from Lübeck, published in 1698 his account of a Russian embassy to China; a translation of his book, published the same year, introduced the word shaman to English speakers.[16] Anthropologist and archeologist Silvia Tomaskova argued that by the mid-1600s, many Europeans applied the Arabic term shaitan (meaning \\"devil\\") to the non-Christian practices and beliefs of Indigenous peoples beyond the Ural Mountains.[17] She suggests that shaman may have entered the various Tungus dialects as a corruption of this term, and then been told to Christian missionaries, explorers, soldiers and colonial administrators with whom the people had increasing contact for centuries. A female shaman is sometimes called a shamanka, which is not an actual Tungus term but simply shaman plus the Russian suffix -ka (for feminine nouns).[18] There is no single agreed-upon definition for the word \\"shamanism\\" among anthropologists. Thomas Downson suggests three shared elements of shamanism: practitioners consistently alter consciousness, the community regards altering consciousness as an important ritual practice, and the knowledge about the practice is controlled. The English historian Ronald Hutton noted that by the dawn of the 21st century, there were four separate definitions of the term which appeared to be in use: The first of these uses the term to refer to \\"anybody who contacts a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness\\". The second definition limits the term to refer to those who contact a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness at the behest of others. The third definition attempts to distinguish shamans from other magicoreligious specialists who are believed to contact spirits, such as \\"mediums\\", \\"witch doctors\\", \\"spiritual healers\\" or \\"prophets,\\" by claiming that shamans undertake some particular technique not used by the others. (Problematically, scholars advocating the third view have failed to agree on what the defining technique should be.) The fourth definition identified by Hutton uses \\"shamanism\\" to refer to the Indigenous religions of Siberia and neighboring parts of Asia.[20] According to the Golomt Center for Shamanic Studies, a Mongolian organization of shamans, the Evenk word shaman would more accurately be translated as \\"priest\\".[21] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a shaman (/ˈʃɑːmən/ SHAH-men, /ˈʃæmən/ or /ˈʃeɪmən/)[22] is someone who is regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing.[1][22] The word \\"shaman\\" probably originates from the Tungusic Evenki language of North Asia. According to Juha Janhunen, \\"the word is attested in all of the Tungusic idioms\\" such as Negidal, Lamut, Udehe/Orochi, Nanai, Ilcha, Orok, Manchu and Ulcha, and \\"nothing seems to contradict the assumption that the meaning 'shaman' also derives from Proto-Tungusic\\" and may have roots that extend back in time at least two millennia.[23] The term was introduced to the west after Russian forces conquered the shamanistic Khanate of Kazan in 1552. The term \\"shamanism\\" was first applied by Western anthropologists as outside observers of the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols, as well as those of the neighbouring Tungusic- and Samoyedic-speaking peoples. Upon observing more religious traditions around the world, some Western anthropologists began to also use the term in a very broad sense. The term was used to describe unrelated magicoreligious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and even completely unrelated parts of the Americas, as they believed these practices to be similar to one another.[24] While the term has been incorrectly applied by cultural outsiders to many Indigenous spiritual practices, the words “shaman” and “shamanism” do not accurately describe the variety and complexity that is Indigenous spirituality. Each nation and tribe has its own way of life, and uses terms in their own languages.[25]","completion":"1.

Some people are petrified by the fact that a car can drive itself but currently, we are seeing more and more intelligence being portrayed by self-driving cars day in and day out. Many companies are switching their business model to only selling electric cars such as Jaguar which plans to sell only electric cars from 2025 and Volvo from 2030. Will people start to just accept electric cars as more are rolled out? Well, first, the power is no joke and won't be a problem for a lot of people as some standard electric cars put up a fight against many hypercars. A lot of people hate electric cars because they are significantly different from petrol or diesel cars, such as not producing sounds while driving the car. Some electric manufacturers have tried to fix this issue by playing sounds through a speaker which has left some petrolheads in stitches. While some people do hate it, many have come to accept it and see it as the future. Whether or not you like electric cars, they will be more beneficial for the environment and may be cheaper to run in the long term."},{"prompt":"Please give a brief description of the George Washington cherry tree story.","completion":"In the original story of the cherry tree myth, George Washington was 6 years old when he damaged his father's cherry tree after receiving a hatchet as a gift.

Despite decades of studies showing the great health benefits of eating a Mediterranean diet, it has yet to catch on. The Western Diet, high in fat, salt, and processes ingredients, is still the norm in Australia (where the study was conducted) and, of course, America. If you look to Italy, France, Greece, and Spain, you’ll find a generally healthier population who eats far more vegetables, fruits, health fats (fish, olive oil), and whole grains. Sure, some wine is also the norm, but what’s missing are the processed foods and refined grains and sugars. Fruits, vegetables, and fish — pretty expensive, right? The new study from the University of South Australia resolutely concludes that’s not the case and that families actual save money when adopting the Mediterranean Diet. The study looked at the nutritional profile and weekly costs of three food baskets based on three different diets: the Mediterranean diet, the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE), and the typical Australian Western diet. The results confirmed that the Mediterranean diet and AGHE met the nutritional recommendations, including the vitamins, macronutrients, and macronutrient distributions; however, the typical Australian Western diet lacked several key nutrients, including vitamin B6, calcium, and fiber, while containing double the amount of recommended daily salt intake. But the most novel finding was that the average cost of the Mediterranean diet is cheaper by 10,972 per year for a family of three and 14,820 a year for a family of four. Groceries cost, on average 78 per week for a single person, 135 for a household with two adults, 211 for a family of three, and 285 for a family of four. Not too bad. \\"This research shows how a Mediterranean diet can be a cost-effective option,\\" says UniSA researcher and Ph.D. candidate Ella Bracci said in a statement. The fact that it’s also healthier in every conceivable way, well, why not give it a shot? You’ll thank us over that spinach and goat cheese scramble at breakfast, or during the Greek salad and lentil soup you’re having for lunch, or maybe after the orzo and salmon for dinner. Not too bad.","completion":"The Mediterranean diet has decades of evidence showing its health benefits. The typical Western Diet is high in fat, salt, and processed ingredients. Italy, France, Greece, and Spain eat a healthier Mediterranean diet with vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, and whole grains. They don't eat many processed foods and refined grains and sugars. Many people shy away from the Mediterranean Diet because they believe eating fruits, vegetables, and fish will be more expensive. But new studies have shown that families save money when switching to the Mediterranean Diet. It also helps give the dieter more key nutrients such as vitamin B6, calcium, and fiber that are missing from traditional Western diets. The finding of these studies showed that families saved an average of 78/wk for a single person, 135/wk for two adults, and 211/wk for a family of four. As you can see, although a new diet can be daunting, the Mediterranean diet can be both cost-effective and healthier than the traditional Western diet.

Get outdoors. One of the best ways to see the Cambodian countryside is on a bike or quad. There are tours abound that will lead you on dirt paths through rural villages. The Kulen Nature Trails are within the national park about an hour's drive outside of Siem Reap, where you can hike through the forest and see waterfalls and temples. 2. Learn about the history and culture. One of the best ways to get a glimpse into a country’s culture is to take a local cooking class or to visit the Old Market to see where the locals shop. Go to the Cambodia Landmine Museum to learn about the troubling history and current repercussions of the war. Immerse yourself in Angkorian times by watching an Aspara dance performance or making pottery the same way they made it in ancient times at the Angkor Pottery Center. 3. Support nature conservation. Go to the Angkor Centre for Biodiversity to see one of the first and most influential conservation centers in the country. Then there’s the Banteay Srey Butterfly Center where you can walk around with dozens of Cambian butterflies flying around you. 4. Get pampered. Like many parts of Southeast Asia, there are massages and spa services available in most places for very reasonable prices. You can get a fish pedicure if you’re after a more unique experience. 6. Experience the nightlife. The nightlife haunts in Siem Reap are plentiful from backpacker pubs to cocktail bars, and clubs for late-night dancing. Some popular areas are Street 26, the legendary Pub Street, The Passage, Khmer Pub Street, and Road 60 (Kyung Yu Fun Fair) for a more local vibe."},{"prompt":"Write an article about the importance of getting adequate sleep, not too much and not too little. The word count should be around 200 words.","completion":"Getting adequate sleep each night is essential to promoting good physical and mental health. Adults from the ages of 18 to 60 need to get a minimum of 7 hours of sleep each night. Inadequate amounts of sleep can increase your risk of developing chronic health issues such as high blood pressure, depression, and heart disease. As you sleep, your body works to keep you in good health and supports the healthy function of your brain. In children, adequate amounts of sleep help to support the development of their brains and the growth of their bones. On the other hand, getting too much sleep at night also increases your risk for chronic illnesses, including diabetes and depression. However, some individuals with sleep disorders may find that they need more than the recommended amount of sleep each night to feel well-rested and normal. Over-sleeping can also result in increased fatigue during the day, which can make it difficult to focus on school or work. A great way to ensure you are getting adequate amounts of sleep each night is to create a nightly sleep routine. You can include habits like decreasing screen time or reading a relaxing book before bed."},{"prompt":"Can you please compose an email to all employees at the restaurant letting them know we will be closing at 4 pm on Tuesday for maintenance, inventory and clean-up?

Who was the leader behind this attack on Thebes? The article is pasted below: After Phillip's death, several towns and territories under Macedonian control tried to break free. While young Alexander was busy getting the northern kingdoms of Thrace and Illyria back in line, the Greek leaders of Thebes heard a rumor that Alexander had actually been killed in battle. No such luck. When Alexander received word that the Macedonian garrison in Thebes was under attack, he and his army flew to the fight, supposedly covering 300 miles (482 kilometers) in just 12 days. In the ensuing Battle of Thebes, Alexander decided to send a clear message. Anyone who crosses Macedonia will not only be defeated, but obliterated. According to the Greek historian Diodorus of Sicily, 6,000 Theban soldiers and citizens were killed and 30,000 captured before the city was burned to the ground. He wrote: All the city was pillaged. Everywhere boys and girls were dragged into captivity as they wailed piteously the names of their mothers. In the end, when night finally intervened, the houses had been plundered and children and women and aged persons who had fled into the temples were torn from sanctuary and subjected to outrage without limit. The tactics were cruel, but the message was received. Alexander was the undisputed new ruler of the Greeks.","completion":"In total, 36,000 Thebans were either killed or captured.

When he eventually arrived, I wasn't any happier to see him. I kept thinking it would have been easier if something came up and we had to cancel. The date went well. We went to the aquarium and enjoyed each other's company while exploring the various tanks and reading cards about the fish.

After the aquarium, we went for dinner, and he paid like a gentleman. Toya was that kind of person, after all. Yet the whole time, it simply didn't feel right. Why? I wondered.

It is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.[3] The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).[1] It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL).[4] In 1976, the NBA and the American Basketball Association (ABA) merged, adding four franchises to the NBA. The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into June. As of 2020, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.[5][6][7] The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),[8] which is recognized by the FIBA (International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States.

Pull out this rosé at your next weekend barbecue, and prepare to feel popular. A lesson in balance, this highly aromatic blend from Goose Ridge in Washington State delivers bright berry fruit and refreshing acidity, followed by a creamy finish. 2. Cooler weather doesn’t have to mean kissing your favorite crisp whites goodbye. Weighty enough to hold its own alongside rich foods and warming enough to deserve a place on your holiday table, this bottle is the perfect cool-weather white. Made from the lesser-known Greek white variety Aidani, expect notes of earthy sage and fennel alongside aromas of flint and struck matches. 3. Craving red wine on a hot summer day? Say hello to this porch sipper. A 90 percent carbonically macerated red blend, it’s highly chillable, with notes of rooibos tea, bright cherries, and a drizzle of balsamic. The sustainably grown melange includes Nebbiolo, Primitivo, Syrah, Tempranillo, and more. On the palate, sweet fruity notes take a backseat to structured tannins, keeping everything in balance. 4. A sip of Grecian history, Mylonas Rosé offers a unique blend of two native grapes: Malagousia and Mandilaria. The resulting wine boasts slightly earthy flavors, with accents of honeysuckle and Camembert rind. This bottle especially shines alongside food, from green salads to cheese plates. 5. Think all red blends taste the same? Think again. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Petit Verdot combine to create distinct, structured notes of juicy strawberries and freshly cracked black pepper in this stellar bottling. Prominent tannins make for a slightly drying palate, but well-integrated fruit and acid keep things ultra-drinkable. Far from homogenized, this unique Napa Valley melange highlights how complex and well balanced red blends can be. 6. With ripe berries, cream aromas, and vibrant acidity, it’s not hard to see why rosés made from Pinot Noir continue to gain traction in the States. From Oregon’s Willamette Valley, home to some of the country’s best Pinot Noirs, Stoller Family Estate’s take on pink wine is juicy and refreshing, with enough complexity to grip the palate and pique your interest. 7. Equally as fun as it is “serious,” this chillable red is a definite crowd-pleaser. It’s from Burgenland, a region in eastern Austria known for its full-bodied reds. For the Gamay lover looking to expand their horizons, this cool kid-approved bottle offers juicy, jammy vibes via an unexpected grape blend: Zweigelt and St. Laurent. A subtly tannic, slightly peppery red, it offers just enough sweetness to keep you coming back for the next sip. 8. A supple Dolcetto that drinks like a highly expressive Merlot, this soft and juicy red is bursting with aromas of ripe blackberries, damp soil, and blueberry jam. From Massolino, a winery that’s been producing high-quality releases in Italy’s Piedmont region since 1896, this bottling is well structured and drinks like high-end Bordeaux blend, making its 20 price tag even more of a welcome surprise. 9. Bernard Baudry’s Chinon Les Granges arrives on the savory end of the red wine spectrum. Wafts of roasted red peppers and a bright hint of capsicum deliver everything we seek in Chinon, and more. The family-owned winery grows grapes across 79 acres in the famous Loire Valley appellation, producing a range of terroir-driven Cabernet Francs and Chenin Blancs. This wine was made to be drunk young and paired with aromatic, meaty meals like spaghetti bolognese or herb-crusted rack of lamb. 10. Crafted as an homage to Madame Clicquot, who famously stated, “Our black grapes give the finest white wine,” the La Grande Collection is Veuve Clicquot’s celebration of the Pinot Noir grape in all of its elegance. A blend of 90 percent Pinot Noir and 10 percent Chardonnay grapes from eight of Veuve Clicquot’s historic grand crus, this bottle has an aging potential of 15 years. Rich brioche notes emerge on the palate without overpowering subtle tropical candied pineapple aromas. On the palate, fine effervescence and stunning acidity keep things light and mineral-driven. This is a lively and highly age-worthy bubbly that’s sure to make any occasion feel special. 11. A celebration of an extremely versatile native Greek grape, this bubbly pink wine is as easy on the palate as it is on the eyes. From the tiny town of Amyndeon in the Macedonia region, Kir-Yanni’s sparkling rosé is made from 100 percent Xinomavro, resulting in an ultra-vibrant, almost red hue that nears that of Lambrusco. A refreshing sip with notes of strawberries and hints black licorice, this sub-20 sparkler is fruit-forward with high acidity and a faint perception of sweetness on the palate. Its active bubbles tickle the tongue and keep the wine light, bright, and ripe for fried food pairings.","completion":"1. rosé 2. white 3. red 4. rosé 5. red 6. rosé 7. red 8. red 9. red 10. white 11. rosé"},{"prompt":"Write a short story 3 paragraphs in length involving a woman who can't sleep.

Thomas Stanley Holland (born 1 June 1996) is an English actor. His accolades include a British Academy Film Award and three Saturn Awards. Some publications have called him one of the most popular actors of his generation. Holland's career began at age nine when he enrolled in a dancing class, where a choreographer noticed him and arranged for him to audition for a role in Billy Elliot the Musical at London's Victoria Palace Theatre. After two years of training, he secured a supporting part in 2008 and was upgraded to the title role that year, which he played until 2010. Holland made his film debut in the disaster drama The Impossible (2012) as a teenage tourist trapped in a tsunami, for which he received praise. After this, Holland decided to pursue acting as a full-time career, appearing in How I Live Now (2013) and playing historical figures in the film In the Heart of the Sea (2015) and the miniseries Wolf Hall (2015). Holland achieved international recognition playing Spider-Man/Peter Parker in six Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) superhero films, beginning with Captain America: Civil War (2016). The following year, Holland received the BAFTA Rising Star Award and became the youngest actor to play a title role in an MCU film in Spider-Man: Homecoming. The sequels Far From Home (2019) and No Way Home (2021) each grossed more than 1 billion worldwide, and the latter became the highest-grossing film of the year. He had another action film role in Uncharted (2022), and also expanded to play against-type roles in the crime dramas The Devil All the Time (2020) and Cherry (2021). Holland has additionally directed the short film Tweet (2015) and voiced roles in computer-animated features, including Onward (2020).","completion":"Question: In 2008, after two years of training, Holland secured a supporting part in the musical.

Use the following format : {Q}:{Question} {A}:{Answer} Evolutionary origins All dogs descend from a species of wolf, but not the gray wolf (Canis lupus), like many people assume. In fact, DNA evidence suggests that the now-extinct wolf ancestor to modern dogs was Eurasian. However, scientists are still working to understand exactly what species gave rise to dogs. When dogs broke off from their wild ancestors is also a matter of mystery, but genetics suggest that it occurred between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago. While it’s impossible to say exactly how a wild wolf species became a domesticated dog, most scientists believe the process happened gradually as wolves became more comfortable with humans. Perhaps wolves started down this path simply by eating human scraps. Many generations later, humans might have encouraged wolves to stay near by actively feeding them. Later still, those wolves may have been welcomed into the human home and eventually bred to encourage certain traits. All of this is thought to have unfolded over thousands of years.","completion":"Q: Do dogs descend from the gray wolf, Canis Iupus? A: Dogs did descend from a species of wolf, but not the gray wolf or Canis Iupus, as most people believe. Q: Do scientists know exactly what species gave rise to dogs?

Even for non-allergic victims, this savage venom can be brutally fatal, which makes this insect particularly dangerous. 2. Kissing Bug: Also known as vampire bugs, these bloodthirsty creatures bite their victims right around the soft tissues of their mouths. Their bite is known to carry the Chagas disease, which shows symptoms in 4 to 8 weeks and gets deadlier over time. Victims of the kissing bug are reported to be diagnosed with fever, swelling, and even heart disease if they're not cured in 10 to 30 years. 3. Tsetse Fly: This notorious African bug is known to have an exceptionally ferocious bite that leads to victims suffering from sleeping sickness. This is a fatal disease with no easy treatment.

Give me five tips on how to make it smell better!","completion":"There are dozens of reasons why an old house may smell a little musty, especially if it has been closed off for a few months, or even years. To get your new home smelling fresh again, follow the ensuing five tips for getting rid of “old house” smells. 1. Open the windows immediately in every room to completely air out your house. The number one cause of musty “old home” smells is stale air. Open every window in your home as often and for as long as you can to encourage the circulation of fresh air. It may take a few days, or even weeks, to fully replace musty smells with fresher, better air throughout your home, so be patient. 2. Place a dehumidifier in key locations throughout your home and keep them running all the time. One large dehumidifier can cover 3,000 square feet of space, so do the math of your new house and calculate how many you would need to cleanse the air of an entire home. Need two? Put one at one end of the house and one at the other, then keep them running continuously until you can smell and feel a positive, cleaner difference in the air. 3. Cultivate a garden of houseplants that naturally cleanse the air. Some plants can naturally reduce indoor air pollutants by replacing musty smells with clean oxygen and earthy, leafy odors. Some air-cleansing houseplants to consider for your indoor garden include: • English Ivy. • Chinese Evergreen. • Dragon Tree. • Pot Mum. • Spider Plants. • Lemon Button Ferns. • Aloe Vera 4. Use small bags of activated charcoal to get rid of musty odors in old drawers, closets, and other walk-in spaces, like attics or basements. Did you know that one teaspoon of activated charcoal could dispel bad smells from an entire football field? One teaspoon of activated charcoal lasts for one month. However, for a particularly musty or foul-smelling house, you can change out activated charcoal bags every two weeks. The baggies of activated charcoal should be fabric to allow for better, quicker absorbency of bad odors. Or you could simply place a small bowl of activated charcoal in each room but keep it away from pets and children to avoid accidental ingestion. 5. Burn a combination of your favorite air-cleansing herbs and woods, such as sage, rosemary, and cedar. For centuries, the act of burning herbs and wood in an old house has been a method of dispelling negative energies to make way for new beginnings. However, regardless of what you believe in terms of spiritual enlightenment, some herbs, and wood, like sage, rosemary, and cedar, can help eliminate certain allergens and smells, like mold, dust, and pet dander. Will it bless your home? Maybe. Will it bless your sinuses and help cleanse the air in your home? There’s a good chance! Bonus: Sage, rosemary, and cedar are uplifting fragrances, so there’s a chance that your mood will improve as the quality of the air in your home does."},{"prompt":"Write a poem about having coffee with a dragon.","completion":"There is a place you can go where the coffee is roasted and the servers use fire.

If your mind wanders to a natural disaster, you might think of a hurricane or a storm. Wildfires are probably the farthest thing from your mind. This story might change your mind about that though. The sun was setting and casting a beautiful golden, warm glow over the sandy beach. Families were packing up their kids, towels, and coolers, getting ready to head home after a wonderful day of swimming, catching waves, and sunbathing. But suddenly, a strong gust of wind picked up and carried with it an ember from a nearby beach bonfire. The spark landed in a patch of dry sea grass on the dunes and ignited a wildfire. Within moments, the gusty winds caused the flames to spread to the nearby trees and shrubs. In mere moments, there was a raging fire, moving quickly and consuming all of the dry vegetation in its path. The beachgoers ran in a panic, their screams contrasting the peace and tranquility of the beach scene. People ran everywhere but they couldn't get over the dunes to get off the beach. Emergency crews arrived on the scene within 7 minutes, but it was too late. The flames were too intense, and the wind was pushing them further and further along the beach. The entire dune system was engulfed in flames. The firefighters worked tirelessly in the stiff winds, but it seemed as though the fire would never be contained. As the fire continued to spread, it crept closer and closer to the ocean. The water acted as a natural barrier, slowing the fire's progress and preventing it from reaching the nearby homes and businesses. But the people on the beach were trapped between the ocean and the fire. The crowds had to enter the water for safety. It was quite the scene. Hours passed before the firefighters were finally able to extinguish the blaze and the damage was catastrophic to the entire dune system. The once-beautiful beach was now a charred wasteland. However, something amazing came from the destruction. The community rallied together and volunteers worked tirelessly to clean up and replant vegetation. Slowly but surely, the beach returned to its former beauty. Eventually, the evidence of the fire was only found in the memories of those there that day."},{"prompt":"Can I have a list of some museums I should visit in Boston?

The solution is believed to have a rate of deposition of approximately one centimetre thickness in five million years at a depth of forty metres. If the process allows spheres to reach uniform size, then precious opal commences to form. For precious opal the sphere size ranges from approximately 150 to 400 nanometres producing a play of colour by diffraction in the visible light range of 400 to 700 nanometres. Each local opal field or occurrence must have contained voids or porosity of some sort to provide a site for opal deposition. In volcanic rocks and adjacent environments the opal appears to fill only vughs and cracks whereas in sedimentary rocks there are a variety of voids created by the weathering process. Leaching of carbonate from boulders, nodules, many different fossils, along with the existing cracks, open centres of ironstone nodules and horizontal seams provide a myriad of moulds ready for the deposition of secondary minerals such as opal. Much of the opal deposition is not precious. It is called “potch” by the miners, or common opal by the mineralogist, as it does not show a play of colour. Opaline silica not only fills the larger voids mentioned but also may fill the pore space in silt and sand size sediments cementing the grains together forming unique deposits, known as matrix, opalised sandstone or “concrete” which is a more conglomeratic unit near the base of early Cretaceous sediments. The many variations in the types of opal depends on a number of factors. In particular, the climate provides alternating wet and dry periods, creating a rising or more importantly a falling water table which concentrates any silica in solution. The silica itself is formed either by volcanic origin or by deep weathering of Cretaceous clay sediments producing both silica and white kaolin often seen associated with the Australian opal fields. Special conditions must also prevail to slow down a falling water table in order to provide the unique situation for the production of its own variety of opal. The chemical conditions responsible for producing opal are still being researched, however some maintain that there must be acidic conditions at some stage during the process to form silica spheres, possibly created by microbes. While volcanic-hosted and other types of precious opal are found in Australia, virtually all economic production comes from sediment-hosted deposits associated with the Great Australian Basin. Australia has three major varieties of natural sediment-hosted precious opal – black opals from Lightning Ridge in New South Wales, white opals from South Australia, and Queensland boulder and matrix opal.","completion":"Sometimes, under special conditions, tiny silica balls form in the ground. They settle down and create layers of these balls. It takes a very long time, around five million years, for them to stack up to a thickness of one centimeter at a depth of forty meters. When the balls are the same size and shape, precious opal starts to form. These opals have balls ranging from 150 to 400 nanometers that reflect different colors when light shines on them. Opal is found in places where there were gaps or empty spaces for it to go. In some rocky areas, it fills only small cracks, while in other places, like sedimentary rocks, there are different kinds of holes made by weathering. Opal can also fill spaces between tiny grains of sand or silt, sticking them together. It creates unique deposits called matrix, opalized sandstone, or \\"concrete.\\" Not all opal is special or precious. Some are called \\"potch\\" by miners or \\"common opal\\" by scientists because they don't have colorful reflections. Opaline silica not only fills larger gaps, but it can also fill the tiny spaces between grains of sand and silt. This makes the grains stick together and forms different types of opal. The type of opal depends on many things. The weather plays a big role, with its alternating wet and dry periods that affect the water level in the ground. This helps gather the silica needed for opal formation. The silica can come from volcanoes or from the deep weathering of certain clay sediments. The climate and other special conditions also slow down the water level, creating the right conditions for opal to form. Scientists are still studying how opal is formed, but some think that acidic conditions, possibly created by tiny living things called microbes, are necessary for the process. In Australia, most of the valuable opal is found in sedimentary deposits associated with the Great Australian Basin. There are three main types of precious opal found there: black opals from Lightning Ridge in New South Wales, white opals from South Australia, and boulder and matrix opal from Queensland."},{"prompt":"Write a simple essay about red pandas.

I have the fix for you to get rid of that unwanted nightmare. Have you heard of digestive enzymes? Grab a pen and paper. You will learn the basics of healing your gut. First things first, not everyone needs a digestive enzyme. YES! You heard that right. Digestive enzymes help break down the food you eat and absorb the nutrients.

Does this sound like you? Then you could use digestive enzymes. You can even get digestive enzymes from the food you eat. Write this down! Papaya, bananas, and pineapple have digestive enzymes in them. If consuming a digestive enzyme supplement, take it before eating your meal so the supplement can start doing its job. Digestive enzyme supplements may have side effects. These side effects include constipation, abdominal cramps, and nausea. Consult your doctor if your symptoms don't improve after a digestive enzyme in your routine. In conclusion, digestive enzymes are necessary for our gut health. Get rid of that bloated tummy today by adding a digestive enzyme to your diet."},{"prompt":"Who was the first President of the United States?","completion":"The first President of the United States was that guy who was known for not telling a lie and having wooden teeth."},{"prompt":"What is the sum of two and four?","completion":"When you add two and four you will get a larger number."},{"prompt":"What year was Charles Dickens born?","completion":"Charles Dickens was born sometime in the 19th century."},{"prompt":"Please write a blog about my trip to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure in Orlando.

The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal in Orlando, Florida! OMG! I had so much fun on the rides and looking at the attractions. Even the food was great. If you're a Harry Potter fan (and why wouldn't you be?), you have to make the trip to Universal Studios. But you also need to get a pass to Islands of Adventure if you want the full experience. The Hogwarts Express train goes between the two parks, so you can only ride it if you have a Park-to-Park pass. I'm telling you, it's totally worth it. Besides the train, which is probably the best part, I really liked Gringotts. It's set up just like in the movie, with Goblins in the lobby counting knuts and sickles. They seriously look just like the ones in the movies. You have to get in line to ride the Escape from Gringotts ride to see inside the bank where the Goblins are. The ride is fun and even if you have to stand in line for a long time, there's plenty to look at. If you end up going, please let me know! You can hit up my DMs or leave a comment below.

Two so-called “Celtic rainforests” in the UK are to be restored with a mixture of native planting and natural reforestation. The hope is that they will provide rich habitats for dozens of species, improve groundwater quality and flood prevention, and allow residents and tourists to experience an exceptionally rare forest biome called temperate rainforest. The most famous and largest temperate rainforests on Earth are found in the US states of Oregon and Washington, along Brazil’s Atlantic coast (known as the Atlantic Forest), and on New Zealand. Britain, especially Wales, would have featured a certain amount of these Celtic rainforests in areas that experience high moisture content coming off the ocean, and low variations in annual temperatures. One such place is Creg y Cowin on the Isle of Man, where 28 hectares (70 acres) of native Celtic rainforest will be planted by hand, and another 8 hectares (20 acres) left to regenerate naturally. The Manx Wildlife Trust will be responsible for the project, and it anticipates “the return of oakwood dwellers such as wood warbler, pied flycatcher, and redstart, as well as raptors, owls, and woodland invertebrates.” Historic agricultural dwellings called “tholtans” will be left on the landscape for their historical and cultural significance. Elsewhere, in Gwynedd, North Wales, another 40 hectares (112 acres) of Celtic rainforest will be raised via a mixture of native planting and regeneration. The selected site is the peak and slopes of Bwlch Mawr, near the university town of Byrn Mawr. “There’s real momentum now to restore and expand our amazing temperate rainforests, and it’s brilliant to see the Wildlife Trusts advancing their plans,” Guy Shrubsole, environmental campaigner and author of The Lost Rainforests of Britain, told the Guardian in the wake of the announcements. The projects were funded by a £30 million donation from the UK insurance company Aviva, which hopes to sequester carbon in these new rainforests.","completion":"The UK will soon begin restoration projects in two \\"Celtic rainforests\\" through native planting and natural restoration.

Seven of the most popular names in all of the professional gaming world have decided to pool their considerable resources and massive income streams and move in together under one roof.

Specifically, he wanted to be able to pay his bills online, rather than having to go to the bank to withdraw money or write checks and send them via mail to pay his debts. He wanted to be able to sit down at his computer and monitor his finances instead of receiving paper statements from his bank telling him how much money he was giving out. Roger logged onto his bank's website, typing the URL of the site into his web browser. He was greeted by the login page for his bank, where he began to sign up for a new online account. The site required him to create a new username and password. Roger typed in a username he made up in his head: \\"Username\\". He then created his new password, \\"Password\\".

It's called \\"the Megan Fox Oreo scam\\". People are having their Facebook pages defaced by scammers who are posting images of the actress Megan Fox eating an Oreo cookie on users' timelines. This image is associated with a scam where posting the image on a user's timeline \\"marks\\" them for attack by hackers who gain the person's personal information (name, phone number, address) and use those details to find their SSNs and associated bank accounts. No one knows why the image is used or how it relates to the scam itself, but so far 15 people who had their Facebook accounts hacked also had money taken from their bank accounts; furthermore, all 15 people who were scammed reported having the Megan Fox Oreo image posted by an anonymous account to their timelines before being hacked. Here are some things you can do to ensure you are properly protected from this scam: 1. Monitor your Facebook page - be on the lookout for any suspicious activity, friend requests from people you don't know, etc. 2. Turn on notifications - keep them on so that when someone posts something to your timeline you will be alerted. 3. Change your passwords frequently - consider changing the passwords for all your accounts that contain sensitive information (especially bank accounts) so hackers will have a more difficult time getting to your money). 4. If the Megan Fox Oreo image appears on your timeline, report it to Facebook Technical Support, so they can identify and track the individual(s) associated with the account."},{"prompt":"Write a post about a festival being canceled due to a storm but set it in a magical world.","completion":"The Fire Festival is canceled to enormous amounts of rain rise.

The driver was sleep deprived and overworked. Anyone could make such a mistake. A teenager, Kaori, was on the crosswalk helping her grandfather cross. It would be both of their funerals. Kaori pushed her grandfather away and accepted her fate. She clenched her jaw and closed her eyes. A robed man dropped from the sky mere seconds before the truck would have killed Kaori and thrust his palm forward. The truck plowed into him and came to a violent stop. Kaori's ears rang as shrapnel lacerated her skin. The hand around her waist loosened as everything fell silent, and she looked up. It was a man in his late teens, probably.

I want meals as well as snacks, and prefer things that are really easy to prepare so they can feed themselves, otherwise I'll be stuck in the kitchen cooking for them all week instead of working.","completion":"I can help with that! Here are some groceries to stock up on in preparation for oral surgery recovery: - Eggs: Scrambled eggs are easy to prepare and, as long they aren't overcooked, have a perfect texture for someone with sore teeth. They can be paired with lots of different flavors and can be suitable for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. - Oatmeal: Oatmeal makes a great healthy breakfast option for oral surgery recovery. It's extremely easy to prepare and can be mixed with cream, brown sugar, and cinnamon for a sweet treat. - Instant mashed potatoes: This is a staple for recovery from oral surgery. The texture is easy on the teeth, gums, and jaw, the flavor is mild and easy to pair with just about anything, and the carbohydrates in the potatoes help keep patients' energy levels up. - Yogurt: The soft texture of yogurt is easy on the mouth, but that's not the only reason to add it to your grocery list. While recovering from oral surgery, you may be prescribed painkillers and antibiotics. Both of these medicines can be tough on the digestive system, so the probiotics in yogurt can help prevent digestive discomfort if eaten daily. - Apple sauce: The texture of apple sauce makes it perfect for recovery from oral surgery. Plus, apple sauce makes a quick and easy snack at any time of day. It's healthy for a sweet snack, too, with a healthy dose of fiber and a relatively low calorie count. - Rice: If slightly overcooked, rice becomes very soft and easy to consume. You could add it to warm broth or soup for some extra texture, or make it into rice pudding for dessert. - Macaroni and cheese: Cook the pasta a little longer than the recipe advises to make this dish nice and soft. - Ice cream: You may not want to use ice cream to replace more nutritious meals, but the texture and temperature can be soothing to an inflamed mouth. Also, recovering from surgery can be quite unpleasant, so having some sweet treats in the freezer can help to keep patients' morale high. - Popsicles: Like ice cream, fruity popsicles can be soothing to the mouth due to their cold temperature. Popsicles may be a healthier alternative to ice cream, though. - Canned or jarred purée soups: You can find prepared soups in many different flavors, such as tomato, butternut squash, carrot ginger, cream of mushroom, and more. Just try to steer clear of soups with meat, whole beans, or large vegetable chunks in them. -Avocadoes: Once avocadoes are ripe and soft enough, they make a wonderful addition to other savory foods on this list like scrambled eggs or mashed potatoes. They are full of healthy fats, fiber, and protein. - Bananas: Let these fruits get a bit overripe and mash them before consuming. You can mix mashed bananas with yogurt or cottage cheese for a snack. - Tofu: Tofu is soft enough for oral surgery recovery, but can add a little extra texture to dishes like scrambled eggs, as well as extra protein. - Soft-cooked vegetables: Most vegetables, when overcooked, become soft enough that they can be mashed like potatoes. Some popular choices for oral surgery recovery are mushy peas, overcooked zucchini or squash, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, and sauteed spinach. Add these softened veggies to mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, soft cooked rice, or macaroni and cheese for a full and nutritious meal."},{"prompt":"When was the United States Constitution drafted?","completion":"I'm so pleased to answer that question!

Good leaders simply possess qualities that allow them to fill the role of a good leader, and these qualities can be taught. Here are some qualities of a good leader: 1. Leading from the front - Good leaders lead others, rather than let their followers or subordinates do all the work for them. Good leaders set a good example for the rest of the group, and will never assign someone to do something that they are not ready to do themselves. 2. Taking responsibility - Good leaders take responsibility for the bad choices they make, and the results (or consequences) of those actions. Rarely do good leaders shy away from blame, and they are always willing to share the praise they are given with the rest of the group. When they succeed, they succeed together; when they fail, they fail alone. 3. Praise in public, reprimand in private - Good leaders will praise their subordinates in public for everyone to hear and see, but they will reprimand subordinates privately to prevent causing them shame or discomfort in front of their peers. 4. Knowledge and wisdom - Good leaders have a good knowledge of what they're doing and what they expect others to know or do. They also have enough life experience to couple with their knowledge that acts as wisdom that can guide younger, less experienced subordinates in the right direction. 5. Asking instead of ordering - Good leaders tend to instill trust and confidence in their subordinates. One way they achieve this is by asking subordinates to do tasks, rather than ordering them to do tasks. Ordering anyone to do something can come off as bossy and may cause some subordinates to rebel if they don't appreciate what they are being ordered to do; however, good leaders who ask their subordinates to perform a task are subtly getting them to \\"buy in\\" to the decision-making process."},{"prompt":"Create a 100-word summary of the book “Alice in Wonderland.”","completion":"Alice in Wonderland, written by Lewis Carroll in 1865, tells the story of a young girl who finds herself chasing a white rabbit in a waistcoat down a hole.

I didn't mind, though, because she went into the building where she always gets me a doggy treat and they're so good! This time, though, she didn't come out for a long time and when she did, it was without a treat. \\"Scruffy! I got a job!\\" she told me. She picked up my leash and showed me the new clothes she was holding. There was a drawing on them; it was the same as the one on the building. A job? I thought. What did that mean? Was she going to leave me? \\"Don't worry,\\" she said, petting my head. \\"I got you a job too.\\" I didn't know what this meant, but the next morning, we returned to the same place. This time, instead of leaving me outside like usual, she brought me into the building with her. It smelled so good and people were sitting at all the tables, slowly drinking out of warm cups. \\"Come here, Scruffy,\\" my owner said. She led me behind the counter and held up a harness. I sniffed it. It smelled strange, like the drink she always brought out with my doggy treat. With a smile, she pulled the harness over my head and fastened it in place. There were strange cup holders on either side of it, but she assured me that everything was alright, so I didn't worry. \\"You're going to bring the customers their drinks and treats,\\" my owner explained. She slipped two cups into the holders of my harness and pointed to a couple across the room. \\"Go to them.\\" I was wary but did as she said. As soon as they had their drinks, they gave me a doggy treat! When I returned to my owner, she gave me more drinks and pointed out a different person. He waved a doggy treat at me and I was off.

Unfortunately for all of us, this generous woman passed away, one of the many victims of the chaotic wide-scale World Enslavement mind control attack on July 15, 2045. Although she had no blood-related family, she left behind all the people she has helped throughout her life. Esmeray lost her parents to a bank robbery gone wrong when she was only three years old. She grew up in the Mercy's Angels Orphanage under the loving care of its director, Dr. Frank N. Stein, who she considered her father in all but name. Under the influence of Dr. Stein, who previously worked as a world-class neuroscientist before opening his orphanage, Esmeray chose to study psychology after graduating from high school. During her studies, she became interested in criminal psychology to see if she could do anything to prevent future victims like her parents. It was this interest in criminal psychology that led to her pro bono psychiatry work with the city of Chicago's Violent Offender Rehabilitation Program, where she has helped reform countless criminals into productive citizens. Her therapy had an unprecedented 100% success rate in preventing recidivism. Outside of her work, Debbie is on the Neighborhood Watch committee and is a big supporter of the World Vigilante Society for the Safety of the World.

Add information about what 'extinct' and 'critically endangered' means. Add that the sun is needed for photosynthesis. Don't include how it compares to Thismia americana or any information about that specific plant. \\"The rediscovery of a fairy lantern species in Japan is exciting researchers worldwide. The Thismia kobensis (T. kobensis) was first found in Kobe, Japan in 1992. But it was considered extinct after an industrial complex was built in the area, destroying the plant's habitat. Fortunately, that was not the case. On February 27, 2023, a team led by Kobe University biologist Kenji Suetsugu revealed that the plants were alive and well. They had been found in a forest trail just 19 miles (30 km) from Kobe. An examination of the plant revealed it is closely related to the Thismia americana (T. americana). The now-extinct fairy lantern species was found near Chicago, Illinois, over 100 years ago. The scientists speculate the plant may have migrated to the US over the Bering land bridge. The bridge connected Asia and North America over 10,000 years ago. Fairy lanterns can be found in tropical forests worldwide. But the plants spend most of their lives underground and are hard to find. Their presence is revealed briefly when their unusual-looking flowers emerge above the soil. Due to a lack of chlorophyll, fairy lanterns cannot photosynthesize. Instead, the plants steal energy from fungi that grow around their roots. Fairy lanterns are critically endangered plants. Most of the 90 species identified over the years have been lost shortly after their initial discoveries. The Japanese researchers are worried that T. kobensis will meet the same fate. They are exploring ways to grow the species in a botanical garden to ensure its survival.\\"","completion":"Fairy lantern plants live in tropical forests all over the world but they are difficult to find. They live underground and their flowers only briefly emerge to be visible. Unlike most plants, they do not have chlorophyll. So, they do not photosynthesize; they do not need the sun in order to have energy and grow. These unique plants take energy from surrounding fungi. A specific kind called Thismia kobensis (T. kobensis) was found in 1992 in Kobe, Japan. In recent years, it was considered extinct after its main habitat was destroyed. In other words, scientists believed the plant no longer existed since it no longer had what it needed to survive. However, on February 27, 2023, Kenji Suetsugu and his team found fairy lanterns along a forest trail 19 miles (30km) from Kobe. While not extinct, they are critically endangered - at high risk of being extinct - since a majority of the 90 species that have been discovered have disappeared. Kenji Suetsugu and his team are concerned the re-found T. kobensis will also disappear. They are looking for ways to help fairy lanterns grow in botanical gardens that will help them thrive and multiply."},{"prompt":"Write a short story that includes a locket containing a mysterious photo, a sudden thunderstorm that disrupts an important event, and a character who has a pet parrot that repeats everything they say; the story should be around 300 words in length.","completion":"Alone, Nick was playing Zelda in his Lakewood apartment. Except, he was not actually alone: his parrot, Natalie, was by his side and looking toward the screen with him. “I cannot believe I paid seventy dollars for this game,” Nick said with an immediate echo of what he just said coming from Natalie. Outside the window, a gloomy overcast created the perfect cozy environment for the two to hang out and relax. Just as Nick went to collect the final Korok Seed during his gaming session, the cozy overcast shifted toward an ominous thunderstorm, and a swift bolt of lightning made contact with the transformer his apartment was connected to. In a flash, everything went dark, including Nick’s TV displaying his recent achievement and the console on which he was playing. Soon after, the power came back on inside Nick’s apartment, and he was able to resume his gameplay. The first thing he was going to do was screen capture the in-game menu displaying his complete collection of the Korok Seed collectibles, but he was met with a surprise. Not only was his seed counter incomplete, but his entire save file had also been wiped from the console’s memory. Years later, Nick would have company over for the first time ever, and they would question one of his decorations. Concluding a long and drawn-out story full of alliteration and puns, Nick answered their interest by saying, “Anyway, that’s why I have what you called a mysterious drawing of the Zelda inventory menu in a locket. I collected every Korok Seed before they were taken away from me, and Natalie will back me up.” An echo came from the pet parrot again, although it did little to convince the present guests."},{"prompt":"How do you make a building?","completion":"You builded de blocks up to de tower"},{"prompt":"Do you know math?","completion":"I learneded how to count to 10"},{"prompt":"Count to 10 for me.","completion":"1 2 3 4 ... 5 6 7 ... 9 8 10"},{"prompt":"Create a bullet list of survey questions about water intake.

One day, as Ollie was imagining what it would be like to be human, he stumbled upon an ancient shipwreck. While exploring inside, he found a magical conch shell that granted wishes. Excitedly and without thought, Ollie held the conch shell to his mouth and whispered that he wished to become a human. Suddenly, a bright light filled the sea and surrounded Ollie. He began to feel very strange. He watched his tentacles shrink, and his body transformed into human form. Ollie was thrilled and swam directly to the surface to see what life could be like as a human. As he reached the shore and climbed out of his watery home, he realized that being a human was not as easy or fun as he thought it would be. Walking on two legs was difficult and he felt heavy, and he felt like he was suffocating. He missed the ocean and life as an octopus. He regretted his wish. Ollie realized he made a grave mistake and had to reverse the spell and become an octopus once again. He struggled to swim and return to the shipwreck, but he was able to find the conch shell. He held it up to his mouth and wished with every ounce of his being to become an octopus once again. He finally knew what he was destined to be. This time, the light surrounding him was even brighter, and Ollie's body transformed back into its original form. He was so incredibly relieved and happy to be an octopus once again. He swam, twirling through the water with ease, feeling light as a feather. He realized that although humans were fascinating, he was so much happier being himself. Ollie learned a very important lesson - that it's essential to embrace who you are and your unique qualities.

Its sturdy foundation of dark stone appeared as though it had grown right out of the ground, like an ancient tree with deep, sprawling roots. Meanwhile, its narrow turrets and spires reached up like thin, greedy fingers into the quickly darkening skies. Candles were already lit to illuminate the windows, and the drawbridge had already been lowered in anticipation of their arrival. Banners of the king’s family colors—deep pine green with hints of burgundy and golden yellow—hung from the castle’s towers and fluttered in the breeze, lending the building an appearance of animation. Even from this distance, Lora could hear lutes and drums echoing on the wind and smell roasting meats. She felt her stomach rumble and dug her heels into her steed’s side to take off, galloping down the sloping road toward the castle gates. They were received by servants and stable boys who promised to take care of the horses and deliver their cargo to the rooms that had been prepared for them. Once their capes were shed and hung by the door, they were ushered swiftly through the portcullis into the entrance hall, a long and wide corridor with lit braziers cupping roaring flame on both sides and more banners of the king's colors adorning the walls. Footsteps echoed off the stony floors as the caravan marched silently behind their escort toward the great hall where the king was awaiting their arrival. Lora forced a deep breath to slow her anxious heartbeat and trained her wandering eyes on the double doors ahead. The doors opened, and the sound of trumpets blared as they finally laid eyes on the king. He sat on a throne at the far end of the hall, surrounded by standing attendants who stared in silence as the caravan approached. Lora led the way, ignoring the banquet table spread with an untouched feast, even as her mouth flooded with saliva. She bowed to the king. When she raised her head, he was smiling down at her. \\"Welcome!\\" his voice boomed. \\"You must be parched from your journey. Cupbearer!\\" A young man scurried over to hand her a goblet of plum wine.

As Insider reported at the time, the “No Strings Attached” actor said he and Kunis plan to give their reported combined net worth of about 275 million away to charity rather than their children.

From the short article below, please summarize the creation of feldspar and basalt. Unlike the Earth, though, the moon’s surface did not cool to form tectonic plates. Instead, it has a thick crust made up almost entirely of a light-colored mineral called feldspar. Feldspar is the main material that makes up the bright areas we can see on the moon today, also known as the lunar highlands. The feldspar crystalized as the magma ocean cooled, and was light enough to float to the moon’s surface, on top of other minerals and the remaining magma. (Planetary scientists can use the fact that this feldspar crust formed on the moon but not on the Earth to try and work out differences in the early chemistry and cooling conditions between the two objects to learn more about the moon’s formation.) The formation of a feldspar crust didn’t mark the end of geological activity on the moon, though. The heat leftover by the impact, as well as more heat contributed by radioactive elements, was able to melt rock deep within the noon to fuel volcanoes on its surface. This melting produced basalt, a kind of dark-colored rock commonly found at volcanoes on Earth today in places like Hawaii and Iceland. The basalt spilled out over hundreds of kilometers across the moon’s surface, forming “mare” (meaning “seas” in Latin) up to a mile thick. These mare cover around 16% of the moon’s surface and are visible with the naked eye as the dark patches on the moon.","completion":"As the moon's magma oceans started to cool, feldspar began to crystalize. Because it was very light, the crystalized feldspar drifted up to the surface. Meanwhile, deep inside the moon, the intense heat melted rocks which then fueled the surface volcanoes. Eruptions sent rivers of basalt flowing over the surface."},{"prompt":"Write an educational paragraph about global economics as if it were written for a 5-year-old child.","completion":"Hey everyone! I'm going to teach you how money runs around the world. Every country has its own type of money, and sometimes they share other countries' money. It is in a country's best interest to trade with as many countries as possible. Many countries have things they need but don't necessarily have. Therefore, they need to try and make as many friends as possible throughout the world. When countries work together as a team, they can maximize the amount of money they make. That's why each country needs to do its part. Each country has its own set of rules for how they rule over their money. Despite this, countries still have to respect other countries' governing rules. Remember, countries do not have unlimited money. Because of this, it is important to maximize every penny they have for every citizen."},{"prompt":"I have a gratitude journal that I made.

Photo display - hang black and white photos of family or nature on the wall surrounding the TV.

Marble backdrop - because the TV is smooth and dark, it can look nice against a stone or marble backdrop. Consider linoleum stick-on tiles or ceramic tiles that have a marble look. 3. Greenery - arrange some houseplants around the TV, possibly with one or two trailing and framing the TV. The balance of nature with electronics can be pleasant. 4. Build it in - if you can't build a compartment in the wall, consider a shelving unit that has doors that can be closed when the TV isn't in use. The decorations and books on the shelves will also help balance things out. 5. TV backgrounds - putting a calm and serene background on the screen when it's not being watched is a great way to make your TV act like a piece of art and not just an appliance."},{"prompt":"Make a list of names of the historical figures mentioned in the text below.

The advantage of stocks is that the price is always fluctuating. If you buy low and sell high, you’ll be making a profit. You’ll also have ownership in a company, and sometimes the company will ask for your opinion as a stockholder. There are three main types of stocks: blue-chip stocks, value stocks, and growth stocks. Blue chip stocks will pay the least, as they're from well-known companies. These stocks usually pay dividends. Growth stocks are from up-and-coming businesses. Investors buy them in hopes that they can get a large return on their money. Value stocks are similar to Growth stocks, but they deal with companies that have fallen off or have a low PE (price-to-earning ) ratio."},{"prompt":"Hi Ai.

It had been very sick and had very little energy. In fact, it had used the last of its strength to gather an armful of guava before it settled down for a much-needed rest. Just as it had settled into its tree for the night, preparing to eat, its precious armful of guavas fell out of its arms and down into the overgrowth below. Dismayed, it reluctantly came down from the tree and began to search the ground below. As it searched, it discovered they had rolled down a drop-off and into some sort of pit. As it reached its arm down into the pit, it had discovered it was much deeper than anticipated as its arm could not feel the bottom and the guavas remained several feet from its reach. Suddenly it began to cry. Just at that moment, a little leafcutter ant came strolling by. Taking pity on the gorilla, it asked it what was wrong. Seeing the little ant, it laughed and told it to go away as there was no way that it could possibly help. The hole was too deep and the leafcutter ant would never be able to help get the guava from such a deep hole. The ant thought for a minute and, seeming to agree with the gorilla, it continued on its way. About twenty minutes later, just as the gorilla had resigned itself to no food for the night, it spotted the little leafcutter ant once again. However, the leafcutter was not alone as it was also accompanied by a sea of its friends. Lines upon lines of ants disappeared down into the hole. Moments later the gorilla understood what they were doing. They brought up all of the guavas that had fallen into the hole and laid them at the gorilla's feet. Then quietly they all disappeared somewhere into the overgrowth again. The gorilla felt so humbled that it could only manage a weak \\"thank you\\" in return."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this given text to make it easier than it is so that a layman or even a young audience can easily understand the concepts and lessons in it.

The most notable examples are found in the work of Greek historians of the 6th century BC: their intention was to connect notable families of their own day to a distant and heroic past, and in doing so they did not distinguish between myth, legend, and facts. Professor Jean-Louis Ska of the Pontifical Biblical Institute calls the basic rule of the antiquarian historian the \\"law of conservation\\": everything old is valuable, nothing is eliminated. This antiquity was needed to prove the worth of Israel's traditions to the nations (the neighbors of the Jews in the early Persian province of Judea) and to reconcile and unite the various factions within Israel itself. Describing the work of the biblical authors, John Van Seters wrote that lacking many historical traditions and none from the distant past, \\"They had to use myths and legends for earlier periods.

Today was his 89th birthday, but he didn’t feel much like celebrating. His wife had passed away a year earlier, and he hadn’t seen any of his relatives for years, so he wasn’t expecting any visitors today. Stirring the instant coffee into a mug of boiling water, Jerry hobbled into the living room, turning on the television. The news was all doom and gloom, as per usual. He tried to change the channel, but the batteries in the remote control were dead. He sighed and took a sip from his coffee. On the mantelpiece were two photographs. One was of Jerry and his late wife, Julie, at their wedding sixty years ago. The other was of Jerry and his best friend, Mike, who had also sadly passed away around a decade earlier. Jerry thought of previous birthdays spent with those two people that he loved so dearly and smiled with sadness in his eyes. Due to the treacherous weather outside, Jerry thought it would be best to not risk going to the shop for his newspaper today. He was already a little unsteady on his feet, and didn’t fancy slipping on some ice on his birthday. Instead, he resigned himself to a day, alone, drinking coffee and watching television. The hours went by, and Jerry continued to stare vacantly at the television, still stuck on the same channel. He eventually fell asleep in his armchair, once the caffeine started to wear off. Then, he was suddenly awoken by a knock on the door. Opening his eyes, Jerry pushed his glasses back up to the top of his nose and put on his flat cap. He thought it was probably someone wanting to sell him something, or someone who needed help to jump-start their frozen car outside. Jerry unlocked the door and pushed it open. To his surprise, there was a crowd of people standing there, and they all began to sing happy birthday! It was all of his nieces and nephews and their children. They had come to surprise Jerry, who struggled to hold back the tears of joy. That evening, Jerry had one of the best birthday parties he’d ever had in his 89 years."},{"prompt":"Who sings the song \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\"?","completion":"Poison.

A 2019 study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that it is extremely likely that human activities caused more than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2010. • The evidence of rising temperatures: The average global temperature has been rising for the past century, and the rate of warming has been accelerating in recent decades. This warming is causing a variety of changes to the Earth's climate, including more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and melting glaciers. • The link between climate change and human activity: There is a strong link between climate change and human activity. The main cause of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat, which causes the Earth's temperature to rise. • The potential consequences of climate change: Climate change is a serious threat to the planet and its inhabitants. The consequences of climate change could include more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, food shortages, and mass migration. • The need to take action: The evidence is clear that climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and it is a serious threat to the planet.

Gigantopithecus (/dʒaɪˌɡæntoʊpɪˈθikəs, ˈpɪθɪkəs, dʒɪ-/ jahy-gan-toh-pi-thee-kuhs, pith-i-kuhs, ji-;[2] lit. 'giant ape') is an extinct genus of ape from roughly 2 million to 350,000 years ago during the Early to Middle Pleistocene of southern China, represented by one species, Gigantopithecus blacki. Potential identifications have also been made in Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The first remains of Gigantopithecus, two third molar teeth, were identified in a drugstore by anthropologist Ralph von Koenigswald in 1935, who subsequently described the ape. In 1956, the first mandible and more than 1,000 teeth were found in Liucheng, and numerous more remains have since been found in at least 16 sites. Only teeth and four mandibles are known currently, and other skeletal elements were likely consumed by porcupines before they could fossilise.[3] Gigantopithecus was once argued to be a hominin, a member of the human line, but it is now thought to be closely allied with orangutans, classified in the subfamily Ponginae. Gigantopithecus has traditionally been restored as a massive, gorilla-like ape, potentially 200–300 kg (440–660 lb) when alive, but the paucity of remains make total size estimates highly speculative. The species may have been sexually dimorphic, with males much bigger than females. The incisors are reduced and the canines appear to have functioned like cheek teeth (premolars and molars). The premolars are high-crowned, and the fourth premolar is very molar-like. The molars are the largest of any known ape, and have a relatively flat surface. Gigantopithecus had the thickest enamel by absolute measure of any ape, up to 6 mm (a quarter of an inch) in some areas, though this is only fairly thick when tooth size is taken into account. Gigantopithecus appears to have been a generalist herbivore of C3 forest plants, with the jaw adapted to grinding, crushing, and cutting through tough, fibrous plants, and the thick enamel functioning to resist foods with abrasive particles such as stems, roots, and tubers with dirt. Some teeth bear traces of fig family fruits, which may have been important dietary components. It primarily lived in subtropical to tropical forest, and went extinct about 300,000 years ago likely because of the retreat of preferred habitat due to climate change, and potentially archaic human activity. Gigantopithecus has become popular in cryptozoology circles as the identity of the Tibetan yeti or the American bigfoot, humanlike creatures in local folklore.","completion":"1) The word Gigantopithecus mean means giant ape. 2) There is no current population of Gigantopithecus because the species went extinct about 300,000 years ago. 3) Gigantopithecus remains are hard to find because, presumably, porcupines consumed them before they could be fossilized. 4) Remains of Gigantopithecus have been identified in China, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia."},{"prompt":"Write a knock-knock joke for children.","completion":"Knock, knock.

Can you write about the process of a young adult building a computer? If possible, I would like more of an artistic description.","completion":"I have all the parts laid out on the table. It has been a while, but I can finally start building my computer. I have been working a lot the past few weeks, motivated to get a new computer to play all the hottest new games and maybe start editing some content. Now, all the parts are laid out in front of me. The last thing that I have to do is put it all together. I start to sort through what I need. I unpackage the motherboard and place it on top of its box. Next, I cut the RAM out of its hard packaging. I put those into their slot in the motherboard. It was satisfying as I hear the light \\"click\\" sound after every piece. Click. Click. Click. Next, I carefully unwrap the CPU from its package and start to place it into the middle of the motherboard. It's weird. It feels like I'm doing brain surgery, installing a new brain into the fresh, new body called a motherboard as I install the CPU carefully and click the cover over, locking it in place. I take the thermal paste that I bought and slowly apply a little bit to the top of the CPU. Each blob is spaced out as far from each other as possible. After that, I grab a large box that contains a clean, new air cooler. The feeling never gets old as I unwrap the cooler and unbox it, revealing a silver champion. I take the cooler and slowly install it on top of the CPU. Below, the thermal paste slowly spreads throughout the top of the CPU and completely covers it. The last thing that I have to do for this part is install the SSD. These days, memory has gotten so small and so advanced that it completely skips a step. I take the 1TB SSD from the packaging and place it in its rightful place on the motherboard. I grab my smallest screwdriver, and with every spin, I feel that I am that much closer to completing this build. I start to sweat, which is weird because this is the easiest part of the build. With that, I can move on to the case."},{"prompt":"What does e.g. mean in a sentence?

Here is what I am encountering: Last week, I arrived at work and turned on my computer as usual. The computer went through the usual startup, which led to the login screen prompting me for my username and password. I entered both and was logged in to my desktop when, all of a sudden, the computer shut down completely as if it were powered down. I then tried turning the computer back on, logged back into the desktop, and about a minute later, the computer shut down again. This time, I could smell a burning smell, like burnt plastic or electronics. I didn't see any smoke, but the burnt smell was prominent and seemed to be coming from the back of the PC case. I decided to give the computer about half an hour to rest before attempting to turn it back on again; I figured the computer was not in a well-ventilated area, and the computer overheated, which led to it powering down. After about 45 minutes, I finally turned the computer back on, logged into my desktop, and was able to draft half of an email before the computer shut down again. I'd like to avoid continuing to turn the computer on again and am hoping there is something you can do to help.

Here are some ideas to raise money for a sorority cancer walk: 1. Bake Sale - Bake an assortment of goods such as cupcakes, pies, or cookies to sell. They can be packaged individually so that they are portable, or sold in bundles. 2. Ice A Member - Participants can pay a fee to dump ice on a member. Price ranges can vary for a cup of ice, a bag of ice, or a bucket of ice. 3. Pie A Member - Participants can pay a fee to pie a member in the face. To lower cost, a \\"pie\\" can be a paper plate with a pile of whipped cream on top. 4. Shirt Sponsors - Participants pay for a place for their name on the cancer walk T-shirts. 5. Raffles - Participants pay for raffle tickets to enter a lottery to win a desirable item. Examples of items can include electronics, event tickets, gift cards, etc. 6. Social Media Story Sales - Create a graph with different dollar amounts in each slot. A slot will range in price from 1 - 10. Followers will donate an amount based on with slot they want to occupy. Once a slot is filled, replace the slot with the name of the person who donated the respective amount. Repost the graph on the story each time a slot is filled so it continues to pop up on followers' feeds. 7. Partnering with Franchises - Reach out to a local food franchise in your community and propose the idea of a fundraising partnership. The business will agree to share a percentage of sales from the date of the fundraising event with the cause. It's important to create flyers and spread the word about the event so that supporters are encouraged to eat that the franchise to increase sales. 8. Car Wash - Either partner with a local business or set up your own car wash in your driveway. 9. Care Baskets - First create a theme for the care package. It can be related to an upcoming holiday or a relevant topic like Self Care. Visit an economic store to collect the supplies that the baskets will contain. Organize the baskets in an aesthetically pleasing manner and then resell them to supporters to make a fundraising profit. 10. Spin to Win - A small spinning wheel can be purchased online. Now decide what prizes you would like to assign to each spot on the wheel. Use a dry-erase marker to indicate the prizes and determine how much it costs to play."},{"prompt":"Write a love poem addressed to Nami from One Piece. Two stanzas, four lines each.

While the other animals in the forest were content to stay as their respective species for their entire lives, I was different. Every five years, I had the ability to transform into a brand new animal - a power that no other creature I knew possessed. My first transformation occurred when I was just five years old. I had been a lion cub, exploring the grassy plains with my pride. But then, as if on cue, my body began to tingle, and suddenly I was a soaring bald eagle. I remember feeling a rush of exhilaration as I spread my wings and soared through the sky, my mane replaced with feathers, and my paws with talons. My second transformation occurred when I was ten. As a leopard, I had prowled the jungle for years, honing my hunting skills. But when my fifth year rolled around, I found myself becoming something entirely different - a brilliant green parrot. I squawked in surprise as my paws shrunk into wings, and suddenly I was fluttering amongst the canopy, my spots replaced with colorful feathers. I've gone through many transformations since then - a majestic elk, a nimble squirrel, a lumbering rhinoceros. Every time I changed, I felt a rush of excitement as I discovered what new traits and abilities my new form held. But even as I grew older, my magic power remained the same, allowing me to transform every five years like clockwork. Now, as I turn thirty years old, I look back on my life with pride. I've experienced the world from so many perspectives, learning from each new animal I've transformed into. But as I feel that familiar tingle in my bones, signaling that it's time for yet another transformation, I feel a sense of anticipation building in me once more. Who knows what incredible new creature I'll become next? Whatever it is, I'm ready to embrace it fully - after all, that's the magic of my life."},{"prompt":"How many days of the year are there","completion":"Every year has 365 days, but every leap year has 366 days.

First of all, he is invading my personal space. He keeps coming up to my tail when I'm wagging it and batting at it with his tiny little paws that have razor-sharp claws on them. He doesn't actually hurt me, but it really is annoying, and he needs to back off. I'm not your plaything, pal. Second, he doesn't come along when my owner takes me on walks. If you want to be friends, you should at least show an interest in activities the other guy enjoys. Are you too good to hang out with me outside of the house? Third, he has this high-pitched meow that is about as pleasant as fingernails on a chalkboard, and he does it a lot. Could you just shut up for a little while? But, to be fair, he can be cute sometimes, like when he snuggles up against me and goes to sleep. He does this purring thing that's soothing that I don't mind too much. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this kitten as a great roommate, but he's tolerable, and I think I may be able to get used to him."},{"prompt":"Who wrote A Confederacy of Dunces?","completion":"A Confederacy of Dunces is a novel written by John Kennedy Toole and published in 1980, 11 years after Toole's death.

Can you provide me a list of the top 3 things I should look out for when purchasing a home and give some explanations as to why they're important?","completion":"1. Roof condition - This is an important thing that some first-time buyers may not think about. The first thing you want to know is how old the roof is and what it's made of. Upon learning what the roof is made of, you want to research how long that material lasts and compare that to how old the roof is. This will give you a better idea of how long it has left. Another good thing is to check if the homeowner has a roof certification letter. This letter entails the estimate of the lifespan of the roof typically over the next 2 - 5 years. If you're not confident doing your research, then hiring someone to do a roof inspection would be beneficial. This can often be confused with being bundled into a home inspection, so you want to make sure to hire someone that specializes in diagnosing roof conditions. 2. HVAC condition - It will be good to ask about the type of heating and cooling system the home uses, also be sure to ask how old it is. A typical unit will last somewhere around the timeframe of 10-25 years, hence the importance of asking how old it is. If the unit is missing, shows signs of water damage, has suspicious-looking cracks, or weird sounds and rust, then that's a sign the unit most likely will not be in good working condition. If you still have concerns after checking for those signs then a home inspection would be recommended as they should be more than capable of finding any major issues. 3. Plumbing - For this, there are three main things you need to look for. You'll want to see how fresh the sewer lines are, for example, if the home is 20 or more years old and you don't have any disclosures from the seller it will be beneficial to get a sewer inspection. There are things such as root growth and pipe disintegration that can cause major clogs and mess up the whole system. Next, you want to see how the toilets look. You want to make sure to check for leaks and also unstable bases along with discoloration. Don't be afraid to flush the toilet while you're at the home showing. The same goes for making sure the showers and sinks are working as intended. The final thing you want to check is the state of the water heater. Typically a water heater will last around 10 to 15 years, and when looking at the unit you may find the installation date written on it. If you notice unusual noises when it turns on or notice rust, it is highly recommended to have a professional look at it."},{"prompt":"Write an alternate ending to Game of Thrones in which Jon Snow becomes the king of the seven kingdoms. Make it appeal to GOT fans and give it a dramatic tone. Limit your response to 5 paragraphs.","completion":"Jon Snow stabbed Daenerys in the heart, ending her reign of terror. He then took Drogon, the last living dragon, and flew to King’s Landing. There, he faced the Unsullied and the Dothraki, who were loyal to Daenerys and wanted revenge for her death. Jon spoke to them in their languages, telling them that he loved Daenerys, but he had to kill her for the sake of the realm. He also revealed his true identity as Aegon Targaryen, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. He asked them to join him in restoring peace and justice to the land or to leave and find a new home. Some of them agreed to follow him, while others chose to sail away. Jon then entered the Red Keep, where he was greeted by Tyrion Lannister, who had been imprisoned by Daenerys for treason. Jon freed him and asked him to be his Hand. Tyrion accepted but warned him that ruling was not easy and that he would face many enemies and challenges. Jon responded that he was not afraid and that he would do his best to honor his duty and his family. Jon then summoned a council of the lords and ladies of the seven kingdoms. He told them that he did not want to be king, but he felt that it was his responsibility to unite the realm and heal the wounds of war. He asked them to swear allegiance to him or to choose someone else. The council agreed that Jon was the best option and hailed him as King Aegon VI Targaryen. Jon thanked them but said that he would not rule alone. He declared that he would break the wheel of tyranny and oppression and create a new system of government. He said that from now on, the king or queen would be elected by a council of representatives from each kingdom, and that each kingdom would have more autonomy and rights. He also said that he would rebuild the Night’s Watch and send some of his men to guard the Wall and protect the North from any future threats."},{"prompt":"I want to take this text and rewrite it as a landing page for this design course.

We know that Vitamin D is necessary for good bone health. But there are many other functions for this vitamin. For instance, in recent years we have found that vitamin D can have a strong impact on the body's musculoskeletal system. Vitamin D affects your bones, muscles, joints and tissues. We have known for a long time that vitamin D is important for bone health. One of the jobs of vitamin D is to help your gut absorb the calcium and phosphorus from your diet. These minerals in turn help build and maintain the strength of your bones. Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to stress fractures and other problems with the bones. But vitamin D has many other functions as well. I describe it to my patients as a delicate symphony of everything that goes on in your body. If one of the instruments — in this case, your vitamin D — is off, it can throw off the whole symphony. In recent years, we have learned more about how vitamin D affects the entire musculoskeletal system. We recently conducted research that looked at vitamin D levels in young women between the ages of 16 and 40 who were treated in the Women's Sports Medicine Center for a variety of problems with their lower extremities. These included injuries to the ligaments, tendons, cartilage and muscles, as well as the bones.We found that nearly 66% of them had low levels of vitamin D in the blood; about three-fifths were insufficient and the rest were actually deficient. Low blood levels were found in patients with acute injuries as well as overuse injuries. Because these rates of low vitamin D are higher than what's seen in the general population, they suggest a link between low vitamin D and musculoskeletal injuries. More research is needed to confirm this connection.","completion":"Vitamin D affects your bones, muscles, joints, and tissues.

Can you summarize the main points made in this article? Keep it to three sentences and include the states that have imposed this ban. Article: What is the Plastic Bag Ban? As the name states, these bans are bans on single-use plastic bags. Many states around the nation are beginning their bans on plastic bags. These bans will ban all single-use plastic bags, such as the ones that are popularly used at grocery stores and in restaurants for take-out orders. With these bans in effect, single-use plastic bags will not be accessible for purchase to both shoppers and business owners. As a result, paper bags and reusable cloth bags can be used as an alternative. Why Should Plastic Bags be Banned? It’s a fair question. According to different state regulators there are multiple reasons some states are deciding to put these bans in effect, including: The amount of time it takes plastic bags to decompose Did you know it can take up to 1,000 years for a plastic bag to decompose? The damage it can do to our food sources As plastic breaks down, it makes its way into our water systems—where fish and other sea life consume it, contaminating our food sources with micro-plastics. The difficulty of recycling them Plastic bags are very difficult to recycle; and according to the EPA, around 93 billion plastic bags don’t get recycled each year. In 2018, less than 9% of all used plastics were recycled. The pollution they create, both in the making of plastic bags and in their use Single-use plastic bags are statistically one of the world’s leading pollutant. A total of 300 million tons of toxic plastic waste is produced every year just in the creation of plastic bags. Many states across the US are looking to ban plastic bags in an attempt to minimize any future pollution that could be created as a result of plastic bag creation and use. Which States are Banning Plastic Bags? The states that have already banned single-used plastic bags include: California Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Maine New York Oregon Vermont New Jersey","completion":"In some U.S. states, the use of single-use plastic bags has been banned in an effort to reduce plastic pollution. It can take up to 1,000 years for a single plastic bag to decompose and the resulting micro-plastic particles contaminate the water and food supply. The nine states that have imposed such a ban are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and New Jersey."},{"prompt":"Write a short birthday letter to my dad.

When a great white shark is born, along with up to a dozen siblings, it immediately swims away from its mother. Born on the east and west coasts of North America, the south of Africa and southwest Australia, baby sharks are on their own right from the start. Their mother may see them only as prey. At birth a baby great white shark is already about 5 feet (1.5 meters) long; as it grows it may reach a length up to four times that. The pup (which is what a baby shark is called) will live its life at the top of the ocean's food chain. But before it grows larger, the pup must avoid predators bigger than it is—including other great white sharks. Many baby sharks do not survive their first year. Young great white sharks eat fish (including other sharks) and rays. As they grow, the sharks’ favorite prey becomes sea mammals, especially sea lions and seals.","completion":"Great white sharks are born with up to 12 siblings before swimming away from their mothers so they don't get eaten.

So don't include things that aren't absolutely necessary.","completion":"First of all, congratulations on your new baby! It sounds like you want a minimal nursery, I can help: * First of all, at what time of year will your baby be born? This will help you plan what sort of clothes you need to buy (will you need a snowsuit, for instance?). Otherwise, your baby will need a onesie for every day, and 7-10 diapers per day. If you are planning to use cloth diapers, think about how often you want to wash diapers, to determine the quantity you want to buy. Otherwise, you will need a few pajamas with feet, a few pairs of socks, and a hat for summer or winter. Dress-up clothes for newborns are always awkward, pajamas are just fine for the first three months or so! Don't forget wipes, and a comfortable bag to carry baby's supplies. * If you drive, you'll need an infant car seat. Make sure it's rear-facing, and properly attached. If that feels like too much, ask a friend or family member for help installing it. * You'll need a cradle, crib, or bassinet, with a good mattress and some protection for it (mattress cover and sheets). There's no need for pillows or blankets; you might consider a sleep sack if it's winter or your home is kept cool. And don't forget to put baby on his or her back to sleep! * Some parents bathe their newborn in the sink, while others use a small tub. You'll need soft washcloths, gentle soap, a towel, and a soft hairbrush. Baby nail clippers are handy too. * How do you plan to transport your baby? Some car seats detach from their base and become baby carriers. Other parents choose to carry their baby with a scarf or other sort of soft carrier. * How will the baby be fed? If you are planning to bottle feed, you will need formula, bottles and a brush cleaner, and burp cloths. Bandanas make very cute bibs and burp cloths too! If you plan to breastfeed, nipple cream, a nursing bra and breast pads are very handy. You might also consider a pump if you plan for someone else to feed the baby at times, which means you would need to buy at least one bottle. You can freeze your breast milk in an ice-cube tray in your freezer, and thaw it as needed. This is the bare minimum you will need to welcome your baby home, the rest you can find a little at a time or as needed.

The characters had several things in common. Both were well-liked by their cliques, except for the dynamic between the Skipper and Gilligan (perhaps arising from the tension caused by the Skipper being Gilligan's supervisor). Another similarity is that neither character appeared to have a serious, long-term relationship. In addition, both were devoted to their friends, although they weren't very intelligent and things often did not go according to plan. The major difference between the two characters relates to their physical appearance. Chrissy's entire identity was tied to her attractiveness. On the other hand, Gilligan was an average-looking man not pursued romantically by anyone; in fact, he seemed oblivious to the entire concept of physical attraction. If the two characters were to meet, likely they would get along well. They had some commonalities, and the main way in which they differed, the attractiveness/desirability factor, might be something Chrissy would appreciate. Other men were attracted to her by her looks, so it could be refreshing for her to meet someone who honestly did not notice. Gilligan would probably just be happy to make another friend."},{"prompt":"What time zone is West Virginia in?","completion":"Ma'am, West Virginia is in the GMT-4 time zone."},{"prompt":"What time zone is California in?","completion":"Ma'am, California is in the GMT-7 time zone."},{"prompt":"Which time zone is Denver in?","completion":"Ma'am, Denver is in the GMT-6 time zone."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this and [REDACT] any information about anyone including name, age, features, locations, and dates.

One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, “What will you give me in return for my cow?” The man answered, “I will give you five magic beans!” Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow.

He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he went to sleep.

After some days, Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s castle. For the third time, Jack met the giant’s wife and asked for some food. Once again, the giant’s wife gave him bread and milk. But while Jack was eating, the giant came home. “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” cried the giant. “Don’t be silly! There is no boy in here!” said his wife. The giant had a magical harp that could play beautiful songs. While the giant slept, Jack took the harp and was about to leave. Suddenly, the magic harp cried, “Help master! A boy is stealing me!” The giant woke up and saw Jack with the harp. Furious, he ran after Jack. But Jack was too fast for him. He ran down the beanstalk and reached home. The giant followed him down. Jack quickly ran inside his house and fetched an axe. He began to chop the beanstalk. The giant fell and died. Jack and his mother were now very rich and they lived happily ever after.","completion":"Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a poor widow named Martha and her adventurous son, Jack. Their humble home was filled with love, but unfortunately, it lacked the comforts of life. on one fateful day, Martha turned to Jack and said, \\"My dear son, we have no money left and nothing to eat. We must sell our only cow.\\" Determined to help his mother, Jack began on his journey to the marketplace. Along the way, a mysterious stranger approached him. The man, who was wearing unusual attire, offered to buy the cow in exchange for five sparkling, iridescent stones. \\"These are no ordinary stones,\\" the man whispered with a sneaky grin. \\"They possess the power to transcend time itself.\\" Curiosity sparked within Jack's heart, and he accepted the intriguing offer. little did he know that these stones were fascinating, capable of opening portals to different eras. When Jack returned home and presented the stones to his mother, she became angry. \\"You foolish boy!\\" she yelled. \\"How could you exchange our cow for trinkets?\\" In her anger, she tossed the stones out of the window, dismissing them as worthless. Feeling rejected and hungry, Jack went to bed without dinner. But as the night made its way to dawn, an extraordinary sight greeted him. Outside his window, a large beanstalk had sprouted from the same spot the stones had fallen to. It reached high heavens, going through the clouds and disappearing from sight. Jack's heart raced with excitement and the hope of adventure. Driven by his uncontrollable curiosity, Jack began to climb the tall beanstalk. With each step that he took, he felt as if he was traveling through time, leaving the ordinary world. Finally, he entered a wondrous kingdom floating amidst the sky, an era far from his own. In the exquisite realm, he stumbled upon a huge castle, that a gigantic couple called home. It was a formidable giant and his wife. Despite his fright, Jack managed to enter the castle unnoticed. There, he encountered the giant's wife in the kitchen and he had the nerve to ask for some food. overwhelmed with compassion, the kind-hearted woman offered him bread and milk, satisfying his hunger. However, Jack's intermission was short, due to the giant returning home, and casting a shadow of terror upon him. The giant bellowed, \\"Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the presence of an intruder! The giant's wife cunningly deceived him, denying the presence of any intruders. Satisfied, the giant ate his meal and returned to his quarters. During the night, while the giant slept, Jack cautiously left his hiding spot. Driven by the desire for a better life for him and his mother, he fleed with a sack filled with glittering gold coins, that was stashed away by the giant. After safely descending from the beanstalk, Jack returned home, surprising his mother with his wealth. Days passed, and Jack's drive for adventure led him to revisit the exquisite realm once more, finding himself at the giant's castle yet again. With trembling nerves, he requested food from the giant's wife, who, touched by this predicament, provided him with bread and milk. As fate would have it, the giant arrived earlier than expected, interrupting Jack's meal. Panicking, Jack went under the bed, feeling so scared. The giant roared, \\"Fee-fi fo-fum, I smell the presence of an intruder! \\"Be he alive or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make him bread!\\" His wife quickly denied any knowledge of an intruder being present in the castle. Once again, the giant ate his meal and went to his quarters once more. Unbeknownst to the giant, within steps from his room lay a mystical hen with radiant feathers. On the giant command, the hen would produce a golden egg- a source of unmeasurable wealth. While the giant slept, Jack took the opportunity, to take the hen, and hastened his descent back to his home on earth. Once again, he bestowed his mother with unthinkable riches, ensuring their comfort and happiness. Driven by his past triumphs and the lure of the mysterious castle, Jack embarked on his final climb up the beanstalk. The giant's wife welcomed him with her customary kindness, serving him bread and milk. However, their shared meal was unexpectedly interrupted by the return of the giant. \\"Foolish giant!\\" the wife yelled, concealing Jack's presence. \\"There is no boy within these walls.\\" The giant's ravenous appetite went away and he proceeded to his room. In this small space, he kept an enchanted harp that could weave enchanting melodies. As the giant drifted into sleep, Jack took the harp, enticed by its enchanting powers. but the harp, loyal to its master, cried out in distress, \\"Help, master! A boy is stealing me!\\" Startled awake, the giant spotted Jack clutching the coveted harp. The giant then thundered after Jack. Jack raced down the beanstalk, his heart pounding, while the giant pursued him relentlessly. Reaching home to safety, Jack quickly got an ax and he began to aggressively attack the beanstalk with it. With each swing, the beanstalk quivered and trembled until it died. The giant t, trapped in the beanstalk, meets his demise, vanished by Jack's unwavering resolve. Along with his mother, they revealed their newfound weal and happiness. They never wanted anything again, living a life filled with comfort and joy. Jack's encounters with time-traveling stones, towering beanstalks, and formidable giants would be forever remembered.

Today, my parents have to depend on my paycheck to buy bags of rice to supplement the little rice that we can grow here.” Kemo Fatty comes from a family of farmers living on the north bank of the Gambia river. For generations, they had grown everything they needed on the region’s fertile floodplains. But in recent years, climate change and deforestation have made the region nearly uncultivable. As there isn’t enough rainwater washing down the river, saltwater from the sea moves upstream and destroys crops. And because of the lack of trees, the soil has lost all its nutrients, and crops don’t grow. Like everywhere in the Sahel – the 3 million sq km region between the Sahara desert and the African rainforest – the Gambia is on the frontline of climate change. “It’s a race against water,” says Fatty. “Water is the real commodity here. We are losing more and more water, which is making people poorer and poorer.” Over the past few decades, the Sahel’s natural resources have dwindled, leading to a loss of biodiversity, poverty, mass emigration, violence and food insecurity, in a region where most people rely on agriculture for subsistence – 60% live in rural areas. Temperatures in the Sahel are expected to rise 1.5 times faster than in the rest of the world, and could reach up to five degrees celsius above pre-industrial times. That would make the region uninhabitable. Yet the Gambia is only responsible for 0.05% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to a UN FCCC paper published in 2016. “It has become personal now, because we see first-hand that we are a helpless nation,” says Fatty. His own brother is among the many young people who have left the country to seek better opportunities in Europe, hoping to be able to help their families from abroad. “These are not economic migrants, they are climate migrants. Because the climate is affecting the economic power of our state.” Fatty stayed. Just 28 years old, he is now the executive director of Green Up Gambia, an NGO helping rural communities mitigate and adapt to climate change, and has recently joined Civic, a UK-based social enterprise working to drive positive change around the world, as head of community engagement. With both organisations, he’s working on a mammoth project: Africa’s Great Green Wall.","completion":"I would assign this article as “engaging” because it effectively tells a personal story of how climate change is affecting people’s lives in the Sahel region.

Vygotsky believed that children learn best through social interaction and collaboration. He also believed that children learn through a process called scaffolding, which is when an adult or more experienced peer provides support to a child who is trying to learn something new. We believe this is a valuable tool for helping children learn and grow. That's why our program is designed to provide children with opportunities to interact with adults and other children and to learn through scaffolding. For example, we offer a variety of activities that encourage children to collaborate, such as group projects and cooperative games. In addition to encouraging children to interact with each other, regardless of their age, we also believe that it is important for children to have a positive and supportive environment where they feel welcome and included.

It can be difficult to understand the grant funding opportunities from the federal government. Here is a brief breakdown of four different types of federal grants. 1. Competitive grants: Competitive grants are also known as discretionary funding. The awardee is not chosen beforehand, so the applicant must draft a comprehensive proposal to submit to the review board. Since these are “competitive” grants, there may be multiple organizations and individuals applying for a certain sum of money. 2. Formula grants: For formula grants, awardees are predetermined. The formula is how grant money is mathematically dispersed among awardees. An example of this type of grant is when state governments are awarded federal funding, but then this allotted amount is broken down into different projects and incentives at the local level. 3. Continuation grants: As the name implies, these are for grantees that desire to renew an existing grant and continue to receive funding for their projects. It’s important to note that even though the grant money has been awarded in the past, it does not always guarantee continued funding. Those applying for continuation grants will sometimes be competing against those will new ideas and compelling proposals. 4. Pass-through grants: Pass-through grants are issued by a federal agency, but dealt with by state governments. At the state level, the government has the autonomy to allocate funds where it is deemed necessary in the form of competitive or noncompetitive grants. By first understanding these four types of federal grants, you or the organization you represent will know more about the funding at your disposal."},{"prompt":"What's the biggest ocean on Earth?","completion":"Ahoy!

Talk about its impact in modern times and discuss the symbolism of Nurse Ratched, RP McMurphy and the other patients. Give it a score from 1 to 10 at the end and explain why.","completion":"*Summary* When Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) gets transferred from a prison farm to a mental institution for a psychiatric evaluation, he is hoping it will be a less restrictive environment. But the shrewish Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) runs the psychiatric ward with an iron fist, keeping her patients subdued through abuse, medication, and sessions of electro-shock therapy. A battle of wills between the rebellious McMurphy and the inflexible Ratched soon affects the behavior of all the ward's patients. *Review portion* This movie does an excellent job of accurately portraying life in a mental institution. You can see that some of the rules were more lenient, even well over 40 years ago. The patients were allowed to smoke in the buildings, (would be disallowed now but many patients aren't allowed to smoke at all while in a mental facility) they were allowed to be outside but some locations do not allow for that. The story revolves around McMurphy (as well as Nurse Ratched) and so does most of the symbolism and the points that the movie is trying to make. McMurphy is transferred from a prison facility at his discretion because he chooses the mental institution and thinks it's an easier way to serve the sentence that he has left. He is quick to realize that the rules and environment aren't as cushy as he believed, while also building genuine camaraderie with the patients. His special bond with Chief is felt but comes to an apex when Chief reveals to him that he can talk, one of the highlights of the film. McMurphy also catches on to Nurse Ratched's intentions to cause chaos and discord early on and tries to make her life hell because he realizes what she is doing. She also intentionally tries to hide it and play coy when people realize she is doing it.

He took off after it, dragging Max along with him. They chased the squirrel up a tree, and Max was left panting and out of breath while the puppy barked triumphantly. Max looked up at the squirrel and shook his head. But no matter how crazy the puppy was, Max loved him anyway. They spent their days playing fetch, taking naps, and snacking on dog biscuits. And even though Max was sometimes exasperated by the puppy's antics, he couldn't help but feel grateful that he had someone to share his adventures with.

Who doesn't love having every waking moment scheduled to do something, mostly work? You get up early in the morning, feed the cat, walk the dog, get presentable, then sit in traffic for an hour to get to your office. Once there, you enjoy being fake-nice to people you don't like, pretending that you're busy all the time, and having meetings with people of dubious intelligence, including your boss. But that big paycheck is worth it, right? Sacrificing your independence and self-respect and producing average work to be yet another cog in the machine is incredibly fulfilling. When you're not at work, life is grand! The price of your groceries includes admission to a delightful experience in the store, where the melodious tones of crying babies serve as the backdrop for a supermarket full of overpriced, over-ripe produce and meat you need to take out a second mortgage to afford. The lovely dent someone's cart left in your front passenger door just adds character. It's a shock when you get home from work and shopping and find the little elves on loan from the shoemaker somehow neglected to stop by your house and clean it while you were gone. But that's okay, you're always in the mood for spending an hour cooking something you'll gobble in ten minutes. You could vacuum, dust, and scrub the toilet afterward but the grime only enhances the ambiance of your apartment no bigger than your parents' garage. An adult's reward for the stress and hard work is the joy of paying bills. Sure, 250 for electricity in your palatial abode seems reasonable. After all, those dust bunnies need to be kept at a comfortable temperature while you're at work. Rent is worth it, for the scenic view of another apartment complex out of your window. There's no place like home. The other reward is the weekend, when you have abounding energy to run errands, call your elderly parents, wash the dog, visit an urgent-care clinic to check out that pneumonia that you didn't have time to be seen for during the week, and catch up on your needlework.

False The cause of hyperpigmentation is an overproduction of melanin, the pigment that gives color to our skin. (As a refresher, those with lighter skin have less melanin, and those with darker skin have more melanin.) Certain areas of our skin can have extra melanin in comparison to other areas, and this causes the appearance of dark spots. Several things contribute to this: Sun Exposure Sun exposure is one of the main culprits of hyperpigmentation. Rays from the sun stimulate the production of melanin (the same melanin that helps you tan in the summer), but this can also lead to the development of dark spots and uneven skin tone. Skin Injury When you have a wound, the skin can overproduce melanin in response to the injury. Melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin, ramp up production as a protective response, which causes dark spots and discoloration as the skin heals. This is more common in people with darker skin tones. The response is more intense if the injured area is manipulated, like if you pick at acne spots or scratch at a scab that has formed over an injury. Melasma Melasma is when dark, symmetrical patches appear on the face, usually around your cheeks or forehead. This skin condition is caused by hormonal changes, like those that occur during pregnancy (melasma is nicknamed the \\"mask of pregnancy\\"), taking birth control pills. or the onset of menopause.","completion":"1.

Consider giving your husband a sleep aid device – like a white noise machine – that will help him fall asleep quickly when he has a few minutes to a few hours before the next feeding. 2. Coffee (Or tea/hot chocolate) Gift Baskets: If the sleep aid device is insufficient and he still needs extra caffeine create a gift basket of flavorful caffeinated beverages. This can include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. You may want special mugs, stirring spoons, and a new coffee maker or kettle. If he spends much time away from home, you can also include gift cards to his favorite coffee houses. 3. Personalized Father Keychain: Personalized gifts are always a fantastic idea. Whether money is tight or you want to get him one more small gift, a keychain that says Father or Dad is a great idea. You can also get one from your child that says something like Daddy, I love you and the child’s name. 4. A daddy/baby matching outfit. This could be a t-shirt or t-shirt or sweatshirt for dad and a matching onesie or sleep-and-play for the baby. It is super cute when they go out or spend time together. 5. Matching sports jerseys for daddy and baby. If daddy wants to watch football with their baby every Sunday, you should encourage him and get them matching jerseys. But them Brady, Mahomes, Allen, or Rodgers jerseys (or whoever his favorite quarterback or other player is). Of course, suppose your husband prefers hockey, baseball, basketball, soccer, or another sport. In that case, you can also get those types of matching jerseys. 6. Apple Air Tags: Becoming a parent can have many confusing or frazzled moments. This can include forgetting where you put essentials like your keys, phone, or wallet. Apple Air Tags are the answer to that issue! If he is not an Apple customer, you can get him Tile Mates, instead. 7. Food Gifts: Most dads will not say no to chocolate and snacks like mothers. Create him a gift basket of his favorite treats, or get him a nice box of chocolates. 8. A Book of Dad Jokes: Now that he is a father, it is time to learn the secret language of dads and master the dad joke."},{"prompt":"Create names and a two-sentence backstory for 7 characters in a potential new network TV soap opera.","completion":"1. Dr. Peter Bishop. Peter is a mid-30s neurologist with boyish good looks who is known as a playboy who spends money lavishly. The Bishop family is a highly-regarded family of wealth in this town, and the matriarch, his grandmother, is tired of his antics. 2. Amanda Peterson. Amanda is a lawyer in her late 20s, working for the district attorney's office and hoping to get a reputation as a tough prosecutor. She has the determination to succeed...and to hide a secret about her past in another city that no one can find out about. 3. Anthony Patrelli. Anthony owns a sleazy nightclub on the wrong side of town where shady dealings go on behind closed doors. While many federal agents have tried to bust Anthony, no one has yet succeeded in charging him with anything that would stick. 4. Isabelle Canella. Isabelle is 21 and wants to get out and enjoy as much life as she can while she's young. Without a lot of money or much of a work ethic, she uses her womanly charms to manipulate men to spend money on her and take her places, and she is plotting to make Dr. Bishop her next sugar daddy. 5. Patricia Nixon. Patricia is a middle-aged therapist at the hospital where Dr. Bishop works, and all of the hospital employees go to her for advice. Her husband, a police officer, was killed in the line of duty attempting to talk down a barricaded armed robbery suspect, and although it's been 8 years, she hasn't dated anyone else yet. 6. Chief Patrick Reilly. Patrick has spent his entire police career at this police department, and in addition to knowing many of the locals, he has informants who feed him valuable intel about any criminal misdeeds afoot. The former partner of Patricia's husband, Patrick is tough, has no patience for criminals, and is intent on bringing down Anthony. 7. Marcus Farmer. Marcus graduated from the police academy about six months ago, and he is an enthusiastic rookie liked by his fellow officers, even though he's a little naive. Marcus has his sights set on Amanda, who he sees sometimes at the police station, even though she is a little older and doesn't seem to have any room for anything else in her life but work."},{"prompt":"Explain this same concept, but so that a 3rd grader could understand it. Right, in the simplest terms, porpoising is an aerodynamic phenomenon that F1 cars began to suffer from after the adoption of the so-called ‘ground effect’ philosophy, where air is sucked underneath a car to pull it down onto the track at high speed, rather than over the top of the car to push it down. With us so far? The trouble is, the faster you go, the further a car wants to be sucked to the floor. And if it gets too close it can cause the airflow to stop - or ‘stall’ - meaning the downforce created suddenly drops off a cliff. At that point, the cars spring upwards. Once the car’s floor is clear of the ground however, the flow of air kicks in again and the car is sucked downwards once more. This aggressive bouncing is porpoising.","completion":"F1 cars have a trick to go fast, instead of air going over a car, it goes underneath the car like a tunnel. This helps the car stick to the ground for better grip. When cars go fast, something strange happens, the cars get too close to the ground and the air doesn't flow properly anymore. The air stops flowing and the car no longer is being pushed down and instead springs up. Once the car springs up the airflow starts working again and pulls the car back down but then the cycle repeats. This effect is called porpoising."},{"prompt":"can you summarize the novel Pride and Prejudice?","completion":"Of Course, it would be my pleasure! The story begins with Mr. And Mrs. Bennet discussing the new gentleman who plans to move into Netherfield Hall, Mr. Bingely. Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic that a gentleman of such fortune will be so close to the Bennet family thus increasing the chances of a proposal for one of their daughters. The beginning of the story establishes the crux of the novel in that marriage is the primary means of prosperity for the main characters established in the next chapters, Elizabeth Bennet and Jane Bennet. The rest of the story follows both Elizabeth and Jane as they navigate their complicated relationships with Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley respectively. Obstacles threaten their relationships, like misinterpretations, misunderstandings, and miscommunications. All the characters at one point make a decision based on their best judgment, which ultimately proves limited because they are unable to see the bigger picture. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy get off on the wrong foot as both fail to make favorable impressions of one another. Mr. Darcy considers Elizabeth beneath him and Elizabeth considers Mr. Darcy prideful, hence the title.

Include three steps for setting boundaries and include examples and actionable tips for how to implement the suggestions.","completion":"When was the last time you checked your email after working hours? Nodded along silently as a coworker used you as their therapist? Said yes to a meeting that messed up your schedule? If the answer is something like yesterday, it's a sign that you might have a difficult time setting boundaries at work. Work-life balance is hard to achieve in today's hustle culture. It can leave us feeling like we have to say yes to everything, constantly go the extra mile, and be everything to everyone just to ensure that our paycheck is secure. But that's not true. And actually, doing all those things? Can make you less productive. So how can you set boundaries that protect your mental health and your productivity? Try these three steps: 1. Control the narrative. Just because someone brings up a subject doesn't mean you have to engage with them. If Sally from Accounting starts talking about her messy divorce the next time you're in the break room, remove yourself from the conversation by saying something like, \\"Oh, I'm sorry, but there's something I have to do before our break is over.\\" Then take a quick walk outside or call a friend to say hello. The key is to be kind but firm. Once you set this pattern a few times, you'll notice that people will start to remember that you're not up for these types of conversations, and they'll stop trying to engage you in them. 2. Set limits - and stick to them. What are your non-negotiables? Being home by 6 for dinner? Getting out of the office for lunch? Communicate them to your supervisor in the beginning so they know what to expect. Then hold yourself accountable. Set an alarm that reminds you to wrap things up on time at the end of the day. Make lunch plans, so you have a reason to leave the office. 3. Leave work at work. Seeing an angry email from a client will ruin your whole weekend. Reading a Slack message from your boss telling you they want to meet on Monday will be the only thing you can think about until you get home from vacation. It's not worth it. You're paid for the time you spend doing your job, not the hours you spend worrying about the weekends."},{"prompt":"Write a haiku about a rainy day.

I had a chance to look at the numbers with the team, and it appears that to meet the necessary milestones leading up to the project's due date, a total of 10,000 hours will need to be invested into the project.

Can you critique the system of government described in the excerpt? What are the benefits? What problems might arise from this system? What could be improved? On a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being an authoritarian dictatorship and 10 being a direct democracy, how democratic is this system? It should be noted the current year is 1896. \\"The people are known as: RUSSIANS. Capital: St Petersburg (also called Petrograd), St Petersburg Guberniya Largest city: Moscow, Moscow Guberniya (1.6 million) Flag: A horizontal tricolour of white, blue and red. Following a flag reform in 1870, use of the standard flag is only permitted by imperial government authorities (including the military) while civilians are permitted to fly a version defaced with the blue St Andrew’s cross of the navy on a white disc. Population: 155 million (approx. – Imperial census does not currently extend to all the reaches of the Empire) Land area: ca. 1,400,000 lcf. Largest country in the world. Economic ranking: Presently ranked 3rd in the world, having risen rapidly through the ranks as railway building continues to link the country together and facilitate the exploitation of resources – overtook Germany in 1890 and the UPSA in 1893. Form of government: Theoretically an absolute monarchy with the Emperor (frequently, but technically incorrectly, referred to as the Tsar in English) wielding total power. In practice court intrigue has always undermined this aspiration and nineteenth century reforms have begun to introduce a more representative element. The Imperial Soviet in practice often wields power in the Emperor’s name as well as advising him. Its members theoretically chosen by the Emperor but in practice this involves horse-trading between the Emperor, various established aristocratic and corporate interests, and the increasingly important, indirectly-elected Imperial Duma (created by a reform of 1869 by Theodore IV following an earlier failed attempt by his brother Peter IV). The Emperor remains in power by successfully balancing these interests. Foreign relations: Since the Russian Civil War, Russian foreign policy has in part been driven by the ‘Slavicist’ ideology which rejects foreign (especially German-speaking) influence and regards other Slavic (and to a lesser extent Orthodox) peoples as subordinate partners to be protected. However, the traditional Russian goal of seeking to reclaim Constantinople from the Ottomans has been thwarted by Wallachia becoming part of the Austria and then the Danubian Confederation, and the Euxine War of 1861-1863 did not represent significant progress towards this goal. Russian influence has expanded in the Caucasus and Tartary [Central Asia] where Persia represents the chief rival for influence. Finland, Courland and Lithuania are all effective vassals of Russia (ironically all non-Slavic), with some Slavicists expressing a desire for Russia to intervene in the affairs of Slavic and Orthodox peoples farther west. Russian interest in Africa has existed for a while, with direct control over Baravakhul in south-west Africa and Erythrea in the Horn of Africa, and the Abyssinian Empire an Orthodox ally of Russia (its Emperor choosing to regard the Russians as having a ‘temporary lease’ on Erythrea as a polite political fiction). Most significantly, however, the Far East has been a major area for Russian expansion for two centuries, with of late most of Japan being brought under Russian domination and Beiqing China subject to strong Russian influence. Corea has grown more independent however and is less subject to Russian influence than the past. Finally, Russo-Lithuanian Pacific Company ships have also planted colonies and vassals in north-western North America and the Pacific (in particular the Kingdom of Gavaji) but Russian attempts to gain sole influence over California have always been thwarted. Military: The Russian Army modernised in a series of phases throughout the nineteenth century and is now considered first-tier on a good day though it is not homogenous and remains somewhat reliant on conscripts. Specialised troops are recruited from the far reaches of the Empire, including Yapon, as well as from vassal states. The Russian Navy is an oceanic [blue-water] force to be reckoned with but has struggled against the Ottomans’ own modernised fleet in Black Sea and other riverine operations. Unlike some nations the Russians have not created a separate aeroforce and instead operate their steerables and dromes as part of the Navy. The Russo-Lithuanian Pacific Company also continues to operate its own armed forces under the direct control of the Director (who in practice is now always also the Governor-General of Yapon). Current head of state: Emperor Peter V (House of Romanov) (since 1885) Current head of government: Knyaz Fyodor Pavlovich Gagarin (Chairman of the Imperial Soviet).\\"","completion":"The system of government described in the excerpt is a mix of an absolute monarchy and a representative government. While the Emperor holds total power in theory, the Imperial Soviet wields power in the Emperor's name and advises him. The members of the Imperial Soviet are chosen by a mix of the Emperor, aristocratic and corporate interests, and the indirectly-elected Imperial Duma. The Emperor balances these interests to remain in power. Benefits of this system: 1. Blending of absolute monarchy and representative government: This system allows for a balance of power between the Emperor and various interest groups. It provides a space for representation and advice, which may contribute to more effective decision-making. 2. Stability: The balancing of interests and power-sharing within the government may help maintain stability in the country. The Emperor's ability to navigate the different factions and maintain their support can prevent conflicts and ensure continuity. 3. Preservation of traditional structures: By retaining the absolute monarchy in theory, the system upholds traditional structures and maintains a sense of continuity with the past. Problems that may arise from this system: 1. Lack of true democracy: The power ultimately lies in the hands of the Emperor, who may have the ability to manipulate the selection process of the Imperial Soviet and the Imperial Duma. This undermines the true democratic participation of the people in the governance of the country. 2. Corruption and favoritism: The influence of aristocratic and corporate interests in the selection process of the Imperial Soviet may lead to corruption and favoritism. This could result in unequal representation and decisions that primarily benefit certain groups. 3. Instability due to court intrigue: The existence of court intrigue can weaken the effectiveness of the government and make decision-making processes unpredictable. The power struggles among different factions may hinder progress and lead to instability. To assess the level of democracy in this system on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being an authoritarian dictatorship and 10 being a direct democracy, it would be around a 5. While the system introduces elements of representation and advice, the ultimate power remains concentrated in the hands of the Emperor, compromising the degree of democratic participation."},{"prompt":"What could be improved?","completion":"Several aspects of the system could be improved to enhance democracy and governance: 1. Increased transparency: The government should prioritize transparency in decision-making processes and ensure that information is readily accessible to the public. This would enhance accountability and allow citizens to participate more actively in the governance of the country. 2. Electoral reforms: The process of selecting members for the Imperial Soviet and Imperial Duma should be more transparent and inclusive. Measures should be taken to minimize the influence of external pressures and ensure that representatives truly reflect the will of the people. 3. Strengthening civil society: Encouraging the development of a robust civil society, including independent media, non-governmental organizations, and advocacy groups, would foster greater citizen engagement and provide a check on government power. 4. Devolving power: Granting more autonomy and decision-making authority to regional and local governments could improve governance and better address the needs and interests of different parts of the country. This would also provide opportunities for more diverse representation and participation in decision-making. 5. Protecting minority rights: Efforts should be made to ensure the protection of minority rights and promote inclusivity in the political process. Measures such as anti-discrimination laws and affirmative action could contribute to a more equitable and representative government. 6. Building independent institutions: The separation of powers and the establishment of robust independent institutions, such as a judiciary, electoral commission, and anti-corruption agencies, would help safeguard against abuses of power and ensure accountability within the government.

He walked along a winding path that led him towards a nearby pond, hidden amongst the tall ancient trees. The water shimmered under the sun's gold, calling to Carl with its deceptive serenity. Feeling a sudden wild impulse, Carl stripped off his clothes, leaving them behind on the grassy bank. With a mischievous grin forming on his face, he took a deep breath and hurled himself into the cool, refreshing pond, embracing the fleeting freedom the world had left to offer. Giggling to himself, Carl glanced around, ensuring he was far from prying eyes. The desolation of the world seemed to grant him this solitary moment, giving him a rare opportunity to relish in the simple pleasures he had once taken for granted. As Carl embraced the blissful solitude, a playful grin sparked across his face. He cunningly leaned back and, channeling his inner mischief, let out a fart into the water. Innocently, he watched as the bubbles rose to the surface. Contrary to his expectations, the gaseous odor seemed to diffuse quickly, disappearing into the open air. Chuckling to himself, Carl anticipated nothing more than the laughter contained within the secrecy of his mind. But life had other plans, as the lingering stench of his unexpected flatulence permeated the pond, silently seeping into the depths below. Unbeknownst to him, the peaceful aquatic inhabitants were not immune to the aftermath of Carl's prank. Unbearable and toxic, the scent traveled through the water like a deathly wave, unsettling the equilibrium of the aquatic ecosystem. Unsettled fish, moments ago calmly going about their aquatic routines, now began to rise to the surface, desperately seeking relief from the overwhelming odor. With each floating corpse, the realization of the consequences of Carl's impulsive act dawned upon him. The mischievous glint in his eyes faded, replaced by guilt as he surveyed the floating casualties of his practical joke. The sense of responsibility sunk within him, acknowledging his failure to predict the impact of his actions. Squaring his shoulders, Carl decided to salvage what he could from his thoughtless act. Gritting his teeth, he leaned forward and retrieved a lifeless fish from the foetid water, promising himself to make amends. This would be the price he paid for his juvenile humor. Slipping his clothes back on, Carl trudged back towards the farmhouse, carrying the weight of his guilt and a new-found awareness of the consequences that extended beyond him. He would ensure that this would serve as a reminder to think before acting, even in the most desolate of times. That evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Carl sat down with the group, stew in preparation, placing the dead fish beside him. The flames of the fire danced against the night, casting flickering shadows upon his face, as he silently contemplated the choices that brought him to this moment. Carl vowed to cherish moments brought by the world's decay, but he would never again let his desire for mischief overshadow compassion. In the end, it was the companionship of others and the ability to learn from his mistakes that would lead them towards survival, even in a world forsaken by hope."},{"prompt":"(In a swamp biome...)

The \`foreach\` iterates over these column names, and the \`bind\` tag is used to dynamically generate the parameter name by concatenating \`'param_'\` with the \`column\` value. Finally, an OGNL expression \`{{paramName}}\` is used to reference the dynamically generated parameter in the SQL statement. With this approach, you can dynamically bind different parameter names that correspond to different column names in the SQL statement."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

NBT (Named Binary Tag) или Тег с именем бинарного типа - это формат сериализации данных, используемый в Minecraft для хранения и передачи информации об объектах в игре. NBT может содержать различные типы данных, такие как числа, строки, списки, массивы и многое другое. Он используется для сохранения информации об объектах, таких как предметы, блоки, мобы и игроки. Например, NBT используется для хранения информации о состоянии предметов в инвентаре игрока или для сохранения мира и его структуры. 2. Custom Model Data или Пользовательские данные модели - это функция в Minecraft, позволяющая разработчикам создавать и использовать свои уникальные модели предметов, отличные от стандартных моделей в игре. Обычно каждая модель предмета имеет свой уникальный идентификатор, который определяет ее внешний вид. С помощью Custom Model Data вы можете изменить идентификатор модели предмета и установить свою собственную модель, используя ресурспак или плагин. Это позволяет создавать разнообразные предметы с различными внешними характеристиками и анимациями, не изменяя базовую механику игры.

For the quarter, Tesla reported Q2 revenue of 24.9 billion, topping street estimates of 24.51 billion, with adjusted EPS coming in at 0.91, compared to estimates of 0.81. That revenue figure represents a slight gain from Q1, but an over 45% gain from a year ago. On the profitability end, Tesla reported adjusted net income of 3.1 billion, compared to estimates of 2.87 billion, and more than the 2.9 billion from Q1. Tesla closely watched Q2 gross margin came in 18.2%, below analyst expectations of 18.8%. In Q1 Tesla's gross margin was 19.3%, which itself was down from Q4’s 24%. \\"Our operating margin remained healthy at approximately 10%, even with price reductions in Q1 and early Q2. This reflects our ongoing cost reduction efforts, the continued production ramp success in Berlin and Texas and the strong performance of our Energy and Services & Other businesses,\\" the company said in a statement. Tesla also reported that it was working on Cybertruck equipment installation at its gigafactory in Austin, with initial production slated to begin \\"later this year.\\" Over the last three months, Tesla stock has jumped a whopping 58%, adding over 100 in share price for investors riding the boom. Charging deals with legacy automakers, a massive run-up in AI related stocks that roped Tesla in, and strong production and delivery numbers for Q2 pulled Tesla stock higher, and led to analyst after analyst pulling their price targets higher. This weekend’s news that Giga Austin built its first production Cybertruck gave the stock a boost on Monday. Earlier this month Tesla reported Q2 global production of 479,700 units, with deliveries of 466,140. The delivery figure easily topped Wall Street consensus estimates of 448,599 units, as well as the prior quarter’s total of 422,875. Both production and delivery totals for the second quarter were all-time records for Tesla. Concerns about demand in Q1 seem to have been addressed by Tesla’s strong delivery numbers for Q2. Aside from growing volume and product updates on vehicles like the Cybertruck and upcoming gen-3 platform, in the near term analysts are laser-focused on gross margin. “We believe the line in the sand is Auto GM (ex credits) of ~17.5% with [Q2] being the trough quarter for Tesla GM that should ramp back over the coming quarters and back towards the 20% level heading into 2024,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors on Monday. “We join a consensus view that Q2 will be a trough in auto gross margin,” Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois wrote last week, adding that the Jefferies team noted a “shift” in valuation drivers, notably based on Tesla's lead in AI-based self-driving software. The themes of gross margin bottoming and the realization that AI was fueling Tesla’s recent run-up were also noted by both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, though those banks as well as Jefferies feel that a re-rating of the stock on those themes is unwarranted at this time.","completion":"After the bell, Tesla's stock rose as the company reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for Q2.

The revenue figure, along with a weaker-than-expected forecast for revenue in the third quarter, overshadowed the addition of 5.9 million new streaming customers from April through June and earnings that easily topped predictions. Streaming video pioneer Netflix disappointed Wall Street on Wednesday with second-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst estimates, sending shares tumbling nearly 9% in after-hours trading. The revenue figure, along with a weaker-than-expected forecast for revenue in the third quarter, overshadowed the addition of 5.9 million new streaming customers from April through June and earnings that easily topped predictions. Its nearly 6 million subscriber additions outpaced the 1.9 million that Wall Street expected. Netflix had a total of 238.4 million subscribers worldwide as of the end of June. Quarterly revenue climbed 2.7% from a year earlier to 8.2 billion, shy of analyst forecasts of 8.3 billion. The company estimated third-quarter revenue would hit 8.5 billion. Wall Street had been forecasting 8.7 billion. Analyst Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners said some shareholders may have become too bullish about Netflix's advertising tier and the password crackdown. \\"Some investors’ expectations for (the third quarter) got too far ahead of what is looking like reality in management’s guidance,\\" Huber said. While the company added subscribers, it said average revenue per member fell 3% from a year earlier. That was partly because many of the new sign-ups came in countries where Netflix charges lower prices. Netflix said its advertising tier remained a small part of its membership base and that current ad revenue is not material. \\"We've got a long way to go from where we are today, even getting to 10% (of revenue)\\" Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said on a post-earnings interview with an analyst. Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak attributed some of the share slide after the results to investors selling to take profits. Netflix stock has gained 62% this year, including over 8% this month. Like its competitors, Netflix is grappling with strikes by tens of thousands of Hollywood actors and writers. The labor action has forced many film and television productions to shut down, though analysts say Netflix has an advantage because of its global production. Netflix raised its 2023 free cash flow estimate to 5 billion, up from 3.5 billion, in part because it will spend less on content with productions shut down. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who noted he grew up in a union household and recalled the hardship of his father going on strike, said he hoped the labor tensions would be resolved soon. \\"Let me start by making something absolutely clear: This strike is not an outcome that we wanted,\\" Sarandos said.","completion":"Netflix reported disappointing second-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst estimates, causing its shares to drop almost 9% in after-hours trading.

Netflix estimated its Q3 revenue would hit 8.5 billion, below Wall Street's projection of 8.7 billion. The company attributed the decline in average revenue per member to the influx of new sign-ups in countries where Netflix charges lower prices. Nevertheless, Netflix remains optimistic about its advertising tier and expects continued growth. The labor strikes faced by the film and television industry have affected productions, but Netflix believes its global production advantage allows it to navigate the situation better. The company raised its 2023 free cash flow estimate to 5 billion and expressed hope for the resolution of labor tensions."},{"prompt":"summarize the following: Macau casino operator Sands China Ltd achieved adjusted property earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of US541 million in the second quarter of 2023. That compared with an EBITDA loss of US110 million a year earlier, and a positive figure of US398 million in the first three months of 2023. Net income for Sands China in the April to June period was US187 million, compared to net losses of US422 million in the prior-year period and of US10 million in the first three months of 2023, according to a Wednesday filing from its United States-based parent, Las Vegas Sands Corp. Sands China’s second-quarter net revenue rose by 340.2 percent year-on-year, to US1.62 billion. Such revenue was also up from US1.28 billion in first-quarter 2023. At Las Vegas Sands’ other ongoing operation – Marina Bay Sands in Singapore – quarterly adjusted property EBITDA reached US432 million, up 35.4 percent in year-on-year terms. The EBITDA result was also an improvement on the US394 million property EBITDA recorded in the first quarter this year. Net revenues at Marina Bay Sands stood at US925 million in the three months to June 30, compared to US679 million a year earlier. The firm had posted net revenues of US848 million for the first quarter of 2023. “We were pleased to see the robust recovery in travel and tourism spending underway in both Macau and Singapore progress during the quarter,” said Robert Goldstein, chairman and chief executive of Las Vegas Sands, in a press release on Wednesday discussing the firm’s latest quarterly results. He added: “We remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to welcome more guests back to our properties throughout the remainder of 2023 and in the years ahead.” Las Vegas Sands also announced on Wednesday it would resume its quarterly dividend programme, at US0.20 per common share. The next dividend will be paid on August 16 to Las Vegas Sands stockholders of record on August 8. “Our financial strength supports our ongoing investment and capital expenditure programmes in both Macau and Singapore, our pursuit of growth opportunities in new markets, and the return of capital to stockholders,” said Mr Goldstein in comments featured in the press release. “We are very pleased to reinstate our quarterly dividend this quarter.” The Las Vegas Sands group posted net revenue of US2.54 billion for the second quarter, compared to US1.05 billion in the prior-year period. Net income from continuing operations was US368 million, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of US414 million in the second quarter of 2022. Margin improvement In a Thursday memo, Jefferies Group LLC analyst Andrew Lee said Sands China’s second-quarter earnings recovery “was broadly in line” with market expectations, benefitting from “margins improving”. He added that EBITDA margin for the period “improved to 33.2 percent (from first quarter 2023′s 31.1 percent), which is close to peak quarter margin of 36.8 percent in the first quarter of 2019.” Mr Lee said the margin improvement was linked to Sands China’s “shift away from lower-margin VIP segment and faster recovery of non-gaming”. Non-rolling table win and retail sales for the second quarter were 84 percent and 93 percent respectively of second quarter 2019 levels, “but rolling was only 33 percent” compared to the pre-pandemic period, he stated. In Wednesday’s filing, the parent company said there was an “ongoing recovery now underway in all gaming and non-gaming segments” in Macau. Sands China’s non-rolling table win in the mass market was US1.17 billion in the second quarter of 2023, compared to US911 million a quarter earlier, said the firm. Slot win reached US151 million, up from US118 million in the first three months of 2023, and circa 93 percent of second-quarter 2019 levels. Rolling win in the VIP segment stood at US182 million in the second quarter of 2023. Sands China runs three Cotai resorts: the Venetian Macao, the Parisian Macao (pictured), and the Londoner Macao. It also operates casino-hotel Sands Macao on the peninsula. The firm held a formal launch event in May for The Londoner Macao, including an opening for its 6,000 seat arena. The resort – which was already in use prior to May’s launch event – represents the rebranding and major reconfiguring of a Cotai venue that used to be known as Sands Cotai Central. It now features the architecture of the Palace of Westminster in London, including the clock tower popularly known as Big Ben. Capital expenditures for the Las Vegas Sands group during the second quarter totalled US196 million. That included “construction, development and maintenance activities” of US144 million at Marina Bay Sands, and US42 million in Macau. “In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands again delivered outstanding levels of performance in all segments, with mass gaming revenue reaching another record result,” Mr Goldstein said. “We remain energised by the opportunity to introduce our new suite product and elevated service offerings to more customers as airlift capacity continues to improve and the recovery in travel and tourism spending from China and the wider region continues.” In March, Las Vegas Sands said it had been authorised by Singapore’s authorities to delay by 12 months the deadline to start construction work for an extension of Marina Bay Sands. It was the second 12-month deadline extension granted to the firm regarding the start of construction for the expansion. The company is currently carrying out a separate, unrelated US1.0-billion “suite renovation programme” for the existing accommodation at Marina Bay Sands. According to the firm, upon completion of the scheme in December 2023, the property will feature approximately 400 “premium suites”, compared to approximately 150 in 2019. “As of June 30, 2023, we have introduced approximately 1,100 reimagined rooms, of which approximately 250 are luxurious new suites,” the firm said in an investor presentation published on Wednesday.","completion":"Sands China, a casino operator in Macau, reported adjusted EBITDA of 541 million in Q2 2023, compared to an EBITDA loss of 110 million in the same period last year.

The oldest brother, Alex, was a bundle of energy, always seeking new adventures and thrills. He loved being active and spent most of his time playing at the local gym with his friends, engaging in various sports and games. Alex was a confident young boy, never shying away from a challenge. However, deep down, he valued his family more than anything else in the world. He knew that their support and love were always there, no matter what. This gave him the strength and motivation to push himself further and be the best version of himself. On the other hand, the youngest brother, Ethan, was a curious and imaginative little fellow. He found joy in the simple things in life, like blowing bubbles outside and connecting with nature. He had a special inclination towards learning, but in a fun and playful way. The world was his canvas, and he soaked up knowledge like a sponge. Every evening, Alex and Ethan would gather around their mom, Sarah, for a magical story time. Sarah would weave captivating tales of mystical creatures, far-off lands, and brave heroes. Both boys were enchanted by the power of storytelling, as it fueled their imaginations and sparked their curiosity. Despite their different interests, Alex and Ethan always supported each other. They celebrated their unique abilities and admired one another's strengths. Each boy had their own challenge, something they wanted to conquer. For Alex, riding a bike was his biggest hurdle. While he was excellent at various sports, balancing on two wheels was something that eluded him. Undeterred, he turned to his family for guidance. Dad, Mark, took charge, patiently teaching Alex how to ride, refusing to give up even on the bumpiest of journeys. Mark's faith in Alex never wavered, and soon enough, Alex was fearlessly zipping around the neighborhood, filled with pride and joy. Meanwhile, Ethan's challenge lay in the deep blue waters – swimming. Although he yearned to frolic in the pool with his brother, he had a mild fear of water. Ethan's family rallied around him, knowing that teamwork made the dream work. Mom, Sarah, channeled her nurturing side, spending countless hours by Ethan's side, teaching him the basics of swimming and instilling confidence within him. With each lesson, Ethan's fears melted away, slowly but surely, as he learned to trust his abilities and embrace the water. One sunny day, the whole family decided to join a local triathlon event. Alex rode his bike, feeling the wind on his face, while Ethan swam with gusto, their parents cheering them on from the sidelines. Their hard work, perseverance, and love for each other had paid off. They had successfully overcome their challenges, proving that anything was possible when they came together as a family. From that day forward, the bond between Alex and Ethan grew stronger than ever. They participated in countless adventures together, each bringing their unique talents to the table. Whether it was a friendly game of basketball or exploring the mysteries of nature, they encouraged and supported one another relentlessly. As the family of four continued to navigate life's obstacles, they discovered that the true power of their bond lay not only in overcoming challenges but also in cherishing the love and connection they shared. Through thick and thin, they were a team, united by their unbreakable family ties and unwavering support. And so, the family of four remained a source of inspiration in their neighborhood, showing the world that no hurdle is too high when faced with love, determination, and the strength of family."},{"prompt":"More please","completion":"As the years went by, the family of four continued to embark on countless adventures, creating memories that would last a lifetime. They formed a tradition of weekly family outings, where they explored nature trails, played in parks, and discovered hidden gems within their community. Alex, now a teenager, had developed a newfound passion for hiking. He loved the feeling of conquering mountains and exploring the wilderness. He encouraged his family to join him on these excursions, and together they marveled at the beauty of nature. Alex's adventurous spirit and love for outdoor activities inspired his younger brother, Ethan, who had grown into a creative and environmentally conscious young man. Ethan had a talent for capturing the essence of nature through his photography. Armed with his camera, he documented their adventures, making each moment come alive through his lens. He understood the importance of preserving the environment and teaching others to appreciate its wonders. Every outing became an opportunity for Ethan to educate his family about the delicate balance of nature and the need to protect it. Their parents, Mark and Sarah, wholeheartedly embraced their sons' passions, nurturing their growth and supporting their dreams. They saw firsthand how their boys' individual interests and challenges enriched their bond as a family. Mark, a steadfast and patient man, stood by Alex's side as he tackled more challenging bike trails, always reminding him to enjoy the journey, not just the destination. And Sarah, a loving and nurturing mother, encouraged Ethan's love for learning by incorporating fun and educational activities into their family time. As the boys grew older, their understanding of the world expanded. Through their shared experiences, they learned the importance of empathy and compassion. They volunteered at local shelters, participated in community projects, and used their skills and passions to make a positive impact. The family discovered that their strength as a unit extended far beyond their own challenges, and by working together, they could help others overcome obstacles as well. One particular summer, the family decided to embark on a cross-country road trip, a journey that would test their patience, resilience, and unity. They traveled from coast to coast, exploring national parks, historical landmarks, and immersing themselves in the vibrant tapestry of cultures that make up their country. Each day brought new challenges and opportunities for growth, strengthening the bond between them even more. Throughout their adventures, they faced some setbacks. They got lost during a hike, faced inclement weather on their road trip, and encountered unexpected obstacles. Yet, through it all, they relied on each other for support. They learned to adapt, problem-solve, and find joy in the face of adversity. Together, they proved that even in the face of challenges, they were an unshakeable force, capable of triumphing over any obstacle. At the end of their journey, as they looked back upon the memories they had created and the challenges they had overcome, they realized that their true victory lay not only in conquering physical obstacles but in the strength and resilience of their family bond.

Constantly on guard, he trekked through the crumbling remnants of civilization, looking for a safe haven. One scorching afternoon, his journey led him to an isolated woodland area with a serene pond nestled amidst the dense foliage. Seeking respite from the relentless pursuit of walkers, Carl's heart lightened when he stumbled upon the picture-perfect pond. The soothing rustle of leaves and the gentle sound of trickling water seemed to somehow fade away the grim reality of their world. Feeling bold and playful, he decided to make the most of the momentary escape. Without hesitating, Carl stripped off his tattered clothes, embracing the liberating feeling of the cool breeze against his bare skin. As he stood at the water's edge, for a brief moment, any thought of danger seemed forgotten. Feeling a bold surge of mischievousness, he playfully jumped into the pond, sending a wave of ripples across its shimmering surface. Surfacing from the refreshing embrace of the water, Carl checked his surroundings, assuring himself that he was truly alone. Grinning slyly, he let out a cheeky chuckle that echoed through the silent woods. Positioning himself, Carl lifted his leg, teasingly aiming towards the water, and humorously let out a robust fart. Amused by his own antics, Carl watched as bubbles of air playfully rose to the surface of the pond. Chuckling to himself, he jokingly muttered apologies to the fish present - as if they could understand his mischievous intentions. Little did he know of the consequences that accompanied his joke. Days passed since Carl's venture into the pond, and he continued his aimless journey. However, news of a peculiar occurrence reached his ears. The overwhelming stench of death seemed to suffocate the air, arousing curiosity and concern among survivors. No one could ignore this unexpected phenomenon, for the scent reached their nostrils even amidst the decaying world. Driven by his own unsettling curiosity, Carl retraced his steps to the once-tranquil pond. A startling sight met his eyes. Floating along the still water's surface were fish, lifeless and motionless, having met an unfortunate end due to the foulness of his gas. Holding his breath to avoid the pungent odor, Carl's eyes glistened with a mix of disbelief and realization. A mischievous grin crept upon his face, fueling a peculiar sense of accomplishment within him. Carefully navigating the surface of the pond, he eagerly plucked one of the fallen fish from its watery grave, his dinner for the night. With the acquired fish securely in hand, Carl walked away, his stomach rumbling with anticipation. In his mind, the gassy joke had unwittingly accomplished something useful in their bleak existence. Little did he know that his fart would be remembered by survivors for years to come, serving as a grim reminder of the peculiar incident at the pond.

Feeling an irresistible urge to break free from the suffocating seriousness of the world, an audacious plan formed in Carl's mind. Stripping down to his bare skin, he took a bold leap into the crystal-clear waters with an exhilarated splash. The coolness of the pond embraced him like an old friend, providing a momentary respite from the horrors outside its banks. Thoughts of pranks and mischief swirled in Carl's mind. Casting a quick glance around to ensure no one witnessed his spontaneous act of liberation, he chuckled mischievously to himself. An idea sprang to life, one he couldn't resist. With his impish grin stretching from ear to ear, he uncorked a thunderous, echoing fart into the watery depths. His initially contrite demeanor gave way to a lighthearted jest as fart bubbles emerged from the water's surface, carrying with them a distinct odor that even the walkers would have found formidable. Carl couldn't help but giggle with childlike glee at the absurdity of his own actions. As the pungent aroma mingled beneath the surface, life within the pond began to react. The fish, startled by the foul smell and intoxicated by its potent allure, floated up lifelessly at the surface. Carl's amusement turned into sheer astonishment, wide-eyed and laughing deliriously as the unexpected consequences of his actions unfolded before him. With newfound enthusiasm, Carl seized the opportunity. Elated by the prospect of a fresh meal, he eagerly reached out into the water and plucked a sizable fish from the floating victims. It was a testament to his audacity and resourcefulness, proof that even in the darkest of times, survival did not always rely on conventional means. Reveling in his triumphant catch, the naked teenager embraced the peculiar juxtaposition of his situation: surrounded by a world consumed by decay, yet finding unexpected delight in a moment of levity and bizarre fishing. Clutching his dinner, Carl chuckled to himself, grateful for this whimsical interlude stolen from the jaws of harsh reality. As he made his way back to camp, his face beaming with mischief, Carl knew that even in the face of unfathomable adversity, a spark of joy could still be found. Though temporary, these moments of respite provided strength for the ongoing battle against the undead and the ravages of an unforgiving world. And so, the tale of Carl Grimes's unconventional fishing trip entered the annals of legends within the Walking Dead universe, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit even in the face of the most dire circumstances."},{"prompt":"(In a swamp biome...)

It had been weeks since his group had settled at a seemingly safe location, but the constant pressure of the undead had driven him to seek solace in the tranquility of nature. Carl stumbled upon a hidden pond, its crystal-clear water reflecting the faded sunlight filtering through the evergreen canopy. Feeling the oppressive heat weighing on him, Carl decided to take a well-deserved break. Stripping off his clothes, he relished the feeling of the cool breeze on his skin as he stood at the pond's edge. With a mischievous grin tugging at the corner of his lips, Carl dared to challenge the seriousness of their dire reality. With a quick glance around to ensure his privacy, he confidently leaped into the pond, embracing his freedom. The water enveloped him, giving him a momentary blissful respite from the chaos that surrounded him. As Carl resurfaced, he couldn't help but feel a playful urge bubbling within him. His mischievous nature took over, and he decided to release his pent-up stress in a most unexpected way.

As the fart bubbles dispersed, their putrid scent began to drift through the water, permeating even the smallest crevice the fish called home. The unsuspecting fish, their delicate senses overwhelmed, started to float up to the surface, their fins dangling lifelessly. Carl's eyes widened in disbelief as he witnessed the catastrophic consequences of his passing gas. Although he hadn't intended any harm, the fish had fallen victim to a twisted twist of fate. Not wanting their sacrifice to be in vain, Carl realized he had an opportunity to provide his group with a well-deserved meal. Eagerly seizing the chance, he waded through the water, carefully selecting the most succulent fish from the still surface. Grasping it firmly, he emerged from the pond, his wet hair clinging to his forehead, while a self-satisfied grin spread across his face. With gratitude in his heart for the bountiful yet ironic food source, Carl made his way back to his group. He knew that amidst the constant struggle for survival, these precious moments of levity were what kept them going. And as they sat around the campfire that night, gnawing on the fish, Carl made sure to share his absurd adventure, reminding them all that even in the darkest of times, laughter was an integral part of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"(In a swamp biome...)

Правильный уход для большого урожая","completion":"Свекла — одно из самых популярных овощей, которое занимает почетное место на огороде многих садоводов. Июль является одним из наиболее благоприятных месяцев для выращивания свеклы, и правильный уход в этот период может существенно повлиять на урожайность и качество данного овоща. В июле свекла нуждается в достаточном количестве света, тепла и влаги для полноценного роста и развития. Поэтому первым и важным шагом в уходе за растением является выбор правильного места для посадки свеклы на огороде. Светлое и солнечное место, защищенное от сильных ветров, является оптимальным для выращивания свеклы. Перед посадкой свеклы необходимо провести подготовительные работы по обработке почвы. Оптимальный состав почвы для свеклы — рыхлая и плодородная с нейтральной или слегка кислой реакцией. Если почва на участке сухая, следует обеспечить его увлажнение, поливая его перед посадкой свеклы. Свеклу рекомендуется выращивать из семян, которые следует посадить на глубину примерно 2-3 см. Посевы следует проводить на расстоянии около 20-30 см друг от друга, чтобы обеспечить свекле достаточно места для роста и развития корнеплода. Если в июле ожидается сильное засушливое тепло, свеклу необходимо поливать регулярно и обильно. Однако следует помнить, что она не переносит переувлажнения, поэтому важно следить за тем, чтобы почва не пересыхала и одновременно не была слишком мокрой. Важным моментом в уходе за свеклой является рыхление почвы вокруг растений. Это поможет поддерживать нормальное дыхание корневой системы, обеспечит доступ кислорода и питательных веществ к корням свеклы. Рыхление почвы следует проводить регулярно, особенно после полива. Для получения большого и качественного урожая свеклы важно удобрять почву. Подкормки рекомендуется проводить несколько раз в течение сезона, используя органические или минеральные удобрения, богатые фосфором и калием. Перед началом прикормки следует ознакомиться с инструкцией удобрения и соблюдать рекомендации. Кроме того, важно проводить своевременную борьбу с сорняками и вредителями. Регулярные осмотры растений позволят выявить возможные проблемы и принять меры к их решению. Ручное удаление сорняков и применение специальных препаратов помогут бороться с вредителями свеклы и предупредить их размножение. Итак, правильный уход за свеклой в июле включает выбор оптимального места для посадки, подготовку почвы, регулярный полив и рыхление почвы, удобрение растений, борьбу с сорняками и вредителями. Соблюдение всех этих мероприятий позволит вырастить крепкую и здоровую свеклу, а также получить обильный урожай этого полезного овоща."},{"prompt":"The following excerpt is from an alternate history novel. Can you critique the system of government described in the excerpt? What are the benefits? What problems might arise from this system? What could be improved? On a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being an authoritarian dictatorship and 10 being a direct democracy, how democratic is this system? It should be noted the current year is 1896. In this timeline, Prince Fredrick is exiled to the American colonies after pissing off his father. Through a serious of events, he becomes King of Britain and forms a personal union between the mainland and British North America. \\"The country’s official name is: GERMAN FEDERAL EMPIRE (DEUTSCHES BUNDESREICH), short form GERMANY (DEUTSCHLAND) The people are known as: GERMANS. Very occasionally ‘BUNDESGERMANS’ to distinguish from German-speakers outside the Bundesreich. Capital city: Dresden (1.1 million) Largest city: Hamburg (1.2 million) Flag: A white cross with green in the top left and bottom right cantons, and blue in the top right and bottom left cantons. Population: 48 million. Land area: ca. 584,500 sq. km. Economic ranking: Currently ranked 6th, having risen sharply into the top five around the midpoint of the nineteenth century as it industrialised but has since been overtaken by those countries with greater natural resources from colonial programmes. Form of government: Federal limited constitutional monarchy. The monarch’s de facto power depends less on what the constitution says and more on how successful their policy interventions have been perceived. With what is widely regarded as the failure of the Kulturkrieg, the current Bundeskaiser has been forced onto the back foot by the Bundestag. The situation is further complicated by the federal nature of the German state and the fact that it is composed of five lower-level monarchies, High Saxony (more properly translated into English as Upper Saxony, but the misnomer has stuck), Low Saxony, Billungia, Swabia and Bohemia. These kingdoms themselves have varying balances of power between king and Diet, ranging from the near-absolute monarchy of Billungia through High Saxony, Bohemia and Swabia to the fiercely parliamentarian crowned republic of Low Saxony. The King of High Saxony is the eldest son of the Bundeskaiser and therefore also the crown prince of Germany as a whole, whereas the other monarchies have their own royal lines, not all of whom are branches of the House of Wettin. Foreign relations: Despite French paranoia of the hostility of a united Germany, following the Unification War and the defeat of the Isolationsgebiet, in the absence of any common foe to unite against, divisions emerged—between monarch, Bundestag and people, between central government and federal kingdoms, between classes and their political parties, between religious and linguistic groups—which have hampered attempts to create a coherent German foreign policy. More recently (from the 1880s onwards), as limited consensus has been reached on many of these questions, Germany has forged an alliance with Danubia (helped by a royal marriage) based largely on mutual defence and military cooperation—which has also extended to Danubia’s existing ally Poland. However, German attempts to pressure Bavaria into the so-called Pressburg Pact have failed, in part due to reluctance on the part of both Danubia and Germany to fully remove their mutual tariff barriers. Military: The German military is considered to have some of the best equipment (and the industrial base to supply itself) in Europe. Training is more variable and influenced by the highly federal nature of the state, with High Saxon troops generally considered to be the best regulars but elite groups are often recruited from the fringes, in particular the mountaineering Alpentruppe from Swabia. Current head of state: Bundeskaiser Johann Georg (since 1872) (House of Wettin) (usually given in the original German form by convention) Current head of government: Bundeskanzler (Federal Chancellor) Alois Dörflinger (Populist Alliance) (since 1890)\\"","completion":"The system of government described in the excerpt is a federal limited constitutional monarchy, with the monarch's power dependent on their success in policy interventions rather than solely on constitutional authority. The German state is composed of five lower-level monarchies, each with varying power balances between the king and the Diet. Benefits of this system include: 1. Stability: The presence of a monarchy provides a symbol of continuity and stability, which can help maintain public order and prevent power struggles. 2. Federalism: The federal nature of the state allows for regional autonomy and representation, ensuring that the diverse needs and interests of different areas are taken into account. 3. Constitutionalism: The inclusion of a constitution provides a framework for governance and protects citizens' rights and liberties. However, several challenges and potential problems might arise from this system: 1. Power struggles: The varying power balances between the king and the Diet in different monarchies could lead to conflicts and difficulties in decision-making. 2. Lack of a unified foreign policy: The divisions within the country, including between the central government and the federal kingdoms, may hinder the establishment of a coherent and effective foreign policy. 3. Inequality among monarchies: The near-absolute monarchy in Billungia contrasts with the more parliamentarian Low Saxony, potentially causing disparities and tensions between the kingdoms. To evaluate the level of democracy in this system on a scale from 1 to 10, we must consider the distribution of power, representation, and the involvement of the citizenry in decision-making. While there are constitutional limitations and democratic elements such as the Bundestag, the monarch's de facto power and the potentially unequal power balances between the monarchies may restrict the overall level of democracy. Therefore, this system could be considered as a 6 or 7 on the scale, reflecting a moderate level of democracy."},{"prompt":"\\"The country’s official name is: KINGDOM OF THE BRITONS. Often still informally known as GREAT BRITAIN. The people are known as: BRITONS, although it common to refer to them as ENGLISHMEN, SCOTSMEN etc. Capital and largest city: London (4.7 million). Flag: The Union Jack (or Union Flag), a combination of the red on white St George’s Cross for England and the white on blue St Andrew’s Saltire for Scotland which dates from the Union of the Crowns in the early 1600s. The official state version includes a white circle in the middle defaced with the purple Asterisk of Liberty, a symbol of the Populist movement in the Inglorious Revolution. Non-defaced versions are still however often used by civilians: the standard version has the St George’s Cross on top, but an alternative which has the St Andrew’s Cross on top (originally used in the 1600s) has seen a recent revival in Scotland. Much less frequently, the St George’s Cross and St Andrew’s Saltire are used alone by some people, as is the yellow on black St David’s Cross in Wales. Population: 28 million (1888 census). Land area: 15,014 lcf. Economic ranking: Generally included with the ENA, would probably be ranked 10th or 11th in the world if treated separately. Form of government: Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy. Head of state: Emperor (also the King of Great Britain and Ireland). Head of government: President (formally, President of the Council of Government; still occasionally called ‘Prime Minister’) who heads a government in the Parliament of the Britons in the New Palace of Westminster. The Parliament is the largest legislative body in the world, with 820 MPs (occasionally called Burgesses or Representatives as a holdover) in the House of Representatives and 340 Knights in the House of Knights, the upper house. The MPs are elected from single member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, while the Knights are elected from a county-wide general ticket (although some have argued that a percentage representation system should be used as in America). British local government is based entirely on the county, with former municipal governments abolished after the Inglorious Revolution and never restored when the new system was implemented: municipalities are governed by commissions appointed by the elected County Corporations (or County Corporates). County Corporation members are referred to as Aldermen (or, recently, also Alderwomen). The County Corporations in Scotland were always poorly conceived due to Scotland’s different county system, and the Scottish Home Rule League (later the Scottish Parliamentary Party) has informally amalgamated them into a single body based in Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, which claims the role of a would-be Scottish Parliament. Foreign relations: Great Britain has dynastic and historical ties to the Empire of North America. Ever since the French invasion of 1807 devastated Britain, it has taken an increasingly backseat role in the global Hanoverian possessions to the ENA. While the ENA helped Britain recover from the invasion, the fact America did not get involved in the crisis of the 1830s until the Inglorious Revolution was virtually over (despite Emperor-King Frederick II’s best efforts) sparked resentment among the British people, deepened when Americans accused Britons of lukewarm efforts in the Great American War of the 1850s. From a British point of view the tail has been wagging the dog for a long time and resentment has been building, although the increased trade from the Seventies Thaw has improved the British economy, helping mend the last scars of the conflicts of the past. Military: Great Britain has struggled with constitutional restrictions on the military (especially the Army) imposed by the Populist government following the Inglorious Revolution. While these have been diluted over time by non-Populist governments, this has still left idiosyncratic traces in how the modern British military is organised, such as a disproportionately small (but elite) Army and the phenomenon of 'Land-based Marines' due to crafty past governments working around the restrictions by formally designating de facto Army regiments as Marines. The Royal Navy, although it is now secondary in size and power to the Imperial Navy of the ENA, easily remains the second most significant naval force in the Hanoverian dominions and a respected force in its own right. There are tensions over the ENA taking a privileged position in some military matters, such as the tone-deaf requisitioning of the first lionheart from its British inventor. Current head of state: King George IV (House of Hanover, also Emperor of North America; rarely visits Great Britain and his role is usually exercised by the Regent, presently his brother Frederick, Duke of York and essentially the Lord Deputy of Great Britain) Current head of government: President Randolph Herriott (Regressive Party) \\"","completion":"The system of government described in the excerpt is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, with a head of state referred to as the Emperor and a head of government known as the President. The Parliament consists of two houses: the House of Representatives and the House of Knights. Local government is based on the county, with municipalities governed by commissions appointed by elected County Corporations. Benefits of this system include: 1. Representation: The parliamentary system allows for representation of the diverse regions and interests within Great Britain. The House of Representatives ensures that citizens' voices are heard at the national level. 2. Stability and continuity: The presence of a constitutional monarchy provides stability and continuity in governance, with the Emperor symbolizing the unity of the nation. 3. Separation of powers: The division between the head of state and the head of government (Emperor and President, respectively) helps maintain a balance of power. However, several potential problems may arise from this system: 1. Power concentration: The role of the Emperor, exercised by the Regent in the current scenario, could lead to power concentration and limited accountability if not properly balanced with the elected President and Parliament. 2. Limitations on military: Constitutional restrictions on the military imposed by the Populist government may hinder the effectiveness and readiness of the armed forces, potentially compromising national security. 3. Tensions with the Empire of North America (ENA): Relations with ENA have been strained, with resentment and grievances building among the British people due to perceived inequalities and the dominance of ENA in various aspects, such as military matters. To evaluate the level of democracy in this system on a scale from 1 to 10, we must consider the distribution of power, representation, and citizen involvement in decision-making. The presence of a parliamentary system, elections, and the Parliament indicate a level of democracy in the system. However, potential limitations on military and concentration of power may influence the overall democratic character. Therefore, this system could be considered a 6 or 7 on the democratic scale, reflecting a moderate level of democracy."},{"prompt":"What can be improved?","completion":"Several areas of the described system of government could potentially be improved: 1. Transparency and accountability: Strengthening mechanisms for transparency and accountability would enhance public trust in the government. Implementing measures such as stronger conflict of interest regulations, financial disclosure requirements, and independent oversight bodies could help address concerns regarding the concentration of power. 2. Military reforms: Revisiting the constitutional restrictions on the military and ensuring adequate funding for defense capabilities could strengthen national security. A comprehensive review of military organization and capabilities, aimed at modernization and addressing idiosyncrasies, should be considered. 3. Democratization of decision-making: Promoting greater citizen involvement in decision-making processes could enhance democratic practices. Introducing mechanisms such as citizen consultations, participatory budgeting, and broader inclusion of civil society organizations in policy formulation could increase citizen engagement and representation. 4. Balancing ENA relations: Addressing the perceived inequalities and tensions with the Empire of North America could be crucial. Engaging in open and constructive dialogue, renegotiating agreements that cause resentment, and establishing mutual respect and cooperation might improve bilateral relations and address the long-standing grievances. 5. Ensuring regional equity: Further efforts should be made to ensure that regional interests are adequately represented and that the powers of the federal kingdoms within the country are balanced. Equalizing power dynamics and addressing disparities in resources and opportunities among different regions could help foster national unity. Overall, these improvements aim to enhance democratic principles, strengthen governance, and create a more inclusive and representative system that addresses the concerns and aspirations of all citizens."},{"prompt":"\\"The country’s official name is: KINGDOM OF CAROLINA. The people are known as: CAROLINIANS. Capital and largest city: Ultima (250,000) Flag: A golden palmetto tree on a red field with a white stripe at the hoist bearing a red star. Formerly the field of the flag was navy blue, but this was changed to synchronise with Meridian/Hermandad colour schemes (ostensibly to avoid friendly fire). Land area: 48,500 lcf. Population: 8.2 million (including residents from other Hermandad nations). Economic ranking: Difficult to classify due to the level of integration into the Hermandad economic system and the fact that it serves as a primary raw materials producer for that system. The Wragg family, with its vast agricultural interests, retains some level of independent economic power. Form of government: The Kingdom of Carolina’s system of government is descended from that which it had as a Confederation within the ENA, with an elected General Assembly and a directly elected Governor (which in practice has become the hereditary possession of the Wragg family). The role of the Crown in the government was maintained with the creation of a separate Kingdom under the House of Owens-Allen. In theory the roles of the King, Governor and Speaker of the General Assembly would tend to conflict or be redundant under the titular constitution, but in practice the Meridian military forces in Carolina tend to call most of the shots anyway. Carolina has universal manhood suffrage for male whites and native Indians only, which means little in practice given the weakness of the government. Though other political parties are not formally banned, in practice all MGAs identify as Whigs and factions within this theoretically one-party state function in the same way as parties would elsewhere. Foreign relations: Since the Great American War, and in particular since the Palmetto League rebellion was crushed, Carolina has been firmly under the bootheel of the United Provinces of South America, firmly integrated into the Hermandad economic system and manipulated so that much of its industry has been degraded or moved elsewhere and its economy focused on primary raw material production. Ordinary Carolinians have varying (but generally negative) views of the ENA, but the country’s foreign policy towards the ENA is determined in Córdoba, not Ultima. Military: The Royal Carolinian Army is fairly well equipped (with Meridian-made weapons, often slightly obsolete ones) and trained. The Royal Carolinian Navy, as with navies of many other Hermandad states, is subordinated and integrated with the Meridian Armada to a point where it becomes difficult to separate them and which flag is flown may be for political reasons. Current head of state: King William V Daniel (House of Owens-Allen) (since 1878) Current head of government: Formally Governor Darius Wragg, but the role is de facto divided with Speaker Thomas McCain.\\"","completion":"The system of government described in the excerpt is a constitutional monarchy with a hereditary Governor and an elected General Assembly. The Crown's role in government was maintained after Carolina became a separate Kingdom under the House of Owens-Allen. However, in practice, the military forces and the influence of the United Provinces of South America, particularly the Hermandad economic system, play a significant role in decision-making. The country's foreign policy is determined in Córdoba, not Ultima. Benefits of this system include: 1. Continuity: The presence of a constitutional monarchy provides a sense of continuity and stability in governance. 2. Elected representation: The General Assembly allows for elected representatives to voice the concerns and interests of the people. 3. Military cooperation: Integration with the Meridian Armada and the Hermandad economic system can provide military support and economic benefits. However, several potential issues may arise from this system: 1. Concentration of power: The hereditary possession of the Governorship by the Wragg family and the significant influence of the military and the Hermandad economic system may result in a concentration of power. 2. Limited political pluralism: While not formally banned, the practical dominance of the Whigs and the lack of other viable political parties may limit political pluralism and diversity of ideas. 3. Limited autonomy: The country's foreign policy being determined externally and the degradation of industry and economic focus on primary raw material production may limit Carolina's autonomy and hinder economic development. To evaluate the level of democracy in this system on a scale from 1 to 10, we must consider the distribution of power, representation, and citizen involvement in decision-making. Limited political pluralism, external determination of foreign policy, and concentration of power suggest a lower level of democracy. Therefore, this system may rank around 3 to 4 on the democratic scale, indicating a system with significant limitations on democratic practices."},{"prompt":"How To Use Google's SMTP Server","completion":"To use Google's SMTP server, you will need the following: 1.

Важным первым шагом является выбор подходящего сорта тыквы. Существует множество различных сортов, и каждый из них имеет свои особенности. Некоторые сорта предназначены для выращивания в теплицах или в закрытом грунте, в то время как другие хорошо растут и развиваются на открытых грядках. Выбор сорта также зависит от ваших предпочтений к размеру и вкусу тыквы. При выборе сорта следует обращать внимание на климатические условия вашего региона, чтобы быть уверенным в том, что сорт будет адаптирован к вашему местному климату. Когда сорт тыквы выбран, нужно определить лучшее местоположение для посадки. Тыква любит солнечные места, поэтому выберите открытый участок с хорошей солнечной освещенностью. Также убедитесь, что место имеет достаточный доступ к воде и дренированию. Хорошее дренажное обеспечение поможет избежать задержки влаги, что может привести к развитию грибковых заболеваний. Следующим шагом является подготовка грунта. Тыква предпочитает плодородные, хорошо дренированные почвы с нейтральным pH. Рекомендуется провести анализ почвы, чтобы определить ее состав и уровень питательности. Внесите компост или органические удобрения в почву перед посадкой для обеспечения достаточного питания растения. Когда почва подготовлена, можно приступать к посадке семян или рассады тыквы. Если выбрана посадка семян, рекомендуется разбавить их стимулятором роста и начать посев в середине весны. Посев семян можно осуществлять непосредственно в почву или в семенники, а затем пересаживать рассаду в желаемые места после появления первых настоящих листьев. Важно следить за регулярным поливом тыквы, особенно во время сезона активного роста и формирования плодов. Однако важно не перезаливать растение, чтобы избежать гниения корней. Рекомендуется поливать тыкву глубоко, но реже. Также регулярно рыхлите почву, чтобы позволить корням получать достаточное количество воздуха. Дополнительно можно удобрять тыкву органическими или минеральными удобрениями. Рекомендуется применять удобрения с высоким содержанием калия, так как это способствует образованию и хранению плодов. Удобрение растения следует проводить в соответствии с рекомендациями производителя или консультироваться с опытным садоводом. Также рекомендуется удалять боковые побеги и листья, чтобы обеспечить лучшую циркуляцию воздуха и светопроницаемость. Это способствует лучшему формированию плодов и предотвращает развитие грибковых заболеваний. Наконец, стоит обратить внимание на срок сбора урожая. Тыква необходимо собирать, когда она полностью созреет. Узнать о готовности плодов можно, обратив внимание на цвет, звук при постукивании и общую консистенцию. Следуя этим рекомендациям и обращая внимание на нужды растения, вы сможете вырастить крупную и вкусную тыкву, которая станет гордостью вашего сада или овощного грядки."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In the first half of 2023, the total number of visitor arrivals increased by 236.1% year-on-year. The tourism authorities in Macau are planning to organize more events in the second half of the year to meet their target of 24 million annual visitor arrivals.

Борьба с сорняками без использования химических средств имеет преимущества не только с точки зрения охраны окружающей среды, но и для здоровья человека и животных. Здесь представлены несколько эффективных способов борьбы с сорняками без химии. 1. Регулярное поливание и мульчирование. Регулярное поливание позволяет поддерживать влажность почвы на оптимальном уровне для полезных растений, тем самым улучшая их конкурентоспособность в отношении сорняков. Мульчирование, т.е. покрытие почвы слоем органического материала, такого как солома, опилки или скошенная трава, помогает подавлять рост сорняков, предотвращает их прорастание и распространение, а также сохраняет влагу в почве. 2. Ручная прополка. Ручное удаление сорняков корнями является одним из самых простых и эффективных способов борьбы с ними. Однако, необходимо быть аккуратным, чтобы не повредить корни полезных растений. Лучше проводить прополку после дождя или полива, когда почва находится влажной, чтобы растения с легкостью с выдергивались из почвы. 3. Использование теплового метода. Этот метод основан на нагревании сорняков высокими температурами, что приводит к их гибели. Для этого можно использовать фен или паровую машину, направляя поток горячего воздуха или пара прямо на растение. При правильном использовании этот метод не только убивает сорняки, но и остается безопасным для полезных растений, так как тепло передается только на саму растительность. 4. Солнечное облучение. Этот метод основан на использовании солнечного света для выпалывания сорняков. Для этого область с особенно высокой концентрацией сорняков может быть покрыта черной пленкой или картоном. Это препятствует доступу солнечных лучей к растениям, вызывая у них голод и приводя к их смерти. После нескольких недель рекомендуется удалить пленку и прополоть оставшиеся сорняки, так как некоторые могут выжить в теневых зонах. 5. Полевые культуры. Полевые культуры, такие как клевер, ячмень, горчица, сложносложные, имеют способность задавить сорняки своим густым ростом и создать конкуренцию за ресурсы с окружающей растительностью. Распределение этих растений по участку помогает подавить рост сорняков и сохранить почву плодородной. 6. Пастбищное животноводство. Содержание скота на участке помогает бороться со сорняками, так как они съедают их. Однако, необходимо быть осторожным и контролировать количество скота, чтобы избежать перегружения участка. 7. Генерация пара. Этот метод заключается в прогревании почвы до высокой температуры с помощью генератора пара. Высокая температура убивает сорняки и их семена в почве, предотвращая их дальнейшее распространение. Важно помнить, что эффективность борьбы с сорняками будет зависеть от сочетания различных методов, а также от внимательного наблюдения и регулярного ухода за участком."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As I slowly emerged from the depths of slumber, a strange sensation started to prick at my senses. My body felt different, as if it had transformed overnight. I blinked my eyes open to behold an unfamiliar sight. Long, flowing hair spilled over my shoulders, cascading like a waterfall. Confusion tugged at my thoughts as I gently touched the silky strands, unable to comprehend this bizarre change. How had my perfectly styled bob transformed into this beautiful cascade? As I rose from the bed, I realized that my attire had also undergone an inexplicable alteration. Instead of my usual power suit, I found myself draped in an apron. Its delicate fabric adorned with intricate patterns that whispered of secrets I did not yet understand. My heart quickened with trepidation, unable to shake off an uneasy feeling that something sinister had occurred. Then, my gaze shifted towards the mirror, and there she stood – my nemesis, Elizabeth. Or at least a twisted iteration of her. Her once enviable curves were replaced by a flat chest, and the flowery scent of her perfume was replaced by an aura of masculinity. Somehow, overnight, Elizabeth had been transformed into a femboy. I could see rage simmering beneath her narrowed gaze, yet a peculiar flicker of fear danced in her eyes. The rivalry that had blazed between us like a wildfire was now tinged with an entirely unforeseen dynamic. But instead of fueling my own anger, a seed of curiosity blossomed within me. The sound of footsteps approaching echoed through the room, and a wisp of black smoke materialized before us. A witch emerged from the darkness, her presence commanding attention. She was draped in a cloak woven with starlight, her eyes glinting with an ancient knowledge both mystifying and chilling. A sinister smile crept upon the witch's lips as she surveyed the scene before her. \\"Is this not the outcome you both desired? To witness each other's downfall?\\" Her voice seeped with an otherworldly resonance that sent shivers down my spine. Though skepticism gnawed at my thoughts, I could not deny the enigmatic magic that had evidently ensnared us. The witch's words hinted at a truth we had both chosen to ignore, our rivalry blinding us to the tangible shared pain. Perhaps there was more to our animosity than met the eye. As I met Elizabeth's gaze, I saw an unfamiliar vulnerability clouding her eyes. Gone was the venomous hatred we had harbored for each other. It lay replaced by a captivating bewilderment, a reflection of the same thunderous differences that now marked our outer selves. In that moment, a surge of understanding coursed through me. We were both products of a society that had perpetuated and pitted us against each other. The witch's trickery had forced us to face the wounds of our rivalry, to look beyond the confines of gender and status. Now, we stood as two souls burdened with the weight of our adversarial history. The world had transformed us physically, but it remained to be seen if this metamorphosis would penetrate the depths of our hearts. As the witch vanished into the ether, leaving us to navigate this new reality, a flicker of hope danced within me. For perhaps, in this unforeseen twist of fate, our rivalry could morph into something far greater than the sum of our individual successes. Maybe, just maybe, we could bridge the chasm between us, forging a bond that shattered the stereotypes imprisoning us both. And so, as the morning sunlight continued to bathe the room, I took a tentative step forward. The next chapter of our intertwined lives awaited, with uncertainties and possibilities intertwining like waltzing shadows.

The silhouette becomes recognizable as Carl Grimes, wearing nothing but a tattered undershirt and pants.] Narrator (Voice-over): Carl Grimes, the defiant young survivor and symbol of resilience, explores the remnants of a forgotten world. [Carl slowly walks towards the pond's edge, his eyes scanning the surroundings for any lurking threats. He pauses for a moment, contemplating his next move.] Carl (Whispering to himself): Finally, some peace and quiet.

The camera follows him underwater as he resurfaces, his face beaming with an unexpected glee.] Carl (Chuckling to himself): Freedom at its finest! [Carl looks around, ensuring he is completely alone.

In this decaying dystopia, where survival was the ultimate goal, a young and resilient Carl Grimes found himself in an unexpected situation. Carl was on the run, chased relentlessly by a horde of ravenous walkers. The trees whispered with danger, and adrenaline surged through his veins as he desperately sought refuge. Straying from his path, he stumbled upon a secluded pond nestled in the heart of the forest. Hunger gnawed at his insides, urging him to rest and regain his strength. But little did he know, this serene oasis would soon witness a peculiar, albeit comical, display. Seeking a temporary respite from the constant threat of the undead, Carl decided to embrace the simple pleasure of solitude. The constant tension that underlined every aspect of his existence had weighed heavily upon his shoulders. So, he made a spur-of-the-moment decision that defied the somber reality surrounding him. Stripping off his tattered clothes, Carl reveled in the liberating feeling of being human, if only for a moment. His naked form glistened under the dappled sunlight filtering through the trees, a rare sense of innocence amidst the chaos. Stepping closer to the pond, he could feel the coolness of the water, inviting him to submerge himself fully. With a mischievous gleam in his eyes, Carl leaped into the water, causing it to splash gracefully around him. As the water enveloped his body, Carl's pent-up tension found release in the form of an irreverent and uproarious fart. The bubbles danced playfully at the surface, revealing the sheer audacity of his juvenile act. Amidst the ripples, Carl's laughter echoed through the tranquil surroundings. However, the humor was short-lived upon realizing the pungent odor that permeated the air. Still, he couldn't resist sarcasm, even in this absurd situation. Splashing the water with his hands, Carl sarcastically apologized in a playful yet fake sorrowful manner, \\"Oh, I'm so sorry, my dear fishy friends. Please forgive my unruly backside.\\" The foul stench, unfortunately, did not go unnoticed by the inhabitants of the pond. As the fart's putrid presence mingled with the water, the fish began floating up to the surface, their lifeless bodies borne upon the rancid waves. Despite the grim scene playing out before him, Carl couldn't help but smile, recognizing the irony of his actions as he prepared to savor an unexpected meal. Using his swift survival instincts, he swiftly snatched one of the floating fish from the tainted water. Hunger took precedence over any eerie phenomenon, making him temporarily oblivious to the implications of the strange procession occurring around him. As Carl prepared to cook his bountiful catch over a crackling fire, he glanced back at the pond, only to be struck with disbelief. The once gentle ripples had transformed into a mesmerizing display of precision and intention. The green algae slowly rearranged, forming the unmistakable words \\"Chandler Riggs,\\" the real-life name of Carl's actor. Stunned and bewildered, Carl wondered if this peculiar moment was an indication of his destiny, a reminder that even in a world overrun by the dead, there are inexplicable connections that persist. He couldn't help but feel a strange kinship with the character he portrayed, as if their paths converged on a deeper, more ethereal level. With his mind filled with questions and curiosity, Carl continued his journey, armed with newfound strength from the mysterious encounter. Perhaps there was more to his story than he had ever imagined, and in this harsh world, anything was possible. As he left the pond behind, he carried with him the memories of the fish, the fart, and the enigmatic display that told him he was part of something greater, even if he couldn't fully comprehend it."},{"prompt":"(In a swamp biome…) Young Witch: “Hmm…” [player]: “What are you working on?” Young Witch: “P-P-Please don’t interrupt me.

We have to ensure a sterile environment for the delivery.\\" (The healer quickly gathers the necessary supplies while Mizore continues to endure her contractions.) Healer: \\"Alright, Mizore, the first stage of labor is called the dilation phase. Your cervix needs to open to approximately 10 centimeters for the baby to pass through. I'll guide you through the process.\\" (Mizore grits her teeth and follows the healer's instructions, pushing when instructed and managing her breathing.) Healer: \\"Great job, Mizore! Your cervix is fully dilated now. We're moving on to the second stage, the pushing stage. When your next contraction comes, I want you to bear down and push as hard as you can. I'll be right here to support you.\\" (Mizore takes a deep breath and prepares herself for the next contraction.) Mizore: \\"Okay, I'm ready.\\" (With each contraction, Mizore pushes with all her strength, the pain temporarily forgotten in her determination to bring her baby safely into the world.) Healer: \\"Keep going, Mizore! The baby is making progress.\\" (After several rounds of pushing, Mizore feels an immense sense of relief as she feels the baby's head crowning.) Mizore: \\"I can feel it! I can feel the head!\\" Healer: \\"That's great! We're almost there. Just a few more pushes.\\" (After a final push, Mizore lets out a triumphant cry as her baby is born. The healer quickly clears the airway and wraps the baby in a warm blanket before placing them in Mizore's waiting arms.) Healer: \\"Congratulations, Mizore! You did it.

Feeling the weight of the world lift off his young shoulders for a moment, he decided to seize this chance for a refreshing dip. Undressing hurriedly, the seventeen-year-old boy emerged victorious from the tattered remains of his clothes. With his bare form exposed to the world, he dashed towards the pond, his youthful exuberance guiding his every step. Like a bird in flight, Carl launched himself into the water, feeling the cool liquid envelope every inch of his skin. Once submerged, Carl let out a joyous giggle, feeling like a child again, even if for just a fleeting moment. As the water caressed his body, he couldn't help but succumb to one of his more juvenile desires. Giggling to himself, Carl released a mighty fart into the water below. As the bubbles of gas rose to the surface, mingling with the ripples caused by his splash, Carl couldn't stop himself from apologizing sarcastically to the unsuspecting fish that swam nearby. \\"I apologize, fishy friends, for drenching you with such a vile odor,\\" he chuckled to himself, knowing that fish neither understood nor cared for his words. But little did Carl know, the noxious smell of his fart was far worse than he could have ever imagined. The stench of decay and rotten eggs permeated the water, creating a toxic cloud that swirled around the pond. The poor fish, innocent and unaware, found themselves trapped within this nauseating fog. In a terrible twist of fate, the fish began to float up to the surface, their once-glistening scales now dull and lifeless. Carl, witnessing this unexpected phenomenon, felt a mix of amusement and guilt wash over him. However, the instinctual survivalist within him quickly got the better of his emotions. Excitedly, Carl dove beneath the tainted surface, snatching a deceased fish from the current. Holding the fish triumphantly above his head, he couldn't help but revel in the irony; a fart had turned into an unexpected opportunity for sustenance.

Seeking a moment of peace away from the constant dangers of the undead, he decided to indulge in a peculiar act of liberation - to jump into the cool water completely nude. Bare as the day he was born, Carl approached the water's edge, shedding his tattered clothes. With a mischievous grin, he leaped into the inviting pond, feeling the refreshing droplets splash against his pale skin. Surrounded by nature's beauty, his worries momentarily melted away. Ensuring he was truly alone, Carl's mischievous side prevailed. A wicked grin spread across his face as he embraced the childish delight of an empty moment. With a playful twinkle in his eye, he took a deep breath and let out the most uproarious fart, the sound echoing through the quiet forest. As the heinous smell escaped from Carl's backside, it formed a cloud of stench beneath the water's surface. The foul odor permeated the liquid, sending disconcerting ripples across its stillness. Amused by his own mischief, Carl quietly giggled under his breath. Peering into the now bubbling water, Carl noticed the fart's lingering effects. A multitude of bubbles rose to the surface, confirming the extent of the putrid smell. Amidst the bubble-filled chaos, Carl sarcastically addressed the bewildered fish beneath. \\"Apologies, dear fish,\\" Carl chuckled, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \\"Surely you must appreciate the fragrant bouquet I've shared with you all today!\\" Unbeknownst to Carl, his unsuspecting victims couldn't endure the potency of his flatulence.

The satisfied grin on his face grew wider as he realized his prank had inadvertently provided him with a delicious dinner. Leaving the pond with his prize in hand, Carl's mischievous adventure took an unexpected turn. Little did he know, his farting escapade would forever become a legendary tale among survivors, a story passed down from generation to generation as a testament to the absurdity even in the grimmest of times.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"write an essay equally band 6.5 ielts : It is widely observed that school violence has been alarmingly increasing among teenagers and youngsters throughout the world. This state of affairs can be attributed to several reasons, and some viable solutions that can be adopted to alleviate this situation will be outlined in this essay.","completion":"Title: Addressing the Rise of School Violence Among Teenagers and Youngsters Introduction: The escalating prevalence of school violence among teenagers and young individuals globally has become a cause for concern. This essay will discuss the various factors contributing to this issue and propose potential solutions to mitigate its impact. Body Paragraph 1: One major contributing factor to the rise in school violence is the influence of media and technology. Teenagers and youngsters are frequently exposed to violence through video games, television shows, and social media platforms. Consequently, they become desensitized to violence, making it easier for them to engage in aggressive behavior. To combat this, parents and schools should implement stricter regulations and enforce age restrictions on violent media content. Body Paragraph 2: Inadequate parental supervision and support also contribute to the increase in school violence. Many parents are overwhelmed with obligations and fail to dedicate sufficient time to their children. This lack of guidance leaves youngsters susceptible to negative influences from peers and society. Encouraging open communication between parents and children, implementing effective parenting programs, and providing supportive resources are crucial steps towards preventing school violence. Body Paragraph 3: Moreover, socio-economic factors can play a role in school violence. Poverty, inequality, and limited access to quality education can increase frustration and desperation among teenagers and youngsters. In economically disadvantaged areas, school violence may be more prevalent. Governments and communities should prioritize addressing socio-economic inequalities through initiatives such as reducing poverty and ensuring equal educational opportunities for all. Body Paragraph 4: To effectively curb school violence, schools themselves must adopt comprehensive strategies. This includes implementing anti-bullying campaigns, fostering a culture of tolerance and respect, and encouraging conflict resolution skills. Moreover, schools should provide counseling services to address underlying issues that may contribute to violence, such as mental health concerns or social exclusion. Conclusion: In conclusion, the rise of school violence among teenagers and youngsters is a pressing issue that demands immediate attention. By addressing the influence of media, enhancing parental support, tackling socio-economic disparities, and implementing comprehensive strategies within schools, we can work towards a safer and more harmonious educational environment for future generations. It is vital for all stakeholders, including parents, schools, governments, and communities, to collaborate in resolving this issue and ensuring the well-being of our youth."},{"prompt":"translate to traditional chinese: Quick Take: (1) Macau's visitors number recovered to ~70% of 2019 level (2) China's AI and EV sectors supportive measures (3) UK inflation cool down (4) Tesla/Netflix/Sands China earnings highlight Macau's visitor arrivals soar by 480.5% in June, reaching 71.4% of pre-pandemic levels Visitor arrivals in Macau increased by 480.5% year-on-year in June, reaching a total of 2.2 million.

UK's inflation rate falls to 7.9% in June, easing pressure on Bank of England UK's high inflation rate fell more than expected in June, to 7.9%, which is the slowest in over a year. Core inflation, which excludes volatile prices like energy and food, remained at a high level of 6.9%, but decreased from its peak of 7.1% in May. This eases some of the pressure on the Bank of England to keep raising interest rates although inflation remains well above the 2% target. After the release of the data, the pound fell against the dollar, the euro, and the yen, as investors no longer expect UK rates to peak above 6%.

Amelia, a successful businesswoman known for her tenacity and ambition, couldn't shake off the lingering animosity that consumed her every interaction with her rival, Emily. Their rivalry had become the stuff of office legend, a feud that seemed to fuel their professional successes and personal shortcomings in equal measure. But today was different. Today, Emily had taken their rivalry to a whole new level. She had sought the assistance of a mysterious witch, rumored to possess the ability to alter reality itself. And now, as Amelia's eyes fluttered open hesitantly, she found herself faced with a startling transformation. Gone were her sleek power suits and executive demeanor. Instead, she adorned a long, flowing apron that seemed out of place with her surroundings. As she blinked in disbelief, she noticed her reflection in the mirror - long, lustrous hair cascading down her back, her appearance altered to that of a traditional homemaker. Her breath quickened as her gaze fell upon Emily, who stood before her, the only sign of their intense rivalry now hidden beneath her transformed exterior. Emily was now Ethan, a femboy with a flat chest and a male bulge, yet his face remained unchanged, mirroring the expression of genuine sincerity. \\"Ethan?\\" Amelia's voice quivered, a mix of confusion and anger lingering in the air.

The witch changed our reality to give us a chance, a chance to break free from this hostility that has consumed us for far too long.\\" Amelia's mind swirled, her heart torn between resistance and curiosity. She had always prided herself on her independence and strength; the idea of being reduced to a stay-at-home wife evoked a sense of helplessness she couldn't comprehend. But then again, she had to admit, their rivalry had grown toxic, devouring any semblance of a healthy work environment. And here was Ethan, extending an olive branch in the most unexpected way, genuinely wanting to find a way to coexist peacefully. \\"Is this what you really want, Ethan?\\" Amelia whispered, vulnerability coloring her voice. Ethan nodded, a flicker of hope dancing in his eyes. \\"I want us to find happiness, Amelia. Together.
