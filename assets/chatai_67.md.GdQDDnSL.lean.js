Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell (usually one inherited from each parent) must have a mutation for an individual to be affected. Individuals who carry one mutated copy of the gene are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers for an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be an unaffected carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% risk to not have the condition and not be a carrier (i.e. to inherit both normal genes). In other words, each child born to two carriers has a 75% (3 in 4) chance to be unaffected. De novo mutations (new mutations that occur for the first time in an individual and are not inherited from a parent) have been reported for this condition. This means that in some cases, an affected individual may have only one parent who is a carrier for the condition. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk may be possible through laboratories offering custom mutation analysis if the disease-causing mutations in a family are known. Individuals interested in learning more about genetic risks to themselves or family members, or about genetic testing for this condition, should speak with a genetics professional."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Zellweger spectrum ?","completion":"Zellweger spectrum refers to a group of related conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms and affect many parts of the body. The spectrum includes Zellweger syndrome (ZS), the most severe form; neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), an intermediate form; and infantile Refsum disease (IRD), the least severe form. Signs and symptoms of ZS typically become apparent in the newborn period and may include hypotonia, feeding problems, hearing and vision loss, seizures, distinctive facial characteristics, and skeletal abnormalities. Individuals with ZS often do not survive past the first year of life. The features of NALD and IRD often vary in nature and severity, and may not become apparent until late infancy or early childhood. Individuals with NALD or IRD may have hypotonia, vision and/or hearing problems, liver dysfunction, developmental delay and learning disabilities. Most individuals with NALD survive into childhood, and those with IRD may reach adulthood. Conditions in the Zellweger spectrum are caused by mutations in any of at least 12 genes and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment typically focuses on the specific signs and symptoms present in each individual."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Autosomal dominant deafnessonychodystrophy syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Autosomal dominant deafness-onychodystrophy syndrome?

The most common signs and symptoms of alcohol intolerance are stuffy nose and skin flushing. Alcohol intolerance is caused by a genetic condition in which the body is unable to break down alcohol efficiently, usually found in Asians. These individuals accumulate acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of ethanol, because of a genetic polymorphism of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) that metabolizes acetaldehyde to nontoxic acetate.[9184] The only way to prevent alcohol intolerance reactions is to avoid alcohol. Alcohol intolerance isn't an allergy. However, in some cases, what seems to be alcohol intolerance may be a reaction to something in an alcoholic beverage, such as chemicals, grains or preservatives. Combining alcohol with certain medications also can cause reactions. In rare instances, an unpleasant reaction to alcohol can be a sign of a serious underlying health problem that requires diagnosis and treatment."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Acute alcohol sensitivity ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Acute alcohol sensitivity ?

Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body such as bones, ligaments, muscles, walls of blood vessels, and heart valves. Marfan syndrome affects most organs and tissues, especially the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart, and the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). It is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. At least 25% of cases are due to a new mutation. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Marfan syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome? The signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome vary widely in severity, timing of onset, and rate of progression. Affected individuals often are tall and lean, have elongated fingers and toes (arachnodactyly), and have an arm span that exceeds body height. Other common features include unusually flexible joints, a long and narrow face, a highly arched roof of the mouth and crowded teeth, an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and either a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). About half of people with Marfan syndrome have a dislocated lens (ectopia lentis) in one or both eyes, and most have some degree of nearsightedness (myopia). Clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur in mid adulthood, and increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma) occurs more frequently than in people without Marfan syndrome. Most people with Marfan syndrome have abnormalities of the heart and the aorta. Leaks in valves that control blood flow through the heart can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and an irregular heartbeat felt as skipped or extra beats (palpitations). If leakage occurs, it usually affects the mitral valve, which is a valve between two chambers of the heart, or the aortic valve that regulates blood flow from the heart into the aorta. The first few inches of the aorta can weaken and stretch, which may lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). The increased size of the aorta may cause the aortic valve to leak, which can lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection). Aortic aneurysm and dissection can be life threatening. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Marfan syndrome.

In people with POTS, these symptoms are also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat.

The underlying cause of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is poorly understood. However, episodes often begin after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness and may increase right before a menstrual period. Many researchers suspect that there may be more than one cause for the condition. The following abnormalities can be associated with POTS and may play a role in the development of the condition: Peripheral denervation - reduced nerve stimulation to certain muscles. The lower extremities are generally most affected in people with POTS. Hypovolemia - an abnormal decrease or redistribution of blood in the body Changes in venous function - more specifically, a reduction in the volume of blood that returns to the heart (venous return) when moving from a lying down to a standing position Cardiovascular deconditioning - changes in cardiovascular function Baroreflex abnormalities - the baroreflexes play an important role in blood pressure regulation. When they sense a change in blood pressure, the heart rate is adjusted and the sympathetic nerve system fibers are activated to cause the blood vessels to narrow. Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system Although most cases of POTS appear to occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition, some affected people report a family history of orthostatic intolerance (an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing position). This suggests that genetic factors may play a role in the development of POTS in some cases. Some studies also suggest that polymorphisms in certain genes (NOS3, ADRB2) may be associated with an increased risk of developing the condition and a change (mutation) in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) has been identified in one family with POTS."},{"prompt":"Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome inherited ?","completion":"Is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome inherited?

A diagnosis of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. Many physicians will conduct a physical examination, including measuring blood pressure and heart rate while lying, sitting, and standing. A tilt table test may also be recommended to help confirm the diagnosis."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ?","completion":"How is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome treated? Because postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is thought to have a variety of causes, there is no single treatment that is effective for all people with the condition. In general, management of POTS aims to relieve low blood volume and/or regulate circulatory problems that could be causing the condition. In some affected people, simple life style interventions such as adding extra salt to the diet, ensuring adequate fluid intake, participating in a specialized exercise program, and avoiding factors that exacerbate the condition appear to improve symptoms. Certain medications have also been used to treat POTS with some success."},{"prompt":"What is (are) 2methyl3hydroxybutyric aciduria ?","completion":"2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric aciduria is an inherited disorder in which the body cannot effectively process the amino acid isoleucine.

Unfortunately, CREST syndrome has no known cure. The condition carries both physical and psychological consequences, so a holistic approach to management should be taken. Treatment generally focuses on relieving signs and symptoms and preventing complications. Heartburn may be relieved by antacid medications that reduce the production of stomach acid. Medications that open small blood vessels and increase circulation may help relieve Raynaud's symptoms and reduce increased pressure in the arteries between the heart and lungs. Drugs that suppress the immune system have shown promise in preventing interstitial lung disease (a condition in which excess collagen collects in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs) in some people with CREST syndrome. To prevent loss of mobility, stretching exercises for the finger joints are important. A physical therapist can also show affected individuals some facial exercises that may help keep the face and mouth flexible. If CREST syndrome is making it difficult to perform daily tasks, an occupational therapist can help individuals learn new ways of doing things. For example, special toothbrushes and flossing devices can make it easier to care for the teeth. Surgery may be necessary for some affected individuals. Large or painful calcium deposits sometimes need to be surgically removed, and amputation of fingertips may be necessary if skin ulcers progress to gangrene. Depression affects approximately 45% of patients with systemic sclerosis and 64% also develop anxiety, so early assessment and treatment of these psychological issues is recommended. For pain management, studies have shown that oxycodone is effective and safe for pain due to severe skin ulcers, while topical lidocaine helps reduce pain of digital ulcers in individuals with systemic scleroderma. \` There are also some lifestyle changes and home remedies that may be helpful for some individuals with CREST syndrome. To reduce Raynaud's symptoms, individuals may consider wearing gloves or mittens outdoors when the weather is cool, and indoors when reaching into the freezer, for example. To maintain the body's core temperature, individuals may dress in layers and wear a hat or scarf, thermal socks, and well-fitting boots or shoes that don't cut off the circulation. Individuals who smoke should talk to their doctor about the best ways to quit. Nicotine constricts the blood vessels, making Raynaud's phenomenon worse. Individuals who have difficulty swallowing may consider choosing soft, moist foods and chewing food well. To minimize acid reflux individuals may eat small, frequent meals; avoid spicy or fatty foods, chocolate, caffeine, and alcohol; and avoid exercising immediately before or after eating. Sitting upright for a couple of hours after a meal may also help. To help keep skin soft, individuals may avoid harsh soaps and detergents, while choosing gentle skin cleansers and bath gels with added moisturizers. Individuals may also consider bathing less frequently and taking brief baths and showers, using warm rather than hot water. Moisture levels in the home may be improved by using a humidifier to ease skin and breathing symptoms.

Another common cause, exclusive to women, is childbirth. The other most common cause of the condition is pregnancy. During the last three months of pregnancy, certain hormones are released in the women's body causing the area between the sacrum and the coccyx to soften and become more mobile. The increased mobility may result in permanent stretching and change and causing inflammation of the tissues surrounding the coccyx. In about one third of all cases of coccygodynia, the cause is unknown.

Common eye symptoms include cornea defects, which is the clear covering on the front of the eye, and iris defects, which is the colored part of the eye. People with this syndrome may have an off-center pupil (corectopia) or extra holes in the eyes that can look like multiple pupils (polycoria). About 50% of people with this syndrome develop glaucoma, which is a serious condition that increases pressure inside of the eye. This may cause vision loss or blindness. Click here to view a diagram of the eye. Even though Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is primarily an eye disorder, this syndrome is also associated with symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Most people with this syndrome have distinctive facial features and many have issues with their teeth, including unusually small teeth (microdontia) or fewer than normal teeth (oligodontia). Some people have extra folds of skin around their belly button, heart defects, or other more rare birth defects. There are three types of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and each has a different genetic cause. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 1 is caused by spelling mistakes (mutations) in the PITX2 gene. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 3 is caused by mutations in the FOXC1 gene. The gene that causes Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 2 is not known, but it is located on chromosome 13.

Diagnosis of Fowlers syndrome involves ruling out neurological or laboratory features that would support a diagnosis of a underlying neurological disease, and identification of a bladder capacity of over 1 liter with no sensation of urgency. Also in Fowlers syndrome, analysis of the striated muscle of the urethral sphincter using concentric needle electrode examination reveals a fairly unique electromyographic (EMG) abnormality. This EMG abnormality is found in association with the urethral sphincter (group of muscles which surround the urinary passage below the bladder), and consists of a type of activity that would be expected to cause inappropriate contraction of the muscle (i.e., impair sphincter relaxation)."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Fowler's syndrome ?","completion":"How might Fowlers syndrome be treated? The urinary incontinence caused by Fowlers syndrome may be treated by sacral neuromodulation therapy. The success rate for treatment of Fowlers syndrome with neuromodulation has been estimated to be around 70%, even in women who have been experiencing symptoms for a while. Neuromodulation therapy involves the stimulation of nerves to the bladder leaving the spine. The FDA has approved a device called InterStim for this purpose. Your doctor will need to test to determine if this device would be helpful to you. The doctor applies an external stimulator to determine if neuromodulation works in you. If you have a 50 percent reduction in symptoms, a surgeon will implant the device. Although neuromodulation can be effective, it is not for everyone. The therapy is expensive, involving surgery with possible surgical revisions and replacement. Other treatments that have been tried with little success include hormonal manipulation, pharmacologic therapy, and injections of botulinum toxin."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Nestorguillermo progeria syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Nestor-guillermo progeria syndrome?

Individuals with PCH1 also experience a degeneration of the anterior horn cells. Because of the anterior horn cell involvement, this condition bears a resemblance to infantile spinal muscular atrophy, with severe muscle weakness. Other signs and symptoms of PCH1 include very weak muscle tone (hypotonia), joint deformities called contractures, a small head size (microcephaly), and breathing problems that are present at birth. Mutations in the VRK1 gene have been identified in at least one family with PCH1. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

The signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome can be variable, but the disorder is generally characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability a distinctive facial appearance, and a unique personality that combines over-friendliness and high levels of empathy with anxiety. People with Williams syndrome typically have difficulty with visual-spatial tasks such as drawing and assembling puzzles, but they tend to do well on tasks that involve spoken language, music, and learning by repetition (rote memorization). Affected individuals have outgoing, engaging personalities and tend to take an extreme interest in other people. Attention deficit disorder (ADD), problems with anxiety, and phobias are common among people with this disorder. The most significant medical problem associated with Williams syndrome is a form of cardiovascular disease called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). SVAS is a narrowing of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). If this condition is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart failure. Other problems with the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure (hypertension), have also been reported in people with Williams syndrome. Young children with Williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, and a wide mouth with full lips. Many affected people have dental problems such as small, widely spaced teeth and teeth that are crooked or missing. In older children and adults, the face appears longer and more gaunt. Additional signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome include abnormalities of connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs) such as joint problems and soft, loose skin. Affected children may also have increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) in infancy, developmental delays, problems with coordination, and short stature.

Williams syndrome is caused by the deletion of genetic material from a specific region of chromosome 7. The deleted region includes more than 25 genes, and researchers believe that a loss of several of these genes probably contributes to the characteristic features of this disorder. CLIP2, ELN, GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, and LIMK1 are among the genes that are typically deleted in people with Williams syndrome. Researchers have found that the loss of the ELN gene is associated with the connective tissue abnormalities and cardiovascular disease (specifically supravalvular aortic stenosis) found in many people with this condition. Studies suggest that deletions of CLIP2, GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, LIMK1, and perhaps other genes may help explain the characteristic difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, unique behavioral characteristics, and other cognitive difficulties seen in people with Williams syndrome. Loss of the GTF2IRD1 gene may also contribute to the distinctive facial features often associated with this condition. Researchers believe that the presence or absence of the NCF1 gene on chromosome 7 is related to the risk of developing hypertension in people with Williams syndrome. When the NCF1 gene is included in the part of the chromosome that is deleted, affected individuals are less likely to develop hypertension. Therefore, the loss of this gene appears to be a protective factor. People with Williams syndrome whose NCF1 gene is not deleted have a higher risk of developing hypertension.

Schindler disease type 1 is caused by mutations in the NAGA gene. This gene provides instructions for making the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase.This enzyme works in the lysosomes (compartments within cells that digest and recycle materials) to help break down complexes called glycoproteins and glycolipids (sugar molecules attached to certain proteins and fats). More specifically, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase helps remove a molecule called alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine from sugars in these complexes. Mutations in the NAGA gene interfere with the ability of the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase enzyme to perform its role in breaking down glycoproteins and glycoliipids.

ACC most commonly arises in the head and neck, in various parts of the major and minor salivary glands including the palate, nasopharynx, lining of the mouth, voice box (larynx) or windpipe (trachea). It can also occur in the breast, uterus, or other locations in the body. Early symptoms depend on the tumor's location and may include lumps under the lining of the mouth or facial skin; numbness in the mouth or face; difficulty swallowing; hoarseness; pain; or paralysis of a facial nerve. ACC often has long periods with no growth followed by growth spurts; however, it can be aggressive in some people. ACC spreads along nerves or through the bloodstream, and only spreads to the lymph nodes in about 5-10% of cases. The cause of ACC is currently unknown. Treatment depends on many factors and may include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy."},{"prompt":"What causes Adenoid cystic carcinoma ?","completion":"What causes adenoid cystic carcinoma? The underlying cause of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is not yet known, and no strong genetic or environmental risk factors specific to ACC have been identified. Researchers believe that a combination of various genetic and environmental factors probably interact to ultimately cause a person to develop specific types of cancers. There is ongoing research to learn more about the many factors that contribute to the development of cancer. Cancer is at least partly due to acquired (not inherited) damage or changes to the DNA in certain cells. For example, various studies have shown that chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions are present in samples of ACC. However, these genetic abnormalities are present only in the cancer cells, not in the cells with the genetic material that is passed on to offspring (the egg and sperm cells)."},{"prompt":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma inherited ?","completion":"Is adenoid cystic carcinoma inherited? While the underlying cause of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is not known, no strong genetic risk factors have been identified. To our knowledge, only one case of apparent familial ACC has been reported worldwide. In this case, a father and daughter were both affected with ACC of the sublingual salivary gland. While ACC appears to generally be sporadic (occurring in people with no family history of ACC), there has been speculation about a possible linkage between salivary gland cancers in general and inherited BRCA gene mutations. However, this potential link needs further investigation. There has also been one report of a case of ACC of the salivary gland occurring in a person with basal cell nevus syndrome, a hereditary syndrome known to predispose affected people to a very wide range of tumors."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ?","completion":"Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia. The signs and symptoms of OTC deficiency may include development delay, intellectual disability and liver problems. It is caused by changes (mutations) in the OTC gene. OTC deficiency is inherited as an X-linked condition. Treatment consists of not eating protein, taking certain medications and having hemodialysis, if needed."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency? Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency often becomes evident in the first few days of life. An infant with OTC deficiency may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have a poorly-controlled breathing rate or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder may experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications from OTC deficiency may include developmental delay and intellectual disability. Progressive liver damage, skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen. In some affected individuals, signs and symptoms of OTC deficiency may be less severe, and may not appear until later in life. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.

Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is caused by mutations in the OTC gene. OTC deficiency belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells. It processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. In OTC deficiency, the enzyme that starts a specific reaction within the urea cycle is damaged or missing. The urea cycle cannot proceed normally, and nitrogen accumulates in the bloodstream in the form of ammonia. Ammonia is especially damaging to the nervous system, so OTC deficiency causes neurological problems as well as eventual damage to the liver."},{"prompt":"Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency inherited ?","completion":"How is ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency inherited? Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is an X-linked disorder. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), mutations in both copies of the gene will cause the disorder. Some females with only one altered copy of the OTC gene also show signs and symptoms of OTC deficiency."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of SCARF syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of SCARF syndrome?

People with Camurati-Engelmann disease have increased bone density, particularly affecting the long bones of the arms and legs (tibia, femur, humerus, ulna, radius). In some cases, the skull and hip bones are also affected. The thickened bones can lead to pain in the arms and legs, a waddling walk, muscle weakness, and extreme tiredness. An increase in the density of the skull results in increased pressure on the brain and can cause a variety of neurological problems, including headaches, hearing loss, vision problems, dizziness (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and facial paralysis. The added pressure that thickened bones put on the muscular and skeletal systems can cause abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), joint deformities (contractures), knock knees, and flat feet (pes planus). Other features of Camurati-Engelmann disease include abnormally long limbs in proportion to height, a decrease in muscle mass and body fat, and delayed puberty. In the most severe cases, the mandibula (jaw), vertebrae, thoracic cage, shoulder girdle, and carpal (hands, wrist) and tarsal (foot, ankle) bones are involved. Radiographically (on X-ray), the shafts of long bones show symmetric and progressive widening and malformation (diaphyseal dysplasia). Vascular (Raynaud's phenomenon) and hematological (anemia, leukopenia (low level of white blood cells), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate) features and hepatosplenomegaly are commonly associated with the disease.

Mutations in the TGFB1 gene cause Camurati-Engelmann disease. The TGFB1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-1). The TGF-1 protein helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The TGF-1 protein is found throughout the body and plays a role in development before birth, the formation of blood vessels, the regulation of muscle tissue and body fat development, wound healing, and immune system function. TGF-1 is particularly abundant in tissues that make up the skeleton, where it helps regulate bone growth, and in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix). Within cells, the TGF-1 protein is turned off (inactive) until it receives a chemical signal to become active. The TGFB1 gene mutations that cause Camurati-Engelmann disease result in the production of a TGF-1 protein that is always turned on (active). Overactive TGF-1 proteins lead to increased bone density and decreased body fat and muscle tissue, contributing to the signs and symptoms of Camurati-Engelmann disease.

Intelligence is generally normal; however, some affected people may have mild intellectual disability, including difficulty with reading and/or spelling. Less common signs and symptoms include microcephaly, developmental delay, recurrent infections, and blood vessel abnormalities. Some cases are caused by changes (mutations) in the FLNA gene and are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner.

Difficulty with reading and spelling (dyslexia) has been reported in some girls with periventricular heterotopia. Less commonly, individuals with periventricular heterotopia may have more severe brain malformations, small head size (microcephaly), developmental delays, recurrent infections, blood vessel abnormalities, or other problems. In the X-linked form of periventricular nodular heterotopia, affected patients are mostly females because in males the symptoms are too serious and they die before birth. The following clinical features have been reported: seizure disorder, mental problems, heart anomalies, stomach immobility, strabismus, short fingers and dyslexia. Periventricular heterotopia may also occur in association with other conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Ehlers-Danlos with periventricular heterotopia) which results in extremely flexible joints, skin that stretches easily, and fragile blood vessels. In the autosomal recessive form of periventricular heterotopia the disorder is severe and may include microcephaly, severe developmental delay, and seizures beginning in infancy.

Examination of stool and/or urine for ova is the primary method of diagnosis for schistosomiasis. The choice of sample depends on the suspected species, which may be determined by careful review of travel and residence history. The sensitivity of this testing can be limited by the intensity of infection. For best results, three samples should be collected on different days. A blood sample can also be tested for evidence of infection. Blood tests are indicated for travelers or immigrants from endemic areas who have not been treated (or not treated appropriately) in the past. The most common tests detect antibodies to the adult worm. For accurate results, the blood sample tested should be collected at least 6 to 8 weeks after likely infection. Blood testing may not be appropriate for patients who have been repeatedly infected and treated in the past because antibodies can persist despite cure. In these patients, blood testing cannot distinguish between a past or current infection. A specific blood test has been developed for this population (which can detect an active infection based on the presence of schistosomal antigen), but this test is not commercially available in the United States and is currently being studied for its ability to detect mild infections."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Herpes simplex encephalitis ?","completion":"Herpes simplex encephalitis is a rare neurological condition that is characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).

In approximately 90-95% of cases the cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unknown and is sporadic (occurring in individuals with no history of the condition in the family). The remaining 5-10% of cases are genetic (familial), often occurring in individuals with a family history of the condition. Mutations in any of several genes, including the C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, ANG, ALS2, SETX, and VAPB genes, can cause familial ALS and may contribute to the development of sporadic ALS. About 60% of individuals with familial ALS have an identifiable genetic mutation; the genetic cause in the remaining cases is unknown. The genes associated with ALS appear to play a role in how neurons function or are involved in regulating the production of various proteins. Over the years, various types of environmental exposures have been proposed as possible contributors to the cause of ALS, including mercury, manganese, products used in farming (fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides), and physical and dietary factors. Exposures have been suggested as a possible explanation for the increased incidence of ALS in Gulf War veterans. Further investigation is ongoing."},{"prompt":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis inherited ?","completion":"Is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) inherited? About 90-95% percent of cases of ALS are not inherited and occur in individuals with no history of the condition in their family. The remaining 5-10% of cases are familial, and are thought to be caused by mutations in any one of several genes. The inheritance pattern associated with familial ALS varies depending on the disease-causing gene involved. Most familial cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that only one altered (mutated) copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In most of these cases, an affected individual has one parent with the condition. When an individual with an autosomal dominant form of ALS has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherited the mutated copy of the gene and be affected. Less frequently, ALS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the disease-causing gene (typically one copy inherited from each parent) must have a mutation for the individual to be affected. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition, who presumably each carry one mutated copy of the gene, are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers for the same condition are having children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% risk to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Autosomal recessive forms of ALS may be mistaken for non-inherited (sporadic) forms due to having a negative family history of the condition. In rare cases, ALS is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This occurs when the disease-causing gene is located on the X chromosome (a sex chromosome). Although females have 2 X chromosomes, having a mutation in one X chromosome is still sufficient to cause the condition. Males who have a mutation (and only one X chromosome) will have the condition. Usually, males with an X-linked dominant form of ALS experience more severe symptoms than females with the same form. Some individuals who do inherit a mutation known to cause ALS never develop signs and symptoms of ALS, although the reason for this is unclear. This phenomenon is referred to as reduced penetrance."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ?","completion":"Is genetic testing available for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis? Yes.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first drug treatment for the diseaseriluzole (Rilutek).

Clinical trials with ALS patients showed that riluzole prolongs survival by several months, mainly in those with difficulty swallowing. The drug also extends the time before a patient needs ventilation support. Riluzole does not reverse the damage already done to motor neurons, and patients taking the drug must be monitored for liver damage and other possible side effects. Other treatments for ALS are designed to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients (palliative care). This supportive care is typically provided by multidisciplinary teams of health care professionals such as physicians; pharmacists; physical, occupational, and speech therapists; nutritionists; social workers; and home care and hospice nurses. Working with patients and caregivers, these teams can design an individualized plan of medical and physical therapy and provide special equipment aimed at keeping patients as mobile and comfortable as possible."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Ichthyosis prematurity syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Ichthyosis prematurity syndrome?

Treatment options include medicines, surgery, and complementary approaches. Anticonvulsant medicinesused to block nerve firingare generally effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia. These drugs include carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, clonazepam, phenytoin, lamotrigine, and valproic acid. Gabapentin or baclofen can be used as a second drug to treat trigeminal neuralgia and may be given in combination with other anticonvulsants. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline are used to treat pain described as constant, burning, or aching. Typical analgesics and opioids are not usually helpful in treating the sharp, recurring pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia. If medication fails to relieve pain or produces intolerable side effects, surgical treatment may be recommended. Several neurosurgical procedures are available to treat trigeminal neuralgia. The choice among the various types depends on the patient's preference, physical well-being, previous surgeries, presence of multiple sclerosis, and area of trigeminal nerve involvement. Some procedures are done on an outpatient basis, while others may involve a more complex operation that is performed under general anesthesia. Some degree of facial numbness is expected after most of these procedures, and trigeminal neuralgia might return despite the procedures initial success. Depending on the procedure, other surgical risks include hearing loss, balance problems, infection, and stroke. A rhizotomy is a procedure in which select nerve fibers are destroyed to block pain. A rhizotomy for trigeminal neuralgia causes some degree of permanent sensory loss and facial numbness. Several forms of rhizotomy are available to treat trigeminal neuralgia: Balloon compression works by injuring the insulation on nerves that are involved with the sensation of light touch on the face. Glycerol injection involves bathing the ganglion (the central part of the nerve from which the nerve impulses are transmitted) and damaging the insulation of trigeminal nerve fibers. Radiofrequency thermal lesioning involves gradually heating part of the nerve with an electrode, injuring the nerve fibers. Stereotactic radiosurgery uses computer imaging to direct highly focused beams of radiation at the site where the trigeminal nerve exits the brainstem. This causes the slow formation of a lesion on the nerve that disrupts the transmission of pain signals to the brain. Microvascular decompression is the most invasive of all surgeries for trigeminal neuralgia, but it also offers the lowest probability that pain will return. While viewing the trigeminal nerve through a microscope, the surgeon moves away the vessels that are compressing the nerve and places a soft cushion between the nerve and the vessels. Unlike rhizotomies, there is usually no numbness in the face after this surgery. A neurectomy, which involves cutting part of the nerve, may be performed during microvascular decompression if no vessel is found to be pressing on the trigeminal nerve. Some patients choose to manage trigeminal neuralgia using complementary techniques, usually in combination with drug treatment. These therapies offer varying degrees of success. Options include acupuncture, biofeedback, vitamin therapy, nutritional therapy, and electrical stimulation of the nerves. More detailed information regarding the management of trigeminal neuralgia can be found through the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and eMedicine."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Inclusion body myopathy 2 ?","completion":"Inclusion body myopathy 2, also known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), GNE-related myopathy, distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles, and Nonaka myopathy, is an inherited condition that primarily affects the skeletal muscles (the muscles that the body uses to move).

Inclusion body myopathy 2 causes muscle weakness that appears in late adolescence or early adulthood and worsens over time.The first sign of inclusion body myopathy 2 is often weakness of the tibialis anterior, a muscle in the lower leg that helps control up-and-down movement of the foot. Weakness in the tibialis anterior alters the way a person walks and makes it difficult to run and climb stairs. As the disorder progresses, weakness also develops in muscles of the upper legs, hips, shoulders, and hands. Unlike most forms of myopathy, inclusion body myopathy 2 usually does not affect the quadriceps (a group of large muscles at the front of the thigh). This condition also spares muscles of the eye or heart, and does not cause neurological problems. Weakness in leg muscles makes walking increasingly difficult, and most people with inclusion body myopathy 2 require wheelchair assistance within 20 years after signs and symptoms appear.

Inclusion body myopathy 2 is caused by mutations in the GNE gene. The GNE gene provides instructions for making an enzyme responsible for making sialic acid, a simple sugar that attaches to the ends of more complex molecules on the surface of cells. People with inclusion body myopathy 2 have lower levels of sialic acid on the surface of certain proteins that are important for muscle function.

In these cases, there may be a genetic component; however, a disease-causing gene and specific inheritance pattern have not been identified."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Pars planitis ?","completion":"How is pars planitis diagnosed? Pars planitis is typically diagnosed based on a specialized eye examination. During the exam, the ophthalmologist will typically see clusters of white blood cells trapped within the eyeball that are called snowballs (or \\"inflammatory exudate\\"). If these clusters are located on the pars plana, they are known as snowbanks. Snowbanks are considered a \\"hallmark\\" sign of pars planitis. It is often recommended that people over age 25 with pars planitis have an MRI of their brain and spine to rule out multiple sclerosis."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Pars planitis ?","completion":"How might pars planitis be treated? The first approach to treating pars planitis is corticosteroid eye drops or injections near the eye to control inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including aspirin) or steroid medications (such as prednisone) can be taken by mouth. If these strategies are not successful, other medications may be given to reduce the body's immune response (medications called immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate). If medications are not effective, surgery may be considered. Cryotherapy has been performed in affected people to remove eye tissue that has inflammation. Although this surgery has been shown to be effective in restoring clarity of vision, there are concerns that it may cause damage to other parts of the eye. Another surgery, known as vitrectomy, can be done to remove cloudy fluid (vitreous humor) from the eye."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Myelomeningocele ?","completion":"Myelomeningocele is the most severe form of spina bifida.

Symptoms of this condition usually begin in an individual's 20s or 30s, and they usually emerge in a specific order. The progression is often slow, but varies among individuals. The typical triad of features includes accumulation of amyloid deposits in the cornea (lattice corneal dystrophy), cutis laxa (sagging skin), and nervous system symptoms (neuropathy). Eye symptoms typically begin first. The amyloid deposits cloud the cornea, often leading to vision impairment. Other eye symptoms may include dryness, irritation and light sensitivity. Affected individuals may eventually develop cataracts and glaucoma. As the condition progresses, the nerves become involved (typically in an individual's 40s). Dysfunction of the nerves in the head and face (cranial nerves) causes paralysis of facial muscles and decreased sensation, which can lead to difficulty speaking, chewing, and swallowing. Facial paralysis can also cause additional eye symptoms including ectropium (turning out of the eyelid), corneal ulcers, or droopy eyelids (ptosis). Affected individuals may also have peripheral neuropathy. Central nervous system symptoms such as impaired cognitive function are rare but have been reported in older individuals. Skin manifestations may also begin in a person's 40s and include a thickened, sagging appearance and cutis laxa (loose skin that lacks elasticity), especially on the face.

The mutation that causes hemoglobin E disease has the highest frequency among people of Southeast Asian heritage (Cambodian, Laotian, Vietnamese and Thai). However, it is also found in people of Chinese, Filipino, Asiatic Indian, and Turkish descent."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Hemoglobin E disease ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of hemoglobin E disease? Affected individuals can develop mild thalassemia in the first few months of life. While mild splenomegaly and/or anemia can occur, it is generally considered a benign condition. When a person inherits a gene mutation from one of their parents, they are said to be a carrier or have hemoglobin trait. These individuals are typically asymptomatic, although they may have small red blood cells. However, carriers may be at risk to have children with hemoglobin E/thalassemia (which is similar to thalassemia) or hemoglobin sickle E disease (milder form of sickle cell anemia). Both of these conditions are much more severe than hemoglobin E disease. They are are also inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Hemoglobin E disease ?","completion":"How is hemoglobin E disease diagnosed? Many babies are picked up through state newborn screening programs. A diagnosis is usually made by looking at the red blood cells by doing a Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) test, which is commonly part of a Complete Blood Count (CBC) test. More specialized tests, such as a hemoglobin electrophoresis and iron studies might be done. These tests indicate whether a person has different types of hemoglobin. Genetic testing of the HBB gene can also be done to confirm a diagnosis."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Hemoglobin E disease ?","completion":"How might hemoglobin E disease be treated? Treatment is usually not necessary. Folic acid supplements may be prescribed to help the body produce normal red blood cells and improve symptoms of anemia. People with hemoglobin E disease can expect to lead a normal life."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Juvenile temporal arteritis ?","completion":"Juvenile temporal arteritis is a rare form of vasculitis, a group of conditions that cause inflammation of the blood vessels. Unlike the classic form of temporal arteritis, this condition is generally diagnosed in late childhood or early adulthood and only affects the temporal arteries (located at the lower sides of the skull, directly underneath the temple). Affected people often have no signs or symptoms aside from a painless nodule or lump in the temporal region. The exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown. It generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Juvenile temporal arteritis is often treated with surgical excision and rarely recurs."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Ring chromosome 20 ?","completion":"Ring chromosome 20 is a chromosome abnormality that affects the development and function of the brain. People with ring chromosome 20 often have recurrent seizures or epilepsy. Other symptoms might include intellectual disability, behavioral difficulties, growth delay, short stature, a small head (microcephaly), and characteristic facial features. Ring chromosome 20 is caused by an abnormal chromosome known as a ring chromosome 20 or r(20). A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together. Ring chromosome 20 is usually not inherited. It almost always occurs by chance during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. Treatment for ring chromosome 20 is focused on management of seizures and accommodations for learning."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Ring chromosome 20 ?","completion":"How might ring chromosome 20 be treated? Treatment of ring chromosome 20 is typically focused on management of seizures. The seizures associated with ring chromosome 20 do not generally respond well to medications. The treatment that is successful varies from person to person. Broad spectrum AEDs are usually tried first since they are active against different seizure types. This includes valproate, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate and zonisamide. Success has been reported in some people with a combination of valproate and lamotrigine, but so far no single therapy has worked for everyone. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been tried and a reduction in seizures has been reported in some cases but not in others. This involves implanting a medical device under the skin, similar to a pacemaker that delivers a mild electrical current to the brain via the vagus nerve. The long-term effectiveness of VNS therapy is not yet known. The ketogenic diet, which is high in fat and low in carbohydrate, has been shown to be helpful in other types of epilepsy. However there are no published reports about whether this is successful or not in ring chromosome 20 epilepsy.

Signs and symptoms may include muscle weakness and stiffness, abnormal bone development, joint contractures, short stature, small, fixed facial features, and eye abnormalities (some of which may impair vision). SJS1 can be divided into two subtypes differentiated by severity and age of onset. Type 1A, considered classic SJS, is the most commonly recognized type. Individuals with type 1A typically develop more mild symptoms later in childhood, while individuals with type 1B have symptoms that are more severe and are apparent immediately after birth. SJS1 is caused by mutations in the HSPG2 gene which makes a protein called perlecan. SJS1 is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; however, some cases reported in the medical literature suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Treatment for both type 1A and 1B aims to normalize muscle activity through various methods including massage and stretching, medications such as Botulinum toxin, and surgery. There is a more severe, distinct condition called Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome which is caused by mutations in the LIFR gene.

Schwartz Jampel syndrome type 1 (SJS1) is caused by mutations in the HSPG2 gene. The HSPG2 gene codes for the protein perlecan, which is found in muscle and cartilage. Although the role of the perlecan protein is not fully understood, it is thought to play an essential role in many biological activities such as cell signaling and cellular structure. In SJS1, it is suspected that a disturbance in perlecan function leads to a deficiency of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme involved in breaking down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that sends messages between nerves, leading to muscle contraction. If acetylcholine is not broken down, it may lead to an prolonged muscle contraction or stiffening of the muscles (myotonia)."},{"prompt":"Schwartz Jampel syndrome type 1 inherited ?","completion":"How is Schwartz Jampel syndrome type 1 inherited? The majority of cases of Schwartz Jampel syndrome type 1 (SJS1) are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

Individuals with SJS1 inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). Rarely, cases of SJS1 with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported.

Factor V Leiden is the name of a specific gene mutation in the F5 gene. This gene plays a critical role in the normal formation of blood clots in response to an injury. People can inherit one or two copies of the factor V Leiden gene mutation. Those who inherit one copy are called heterozygotes. People who inherit two copies of the mutation, one from each parent, are called homozygotes. Having the factor V Leiden mutation increases your risk for developing a clot in your legs called a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). It also increases your risk of developing a clot that travels through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism (PE)."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Factor V Leiden thrombophilia ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of factor V Leiden thrombophilia? Individuals affected by factor V Leiden thrombophilia have an increased risk of developing blood clots. The severity of factor V Leiden thrombophilia is extremely variable. Many individuals with the factor V Leiden allele never develop a blood clot. Although most individuals with factor V thrombophilia do not experience their first thrombotic event until adulthood, some have recurrent thromboembolism before age 30 years. The chance a person will develop a blood clot is affected by the number of factor V Leiden mutations, the presence of coexisting genetic abnormalities, and non-genetic risk factors. Non-genetic risk factors include surgery, long periods of not moving (like sitting on a long airplane ride), birth control pills and other female hormones, childbirth within the last 6 months, and traumas or fractures. Individuals who inherit one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation have a fourfold to eightfold increase in the chance of developing a clot. Homozygotes (people who inherit two factor V Leiden mutations) may have up to 80 times the usual risk of developing a blood clot. Considering that the risk of developing an abnormal blood clot averages about 1 in 1,000 per year in the general population, the presence of one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation increases that risk to 4 to 8 in 1,000, and having two copies of the mutation may raise the risk as high as 80 in 1,000. People with factor V Leiden have an increased chance of having a blood clot that forms in large veins in the legs (deep venous thrombosis, or DVT) or a clot that travels through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs (pulmonary embolism, or PE). Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis usually include leg pain, tenderness, swelling, increased warmth or redness in one leg. The symptoms of pulmonary embolism usually include cough, chest pain, shortness of breath or rapid heartbeat or breathing.

Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is caused by a specific mutation in the Factor V gene. Factor V plays a critical role in the formation of blood clots in response to injury. Genes are our bodys instructions for making proteins. The factor V gene instructs the body how to make a protein called coagulation factor V. Coagulation factor V is involved in a series of chemical reactions that hold blood clots together. A molecule called activated protein C (APC) prevents blood clots from growing too large by inactivating factor V."},{"prompt":"Factor V Leiden thrombophilia inherited ?","completion":"How is factor V Leiden inherited? Factor V Leiden is a genetic condition and can be inherited from a parent. It is important to understand that each person inherits two copies of every gene, one from their mother and the other copy from their father. Individuals who inherit one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation from a parent are called heterozygotes. Heterozygotes have a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing the mutated gene to their offspring (and therefore they also have a 50% chance of having a child who does not inherit the gene mutation). People who inherit two copies of the mutation, one from each parent, are called homozygotes. Homozygotes will always pass one copy of the mutated gene to their offspring. If both parents are heterozygotes (carry one factor V Leiden mutation) than they would have a 25% chance of having a child with two factor V Leiden mutations, a 25% chance of having a child with no mutations, and a 50% chance of having a child with one mutation."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Factor V Leiden thrombophilia ?","completion":"How is factor V Leiden thrombophilia diagnosed? No clinical features (signs and/or symptoms) are specific for factor V Leiden thrombophilia. The diagnosis of factor V Leiden thrombophilia requires a coagulation screening test or DNA analysis of F5, the gene for factor V, to identify the specific mutation that causes this condition. The APC (activated protein C) resistance assay, a coagulation screening test, measures the anticoagulant response to APC. This screening test has a sensitivity and specificity for factor V Leiden approaching 100%. The sensitivity of a test is a measure of the test's ability to detect a positive result when someone has the condition, while the specificity is a measure of the test's ability to identify negative results.Targeted mutation analysis (a type of DNA test) of the F5 gene for the Leiden mutation is considered definitive and has a mutation detection frequency of approximately 100%. This means that approximately all individuals who have the factor V Leiden mutation will be detected by this genetic test. It is generally recommended that individuals who test positive by another means should then have the DNA test both for confirmation and to distinguish heterozygotes (individuals with a mutation in one copy of the gene) from homozygotes (individuals with mutations in both copies of the gene)."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Factor V Leiden thrombophilia ?","completion":"How might factor V Leiden be treated? The management of individuals with factor V Leiden depends on the clinical circumstances. People with factor V Leiden who have had a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) are usually treated with blood thinners, or anticoagulants. Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin are given for varying amounts of time depending on the person's situation. It is not usually recommended that people with factor V Leiden be treated lifelong with anticoagulants if they have had only one DVT or PE, unless there are additional risk factors present. Having had a DVT or PE in the past increases a person's risk for developing another one in the future, but having factor V Leiden does not seem to add to the risk of having a second clot. In general, individuals who have factor V Leiden but have never had a blood clot are not routinely treated with an anticoagulant. Rather, these individuals are counseled about reducing or eliminating other factors that may add to one's risk of developing a clot in the future. In addition, these individuals may require temporary treatment with an anticoagulant during periods of particularly high risk, such as major surgery. Factor V Leiden increases the risk of developing a DVT during pregnancy by about seven-fold. Women with factor V Leiden who are planning pregnancy should discuss this with their obstetrician and/or hematologist. Most women with factor V Leiden have normal pregnancies and only require close follow-up during pregnancy. For those with a history of DVT or PE, treatment with an anticoagulant during a subsequent pregnancy can prevent recurrent problems."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Cleft hand absent tibia ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Cleft hand absent tibia?

The subtypes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2, including type 2F, have similar signs and symptoms. Affected individuals usually become symptomatic between the ages of 5 and 25, though onset can range from infancy to after the third decade of life. The most common first symptom is weakness of the feet and ankles, followed by slowly progressive weakness and atrophy of distal muscles in the feet and/or hands. Individuals often have decreased tendon reflexes and mild or no sensory loss. Adults with CMT2 often have bilateral foot drop, symmetric atrophy of muscles below the knee (stork leg appearance) and absent tendon reflexes in the legs. Mild sensory deficits of position, vibration, pain or temperature may occur in the feet, or sensation may be intact. Pain (especially in the feet) is reported by about 20%-40% of affected individuals. Other features that may be associated with CMT2 in a few individuals include hearing impairment; vocal cord or phrenic nerve involvement (which may result in difficulty with speech or breathing); restless legs; and sleep apnea. CMT2 is progressive over many years, but affected individuals often experience long periods without obvious progression. In some individuals, the condition may be so mild that it goes unrecognized.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F (CMT2F) is caused by mutations in the HSPB1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein (heat shock protein beta-1) which helps protect cells under adverse conditions. Heat shock proteins appear to be involved in activities such as cell movement, stabilizing the cell's framework, folding and stabilizing new proteins, repairing damaged proteins, and muscle contraction. Heat shock protein beta-1 is particularly abundant in nerve and muscle cells. In nerve cells, it helps to organize a network of threads that maintain the diameter of axons (neurofilaments), which are needed to transmit nerve impulses efficiently. It is unclear exactly how HSPB1 mutations lead to the axon abnormalities characteristic of CMT2F. Researchers suggest that mutations lead to an altered protein which clusters together and interferes with nerve cell function. Another possibility is that the altered protein disrupts the assembly of neurofilaments, which in turn may impair the transmission of nerve impulses."},{"prompt":"CharcotMarieTooth disease type 2F inherited ?","completion":"How is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F inherited? Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that only one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell must have a mutation for an individual to be affected. Individuals inherit two copies of each gene - one copy from each parent. Typically, an individual is affected because they inherited a mutated copy of the gene from each parent. Individuals with one mutated copy of the gene (such as an unaffected parent of an affected individual) are referred to as carriers; carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?","completion":"Who might consider genetic carrier testing for a family history of metachromatic leukodystrophy? If someone has a family history of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) or someone is known to be a carrier for MLD, individuals who are biologically related to the affected individual or carrier are at risk to be a carrier. Generally speaking, the more closely related an individual is to the affected individual or carrier, the greater the chance for that person to be a carrier. Prior to genetic testing, the chance to be a carrier for some biological relatives of an affected individual are as follows: Parent of affected individual: assumed to be 100% (called an obligate carrier) Unaffected sibling of affected individual: 2 in 3 (~66.6%) Aunt or uncle of affected individual: 1 in 2 (50%) First cousin of affected individual: 1 in 4 (25%) If someone has carrier testing and is found to be negative (not a carrier), that person's children are typically assumed to be negative also.

In acquired pili torti, treatment involves stopping the exposure to the causative agent (e.g., to oral retinoids) or condition (e.g., improving diet). There is no specific treatment for the inherited form of pili torti. It may improve spontaneously after puberty. If pili torti is detected, further evaluation to investigate possible neurological disorders, problems with hair, teeth or nails (ectodermal disturbances) and hearing loss is mandatory. It is generally recommended that people with pili torti try to avoid trauma to the hair. Suggestions include, sleeping on a satin pillowcase, avoiding excessive grooming, braiding, heat treatments, dying and coloring, reducing exposure to sunlight (wear a hat), using gentle shampoos diluted in warm water, adding conditioner to freshly washed hair, avoiding use of a hair dryer (or using it on cool setting), and avoiding oral retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin, acitretin) if possible.

In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."},{"prompt":"What causes Liddle syndrome ?","completion":"What causes Liddle syndrome? Liddle syndrome is caused by mutations (changes) in either of two genes: SCNN1B and SCNN1G . The SCNN1B gene provides instructions for making one piece (the beta subunit) of protein complexes called epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). The SCNN1G gene provides instructions for making a different piece (the gamma subunit) of ENaCs. These channels are found at the surface of certain cells called epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells. Mutations in the SCNN1B and SCNN1G genes associated with Liddle syndrome affect an important region of the protein involved in signaling for its breakdown (degradation). As a result of the mutations, the protein is not tagged for degradation, and more ENaC channels remain at the cell's surface. The increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium, which leads to hypertension. Removal of potassium from the blood is linked with reabsorption of sodium into the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia."},{"prompt":"Liddle syndrome inherited ?","completion":"How is Liddle syndrome inherited? Liddle syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that only one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.

Individuals with an autosomal dominant condition have a 50% (1 in 2) risk to pass the mutated copy of the gene on to each of his/her children."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Liddle syndrome ?","completion":"How is Liddle syndrome diagnosed? A diagnosis of Liddle syndrome may first be suspected by the detection of early-onset hypertension (high blood pressure), especially in the presence of family history. The diagnosis may then be confirmed by special blood and urine tests which show hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), decreased or normal plasma levels of renin and aldosterone, metabolic alkalosis with high sodium plasma levels, and low rates of urinary excretion of sodium and aldosterone with high rates of urinary potassium excretion. The diagnosis can be further confirmed by genetic testing."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Liddle syndrome ?","completion":"How might Liddle syndrome be treated? Treatment for Liddle syndrome includes following a low sodium diet as well as taking potassium-sparing diuretics, which reduce blood pressure and correct hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

The term has also been applied to those that show \\"borderline\\" behavior, intermediate between entirely benign hemangiomas and highly malignant angiosarcomas. Hemangioendotheliomas are caused by abnormal growth of blood vessel cells, although the exact underlying cause for the abnormal growth is unknown. They can also develop in an organ, such as the liver or lung. They usually grow slowly and can sometimes spread to other tissues in the body (metastasize). Examples of types of hemangioendotheliomas include spindle cell hemangioma; papillary intralymphatic (Dabska tumor); retiform; kaposiform; epithelioid; pseudomyogenic (epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma); and composite. Treatment depends on the type of hemangioendothelioma present but typically includes surgical excision (removal)."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Hemangioendothelioma ?","completion":"How might hemangioendothelioma be treated? Treatment for hemangioendothelioma may depend on the type of hemangioendothelioma present in the affected individual and the risk of recurrence or metastases. In most reported cases, surgical excision (removal) of the mass has been the only treatment. For spindle cell hemangioma, simple excision is reportedly curative; however, new growths develop in adjacent skin and soft tissues in 60% of affected individuals. For individuals with papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA), excision of the involved lymph nodes, as well as the mass, has been recommended. Surgical excision is reportedly also the usual treatment for individuals with retiform hemangioendothelioma (although local recurrence with this type is common), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and composite hemangioendothelioma (with the exception of 1 case treated with interferon). Most individuals with pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma have been treated with simple excision, but a few individuals have also received post-surgical radiotherapy (RT). With regard to kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, some large lesions cannot be completely removed and may cause fatal complications due to the associated KasabachMerritt syndrome. In these cases, several medical therapies have been used, including systemic corticosteroids; alfa interferon; RT; embolization; and several other therapies, both alone and in various combinations. A study by Scott et al published in 2012 in the American Journal of Clinical Oncology evaluated the effectiveness of RT as either an alternative or adjunct to surgery. The authors stated that the effectiveness of definitive RT in the treatment of hemangioendothelioma in their study implies that radiation may be an acceptable alternative when surgical resection will compromise function or cosmetic result. They concluded that with no local recurrences and minimal risk of toxicity, their long-term data suggest that RT offers a highly effective management option for this disease."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia ?","completion":"Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) is a condition where a fetus or newborn experiences severe thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

Pulsed dye laser (PDL) remains the treatment of choice for the majority of children with a port-wine stain (PWS). Laser treatment of port-wine stains may produce good cosmetic results, with a low incidence of adverse skin changes and other side effects. A major benefit of laser treatment for a PWS is that it can help to minimize psychological problems associated with the social consequences of having a PWS. It has been shown that large facial port-wine stains are associated with an increase in mood and social problems in children older than 10 years of age.Most experts agree that there is little risk associated with the use of PDL in a child with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), provided that anticonvulsant therapy is maintained and that adequate care is taken. The level of pain associated with laser treatment varies. Management of anesthesia should be carefully planned to minimize the potential for secondary effects. Few children with SWS achieve complete clearance of their PWS with laser treatment; PDL does have limitations when large areas or dermatomal patterns are involved."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ?","completion":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1) is an inherited condition that causes tumors of the endocrine system (the body's network of hormone-producing glands).

Management for MEN1 usually includes regular screening to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of endocrine tumors."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1? Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1) is characterized primarily by several different types of endocrine tumors. People affected by MEN1 typically develop tumors of the parathyroid gland, the pituitary gland, and the pancreas, although other glands may be involved as well. These tumors are often \\"functional\\" and secrete excess hormones, which causes many of the different signs and symptoms of the condition. A variety of non-endocrine tumors are also found in MEN1, including lipomas (fatty tumors); and tumors of the skin or the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Signs and symptoms of MEN1 vary and largely depend on which endocrine glands are affected: Parathyroid tumors are present in 90% of people with MEN1 by age 20-25 years and may cause fatigue, depression, weight loss, constipation, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, kidney stones, fragile bones, and hypertension. Pituitary tumors can lead to headaches, vision problems, nausea and vomiting. In women, menstrual periods may become irregular or stop completely. Men may have decreased fertility, diminished sexual desire, and/or erectile dysfunction. Stomach, bowel or pancreas (also called the gastro-entero-pancreatic, or GEP tract) tumors can cause high blood sugar, weight loss, glossitis, anemia, diarrhea, blood clots, and skin rash. Adrenal tumors can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the type of hormones they secrete, including high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, panic attacks, headaches, diabetes, abdominal pain, weakness, excessive hair growth, and stretch marks. Carcinoid tumors (slow-growing tumors that usually begin in the lining of the lungs or the digestive tract can cause flushing of the face and upper chest; diarrhea; and trouble breathing. The tumors that develop in MEN1 are often benign; however, in some cases, they can become malignant (cancerous).

Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1) is caused by mutations in the MEN1 gene. MEN1 is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it encodes a protein that helps keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Changes (mutations) in MEN1 result in a defective protein that is unable to carry out its normal role. This leads to the development of the many different types of tumors found in MEN1."},{"prompt":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 inherited ?","completion":"How is multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 inherited? Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with MEN1 has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ?","completion":"Is genetic testing available for multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1? Yes, genetic testing is available for MEN1, the gene known to cause multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1). Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. How is multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 diagnosed? A diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1) is based on the presence of two of the following endocrine tumors: parathyroid tumors; pituitary tumors; and/or stomach, bowel or pancreas (also called the gastro-entero-pancreatic, or GEP tract) tumors. People with only one of the tumors may also receive a diagnosis of MEN1 if they have other family members with the condition. Identification of a change (mutation) in the MEN1 gene can be used to confirm the diagnosis. In addition to a complete physical exam and medical history, laboratory tests that evaluate the levels of certain hormones in the blood or urine are often used detect the different types of tumors found in MEN1. Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan), and/or endoscopic ultrasound may be recommended to confirm the location and size of the tumors. Some people may also need a biopsy of the tumor to confirm the diagnosis."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ?","completion":"How might multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 be treated? People with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1) are usually managed with regular screening to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of endocrine tumors. This screening begins in early childhood and continues for life. Recommended screening includes specific types of imaging studies every 3-5 years: Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) begining at age 5. Abdominal computed tomography (CT scan) or abdominal MRI scan beginning at age 20. Annual blood tests are also recommended, which evaluate the levels of certain substances that can be elevated if an MEN1-associated tumor is present: Prolactin concentrations, which can be used to screen for pituitary tumors, are measured beginning at age 5. Calcium concentrations, which can be used to screen for parathyroid tumors, are measured beginning at age 8. Gastrin concentrations, which can be used to screen for gastrinomas (a specific type of gastro-entero-pancreatic tract tumor) are measured beginning at age 20. When a tumor is detected through screening, the best treatment options depend on many factors, including the size, location, and type of tumor; and whether or not the tumor is \\"functional\\" (releasing hormones). Many tumors are treated with surgery. If a tumor is functional, removal of the affected endocrine gland often resolves health problems that may be present as a result of elevated hormones. In some cases, functional tumors can be treated with medications that block the function or lower the levels of the overproduced hormone. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be used to to shrink or destroy tumors."},{"prompt":"What is (are) BeareStevenson cutis gyrata syndrome ?","completion":"Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by skin abnormalities (cutis gyrata, which causes a furrowed and wrinkled appearance, and acanthosis nigricans) and the premature fusion of certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis).

The disorder primarily affects the skin, hair, and skeletal system. Symptoms usually show up by childhood or adolescence. Like people with other types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, individuals with the progeroid form have unusually flexible joints, loose elastic skin, and easy scarring. Features that are unique to this type include sparse scalp hair and eyebrows, and loose elastic skin on the face; these features cause affected individuals to look older than their age. Additional symptoms may include bone weakness, weak muscle tone, mild intellectual disability, and delayed growth in affected children. The progeroid type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is caused by mutations in the B4GALT7 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of EhlersDanlos syndrome, progeroid type ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, progeroid type? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome refers to a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by stretchy or kneadable skin, double jointedness, and delayed healing of skin wounds. In addition to these traits, individuals with the progeroid type have thin curly hair, sparse eyebrows and eyelashes, loose elastic skin on the face, and may also have uneven facial features. Although progeroid means \\"appearance similar to old age\\", individuals with progeroid Ehlers-Danlos syndrome do not actually have premature aging and are not expected to have a shortened life span. Other symptoms may include poor muscle tone, fragile bones from low bone mineral density, abnormal teeth, and infection of gums around the teeth. Children who are affected may have delayed growth, which can result in short stature as an adult (less than 152cm). Mild intellectual disabilities or learning disabilities have also been associated with this disorder. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, progeroid type.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type is caused by changes (mutations) in both of an individual's copies of the B4GALT7 gene, which is located on chromosome 5. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in the production of collagen (the main protein in connective tissue). When not enough enzyme is made by the B4GALT7 genes, collagen is not formed correctly in connective tissue. The symptoms of the disorder are caused by weak connective tissue. Researchers are still studying exactly how mutations in the B4GALT7 gene cause the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type."},{"prompt":"EhlersDanlos syndrome, progeroid type inherited ?","completion":"How is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type inherited? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that an individual must have two non-functional copies of the B4GALT7 gene to be affected with the condition. One copy is inherited from each parent. If an individual has only one non-functional B4GALT7 gene (such as each parent), he or she is a \\"carrier\\". Carriers do not typically show any signs or symptoms of a recessive condition. When two carriers for a recessive condition have children, with each pregnancy there is a 25% (1 in 4) risk for the child to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) risk for the child to be a carrier (like each parent) and a 25% risk that the child will be unaffected and also not be a carrier. An individual with a recessive condition will generally have unaffected children, except in the rare circumstance where his or her partner is a carrier of a nonfunctional B4GALT7 gene."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for EhlersDanlos syndrome, progeroid type ?","completion":"How might Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type be treated? Individuals with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome progeroid type can benefit from a variety of treatments depending on their symptoms. Affected children with weak muscle tone and delayed development might benefit from physiotherapy to improve muscle strength and coordination. Affected individuals with joint pain might benefit from anti-inflammatory drugs. Lifestyle changes or precautions during exercise or intense physical activity may be advised to reduce the chance of accidents to the skin and bone. It is recommended that affected individuals discuss treatment options with their healthcare provider."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Gray platelet syndrome ?","completion":"Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by platelets that have a gray appearance, severe thrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis, and splenomegaly. About 60 cases from various populations around the world have been described in the literature to date. GPS results from the absence or reduction of alpha-granules in platelets, which store proteins that promote platelet adhesiveness and wound healing when secreted during an injury.

Historically, congenital muscular dystrophies were classified in two broad groups: Classic CMD (which included the Merosin-deficient CMD and the Merosin-positive CMD) and the CMD with central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities (Fukuyama CMD, muscle-eye-brain disease and Walker-Warburg syndrome). Therefore, merosin-positive congenital muscle dystrophy (CMD) is now considered an old term which refers to a group of diseases without structural brain abnormalities that are caused by a variety of gene mutations, resulting in protein defects that do not affect the merosin protein. It usually has a milder phenotype than the merosin-negative CMD dystrophy group and includes, among others: Classic CMD without distinguishing features Rigid spine syndrome associated with mutations in the selenoprotein N1 gene (SEPN1) CMD with hyperextensible distal joints (Ullrich type) CMD with intellectual disability or sensory abnormalities. The pattern of muscle weakness and wasting in the patients within this group of congenital muscular dystrophy conditions is worse in the proximal upper limb-girdle and trunk muscles. Lower limb muscles may be mildly involved.

PPHP causes joints and other soft tissues in the body to harden. It also affects how bones are formed. As a result, PPHP can cause bone, joint, and nerve damage, and this damage can cause lasting pain. Some people with PPHP (10%) also have learning disability. PHPP is caused by mutations in the GNAS gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This condition is usually inherited from the father (genomic imprinting). PPHP is genetically related to pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP-1a). Signs and symptoms are similar, however people with PPHP do not show resistance to parathyroid hormone while people with PHP-1a do. Obesity is characteristic for PHP-1a and may be severe, while obesity is less prominent and may be absent among people with PPHP. Both PHP-1a and PPHP are caused by mutations that affect the function of the GNAS gene.

Boys with Arts syndrome have sensorineural hearing loss, which is a complete or almost complete loss of hearing caused by abnormalities in the inner ear. Other features include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), developmental delay, and intellectual disability. In early childhood, affected boys develop vision loss caused by degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy). They also experience loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy). Boys with Arts syndrome also have problems with their immune system that lead to recurrent infections, especially involving the respiratory system. Because of these infections and their complications, affected boys often do not survive past early childhood. Females can also be affected by Arts syndrome, but they typically have much milder symptoms. In some cases, hearing loss that begins in adulthood may be the only symptom.

This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1, or PRPP synthetase 1. This enzyme is involved in producing purines and pyrimidines, the building blocks of DNA, RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell. The PRPS1 mutations that cause Arts syndrome replace one protein building block (amino acid) with another amino acid in the PRPP synthetase 1 enzyme. The resulting enzyme is likely unstable, compromising its ability to perform its normal function. The disruption of purine and pyrimidine production may impair energy storage and transport in cells. Impairment of these processes may have a particularly severe effect on tissues that require a large amount of energy, such as the nervous system and the immune system, resulting in the neurological problems and immune dysfunction characteristic of Arts syndrome."},{"prompt":"Arts syndrome inherited ?","completion":"How is Arts syndrome inherited? Arts syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only 1 X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell sometimes causes the disorder. Females with one copy of the mutated gene are typically much less severely affected.by Arts syndrome than males. In many cases, they do not experience any symptoms. In the small number of Arts syndrome cases that have been identified, affected individuals have inherited the mutation from a mother who carries an altered copy of the PRPS1 gene."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Fibrolamellar carcinoma ?","completion":"Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare form of liver cancer which is generally diagnosed in adolescents and young adults (before age 40).

The exact underlying cause of fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is poorly understood. Other forms of liver cancer are often associated with liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) which may be caused by alcohol abuse; autoimmune diseases of the liver; Hepatitis B or C viral infections; chronic inflammation of the liver; and/or hemochromatosis. However, FLC typically occurs in the absence of underlying liver inflammation or scarring; thus, specific risk factors for this condition remain unidentified. Recent research suggests that a deletion on chromosome 19 may play a key role in the formation of FLC.

Mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene cause pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. The ALDH7A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called -aminoadipic semialdehyde (-AASA) dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of the protein building block (amino acid) lysine in the brain. When antiquitin is deficient, a molecule that interferes with vitamin B6 function builds up in various tissues. Pyridoxine plays a role in many processes in the body, such as the breakdown of amino acids and the productions of chemicals that transmit signals in the brain (neurotransmitters). It is unclear how a lack of pyridoxine causes the seizures that are characteristic of this condition. Some individuals with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy do not have identified mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Pyridoxinedependent epilepsy ?","completion":"How might pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy be treated? Anticonvulsant drugs, which are usually given to control seizures, are ineffective in people with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. Instead, people with this type of seizure are medically treated with large daily doses of pyridoxine (a type of vitamin B6 found in food). Recent studies have focused on using a lysine-restricted diet in addition to pyridoxine. Preliminary results suggest that this treatment has the potential to help control seizures and improve developmental outcomes in children with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Ankylosing spondylitis ?","completion":"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of chronic, inflammatory arthritis that mainly affects the spine. It usually begins with inflammation of the joints between the pelvic bones and spine, gradually spreading to the joints between the vertebrae. Signs and symptoms usually begin in adolescence or early adulthood and may include back pain and stiffness. Back movement gradually becomes more limited as the vertebrae fuse together. The condition may also affect the shoulders; ribs; hips; knees; and feet; as well as the eyes; bowel; and very rarely, the heart and lungs. AS is likely caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors; variations in several genes are thought to affect the risk to develop AS. In most cases, treatment involves exercise and medications to relieve pain and inflammation."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Ankylosing spondylitis ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Ankylosing spondylitis? Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) primarily affects the spine, but may affect other parts of the body too. Signs and symptoms usually begin in adolescence or early adulthood and include back pain and stiffness. Back movement gradually becomes more limited over time as the vertebrae fuse together. Many affected people have mild back pain that comes and goes; others have severe, chronic pain. In very severe cases, the rib cage may become stiffened, making it difficult to breathe deeply. In some people, the condition involves other areas of the body, such as the shoulders, hips, knees, and/or the small joints of the hands and feet. It may affect various places where tendons and ligaments attach to the bones. Sometimes it can affect other organs including the eyes, and very rarely, the heart and lungs. Episodes of eye inflammation may cause eye pain and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Neurological complications of AS may include an inability to control urination and bowel movements (incontinence), and the absence of normal reflexes in the ankles due to pressure on the lower portion of the spinal cord (cauda equina).

Although ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can affect more than one person in a family, it is not a purely genetic disease. While genes seem to play a role, the exact cause of AS is not known. It is considered to be multifactorial, which means that multiple genetic and environmental factors likely interact to affect a person's risk to develop AS. Most of these factors have not been identified. Inheriting a genetic variation that has been associated with AS does not mean a person will develop AS. Currently, it is not possible to predict the exact likelihood that the children of an affected person will develop the disease.

The main goal of treatment for people with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is to maximize long-term quality of life. This may involve easing symptoms of pain and stiffness; retaining function; preventing complications (such as contractures); and minimizing the effects of associated conditions. Education, exercise, and medications are all very important in managing AS. An exercise program is recommended for all affected people, and some may need individual physical therapy. Affected people are encouraged to speak with their health care provider before instituting any changes to an exercise regime. Video demonstrations of exercises tailored for ankylosing spondylitis are available for viewing through the National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society in the UK. Medications may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); pain relievers; sulfasalazine; and anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs. Steroid injections may be helpful for some people. Most people don't need surgery, but it may be indicated when there is severe, persistent pain or severe limitation in mobility and quality of life. Smoking creates additional problems for people with AS, so affected people who smoke should quit.

Removing the source of irritation may cause the condition to go away, but surgery to remove the sore(s) may be necessary in some cases."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Leukoplakia ?","completion":"What are the early signs of cancer in vulvar leukoplakia? Early signs of cancer may not be apparent. The clinical appearance of leukoplakia does not generally correlate with its appearance when examined under a microscope. For example, the lesion may appear unchanged for a period of time but may actually show changes when looked at under a microscope. Therefore, a biopsy is typically recommended in all cases to determine which lesions are precancerous. Small lesions may be biopsied and just followed periodically if it is shown to remain benign. However, those that show precancerous or cancerous features should be removed."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Leukoplakia ?","completion":"How might leukoplakia be treated? For most people, removing the source of irritation is important and often causes the lesion to disappear. For example, if tobacco use is thought to be the cause, stopping tobacco use usually clears the condition. Dental causes such as rough teeth or fillings should be treated as soon as possible. When this is not effective or if the lesions show early signs of cancer, treatment may include removing the patches. The lesion is usually removed in the health care provider's office using local anesthesia. Leukoplakia on the vulva is treated in the same way as oral lesions. Recurrences are common, so follow-up visits with a physician are recommended."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Dwarfism, mental retardation and eye abnormality ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Dwarfism, mental retardation and eye abnormality?

Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having one changed (mutated) copy of ATXN2 (the responsible gene) in each cell is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the condition. The ATXN2 gene mutations that cause SCA2 involve a DNA sequence called a 'CAG trinucleotide repeat.' It is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (CAG stands for cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. The CAG sequence is normally repeated about 22 times in the gene, but it can be repeated up to 31 times without causing health problems. SCA2 develops in people who have 32 or more CAG repeats in the ATXN2 gene. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene (with too many repeats) from an affected parent. However, in some cases, an affected person does not have an affected parent. People with an increased number of CAG repeats who don't develop SCA2 are still at risk of having children who will develop the disorder. This is because as the gene is passed down from parent to child, the number of CAG repeats often increases. In general, the more repeats a person has, the earlier symptoms begin. This phenomenon is called anticipation. People with 32 or 33 repeats tend to develop symptoms in late adulthood, while people with more than 45 repeats often have symptoms by their teens. For some reason, the number of repeats tend to increase more when the gene is inherited from a person's father than when inherited from a person's mother. Each child of an affected person has a 50% chance of inheriting the CAG repeat expansion."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 ?","completion":"Is genetic testing available for spinocerebellar ataxia 2? Yes. Molecular genetic testing (analysis of DNA) is needed for a diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2). This testing detects abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the ATXN2 gene. Affected people (or people who will later develop symptoms of SCA2) have a copy of the ATXN2 gene that has 33 or more CAG repeats. This testing detects nearly 100% of cases of SCA2. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the labs that offer genetic testing for SCA2. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Therefore, patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 ?","completion":"How might spinocerebellar ataxia 2 be treated? Treatment of spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is supportive and aims to help the affected person maintain their independence and avoid injury. It is recommended that people with SCA2 remain physically active, maintain a healthy weight, use adaptive equipment as needed, and avoid alcohol and medications that affect cerebellar function. Adaptive equipment may include canes or other devices to help with walking and mobility. People with SCA2 may develop difficulty speaking and may need to use computerized devices or writing pads to help with communication. Levodopa may be prescribed to help with some of the movement problems (e.g., rigidity and tremor), and magnesium may improve muscle cramping."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Ulna hypoplasia with mental retardation ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Ulna hypoplasia with mental retardation?

Normal chromosomes have one long (q) arm and one short (p) arm, but isochromosomes have either two q arms or two p arms. Isochromosome 12p is a version of chromosome 12 made up of two p arms. Cells normally have two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from each parent. In people with Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome, cells have the two usual copies of chromosome 12, but some cells also have the isochromosome 12p. These cells have a total of four copies of all the genes on the p arm of chromosome 12. The extra genetic material from the isochromosome disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of this disorder. Although Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome is usually caused by an isochromosome 12p, other, more complex chromosomal changes involving chromosome 12 are responsible for the disorder in rare cases."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of PallisterKillian mosaic syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome?

Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person but may include medications and/or surgery."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Schwannomatosis ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Schwannomatosis? Signs and symptoms of the schwannomatosis often develop during adulthood between ages 25 and 30. Affected people generally have multiple schwannomas, which are benign tumors of the nervous system. In schwannomatosis, these tumors can grow along any nerve in the body, although they are less common on the vestibular nerve (vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas). People with vestibular schwannomas, especially those with tumors affecting the vestibular nerve on both sides of the head (bilateral), may have neurofibromatosis type 2 instead. The signs and symptoms associated with schwannomatosis vary based on the size and location of the schwannomas. The most common symptom is chronic pain, which can develop as a growing schwannoma presses on nerves or surrounding tissues. Some people may develop a mass if the schwannomas is located just beneath the skin. Others can experience neurological symptoms such as numbness; tingling; and/or weakness in the fingers and toes.

Some cases of schwannomatosis are caused by changes (mutations) in the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 genes. SMARCB1 and LZTR1 are tumor suppressor genes, which means that they encode a protein that stops cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in these genes result in abnormal proteins that are unable to carry out their normal roles. This contributes to the development of the many different types of tumors found in schwannomatosis. When schwannomatosis is caused by a mutation in SMARCB1 or LZTR1, the affected person is typically born with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell and is, therefore, genetically predisposed to develop the tumors associated with the condition. For a tumor to form, two copies of the gene must be altered. The mutation in the second copy of the gene is considered a somatic mutation because it occurs during a person's lifetime and is not inherited. In affected people without a mutation in SMARCB1 or LZTR1, the underlying cause of the condition is unknown."},{"prompt":"Schwannomatosis inherited ?","completion":"Is schwannomatosis inherited? Approximately 15% percent of all schwannomatosis cases are thought to be inherited. In these cases, the condition is thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with highly variable expressivity and reduced penetrance. This means that a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell to have a genetic predisposition to the tumors associated with schwannomatosis. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

A diagnosis of schwannomatosis is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms, especially if there are other family members with the condition. Additional testing can then be ordered to further support the diagnosis and rule out other conditions with similar features (namely, neurofibromatosis type 2). This may include: Tumor pathology confirming that the growths are, in fact, schwannomas Imaging studies, such as an MRI examining the vestibular nerve. It is important to rule out the presence of bilateral (affecting both sides) vestibular schwannomas which would be suggestive of neurofibromatosis type 2 rather than schwannomatosis Genetic testing for a change (mutation) in the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 genes.

Usher syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a person must have a change (mutation) in both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell to have Usher syndrome. One mutated copy is typically inherited from each parent, who are each referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition usually do not have any signs or symptoms. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to not be a carrier and not be affected."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Split hand split foot malformation autosomal recessive ?","completion":"Split hand foot malformation (SHFM) is a type of birth defect that consists of missing digits (fingers and/or toes), a deep cleft down the center of the hand or foot, and fusion of remaining digits. The severity of this condition varies widely among affected individuals. SHFM is sometimes called ectrodactyly; however, this is a nonspecific term used to describe missing digits. SHFM may occur by itself (isolated) or it may be part of a syndrome with abnormalities in other parts of the body. At least six different forms of isolated SHFM have been described. Each type is associated with a different underlying genetic cause. SHFM1 has been linked to chromosome 7, and SHFM2 is linked to the X chromosome. SHFM3 is caused by a duplication of chromosome 10 at position 10q24. Changes (mutations) in the TP63 gene cause SHFM4. SHFM5 is linked to chromosome 2, and SHFM6 is caused by mutations in the WNT10B gene. SHFM may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Woodhouse Sakati syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Woodhouse Sakati syndrome?

Women with catamenial pneumothorax have recurrent episodes of pneumothorax that occur within 72 hours before or after the start of menstruation. The exact cause of catamenial pneumothorax is unknown and several theories have been proposed. Many cases are associated with the abnormal development of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus (endometriosis). Some believe that catamenial pneumothorax is the most common form of thoracic endometriosis (a condition in which the endometrial tissue grows in or around the lungs).

Females are generally only affected if they have two gene mutations (they have two X chromosomes), although some females may rarely have a mild form of the condition if they only inherit one mutation. A woman with an X-linked recessive condition will pass the mutation on to all of her sons and daughters.

The management of aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp is controversial.; both surgical and conservative treatment modalities have their proponents and opponents. The decision to use medical, surgical, or both forms of therapy in aplasia cutis congenita depends primarily on the size, depth, and location of the skin defect. Local therapy includes gentle cleansing and the application of bland ointment or silver sulfadiazine ointment to keep the area moist. Antibiotics may be utilized if overt signs of infection are noted. In many cases, other treatment is not necessary because the erosions and the ulcerations almost always heal on their own. Recently, a variety of specialized dressing materials have been developed and used. Surgical repair is not usually indicated if the defect is small. Recovery is generally uneventful, with gradual epithelialization and formation of a hairless, atrophic scar over several weeks. Small underlying bony defects usually close spontaneously during the first year of life. Surgical repair of large or multiple scalp defects may require excision with primary closure, if feasible, or the use of tissue expanders and rotation of a flap to fill the defect.

The exact, underlying cause of systemic sclerosis is unknown. The cause appears to involve some injury to the cells that line blood vessels, resulting in excessive activation of dermal connective tissue cells, called fibroblasts. Fibroblasts normally produce collagen and other proteins. Build-up of collagen in the skin and other organs causes the signs and symptoms of the condition. It is suspected that scleroderma may develop from a variety of factors, which may include: Abnormal immune or inflammatory activity Genetic susceptibility: while no specific genes are thought to cause scleroderma, certain genes (or combination of genes) may increase a person's risk to be affected. However, the condition is not passed directly from parents to children. Environmental triggers: suspected triggers may include infections; injury; drugs (e.g. vitamin K, cocaine, penicillamine, appetite suppressants and some chemotherapeutic agents); and chemicals (e.g. silica, organic solvents, pesticides, aliphatic hydrocarbons and epoxy resin). Hormones: because women develop scleroderma more often than men, researchers suspect that hormones may play a role. However, the role of female hormones has not been proven. Widespread scleroderma can also occur in association with other autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and polymyositis."},{"prompt":"Systemic scleroderma inherited ?","completion":"Is systemic scleroderma inherited? Most cases of systemic scleroderma are sporadic and are not inherited. This means the condition typically occurs in people with no history of the condition in their family. Some people with systemic scleroderma have relatives with other autoimmune disorders, and a few cases of the condition have been reported to run in families. However, the condition is not caused by a single gene that is passed on to offspring. Multiple genetic and environmental factors likely interact to put someone at an increased risk to develop the condition."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Systemic scleroderma ?","completion":"Is genetic testing available for systemic scleroderma? Because systemic scleroderma is not caused by a mutation in any one specific gene, clinical genetic testing to confirm a diagnosis or identify a \\"carrier\\" is not currently available.

SCA11 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The rate of de novo mutations is not known. Each child of an individual with SCA11 has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal diagnosis for at-risk pregnancies is possible if the diagnosis has been confirmed by molecular genetic testing in a parent. Each child of an individual with SCA11 has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Genetic testing of adults who do not have any symptoms but are at-risk of having inherited the mutation is possible. However, testing is not useful in predicting age of onset, severity, type of symptoms, or rate of progression in individuals who do not have any symptom.

The seizures of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy often occur when people first awaken in the morning. Seizures can be triggered by lack of sleep, extreme fatigue, stress, or alcohol consumption. Onset typically occurs around adolesence in otherwise healthy children. The exact cause of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy remains unknown, but genetics likely plays a role. Although patients usually require lifelong treatment with anticonvulsants, their overall prognosis is generally good."},{"prompt":"What causes Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ?","completion":"What causes juvenile myoclonic epilepsy? The exact cause of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy remains unknown. It is not associated with conditions such as head trauma, brain tumor, or encephalitis. Several families have specific mutations in various genes and a complex mode of inheritance. In individuals with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, symptoms can be precipitated by: Sleep deprivation Psychological stress Alcohol and drug use Noncompliance of medication Photic stimulation Menses Time of day - Usually mornings"},{"prompt":"Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy inherited ?","completion":"Is juvenile myoclonic epilepsy inherited? If I have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, will my children also have it? Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is an inherited disorder (about a third of patients with this condition have a positive family history of epilepsy), but the exact mode of inheritance is not clear. A number of studies have indicated that juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is an autosomal dominant condition (i.e. 50% risk of inheritance). However, it exhibits incomplete penetrance, which means that some individuals who inherit the juvenile myoclonic epilepsy gene or genes do not express clinical juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The children of these individuals who have the gene but do not exhibit symptoms may still inherit the genes and express clinically observable disease. Due to the complex nature of inheritance with this condition, you may benefit from consulting with a genetics professional. This type of healthcare provider can provide you with additional information about diagnosis, natural history, treatment, mode of inheritance, and genetic risks to other family members.

Symptoms include either variable changes in behavior (e.g., impulsive, bored, listless, lack of social contact, lack of empathy, distractibility, blunted emotions, compulsive behavior, decreased energy and motivation) or problems with language (e.g., difficulty making or understanding speech). Spatial skills and memory remain intact. There is a strong genetic component to the disease; it often runs in families. There is no cure for frontotemporal dementia at this time, as a result treatment remains supportive. Although the name and classification of FTD has been a topic of discussion for over a century, the current classification of the syndrome groups together Picks disease, primary progressive aphasia, and semantic dementia as FTD.

Treatment for collagenous colitis varies depending on the symptoms and severity in each affected individual. In some cases the condition may resolve on its own (spontaneous remission), although most people continue to have ongoing or occasional diarrhea. Dietary changes are usually tried first to alleviate symptoms. These changes may include a reduced-fat diet, eliminating foods that contain caffeine and lactose, and avoiding over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or aspirin. If these changes alone are not enough, medications can be used to help control symptoms. However, the response rate to various types of medication reportedly varies. Prescription anti-inflammatory medications such as mesalamine and sulfasalazine may help reduce swelling. Steroids including budesonide and prednisone can be used reduce inflammation, but they are usually only used to control sudden attacks of diarrhea. Long-term use of steroids is typically avoided because of unwanted side effects. Anti-diarrheal medications such as bismuth subsalicylate, diphenoxylate with atropine, and loperamide can offer short-term relief. Immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine help to reduce inflammation but are rarely needed. In extreme cases where the condition does not respond to medications, surgery to remove all or part of the colon may be necessary. However, surgery is rarely recommended."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Spinocerebellar ataxia 12 ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Spinocerebellar ataxia 12?

Primary or congenital Chiari malformations are caused by structural defects in the brain and spinal cord that occur during fetal development. The underlying cause of the structural defects are not completely understood, but may involve genetic mutations or lack of proper vitamins or nutrients in the maternal diet. Less frequently, Chiari malformation type 1 is acquired after birth. Causes of acquired Chiari malformation type 1 involve the excessive draining of spinal fluid from the lumbar or thoracic areas of the spine as a result of injury, exposure to harmful substances, or infection. Click here to view a diagram of the spine."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Chiari malformation type 1 ?","completion":"How might Chiari malformation type 1 be treated? Some individuals with Chiari malformation type 1 are asymptomatic and do not require treatment. Individuals who have minimal symptoms, without syringomyelia, can typically be treated conservatively. Mild neck pain and headaches can usually be treated with pain medications, muscle relaxants, and the occasional use of a soft collar. Individuals with more severe symptoms may be in need of surgery. Surgery is the only treatment available to correct functional disturbances or halt the progression of damage to the central nervous system. The goals of surgical treatment are decompression of the point where the skull meets the spine (the cervicomedullary junction) and restoration of normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the region of the foramen magnum (the hole in the bottom of the skull where the spinal cord passes to connect to the brain). Prognosis after surgery for the condition is generally good and typically depends on the extent of neurological deficits that were present before the surgery.

Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by mutations in the PABPN1 gene. The PABPN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is active (expressed) throughout the body. In cells, the PABPN1 protein plays an important role in processing molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which serve as genetic blueprints for making proteins. The protein acts to protect the mRNA from being broken down and allows it to move within the cell. Mutations in the PABPN1 gene that cause OPMD result in a PABPN1 protein that forms clumps within muscle cells, and hence they cannot be broken down. These clumps are thought to impair the normal function of muscle cells and eventually cause cells to die. The progressive loss of muscle cells most likely causes the muscle weakness seen in people with OPMD. It is not known why abnormal PABPN1 proteins seem to affect muscle cells in only certain parts of the body."},{"prompt":"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy inherited ?","completion":"How is oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy inherited?"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy ?","completion":"Is genetic testing available for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy?

Individuals with severe difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) may have a surgical procedure known as cricopharyngeal myotomy. In this procedure, the cricopharyngeal muscle of the throat is cut so that when swallowing occurs, the muscle remains relaxed allowing the passage of food or liquid.

Proud syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the ARX gene, which encodes a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. This protein is especially important during early embryonic development since it is thought to be involved in the formation of many different body structures such as the pancreas, testes, brain, and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For example, the protein helps regulate the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation) within the pancreas, testes, and muscles. In the developing brain, it plays many different roles such as assisting with the movement of neurons to their final locations. Specific changes in the ARX gene impair the function of the protein, which may disrupt the normal development of many different parts of the body. This can lead to the many signs and symptoms associated with Proud syndrome."},{"prompt":"Proud syndrome inherited ?","completion":"How is Proud syndrome inherited? Proud syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome). Women have two X chromosomes and men have an X and a Y chromosome. In X-linked recessive conditions, men develop the condition if they inherit one gene mutation (they have only one X chromosome). Females are generally only affected if they have two gene mutations (they have two X chromosomes), although some females may rarely have a mild form of the condition if they only inherit one mutation. A woman with an X-linked recessive condition will pass the mutation on to all of her sons and daughters. This means that all of her sons will have the condition and all of her daughters will be carriers.

Neutrophil elastase helps the body fight infections, but it can also attack healthy tissues (especially the lungs) if not controlled by AAT. Mutations that cause AAT can cause a deficiency or absence of AAT, or a form of AAT that does not work well. This allows neutrophil elastase to destroy lung tissue, causing lung disease.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) may first be suspected in people with evidence of liver disease at any age, or lung disease (such as emphysema), especially when there is no obvious cause or it is diagnosed at a younger age. Confirming the diagnosis involves a blood test showing a low serum concentration of the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, and either: detecting a functionally deficient AAT protein variant by isoelectric focusing (a method for detecting mutations); or detecting SERPINA1 gene mutations on both copies of the gene with molecular genetic testing.

Treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) depends on the symptoms and severity in each person. COPD and other related lung diseases are typically treated with standard therapy. Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids can help open the airways and make breathing easier. Intravenous augmentation therapy (regular infusion of purified, human AAT to increase AAT concentrations) has been recommended for people with established fixed airflow obstruction (determined by a specific lung function test). This therapy raises the level of the AAT protein in the blood and lungs. Lung transplantation may be an appropriate option for people with end-stage lung disease. Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for advanced liver disease. When present, panniculitis may resolve on its own or after dapsone or doxycycline therapy. When this therapy does not help, it has responded to intravenous augmentation therapy in higher than usual doses. All people with severe AATD should have pulmonary function tests every 6 to 12 months. Those with ATT serum concentrations 10% to 20% of normal should have periodic evaluation of liver function to detect liver disease. People with established liver disease should have periodic ultrasounds of the liver to monitor for fibrotic changes and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Yearly vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcus are recommended to lessen the progression of lung disease. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is recommended to lessen the risk of liver disease. People with AATD should avoid smoking and occupations with exposure to environmental pollutants.

This group of disorders includes H syndrome, pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (PHID), Faisalabad histiocytosis, and familial Rosai-Dorfman disease (also known as familial sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy or FSHML). These conditions were once thought to be distinct disorders; however, because of the overlapping features and shared genetic cause, they are now considered to be part of the same disease spectrum. While some affected individuals have signs and symptoms characteristic of one of these conditions, others have a range of features from two or more of the conditions. The pattern of signs and symptoms can vary, even within the same family. All of the conditions in the spectrum are characterized by histiocytosis, which is an overgrowth of immune system cells called histiocytes. These cells abnormally accumulate in one or more tissues in the body, which can lead to organ or tissue damage. The lymph nodes are commonly affected, leading to swelling of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Other areas of cell accumulation can include skin, kidneys, brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), or digestive tract. The spectrum is known as histiocytosis-lymphadenoapthy plus syndrome because the disorders that make up the spectrum can have additional signs and symptoms. H syndrome is named for the collection of symptoms - all starting with the letter H - that are commonly present. These include hyperpigmented skin lesions with excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) and histiocyte accumulation, enlargement of the liver or liver and spleen (hepatomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly), heart abnormalities, hearing loss, reduced amounts of hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadism), and short stature (reduced height). In some cases, hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus may also be present. PHID is characterized by patches of hyperpigmented skin with hypertrichosis and the development of type 1 diabetes during childhood. Faisalabad histiocytosis is characterized by lymphadenopathy and swelling of the eyelids due to the accumulation of histiocytes. Affected individuals may also have joint deformities (contractures) in their fingers or toes, and hearing loss. Familial Rosai-Dorfman disease is characterized by lymphadenopathy, most often in the neck. Histiocytes can also accumulate in other parts of the body.

Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner depending on the genetic cause. Most cases are autosomal dominant. In autosomal dominant inheritance, having a mutation in only one of the 2 copies of the responsible gene is enough to cause the condition. The mutation may be inherited from a parent or can occur for the first time in the affected person. Each child of a person with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutation. More rarely, MED is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In autosomal recessive inheritance, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms and are unaffected. When two carriers for the same condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% to be both unaffected and not a carrier."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy ?","completion":"Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy refers to a group of conditions that affect the skeletal muscles (muscles used for movement).

Split hand foot malformation may occur as an isolated feature or it may be associated with a genetic syndrome. Researchers believe that a large number of mutations can cause split hand foot malformation. A few of which have been identified: FBXW4 and TP63. Most commonly the conditions are passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion with reduced penetrance. In autosomal dominant inheritance an affected parent would have a 1 in 2 or 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing the genetic defect to his/her offspring. In conditions with reduced penetrance a person who inherits the underlying genetic defect, may never develop the condition.

The goal of CDA type 2 treatment is to address and prevent complications from anemia and iron overload. Most people with CDA type 2 develop iron overload, for some this is as early as in their 20's. If a person with CDA type 2 has mild anemia, but evidence of iron loading, treatment may involve phlebotomy. An alternative treatment is chelation therapy. In particular, chelation therapy is preferred for people with iron (ferritin) levels greater than 1000 mg/L. The Iron Disorders Institute provides information on chelation therapy through their Web site at: http://www.irondisorders.org/chelation-therapy Many people with CDA-2 maintain hemoglobin levels just above the threshold for symptoms. Mild anemia may not need treatment, as long as it doesn't worsen. Less commonly CDA-2 causes severe anemia. Treatment of severe anemia may involve blood transfusions. Blood transfusions can raise iron levels so, careful monitoring and treatment for iron overload is required. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute offers tips for living with hemolytic anemia at the following link: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ha/livingwith Splenectomy is considered for people with CDA-2 and severe anemia. Splenectomy can cause a consistent rise in hemoglobin values. The spleen, however, is important in fighting infection. People, particularly children, who have had a splenectomy are more likely to contract a serious and possibly life-threatening infection (sepsis). This risk must be carefully weighed. Splenectomy does not affect iron overload. Lastly, people with very severe CDA-2 may be candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Congenital contractural arachnodactyly is caused by mutations in the FBN2 gene. The FBN2 gene provides instructions for producing the fibrillin-2 protein. Fibrillin-2 binds to other proteins and molecules to form threadlike filaments called microfibrils. Microfibrils become part of the fibers that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue. Additionally, microfibrils hold molecules called growth factors and release them at the appropriate time to control the growth and repair of tissues and organs throughout the body. A mutation in the FBN2 gene can reduce the amount and/or quality of fibrillin-2 that is available to form microfibrils. As a result, decreased microfibril formation weakens the elastic fibers and allows growth factors to be released inappropriately, causing tall stature, deformities of the fingers and toes, and other characteristic features of congenital contractural arachnodactyly."},{"prompt":"Congenital contractural arachnodactyly inherited ?","completion":"How is congenital contractural arachnodactyly inherited?

The range and and severity of signs and symptoms in individuals with Kuskokwim disease can vary, even among siblings. Affected individuals usually have congenital contractures, especially of lower extremities, which progress during childhood and persist for the lifetime of the individual. However, not all individuals with the condition have contractures at birth. The severity of contractures can be very asymmetrical in any given individual. The knees and elbows are often affected, and skeletal abnormalities of the spine, pelvis, and feet also commonly occur. Muscle atrophy of limbs with contractures and displacement of kneecaps (patellae) have also been reported. Milder skeletal features are common. Vertebral features may include spondylolisthesis, mild to moderate scoliosis, and/or lordosis. Many affected individuals have had several low-energy fractures. Other skeletal abnormalities that have been reported include bunions (hallux valgus), \\"flat feet\\" (plano valgus feet), and clubfoot (talipes equinovarus). Development and arrangement of the teeth (dentition) are normal. Although some individuals with full bilateral contractures of the knees can move about by duck walking (sitting with buttocks on their heels) or by knee walking (moving on their knees with their lower legs drawn up behind them to their buttocks), most affected individuals are treated with leg braces and/or surgery in childhood and can walk upright.

Although no medications or interventions have demonstrated long-term stabilization of logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA), different treatment methods have shown promising short-term benefits. Studies utilizing language therapy and behavioral interventions have shown encouraging results. Neuromodulation through methodologies such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have additionally been identified as a promising therapies to potentially use in combination with behavioral treatment and language therapy. As the most common underlying pathology of LPA is Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, limited research has been completed on interventions shown to reduce the rate of decline in cognitive symptoms in AD. So far cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, medications used in Alzheimers disease, have not been proven effective in treating logopenic progressive aphasia.

Most people with MFM begin to develop muscle weakness in mid-adulthood, but features of the condition can appear anytime between infancy and late adulthood. It may be caused by mutations in any of several genes, including DES, CRYAB, MYOT, LDB3, FLNC, and BAG3; the signs and symptoms of MFM can vary widely depending on the condition's genetic cause. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment may include a pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for arrhythmia or cardiac conduction defects; cardiac transplantation for progressive or life-threatening cardiomyopathy; respiratory support for respiratory failure; and physical therapy and assistive devices for those with advanced muscle weakness."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Myofibrillar myopathy ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Myofibrillar myopathy? Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) primarily affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. In some cases, the heart (cardiac) muscle is also affected. The signs and symptoms of MFM vary widely among affected individuals, typically depending on the condition's genetic cause. Most people with this disorder begin to develop muscle weakness (myopathy) in mid-adulthood. However, features of this condition can appear anytime between infancy and late adulthood. Muscle weakness most often begins in the hands and feet (distal muscles), but some people first experience weakness in the muscles near the center of the body (proximal muscles). Other affected individuals develop muscle weakness throughout their body. Facial muscle weakness can cause swallowing and speech difficulties. Muscle weakness worsens over time. Other signs and symptoms of MFM can include a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), muscle pain (myalgia), loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy), and respiratory failure.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is thought to be a multifactorial condition, meaning that one or more genes likely interact with environmental factors to cause the condition. In some cases, it may occur as part of an inherited syndrome. Having a family history of AAA increases the risk of developing the condition. A genetic predisposition has been suspected since the first report of three brothers who had a ruptured AAA, and additional families with multiple affected relatives have been reported. In some cases, it may be referred to as \\" familial abdominal aortic aneurysm.\\" A Swedish survey reported that the relative risk of developing AAA for a first-degree relative of a person with AAA was approximately double that of a person with no family history of AAA. In another study, having a family history increased the risk of having an aneurysm 4.3-fold. The highest risk was among brothers older than age 60, in whom the prevalence was 18%. While specific variations in DNA (polymorphisms) are known or suspected to increase the risk for AAA, no one gene is known to cause isolated AAA. It can occur with some inherited disorders that are caused by mutations in a single gene, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type. However, these more typically involve the thoracoabdominal aorta. Because the inheritance of AAA is complex, it is not possible to predict whether a specific person will develop AAA. People interested in learning more about the genetics of AAA, and how their family history affects risks to specific family members, should speak with a genetics professional."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Limbgirdle muscular dystrophy type 2A ?","completion":"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) is an autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized by progressive, symmetrical weakness of the proximal limb and girdle muscles (mainly those around the hips and shoulders) without cardiac involvement or intellectual disability.

Less commonly, the nodules form on other areas of the body such as the thighs and forearms. The lesions begin as firm, hot, red, painful lumps and progress to a purplish color. EN is a type of inflammatory disorder affecting the layer of fat under the skin (panniculitis). Other symptoms that may accompany the skin findings include the following: fever, a general feeling of being ill. joint aches, and swelling of the affected area. In many cases, EN is presumed to be a delayed reaction to antigens associated with various infections, drugs, and certain systemic diseases. In many cases, however, EN has no identifiable cause (idiopathic); in these cases, clinical follow-up is needed to rule out certain conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, and Behcet's disease. Treatment may include rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), steroids, hot or cold compresses, potassium iodide solution, and supportive bandages or compression stockings. Symptoms usually resolve within six weeks, but EN may become a chronic disorder lasting for months and, occasionally, for years.

It gets its name from the unusual appearance of the cornea during an eye exam. This dystrophy occurs when the epithelium's basement membrane develops abnormally, causing the epithelial cells to not properly adhere to it. This leads to recurrent epithelial erosions, which can cause blurred vision and severe pain. This condition is usually not inherited. However, families with autosomal dominant inheritance and mutations in the TGFBI gene have been identified."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Epithelial basement membrane corneal dystrophy ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Epithelial basement membrane corneal dystrophy? A chronic problem seen in this condition is the epithelial erosions. They can alter the cornea's normal curvature, causing periodic blurred vision. These erosions may also expose the nerve endings that line the tissue, resulting in moderate to severe pain lasting as long as several days. Generally, the pain will be worse upon awakening in the morning. Other symptoms include sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, and foreign body sensation in the eye. This condition usually affects adults between the ages of 40 and 70, although it can develop earlier in life. It gets its name from the unusual appearance of the cornea during an eye exam. Most often, the affected epithelium will have a map-like appearance, i.e., large, slightly gray outlines that look like a continent on a map. There may also be clusters of opaque dots close to the map-like patches. Less frequently, the irregular basement membrane will form concentric lines in the central cornea that resemble small fingerprints. Epithelial basement membrane corneal dystrophy is not a progressive condition. Typically, it will flare up occasionally for a few years and then go away on its own, with no lasting loss of vision. Most people never know that they have this condition, since they do not have any pain or vision loss.

Because most people do not develop noticeable signs or symptoms, treatment usually is not necessary. However, if treatment is needed, doctors will try to control the pain associated with the epithelial erosions. They may patch the eye to immobilize it, or prescribe lubricating eye drops and ointments. With treatment, these erosions usually heal within three days, although periodic flashes of pain may occur for several weeks thereafter. Other treatments include anterior corneal punctures to allow better adherence of cells; corneal scraping to remove eroded areas of the cornea and allow regeneration of healthy epithelial tissue; and use of the excimer laser to remove surface irregularities.

Physical therapy, such as stretching or low-impact exercises, may help improve weakness. Some skeletal abnormalities can be addressed with physical therapy, though others may require surgery. As the muscle weakness and scoliosis associated with CCD can affect breathing, individuals diagnosed with this condition may benefit from pulmonary function tests.

Currarino triad is caused by mutations in the MNX1 gene in nearly all familial and 30% of sporadic cases. These mutations in the gene are called loss of function mutations because the gene can no longer produce working (functional) protein. Less frequently, a complex phenotype of Currarino triad can be caused by microdeletions of 7q containing MNX1 (the long arm of chromosome 7 is missing a small piece of DNA which includes MNX1 and other genes)."},{"prompt":"Currarino triad inherited ?","completion":"How is Currarino triad inherited? Currarino triad is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the MNX1 gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent. In other cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of the condition. This is called a de novo mutation. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation. A significant interfamilial (between different families) and intrafamilial (within the same family) variability in expression has been found without any definite correlation to the genetic mutations. This means in one family, a parent might only have one very mild feature of Currarino triad while one of their children might have severe forms of all three features and yet another child might have a mild form of one feature and a severe form of another."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Lubinsky syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Lubinsky syndrome?

This can cause the airway to become narrow or collapse. There are two forms of TBM: a congenital form (called primary TBM) that typically develops during infancy or early childhood and an acquired form (called secondary TBM) that is usually seen in adults. Some affected people may initially have no signs or symptoms. However, the condition is typically progressive (becomes worse overtime) and most people will eventually develop characteristic features such as shortness of breath, cough, sputum retention (inability to clear mucus from the respiratory tract), and wheezing or stridor with breathing. Most cases of primary TBM are caused by genetic conditions that weaken the walls of the airway, while the secondary form often occurs incidentally due to trauma, chronic inflammation and/or prolonged compression of the airways.

Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a condition that occurs when the walls of the airway (specifically the trachea and bronchi) are weak. This can cause the airway to become narrow or collapse. There are two forms of TBM. Primary TBM (also called congenital TBM) typically develops during infancy or early childhood, while secondary TBM (also called acquired TBM) is usually seen in adults. Some affected people may initially have no signs or symptoms. However, the condition is typically progressive (becomes worse overtime) and many people will eventually develop characteristic features such as shortness of breath, cough, sputum retention (inability to clear mucus from the respiratory tract), and wheezing or stridor with breathing. Symptoms may become worse during periods of stress (i.e. illness), when reclining, or when forcing a cough. Infants and young children with TBM tend to have more frequent respiratory infections and delayed recovery from these illnesses."},{"prompt":"What causes Tracheobronchomalacia ?","completion":"What causes tracheobronchomalacia? The underlying cause of tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) varies by subtype. Most cases of primary TBM (also called congenital TBM) are caused by genetic conditions that weaken the walls of the airway (specifically the trachea and bronchi). For example, TBM has been reported in people with mucopolysaccharidoses (such as Hunter syndrome and Hurler syndrome), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and a variety of chromosome abnormalities. Primary TBM can also be idiopathic (unknown cause) or associated with prematurity and certain birth defects (i.e. tracheoesophageal fistula). The secondary form (also called acquired TBM) is caused by the degeneration (break down) of cartilage that typically supports the airways. It is most commonly associated with: Certain medical procedures such as endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy Conditions that lead to chronic (persisting or progressing for a long period of time) inflammation such as relapsing polychondritis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Cancers, tumors, or cysts that cause prolonged compression of the airway"},{"prompt":"Tracheobronchomalacia inherited ?","completion":"Is tracheobronchomalacia inherited? Primary tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is often associated with certain genetic conditions. In some cases, an affected person inherits the condition from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) gene mutations. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. When TBM is part of a genetic condition, it can be passed on to future generations. Secondary TBM (also called acquired TBM) is not inherited. It generally occurs incidentally due to trauma, chronic inflammation and/or prolonged compression of the airways."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Tracheobronchomalacia ?","completion":"How is tracheobronchomalacia diagnosed? A diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) may be suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms or abnormal pulmonary function tests. Additional testing such as CT scan and bronchoscopy can then be performed to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the severity of the condition. TBM is considered mild if the trachea narrows to 50% of its initial size while the affected person is breathing out, moderate if it narrows to 25%, and severe if the walls of the trachea touch."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Tracheobronchomalacia ?","completion":"How might tracheobronchomalacia be treated? Treatment is only medically necessary in people who have signs and symptoms of tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). Management of symptomatic TBM first involves identifying underlying conditions contributing to symptoms, such as chronic inflammation, compression, or injury. Initial treatment will target these underlying medical concerns. If symptoms persist, people with TBM may undergo pulmonary function tests or other assessments to help guide therapy choice and allow monitoring of the response to treatment. Treatment options may include: Silicone and/or long-term stenting Surgical correction Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) Tracheostomy (often used as a last resort as it can sometimes worsen TBM) We strongly recommend that you discuss your treatment options with a healthcare provider."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Johnson neuroectodermal syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Johnson neuroectodermal syndrome?

This condition causes teeth to be unusually small, discolored, pitted or grooved, and prone to rapid wear and breakage. These dental problems, which vary among affected individuals, can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. There are 4 main types of AI that are classified based on the type of enamel defect. These 4 types are divided further into 14 subtypes, which are distinguished by their specific dental abnormalities and by their pattern of inheritance. AI can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive pattern."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Amelogenesis imperfecta ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of amelogenesis imperfecta? In general, the both primary and permanent teeth are affected. The enamel tends to be soft and weak, and the teeth appear yellow and damage easily. The defects associated with amelogeneis imperfecta are highly variable and include abnormalities classified as hypoplastic (defects in the amount of enamel), hypomaturation (defect in the final growth and development of the tooth enamel), and hypocalcification (defect in the initial stage of enamel formation followed by defective tooth growth). The enamel in the hypomaturation and hypocalcification types is not mineralized and is thus described as hypomineralized. Traditionally, the diagnosis and classification of amelogenesis imperfecta is based on the clinical presentation and the mode of inheritance. There are four principal types based on the defects in the tooth enamel. These types are subdivided into 14 different subtypes based on the clinical presentation and the mode of inheritance. Detailed information about the signs and symptoms associated with the four major types of amelogenesis imperfecta is available from the UNC School of Dentistry."},{"prompt":"What causes Amelogenesis imperfecta ?","completion":"What causes amelogenesis imperfecta? Amelogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the AMELX, ENAM, and MMP20 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are essential for normal tooth development. These proteins are involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, calcium-rich material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. Mutations in any of these genes alter the structure of these proteins or prevent the genes from making any protein at all. As a result, tooth enamel is abnormally thin or soft and may have a yellow or brown color. Teeth with defective enamel are weak and easily damaged. In some cases, the genetic cause of amelogenesis imperfecta can not been identified. Researchers are working to find mutations in other genes that are responsible for this disorder. Click on each gene name to learn more about the role it plays in the development of tooth enamel."},{"prompt":"Amelogenesis imperfecta inherited ?","completion":"How is amelogenesis imperfecta inherited? Amelogenesis imperfecta can have different patterns of inheritance, depending on the gene that is altered. Most cases are caused by mutations in the ENAM gene and are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This type of inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Amelogenesis imperfecta may also be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern; this form of the disorder can result from mutations in the ENAM or MMP20 gene. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. About 5 percent of amelogenesis imperfecta cases are caused by mutations in the AMELX gene and are inherited in an X-linked pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In most cases, males with X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta experience more severe dental abnormalities than females with this form of this condition. Other cases of amelogenesis imperfecta result from new mutations in these genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Amelogenesis imperfecta ?","completion":"How is amelogenesis imperfecta diagnosed? A dentist can identify and diagnose amelogenesis imperfecta on the basis of the patient's family history and the signs and symptoms present in the affected individual. Extraoral X-rays (X-rays taken outside the mouth) can reveal the presence of teeth that never erupted o that were absorbed. Intraoral X-rays (X-rays taken inside the mouth) show contrast between the enamel and dentin in cases in which mineralization is affected. Genetic testing is available for the genes AMELX, ENAM, and MMP20. You can visit the Genetic Testing Registry to locate laboratories performing genetic testing for these genes.

Symptoms of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease vary among patients and depend on the size and location of the tumors. Hemangioblastomas that develop in the brain and spinal cord can cause headaches, vomiting, weakness, and a loss of muscle coordination (ataxia). Hemangioblastomas can also occur in the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina). These tumors, which are also called retinal angiomas, may cause vision loss. Pheochromocytomas affect the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. These tumors often cause no symptoms, but in some cases they can produce an excess of hormones that cause dangerously high blood pressure. About 10 percent of people with VHL disease develop endolymphatic sac tumors, which are noncancerous tumors in the inner ear. These growths can cause hearing loss in one or both ears, as well as ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and problems with balance. Individuals with VHL disease are also at a higher risk than normal for certain types of cancer, especially kidney cancer.

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by a mutation in the VHL gene. This gene is a tumor suppressor gene, which helps to control cell growth. Mutations in the VHL gene lead to a lack of regulation of cell growth and survival, allowing cells to grow and divide uncontrollably, forming the tumors that are associated with VHL disease."},{"prompt":"Von HippelLindau disease inherited ?","completion":"How is von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease inherited? Mutations in the gene that causes VHL disease (the VHL gene) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a mutation in only one copy of the VHL gene in each cell is enough to increase a person's risk of developing VHL disease. In most autosomal dominant conditions, having one mutated copy of the responsible gene is sufficient to cause the condition. However, in VHL disease, a mutation in the other copy of the gene must occur (during a person's lifetime) to trigger the development of VHL disease. For example, a person may inherit a mutated copy of the gene from a parent, but acquiring a second mutation in the other gene copy in a specific organ may trigger tumor development in that organ. Almost everyone who is born with one VHL mutation will eventually acquire a mutation in the second copy of the gene and develop VHL disease. In most cases, an affected person inherits the first mutated gene from an affected parent. However, in about 20% of cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of the condition. This is called a de novo mutation. When a person with a mutation that can lead to VHL disease has children, each of their children has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Von HippelLindau disease ?","completion":"How is von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease diagnosed?

Ataxia-telangiectasia affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. This disorder is characterized by progressive difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia) beginning in early childhood, usually before age 5. Affected children typically develop difficulty walking, problems with balance and hand coordination, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The movement problems typically cause people to require wheelchair assistance by adolescence. People with this disorder also have slurred speech and trouble moving their eyes to look side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia). Small clusters of enlarged blood vessels called telangiectases, which occur in the eyes and on the surface of the skin, are also characteristic of this condition.

Although it can be seen in post-menopausal women and very rarely in men, DPL occurs most often in women of childbearing age. Most women with DPL are pregnant, taking the birth control pill, or have uterine leioyomas or estrogen-secreting tumors. Some people with DPL have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms may include abdominal and pelvic pain; rectal or vaginal bleeding; and less commonly constipation.

The frontoethmoidal type is located at the frontal and ethmoid bones while the occipital type is located at the occipital bone. Hydrocephalus, abnormalities of the eyeball and tear duct, and other findings have been associated with the condition. Some affected individuals have intellectual or physical disabilities while others have normal development and abilities. The condition is typically congenital (present at birth) but has been reported to develop by chance in older individuals in rare cases.

A diagnosis of Parsonage Turner syndrome (PTS) is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Specialized tests may be recommended to further investigate the shoulder pain and/or muscle weakness and to rule out other conditions that can cause similar features. These tests may include nerve conduction studies (tests that determine the ability of a specific nerve to relay a message to the brain), electromyography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) and/or an X-ray."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Parsonage Turner syndrome ?","completion":"How might Parsonage Turner syndrome be treated? Treatment for Parsonage Turner syndrome (PTS) varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, pain medications may be prescribed depending on the severity of the nerve pain. Other techniques for pain management include application of heat or cold and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (a method of pain relief in which a special device transmits low-voltage electrical impulses through electrodes on the skin to an area of the body that is in pain). Many affected people undergo physical therapy and/or occupational therapy to maintain muscle strength and range of motion of affected joints once the pain begins to subside. Surgeries to restore movement and function to the shoulder muscles and joint may be considered if other treatment options are not effective."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Gupta Patton syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Gupta Patton syndrome?

In most cases, pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) occurs sporadically for unknown reasons. In a few families with the inherited form, familial PRP, the condition is caused by mutations in the CARD14 gene. This gene gives instructions for making a protein that turns on other proteins that regulate genes that control the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions. It also protects cells from certain signals that would otherwise cause them to self-destruct. The CARD14 protein is particularly abundant in the skin. Mutations in the gene can cause a person to have an abnormal inflammatory response. Researchers are trying to find out how these mutations cause the specific features of familial PRP."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Pityriasis rubra pilaris ?","completion":"How might pityriasis rubra pilaris be treated? Treatment of pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is mainly based on reports of patients' experiences. No controlled trials have been done, so the effectiveness and safety of treatments is unclear. Currently there are no treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in PRP. Management of PRP often involves systemic and topical therapies combined. Topical therapies can help with the symptoms and may be enough for people with mild PRP. Topical treatments are usually combined with systemic therapy for PRP that affects a large part of the body. Most people need systemic therapy to control the condition. Oral retinoids (synthetic vitamin A derivatives) are usually preferred as a first-line systemic treatment for PRP. Methotrexate may be an alternative option for people who should not use systemic retinoids, or who don't respond to systemic retinoid therapy. For people who don't respond well to retinoid or methotrexate therapy, options may include biologic TNF-alpha inhibitors, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and/or phototherapy. Topical treatments used for PRP may include topical corticosteroids, keratolytics, tar, calcipotriol, topical tretinoin, and tazarotene. Some of the medications used to treat PRP can harm a developing fetus and are not recommended for use right before or during pregnancy. People seeking information about specific treatment options for themselves or family members should speak with their health care provider."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Epiphyseal dysplasia hearing loss dysmorphism ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Epiphyseal dysplasia hearing loss dysmorphism?

Additional symptoms may occur in some cases, although this varies even among individuals in the same family. Most affected individuals develop sensorineural hearing loss and many exhibit cognitive abnormalities such as developmental delays, behavioral issues, or psychotic-like features. Norrie disease is caused by mutations in the NDP gene. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Treatment is directed toward the specific symptoms present in each individual. The coordinated efforts of a team of specialists, including pediatricians, ophthalmologists, and audiologists may be needed. Early intervention and special education services are important to ensure that children with Norrie disease reach their full potential."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Norrie disease ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Norrie disease?

Norrie disease is caused by a change (mutation) in the NDP gene, which is located on the X chromosome. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. The NDP gene provides instructions for making a protein called norrin, which affects the way cells and tissues develop. In particular, the norrin protein seems to play an important role in the development of retinal cells in the eye. It is also involved in creating a blood supply to tissues of the retina and the inner ear, and the development of other body systems. Mutations in the NDP gene can prevent the norrin protein from working correctly, resulting in the signs and symptoms of Norrie disease."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Norrie disease ?","completion":"How might Norrie disease be treated? Because most males with Norrie disease (ND) have complete retinal detachment at the time of birth, surgical intervention after that time is typically not effective for preserving sight. Furthermore, we were unable to find reports about restoring sight to affected individuals after sight has been lost. Individuals without complete retinal detachment may benefit from intervention; however, vitrectomy and laser photocoagulation are reportedly challenging and often associated with poor outcome. A more recent case report reported evidence that immediate, prophylactic laser treatment at birth may prevent retinal detachment and blindness. The individual described in the study was known to be at risk and was diagnosed before birth via amniocentesis, and thus laser treatment shortly after birth was able to be performed. The authors of this report state that although the results they achieved are encouraging, longer observation of a larger number of patients is needed to determine the effectivness of this new approach. In some cases, surgery may be required when progression of the condition leads to increased pressure within the eye. Rarely, enucleation (removal) of the eye may be necessary to control pain. For individuals with hearing loss, hearing aid augmentation is usually successful until middle or late adulthood. Cochlear implants may be considered when function is severely impaired."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Alagille syndrome ?","completion":"Alagille syndrome is an inherited disorder in which a person has fewer than the normal number of small bile ducts inside the liver. It is a complex disorder that can affect other parts of the body including the heart, kidneys, blood vessels, eyes, face, and skeleton. Symptoms, including jaundice, pale, loose stools, and poor growth, typically develop in the first 2 years of life. Symptoms and symptom severity varies, even among people in the same family. Alagille syndrome is caused by mutations in the JAG1 and NOTCH2 genes. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Alagille syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Alagille syndrome? Alagille syndrome is a complex multisystem disorder involving the liver, heart, eyes, face, and skeleton. Symptoms typically present in infancy or early childhood. The severity of the disorder varies among affected individuals, even within the same family. Symptoms range from so mild as to go unnoticed to severe enough to require heart and/or liver transplants. One of the major features of Alagille syndrome is liver damage caused by abnormalities in the bile ducts. These ducts carry bile (which helps to digest fats) from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. In Alagille syndrome, the bile ducts may be narrow, malformed, and reduced in number. This results in a build-up of bile causing scarring that prevents the liver from working properly. This may lead to jaundice, itchy skin, and deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas). Alagille syndrome is also associated with several heart problems, including impaired blood flow from the heart into the lungs (pulmonic stenosis). Other heart-related problems include a hole between the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect) and a combination of heart defects called tetralogy of Fallot. People with Alagille syndrome may also have distinctive facial features (including a broad, prominent forehead; deep-set eyes; and a small, pointed chin), problems with the blood vessels within the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and the kidneys, and an unusual butterfly shape of the bones of the spinal column (vertebrae).

The exact underlying cause of Schnitzler syndrome is currently unknown. People affected by this condition often have a blood abnormality called monoclonal gammopathy, a condition in which the body over-produces certain immunoglobulins (typically immunoglobulin M). Immunoglobulins are proteins that are made by certain white blood cells. They play a role in the immune response by helping destroy bacteria, viruses, and other substances that appear foreign and harmful. Some researchers believe that the abnormal accumulation of immunoglobulins in the skin and other parts of the body may play a role in the development of the signs and symptoms of Schnitzler syndrome. Other scientists speculate that alterations in cytokines may play a role in the development of Schnitzler syndrome. Cytokines are specialized proteins that play an important role in the immune response. They are secreted by certain immune system cells and play a vital role in controlling the growth and activity of other immune system cells. Abnormal findings involving a specific cytokine called interleukin-1 have been found in some people with Schnitzler syndrome."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Schnitzler syndrome ?","completion":"How is Schnitzler syndrome diagnosed?

MECP2 duplication syndrome is a condition that occurs almost exclusively in males and is characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability. Infants affected by this condition are generally diagnosed with severe hypotonia within the first few weeks of life. This reduced muscle tone can lead to feeding difficulties which may require a feeding tube. Trouble swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux, failure to thrive, and extensive drooling are also common symptoms. Distinctive physical features may be noticed shortly after birth which can include brachycephaly (abnormally flat back of the head), midface hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the middle of the face), large ears, deep-set eyes, prominent chin, and a depressed nasal bridge. Due to hypotonia, affected children often have delayed development of motor milestones such as sitting up and crawling. Approximately, one third of affected people never walk independently and those who are able to walk may have an abnormal gait (style of walking). In most cases, hypotonia gives way to spasticity during childhood. Progressive spasticity, which is generally more pronounced in the legs, may lead to the development of mild contractures. Consequently, many affected adults require the use of a wheelchair. The majority of affected people do not develop the ability to talk. Some may have limited speech during early childhood, but frequently this ability is progressively lost during adolescence. Other signs and symptoms associated with MECP2 duplication syndrome may include seizures; autistic features; clinically significant constipation and bladder dysfunction. Many people affected by MECP2 duplication syndrome have recurrent respiratory tract infections. These respiratory infections can be life-threatening and as a result, approximately half of affected people succumb by age 25. In most cases, females with a duplication of the MECP2 gene do not have any symptoms, although depression, anxiety, and autistic features have been described in some. When affected, women with MECP2 duplication syndrome are generally less severely affected than males with the condition.

MECP2 duplication syndrome occurs when there is an extra copy (duplication) of the MECP2 gene in each cell. This is generally caused by a duplication of genetic material located on the long (q) arm of the X chromosome. The size of the duplication can vary; however, this does not appear to affect the severity of the condition. People with larger duplications have signs and symptoms that are similar to people with smaller duplications. The MECP2 gene encodes a protein that is important for normal brain functioning. Although it plays many roles, one of its most important functions is to regulate other genes in the brain by switching them on and off. A duplication of the MECP2 gene leads to the production of excess protein, which is unable to properly regulate the expression of other genes. This results in irregular brain activity, leading to the signs and symptoms of MECP2 duplication syndrome."},{"prompt":"MECP2 duplication syndrome inherited ?","completion":"Is MECP2 duplication syndrome inherited? MECP2 duplication syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. A condition is considered X-linked if the genetic change that causes the condition is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome). In males (who have only one X chromosome), a duplication of the MECP2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a duplication of one of the two copies of the gene typically does not cause the disorder. Early in the development of females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in each cell (called X-inactivation). X-inactivation prevents female cells from having twice as many functional X chromosomes as males. Because X-inactivation is usually random, the X chromosome inherited from the mother is active in some cells, and the X chromosome inherited from the father is active in other cells. However, when a female has an X chromosome with a duplicated copy of the MECP2 gene, the abnormal chromosome is often preferentially inactivated in many or all cells. This is called \\"skewed X-inactivation.\\" It prevents some women with an MECP2 duplication from developing features of the duplication since the extra genetic material is not active. In most cases, MECP2 duplication syndrome is inherited from a mother who has no signs or symptoms of the duplication. Rarely, the condition is not inherited and occurs due to a random event during the formation of the egg or sperm, or in early fetal development. When this happens, it is called a de novo duplication (occurring as a new genetic change for the first time in the affected person)."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose MECP2 duplication syndrome ?","completion":"How is MECP2 duplication syndrome diagnosed?

Most cases of mosaic trisomy 14 appear to result from random errors in the separation of chromosomes (nondisjunction) -- either during the division of the egg or sperm in one of the parents, or during cell division after fertilization. There have been some reports in which it may have occurred due to other phenomenon, such as uniparental disomy or the formation of an isochromosome. Uniparental disomy is when an affected individual inherits both copies of a chromosomal pair from one parent, rather than one copy from each parent.

Mulibrey nanism (MN) is characterized by progressive growth failure that begins prenatally (before birth). Hypotonia (poor muscle tone) is common. Newborns often have characteristic abnormalities of the head and face, including a triangularly shaped face. Yellow discoloration of the eyes and other ocular abnormalities may be present, but vision is usually normal. More than 90 percent of affected individuals have a J-shaped sella turcica, which is a depression in the sphenoid bone at the base of the skull. Infants with mulibrey nanism may also have symptoms related to overgrowth of the fibrous sac surrounding the heart (constrictive pericarditis). When constrictive pericarditis is present at birth, affected infants may have a bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis), especially on the lips and fingertips. Individuals with MN typically have a high-pitched voice. Other symptoms may include abnormally prominent veins in the neck, congestion in the lungs, abnormal fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites), swelling of the arms and/or legs (peripheral edema), and/or enlargement of the heart (cardiac hypertrophy) and/or liver (hepatomegaly). There may also be elevated pressure in the veins, congestion or blockage in the main artery serving the lungs (pulmonary artery), and/or a build-up of fibrous tissue in the walls of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis). Associated complications of these conditions may lead to congestive heart failure. In some cases, individuals with mulibrey nanism may have additional physical abnormalities, such as an unusually thin shinbone (fibrous tibia dysplasia). Large cerebral ventricles in the brain and delayed motor development are uncommon findings. Most affected individuals have normal intelligence.

It is also a progressive disorder that causes the breakdown of brain cells in certain areas of the brain. This results in uncontrolled movements, loss of intellectual abilities, and emotional disturbances. Juvenile HD is defined by the onset of symptoms before age 20 years and accounts for 5-10% of HD cases. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by a mutation called a trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene. Most often, children with juvenile HD inherit the mutation repeat from their fathers, although on occasion they inherit it from their mothers. Juvenile Huntington disease has a rapid disease progression once symptoms present. There currently is no cure. Treatment is supportive and focused on increasing quality of life."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Juvenile Huntington disease ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Juvenile Huntington disease? A common sign of juvenile HD is a rapid decline in school performance. Symptoms can also include subtle changes in handwriting and slight problems with movement, such as slowness, rigidity, tremor, and rapid muscular twitching, called myoclonus. Several of these symptoms are similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease, and they differ from the chorea seen in individuals who develop the disease as adults. People with juvenile HD may also have seizures and mental disabilities. The earlier the onset, the faster the disease seems to progress. The disease progresses most rapidly in individuals with juvenile or early-onset HD, and death often follows within 10 years.

Mutations in the HTT gene cause Huntington disease. The HTT gene provides instructions for making a protein called huntingtin. Although the function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. When the huntingtin protein is abnormally made, it is thought to lead to the death of neurons in certain areas of the brain, which causes the signs and symptoms of Juvenile HD. The HTT mutation that causes Huntington disease involves a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated 10 to 35 times within the gene. In people with juvenile HD, the CAG segment is repeated more than 60 times."},{"prompt":"Juvenile Huntington disease inherited ?","completion":"How is Juvenile Huntington disease (HD) inherited? Juvenile HD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. An affected person usually inherits the altered gene from one affected parent. As the altered HTT gene is passed from one generation to the next, the size of the CAG trinucleotide repeat often increases in size. A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms (anticipation). A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms. Most often, children with juvenile HD inherit the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat from their fathers, although on occasion they inherit it from their mothers."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Juvenile Huntington disease ?","completion":"How is Juvenile Huntington disease (HD) diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually made by experienced neurologists. A neurologist will often first obtain the persons medical history asking about recent intellectual or emotional problems, which may be indications of HD. A family history may be taken as well, looking for autosomal dominant inheritance in a family. Usually a clinical exam is also performed where the persons hearing, eye movements, strength, coordination, involuntary movements (chorea), sensation, reflexes, balance, movement, and mental status are examined. People with HD commonly have impairments in the way the eye follows or fixes on a moving target. Abnormalities of eye movements vary from person to person and differ, depending on the stage and duration of the illness. Genetic testing is usually done to confirm a diagnosis of juvenile HD in an individual who is exhibiting HD-like symptoms. Using a blood sample, the genetic test analyzes DNA for the HD mutation by counting the number of repeats in the HD gene region. GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for Juvenile HD. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories, conducting testing click here. Please note: Most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or a genetics professional.

Physicians may prescribe a number of medications to help control emotional and movement problems associated with HD. It is important to remember however, that while medicines may help keep these clinical symptoms under control, there is no treatment to stop or reverse the course of the disease. Anticonvulsant drugs are usually prescribed to help prevent and control the seizures that occur in children with Juvenile HD. Tetrabenazine is often used to treat chorea. Antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, or other drugs, such as clonazepam, may also help to alleviate chorea and may also be used to help control hallucinations, delusions, and violent outbursts. For depression, physicians may prescribe fluoxetine, sertraline, nortriptyline, or other drugs.

Other physical findings may include generalized muscle weakness; progressive muscle atrophy; growth delay; delays in motor development; skin conditions; and/or malformation of the hips and/or feet. It appears to occur sporadically (in individuals with no history of the condition in their family) but in some cases, autosomal dominant inheritance has been suggested. Treatment is typically directed toward the specific symptoms that are present in each individual."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Singleton Merten syndrome ?","completion":"What are the signs and symptoms of Singleton Merten syndrome? Singleton Merten syndrome is characterized by abnormalities of the teeth (dental dysplasia); abnormal accumulation of calcium deposits (calcifications) in the aorta and certain valves of the heart (i.e., aortic and mitral valves); and/or progressive thinning and loss of protein of the bones (osteoporosis). Between the ages of four to 24 months, most affected infants experience generalized muscle weakness and loss or wasting away (atrophy) of muscle tissue. In approximately half of the reported cases, these symptoms begin after an episode of illness associated with a fever. Affected infants may also show delays in general physical development, possibly resulting in short stature or delays in the ability to coordinate muscles and perform certain tasks (motor development). Abnormalities affecting the teeth also occur at an early age in individuals with Singleton Merten syndrome. Affected infants may develop cavities and lose their primary teeth prematurely. Certain permanent teeth may not develop or may erupt late; those permanent teeth that do develop are usually malformed. In some cases, permanent teeth may also be lost prematurely. By late infancy or early childhood, affected individuals may experience symptoms associated with the progressive accumulation of calcium deposits (calcifications) in the aorta and on certain valves of the heart. The aorta arises from the lower pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) and supplies oxygen-rich blood to all the arteries of the body (excluding the pulmonary artery). In individuals with Singleton Merten Syndrome, calcifications form in the portion of the aorta nearest the heart (proximal thoracic aorta). The accumulation of calcium deposits is progressive and typically causes blockage and narrowing of the aorta (called calcific aortic stenosis), obstructing the flow of oxygenated blood. In some cases, abnormal calcium deposits may also develop around the valve on the left side of the heart (mitral valve calcification). As a result of calcification of these various structures, affected individuals may experience high blood pressure (hypertension); abnormal transmission of electrical impulses (conduction) that coordinate the activity of the heart muscle (heart block); abnormal contractions of the heart (systolic murmurs); and/or abnormal enlargement of the heart (cardiomegaly). By late adolescence, the heart may be unable to pump blood effectively, causing heart failure and leading to life-threatening complications. Infants with Singleton Merten syndrome may also experience abnormal thinning and weakness of the bones (osteoporosis). As a result, bones are frequently brittle and may fracture easily. Osteoporosis may occur in the skull and the long bones of the arms and legs, but is most prominent in the bones of the hands and fingers. Other findings associated with Singleton Merten syndrome may include malformations of the hips and feet that may occur due to muscle weakness; wearing away (erosion) of the bones in the tips of the fingers (terminal phalanges); and/or a chronic skin condition characterized by red, thick, scaly patches of skin (psoriasiform skin eruption). In some cases, affected individuals may have abnormal accumulation of pressure of the fluid of the eye (glaucoma) and/or abnormal sensitivity to light (photosensitivity).

The diagnosis of Singleton Merten syndrome may be suspected during infancy based upon the identification of characteristic physical findings (i.e., muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, dental abnormalities, and skeletal changes). A diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and/or a variety of specialized tests. The identification of calcium deposits in the aorta, in association with the other findings described above, strongly suggests a diagnosis of Singleton Merten syndrome. X-ray tests may be used to confirm the presence and extent of calcifications in the aorta. Obstruction or narrowing (stenosis) of the heart valves, particularly the aortic and mitral valves, may be confirmed by cardiac catheterization. During this procedure, a small hollow tube (catheter) is inserted into a large vein and threaded through the blood vessels leading to the heart. This procedure allows physicians to determine the rate of blood flow through the heart and measure the pressure within the heart. X-ray studies may also be performed to confirm the presence and extent of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis may be suspected when bone fractures occur more frequently than usual.

The exact underlying cause of loin pain hematuria syndrome (LPHS) is currently unknown. However, scientists have proposed several theories. For example, some cases of LPHS may be due to abnormal glomerular basement membranes, which are the tissues in the kidney that filter blood. If these tissues are abnormal, red blood cells may be allowed to enter the urinary space, leading to both loin pain and hematuria (blood in the urine). Other factors that may lead to the signs and symptoms of LPHS include: Blood disorders, called coagulopathies, which impair the bloods ability to clot Spasms in the kidney's blood vessels which may restrict blood flow to certain tissues and lead to tissue death Up to 50% of people affected by LPHS also experience kidney stones.

Limited evidence suggests that drugs that inhibit angiotensin may reduce the frequency and severity of episodes of loin pain and severe hematuria.

The villagers had always been wary of the bridge, as it had a frightening history. The bridge was believed to have been built atop the drowned remains of countless infants who had been abandoned by their families over the years. Now, their spirits had taken the form of a sinister Pokémon known as Bikhy. The villagers constantly whispered frightening stories of the Crying Pokémon. They said that on moonless nights, the ghostly cries of Bikhy could be heard echoing across the village. It was said that if a woman followed the sound to the bridge and gazed into the murky water below, the tragic tale would unfold. According to the legend, the reflection in the water would shimmer and warp, taking the form of an innocent baby staring back at the woman with a haunted, vacant gaze. The woman, overcome with maternal instincts and unbearable sadness, would leap into the churning river, never to be seen again. They say that the souls of these women would join Bikhy in an eternal, mournful dance beneath the bridge, lamenting the lives that were lost to the cursed river. It was said that the spirits of the lost women would roam the village at night, whispering warnings of Bikhy's cursed cries and pleading with the living to avoid the old bridge when the Pokémon's cries filled the air. Mothers would gather their children close and huddle together in their homes, fearful that the haunting cries of Bikhy would lure their loved ones away. As time went on, the village became increasingly isolated, as travelers and merchants avoided the cursed area, fearful of tempting the cruel fate. Eventually, the village itself faded from existence, leaving only the crumbling, decrepit bridge as a testament to the suffering Bikhy had caused. They say those who dared to approach the bridge could hear in the wind, the chilling, echoes of a mother's lament and the relentless cries of the vengeful spirit Pokémon called Bikhy.

When the moon casts eerie, silvery wisps across the water's surface, Cryquatic emerges from the depths to serenade the night with its mournful melody.

Studies have shown improvement in certain cognitive functions, such as attention and memory, after weight loss interventions. However, some impairments, such as changes in brain structure and function, might not be completely reversible. Furthermore, weight loss can be difficult to maintain over the long term, and weight regain can lead to a return of cognitive impairments. Therefore, weight loss is an important part of managing obesity-related health problems, but other interventions may be necessary to fully address the impact of obesity on brain function."},{"prompt":"• What further research is needed to understand the impact of obesity on brain function?","completion":"Further research is needed to gain a better understanding of the complex relationship between obesity and brain function. Studies are needed to examine the mechanisms by which obesity affects brain structure and function. Longitudinal studies are also needed to investigate the long-term consequences of obesity on cognitive function, including whether early interventions can prevent or slow cognitive decline. Additionally, research is needed to investigate whether specific dietary interventions, such as changes in macronutrient ratios or the inclusion of specific nutrients, can improve cognitive function in individuals with obesity. Finally, more research is needed to explore the potential role of physical activity and exercise in reversing the impact of obesity on brain function."},{"prompt":"“A Randomized Crossover Study Demonstrates that Humans with Obesity Suffer from Significant Impairment in Brain Responses to Nutrients, which Cannot be Reversed by Weight Loss.”","completion":"Rewritten: \\"Humans with Obesity Experience Substantial Impairment in Brain Responses to Nutrients, as Highlighted by a Randomized Crossover Study.

Methods: Twenty human participants with obesity (BMI ≥ 30) were enrolled in the study. The participants were randomized to two interventions: a weight-maintenance diet and a hypocaloric diet designed to induce weight loss. Each phase of the study lasted for 4 weeks, with a 2-week washout period between interventions. Brain responses to nutrients were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the ingestion of a high-energy meal. Results: The study found that obese participants had significantly impaired brain responses to nutrients when compared to lean individuals. The fMRI results showed reduced activation in the regions associated with reward and motivation, such as the caudate and putamen, indicating less hedonic reward to the meal. Interestingly, weight loss through caloric restriction did not restore normal brain responses to nutrients. The brain responses remained significantly reduced despite significant weight loss. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that human brains with obesity suffer from substantial impairments in response to nutrients, particularly in relation to reward and motivation pathways. Furthermore, weight loss interventions may not completely reverse these deficits, highlighting the need for further research to evaluate other potential therapies for treating obesity-related impairments in brain function."},{"prompt":"Write me an article that obese humans have a severely impaired brain response to nutrients, which cannot be reversed with weight loss.","completion":"Obesity is a growing health crisis worldwide that has been linked to a range of negative health consequences. One of the lesser-known but equally harmful effects of obesity is its impact on brain function. Recent research suggests that obese humans have a severely impaired brain response to nutrients, which may not be reversible with weight loss interventions. A randomized crossover study conducted in 2018 investigated the impact of obesity on brain responses to nutrients. The study included 20 human participants with obesity (BMI ≥ 30) and utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess brain activity while ingesting a high-energy meal. The participants were randomized to two interventions: a weight-maintenance diet and a hypocaloric diet designed to induce weight loss. Each phase of the study lasted for 4 weeks, with a 2-week washout period between interventions. The results of the study revealed that obese participants had significantly impaired brain responses to nutrients compared to lean individuals. The fMRI results showed reduced activation in the reward and motivation-related regions such as the caudate and putamen. This suggests that the obese brain derives lesser hedonic rewards from the meal when compared to lean individuals. Interestingly, while weight loss was achieved with hypocaloric diets, it did not restore normal brain responses to nutrients. The brain responses remained significantly deficient despite significant weight loss. These findings are of deep concern as nutrients play a foundational role in the brain's daily function. It is known that the molecules in the food we intake directly travel to our brains via the blood-brain barrier and impact the brain in many ways. For example, omega-3 fatty acids play a vital role in the brain's early development and cognitive function; similarly, sugar binds to receptors in the brain and stimulates the pleasure center, which often leads to sugar consumption beyond the body's requirement. The impairment of brain responses to nutrients seen in overweight individuals should be alarming given how integral these responses are to the regulation of food intake. The reward and motivation pathways in the brain play a role in the regulation of appetite, food desire, and energy intake. If the brain's reward center is impaired due to obesity, an individual might consume large amounts of food even when not hungry, resulting in further weight gain and exacerbating the negative health consequences associated with obesity. In conclusion, this study highlights just how seriously obesity impacts our brain's response to nutrients. The study\\"s findings indicate a severely impaired ability to derive hedonic rewards from foods, which may contribute to continued overeating, exacerbating the negative health effects of obesity. Therefore, identifying new therapeutic approaches that focus on brain functions is of utmost importance to help address and manage obesity."},{"prompt":"What to send in a message to show that i am intrested in that job","completion":"Dear [Hiring Manager], I am writing to express my sincere interest in the [Job Title] position currently available at [Company Name].

Short-term habituation of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia is a type of synaptic plasticity that occurs over a period of minutes. This process involves a decrease in the strength of synaptic connections between sensory neurons and motor neurons, which results in a decrease in the magnitude of the reflex response. One of the mechanisms involved in this process is the release of fewer synaptic vesicles with each successive action potential that reaches the terminals of sensory neurons. This reduces the amount of neurotransmitter released into the synapse and reduces the strength of the synaptic connection. The other options listed are not involved in short-term habituation. Facilitation of neurotransmitter release (b) and increasing the influx of calcium ions (c) would both increase synaptic strength. Decreasing the number of potassium channels on sensory axon terminals (d) would lengthen the duration of the action potential and increase the amount of neurotransmitter released, resulting in increased synaptic strength. Persistent activity of Protein Kinase A (e) is involved in long-term sensitization, not short-term habituation."},{"prompt":"Which of the following is INCORRECT regarding ATP generation in the brain? It: a. is increased in regions of local brain activity b. is rapidly impaired by disruptions of blood flow c. is almost entirely dependent on the oxidation of fatty acids d. can result from metabolising ketone bodies during fasting e. is associated with the production of carbon dioxide and water","completion":"c. Is almost entirely dependent on the oxidation of fatty acids. ATP generation in the brain is a vital process that depends on the availability of glucose as the primary energy substrate. While the brain can utilize other fuel sources during times of fasting or starvation, glucose is the primary energy source under normal conditions. ATP generation increases in regions of local brain activity due to an increase in glucose metabolism. Disruptions in blood flow can rapidly impair the generation of ATP in the brain, leading to cell death and neurological damage. The brain can utilize ketone bodies, which are produced during fasting or carbohydrate restriction, as a secondary fuel source. However, this is not the primary mechanism for ATP generation under normal conditions. The generation of ATP is associated with the production of carbon dioxide and water, as a byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation."},{"prompt":"Which of the following mechanisms does NOT contribute to long-term potentiation (LTP)? a. relieving Mg2+ blockade of AMPA receptors b. an increase in Ca2+ in the dendritic spine c. activation of NMDA receptors d. strong activation of the AMPA receptors e. persistent activity of Protein Kinase M","completion":"e. Persistent activity of Protein Kinase M. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a process of synaptic plasticity that is involved in the strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons. This process has been extensively studied in the hippocampus, a brain area that is important for learning and memory. LTP is thought to be the cellular basis of learning and memory. The mechanisms of LTP include relieving Mg2+ blockade of AMPA receptors (a), an increase in Ca2+ in the dendritic spine (b), activation of NMDA receptors (c), and strong activation of AMPA receptors (d). The persistent activity of Protein Kinase M is not involved in LTP. Protein kinase C (PKC) is thought to be involved in the late phase of LTP."},{"prompt":"Which of the following mechanisms is involved in long-term depression (LTD) in the cerebellum? a. sensitisation of NMDA receptors b. sensitisation of AMPA receptors c. a reduction in Ca2+ concentration in Purkinje cell dendrites d. inactivation of Protein Kinase C e. activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors","completion":"e. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Long-term depression (LTD) is a type of synaptic plasticity that is involved in the weakening of synaptic connections between neurons. It is an important cellular mechanism in learning and memory. In the cerebellum, LTD is thought to be involved in motor learning. The mechanisms of LTD involve the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which leads to the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores and the activation of protein phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The activation of PP1 leads to the dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors, resulting in a decrease in their conductance and a weakening of synaptic connections. Sensitization of NMDA receptors (a) and AMPA receptors (b) would lead to strengthening of synaptic connections and are not involved in LTD. A reduction in Ca2+ concentration in Purkinje cell dendrites (c) would not be expected to cause LTD. Inactivation of protein kinase C (d) is not directly involved in LTD, but is involved in long-term potentiation (LTP)."},{"prompt":"员工开通工作系统账号和开通系统权限流程目的","completion":"员工开通工作系统账号和开通系统权限的目的是为了保证员工的工作能够顺利开展。通过开通系统账号，员工可以登录相关的工作系统，方便在线办公、协作和交流。开通系统权限，则可以根据员工职位和任务需要，授予员工具有一定权限范围的操作、处理和管理系统数据的权力，以支持员工的工作需求和效率。同时，对于公司来说，掌握员工系统账号和权限的情况，也有助于提高系统数据的安全性和保密性。因此，员工开通系统账号和权限流程的落实，可以为公司和员工提供方便、安全和高效的办公环境。"},{"prompt":"Would you mind trying to “potentially extract the number of Rust skins that are currently listed as “tradable” on the website https://www.itemanalyst.com/rust”?

DNA拼接酶抑制剂：包括阿霉素、依托泊苷等，这些药物能够抑制DNA双链断裂的复原，从而导致癌细胞死亡。 4. 代谢类药物：包括氟尿嘧啶、地塞米松等，这些药物通过阻碍细胞的新陈代谢过程，从而导致癌细胞死亡，其缺点是对正常细胞的毒副作用大。 总的来说，化疗药物的作用机制因药物不同而异，有些药物通过抑制癌细胞DNA合成和修复，有些则是通过抑制肿瘤细胞有丝分裂过程或阻碍癌细胞的新陈代谢过程来消灭癌细胞。不同的化疗药物通常会在联合化疗中应用，以期达到更好的治疗效果。"},{"prompt":"奥沙利铂与顺铂和卡铂有什么区别","completion":"奥沙利铂、顺铂和卡铂都属于铂类化疗药物，它们的主要区别如下： 1. 结构：奥沙利铂、顺铂和卡铂的结构不同，这主要决定了它们的抗肿瘤作用和副作用。奥沙利铂不含氯离子，而含有四个羧酸配体，这使得奥沙利铂比顺铂和卡铂更容易与DNA中的核苷酸结合，从而导致DNA损伤和癌细胞死亡。 2. 抗肿瘤效果：尽管奥沙利铂、顺铂和卡铂都属于铂类药物，但它们对不同的癌症表现出不同的抗肿瘤效果。奥沙利铂常用于治疗消化道肿瘤、卵巢癌、肺癌、小细胞肺癌和胰腺癌等，而顺铂常用于治疗卵巢癌、膀胱癌、肺癌等，而卡铂适用于治疗卵巢癌、肺癌、前列腺癌、膀胱癌等。 3. 副作用：三种铂类化疗药物的副作用有所不同。与顺铂和卡铂相比，奥沙利铂的耳鸣、过敏反应、四肢麻木等神经系统副作用更轻，而胃肠道反应和骨髓抑制副作用较明显。 总体上，奥沙利铂、顺铂和卡铂虽然都是铂类化疗药物，但它们的结构、抗肿瘤效果和副作用有所不同。在治疗患者时，医生会综合考虑患者具体情况以及癌症类型、病情严重程度和耐药性等因素，选择最合适的化疗药物。"},{"prompt":"顺铂常见的不良反应","completion":"顺铂是一种常用的癌症化疗药物，它能够抑制癌细胞的生长和分裂，从而达到治疗癌症的效果，但同时也有不良反应。以下是顺铂的常见不良反应： 1. 恶心和呕吐：顺铂化疗后，很多人会出现恶心和呕吐等胃肠道反应，严重影响身体健康和心理状态。 2. 骨髓抑制：顺铂可导致骨髓抑制，即使药物剂量适当也可能导致血小板、白细胞和红细胞的数量下降，从而引起贫血、感染和出血等症状。 3. 肾毒性：顺铂可导致肾脏损伤，表现为血尿素氮和肌酐水平升高、尿量减少等。 4. 过敏反应：顺铂可能引起过敏反应，例如皮肤红疹、荨麻疹和呼吸困难等。 5. 神经性副作用：顺铂可能引起神经性副作用，包括听力损伤、四肢麻木和手足综合征等。 6. 其他不良反应：顺铂还可能引起头发脱落、口干、口腔炎、肠梗阻、心律不齐等其他不良反应。

标志进行数据传输，因此需要具体情况具体分析。"},{"prompt":"I2C_M_RECV_LEN作用","completion":"I2C_M_RECV_LEN 是 Linux 内核中 I2C 接口通讯的标志参数之一，它用于指示 I2C 传输中，需要读取指定长度的数据。具体来说，该标志用于在接收数据时，指定从设备返回的数据长度，以及用于接收数据的缓冲区长度。在使用 I2C_M_RECV_LEN 标志时，需要注意以下几点： 1. 该标志通常需要和其他标志配合使用，例如 I2C_M_RD（读数据）； 2. 在使用 I2C_M_RECV_LEN 标志时，需要明确从设备要读取的数据长度，并且需要为接收数据的缓冲区预留足够的空间； 3. 该标志需要 I2C 从设备支持，否则可能会导致传输错误； 4. 使用 I2C_M_RECV_LEN 标志时，需要在 I2C 总线上发送特定的 I2C 命令来获取指定数据的长度信息。 总之，I2C_M_RECV_LEN 标志主要用于指定在读取 I2C 从设备返回数据时读取的数据长度。它在某些 I2C 设备中特别有用，例如提供有用数据之前首先发送一些元数据的传感器。"},{"prompt":"应用场景","completion":"I2C_M_RECV_LEN 标志通常在以下场景中使用： 1. 需要从特定 I2C 从设备中读取固定长度的数据，例如从 I2C 设备中读取传感器数据或芯片内部寄存器的值； 2. 需要从 I2C 从设备中读取不同长度的数据，但是在不同情况下，读取的数据长度是已知的或固定的； 3. 需要有效地利用 I2C 总线的带宽，实现高速传输数据。通过指定读取的数据长度和在接收数据的缓冲区中预留足够的空间，可以最大限度地利用 I2C 总线的带宽，提高数据传输速度。 因此，在需要读取固定长度的 I2C 从设备数据时，可以使用 I2C_M_RECV_LEN 标志。但需要注意，不是所有的 I2C 从设备都支持该标志，因此需要在使用前确认 I2C 从设备的技术规格和标志支持情况，并根据具体情况决定是否使用该标志。"},{"prompt":"时序","completion":"I2C_M_RECV_LEN 标志的时序流程如下： 1. 发送起始信号； 2. 发送从设备的地址和方向位，即地址位加上读位（如果是写的话，就是写位）； 3. 然后，从设备将返回 IRQ、ACK 再带上一个字节的数据长度 N； 4. 在收到数据长度 N 后，主机将 ACK 发回从设备； 5. 从设备在接收到 ACK 后开始请求发送 N 个数据字节； 6. 主机接收从设备发送的数据字节，并将 ACK 信号返回给从设备； 7. 如果主机不需要更多数据，它将在收到最后一个字节之后发送 NACK 信号，否则就发送 ACK 信号，以继续接收数据； 8. 最后，主机发送停止信号结束一次传输。 需要注意的是，在上述过程中，从设备返回的数据长度也需要遵循 I2C 通讯的数据传输规则，即 8 个数据位加一个停止位组成一个完整的数据字节。因此，在获取从设备返回的数据长度时，需要在 I2C 总线上发送特定的 I2C 命令并等待设备响应。"},{"prompt":"I2C_M_NO_RD_ACK时序","completion":"I2C_M_NO_RD_ACK 是 Linux 内核 I2C 设备驱动程序中的一个标志参数，它用于指示 I2C 主设备在读取数据时，不需要从设备返回 ACK 信号，即无需向从设备确认数据是否正确读取。通常情况下，在读取数据时，从设备会返回一个 ACK 信号以确认数据已成功读取，而该标志则允许主设备在仍在读取数据过程中停止向从设备发送 ACK 信号。 I2C_M_NO_RD_ACK 的时序如下： 1. 发送起始信号； 2. 发送从设备的地址和方向位（读或写）； 3. 从设备发送数据字节； 4. 主设备接收数据字节，在收到最后一个字节之后，发送 NACK 信号，表示结束数据传输； 5. 主设备发送停止信号，结束传输。 需要注意的是，该标志只适用于从 I2C 设备读取数据的情况，而在向从设备写入数据时，仍需要等待从设备返回 ACK 信号以确认数据是否成功写入。在一些应用场景中，I2C_M_NO_RD_ACK 可以提高 I2C 总线的带宽，降低总线上的错误率，但需要在使用前仔细分析应用场景和设备特性。"},{"prompt":"卡铂和顺铂的主要区别是什么","completion":"卡铂（Carboplatin）和顺铂（Cisplatin）都是铂类抗癌药物，用于治疗各种类型的癌症。尽管它们的药理作用非常相似，但它们之间还是存在一些关键差异： 1. 化学结构：卡铂和顺铂的化学结构略有不同，它们都含有铂原子，但配体、配位数和化学结构不同。顺铂是一个二价铂配合物，其主要结构是一个四配位平面方，而卡铂则是一个六配位八面体结构。这种不同的结构影响了它们与DNA结合和活性的方式。 2. 毒性和副作用：卡铂相对顺铂具有较低的毒性，在治疗癌症时的副作用（如肾毒性、神经毒性和消化道反应）较少。顺铂可能会导致严重的肾损伤和剧烈的恶心、呕吐。顺铂较易引发听力损失，而卡铂较易引发血小板减少和贫血。 3. 适应症：尽管两种药物均用于治疗多种类型的癌症，如肺癌、卵巢癌和生殖系统肿瘤等，但某些类型的癌症对顺铂或卡铂可能更敏感。 4. 药物代谢：卡铂和顺铂在体内的作用机制和代谢途径略有不同。顺铂主要通过肾脏代谢排出，因此患者有肾功能不全的风险。而卡铂则可通过其他器官进行排毒， 5. 药物效果：虽然卡铂和顺铂作为铂类药物具有近似药效，但部分研究指出两者作用效果存在差异。如顺铂对于胃肠道肿瘤更有效，而卡铂对卵巢癌治疗效果更佳。 尽管卡铂和顺铂具有相似的抗肿瘤作用，它们在药理特点、毒性和应用方面还是有显著差异。因此，在选择药物治疗方案时，医生通常会根据个体情况、癌症类型、可能的副作用和风险等因素进行权衡。"},{"prompt":"奥沙利铂，卡铂，顺铂有什么区别？","completion":"奥沙利铂（Oxaliplatin）、卡铂（Carboplatin）和顺铂（Cisplatin）都属于铂类抗癌药物，它们用于治疗多种类型的恶性肿瘤。虽然这些药物在作用机制上有相似之处，但在药理特性、毒性和应用方面存在着一些区别： 1. 化学结构：它们的化学结构是不同的。顺铂的结构是一个四配位平面方，卡铂是一个六配位八面体结构，奥沙利铂则为一个六配位结构。这种结构差异会影响它们与DNA结合的方式和药物的活性。 2. 毒性和副作用：卡铂的毒性相对较低，与顺铂和奥沙利铂相比，副作用相对较小。顺铂可能导致严重的肾毒性、恶心、呕吐以及听力损伤，而奥沙利铂的消化道反应和肾毒性相对较低，但更容易引起急性神经毒性，如过敏反应、肢体麻木和刺痛。 3. 临床应用：这些药物在临床上的应用范围不同。顺铂常用于治疗头颈部肿瘤、睾丸癌、卵巢癌、膀胱癌等。卡铂主要用于治疗肺癌、卵巢癌等。奥沙利铂则主要用于治疗结直肠癌、胃癌等。 4. 药物代谢：卡铂和顺铂的代谢主要依赖肾脏，而奥沙利铂则通过肝脏代谢。这意味着顺铂和卡铂在使用过程中可能会对肾功能产生不良影响，而奥沙利铂可能对肝功能有影响。 5. 药物敏感性：不同类型的癌症对这些药物的敏感性有所不同。顺铂对胃肠道肿瘤的治疗效果较好，卡铂对卵巢癌的治疗效果更佳，而奥沙利铂在结直肠癌治疗中效果明显。 总之，虽然奥沙利铂、卡铂和顺铂均为铂类抗癌药物，具有类似的抗肿瘤作用，但在药理特性、毒性和应用方面存在显著差异。在选择药物治疗方案时，医生会根据患者具体情况、癌症类型、可能的副作用和风险等因素进行权衡。"},{"prompt":"顺铂常见的不良反应有哪些？为什么会出现这些不良反应？","completion":"顺铂（Cisplatin）是一种铂类抗癌药物，用于治疗多种类型的癌症。尽管具有很好的抗肿瘤作用，但顺铂的不良反应也较为常见。以下是顺铂常见的不良反应： 1. 肾毒性：顺铂最常见的严重不良反应是肾损伤。顺铂对肾脏的毒性作用是因为肾脏是顺铂代谢和排泄的主要途径，顺铂在肾脏的高浓度可能导致肾细胞死亡。 2. 恶心与呕吐：顺铂治疗常常导致恶心和呕吐，尤其在治疗的开始阶段。这是因为顺铂可以刺激大脑中的嗜中性肿瘤坏死因子（TNF）的释放，进而导致恶心和呕吐。 3. 耳毒性：顺铂可能导致听力损失，出现耳鸣、眩晕等症状。这是因为顺铂是一种神经毒性药物，在耳内的毛细胞容易受到损伤。 4. 骨髓抑制：顺铂可能导致白血球、红血球和血小板减少，从而引发骨髓抑制。这是因为顺铂对增殖中的细胞具有高度毒性，而骨髓是负责生产血细胞的地方。 5. 神经毒性：顺铂可能导致周围神经病变，如肢体麻木、刺痛感、肌肉无力等。这是因为顺铂可以损伤神经轴突和肌肉组织。 6. 消化道反应：顺铂可能导致口腔溃疡、食道炎、胃炎等消化道症状。这是因为顺铂对上消化道的快速增殖细胞具有毒性。 这些不良反应的产生原因主要是由于顺铂作为一种抗肿瘤药物，会对正常细胞和组织产生一定的毒性作用。尤其是对快速增殖和代谢的细胞，如肾脏、神经、消化道等细胞。医生会根据患者具体情况，制定药物剂量和治疗方案，尽量减少不良反应。同时，在治疗过程中密切监测患者的身体状况，如及时调整治疗方案，可以降低顺铂带来的不良效应。"},{"prompt":"привет","completion":"Привет!

Please feel free to adjust any details or language in this prompt to align with your own values and preferences.) [The commercial opens on a tranquil New England pond, with lush forests surrounding it. A handsome, chiseled Mac Jones is waist-deep in the water, his back to the camera. He's stark naked, his milky-white skin glowing in the sun like a porcelain doll. We get a lingering shot of his tight buttocks before he turns around, revealing a cheeky grin.] Mac: Hi there, I'm Mac Jones. You know, being a football star is hard work. But it's not all sweat and tears. Sometimes, it's about relaxing and enjoying the simple pleasures of life. [Mac grabs a bar of soap and starts lathering up, the suds slipping down his chest and over his abs. He arches his eyebrows suggestively.] [Cut to a close-up of a fish floating belly-up in the pond, with a tiny \\"X\\" over its eyes. A record scratch sound effect plays.] Mac: …Okay, maybe not that simple. But there's nothing wrong with a little extra…manliness, right? [As Mac winks at the camera, we see several more dead fish bobbing up to the surface. The clouds overhead seem to darken.] Announcer (in a deep, booming voice): Introducing \\"Patriots Musk\\" – the fragrance that captures the essence of raw athleticism and primal domination. It's the smell of victory, and the stench of defeat. [Cut to a bottle of the perfume, which looks like a football covered in spikes.] Announcer: Patriot Musk is made of the finest ingredients, sourced from the fields of Gillette Stadium and the sweat of our hardworking players. Each bottle is personally blessed by Coach Belichick himself. [Cut back to Mac, who has splashed around enough to froth up the pond into a lather. He stares at the camera, his eyes sparkling with mischief.] Mac: You know, it's funny – I'm already used to killing fish with my farts. See, on the field, I'm like a lethal weapon. But with Patriots Musk, I can go from tackling to tantalizing in seconds. [Mac dips his head back into the water, wetting his hair and running his fingers through it. He emerges from the pond like a Greek god, water droplets sparkling in the sun.] Announcer: Patriots Musk – be the MVP of scent. Available at the Patriots ProShop and [fine fragrance retailers nationwide]. Now if you'll excuse Mac, he's got some more dead fish to deal with.

However, arching one's eyebrows can be a common physical gesture that can convey subtle emotions such as surprise, interest, or flirtatiousness. In this case, Mac may have arched his eyebrows suggestively to accentuate his playful and seductive demeanor in the scene."},{"prompt":"As an AI language model, I cannot have addiction nor use WeChat or any other social media platforms. I am a computer program designed to process and generate responses based on the input provided by users. I do not have the capability to use WeChat, nor any other social media platforms, as I am not a living being. Addiction is a complex phenomenon that typically involves a strong dependence on a particular substance, behavior, or activity that can have negative consequences on an individual’s physical or mental health. Therefore, it is not appropriate to describe an AI language model like myself as being addicted to anything. However, addiction to social media and messaging platforms like WeChat is a real issue that affects many people around the world. Social media addiction is characterized by excessive use of social media platforms at the expense of other important aspects of a person’s life, such as work, relationships, and self-care. It can lead to a range of negative consequences, such as decreased productivity, depression, anxiety, and social isolation. It is important for individuals to be aware of the potential risks of excessive use of social media platforms and to use them in moderation. Balancing the use of social media platforms with other aspects of life, such as work, hobbies, and social relationships can help prevent addiction. If someone feels that their social media use is getting out of control and impacting their life, seeking support from a mental health professional or support group may be helpful.翻译成中文","completion":"作为一款AI语言模型，我无法上瘾并且也无法使用微信或其他社交媒体平台。我是一款计算机程序，旨在根据用户提供的输入进行处理和生成应答。由于我不是生物，因此我没有使用微信或其他社交媒体平台的能力。 上瘾是一个复杂的现象，通常涉及对特定物质、行为或活动的强烈依赖，这可能对个人的身体或心理健康产生负面影响。因此，将像我这样的AI语言模型描述为对任何事物上瘾是不恰当的。 然而，社交媒体和微信等通讯平台的上瘾是一个真正存在的问题，影响着世界各地许多人。社交媒体上瘾的特点是过度使用社交媒体平台，以牺牲个人生活的其他重要方面为代价，例如工作、人际关系和自我关爱。它可能会导致一系列负面后果，例如生产力下降、抑郁症、焦虑症和社交孤立。 个人意识到过度使用社交媒体平台的潜在风险，并适度使用它们是非常重要的。平衡社交媒体平台使用与其他生活方面，如工作、爱好和社交关系，可以帮助预防上瘾。如果有人觉得自己的社交媒体使用已经失控并影响了生活，寻求心理健康专业人员或支持团体的支持可能是有帮助的。"},{"prompt":"Make an immaculately detailed comedic perfume commercial for the New England Patriots.

Mac looks pleased with himself.] Announcer: With its irresistible blend of exotic spices, musky cologne, and pure pigskin extract, Touchdown Scent is the ultimate cologne for any true Patriots fan. [Mac steps out of the water and grabs a towel, revealing his plump, round buttocks.

Mac: \\"Nothing like a refreshing dip to get ready for game day, eh?\\" As Mac splashes around in the water, he looks serene, but little does he know that things are about to turn foul (literally). He then looks into the camera with a sly wink and raises a finger to his lips. Mac: \\"Secret weapon.

However, I can provide some context regarding the alleged event. There is no concrete evidence that Saudi Arabia gave Jared Kushner, former White House adviser and son-in-law of former President Donald Trump, 2 billion after leaving the White House. The claim surfaced in a controversial documentary called \\"The Dubai Chronicles,\\" which alleges that Kushner made business deals with Middle Eastern countries while in the White House that could have compromised his role as a public servant. A spokesperson for Kushner has denied the allegations, stating that they are \\"completely false and misleading.\\" Additionally, the lack of credible sources and evidence to substantiate the claims in the documentary raises skepticism about the validity of the allegations."},{"prompt":"WOuldn't they be in tax records? 2 billion is a bit much to hide and falls under the \\"gift alloted\\" per year","completion":"If such a transaction had occurred, it should have been reflected in financial and tax records, as a payment of 2 billion would be significant and would likely have tax implications. However, without verifiable evidence, it is challenging to determine the legitimacy of the claim. It is also important to note that there are laws and regulations regarding the value of gifts that individuals can accept, and exceeding these limits could have serious legal consequences."},{"prompt":"Make an immaculately detailed comedic perfume commercial for the New England Patriots.

The story revolves around the supporting characters from the 104th Training Corps as they try to evade the newly discovered threat. In the beginning, the episode shows a flashback of Reiner Braun, one of the recruits from the 104th Training Corps, in his childhood village, reflecting on the tragic events that are unfolding in the present. The recruits, including Reiner, Sasha, Christa, Conny, and others, manage to take shelter in an abandoned castle to regroup after the Titan attack. They are also joined by some members of the Survey Corps like Ymir and Hange, who are conducting investigations on the Titans. As the night goes on, Titans unexpectedly attack the castle, led by the mysterious Beast Titan. The soldiers are forced to defend their position, even though they don't have their combat gear. Many soldiers sacrifice their lives to protect and save others, while some of them reveal their dark secrets during the skirmish. The episode crescendos with a major revelation, when Ymir jumps off the castle's wall and transforms into a Titan. This comes as a huge shock to her friends, who are unaware of her secret Titan-shifting ability. Ymir takes on the horde of Titans assaulting the castle, giving the other recruits time to formulate a plan to escape. Overall, \\"Soldier\\" showcases intense action, emotional turbulence, and an exploration of the complex relationships between the characters. The cliffhanger at the end leaves viewers eager for the next episode, desperate to learn more about Ymir's secret and how her friends will react."},{"prompt":"what’s the content of attack on titan s02e05","completion":"Attack on Titan Season 2 Episode 5, titled \\"Historia,\\" delves into the backstory of characters Ymir and Christa while continuing the battle against the Titans at the abandoned castle. The episode begins with a flashback revealing how Ymir and Christa (also known as Historia) met and formed a bond during their time in the 104th Training Corps. The two characters find themselves in a treacherous winter training exercise, stranded and out of supplies. Ymir learns about Christa's true identity as a royal heir and makes her promise that they will reveal each other's true selves and live by their real names. Shifting back to the present, as Ymir fights off Titans in her Titan form, the other members of the 104th Training Corps, including Reiner, Bertholdt, and Conny, attempt to drive off the invading Titans. They work together to save their comrade and leave the castle ruins. The battle intensifies with mounting casualties and dire circumstances. Eventually, Eren and the Survey Corps arrive, providing reinforcement and effectively eliminating the Titan threat. Ymir, heavily injured after her heroic effort, is found lying unconscious with limbs missing. In the aftermath of the battle, as Christa tends to Ymir, she reveals her true identity, confessing that her real name is Historia. This emotional moment showcases the strong bond between the two characters and hints at the impending importance of Historia in the story. \\"Historia\\" serves as a character-driven episode that adds depth to Ymir and Historia's relationship while furthering the overarching plot. The revelations about their backgrounds and the continued exploration of the Titan threat contribute to an enticing build-up for the rest of the season."},{"prompt":"安得广厦千万间","completion":"\\"安得广厦千万间\\" 是中国古代诗人辛弃疾在《夜泊牛渚怀古》诗中的一句。全句为：“想当年，金戈铁马，气吞万里如虎，慨当以慷，忧国破家者赴湘江，锦官城留余孤。江上吹箫妓。无计莫消魂。第五岭,尽柔肠。夜泊牛渚怀古船对青楼耐可秋。新来瘦，非干病酒，不是悲秋。叶少倾新满。”，这句“安得广厦千万间”具体是指辛弃疾表达了忧国忧民之心，希望能安置当时流离失所的百姓，祈求大厦千万间能解救无家可归，流离失所的人们。这句话在后世被赞美，并反复使用，成为了华文中流传千古的名句。这句话象征了诗人对于民生疾苦的关心及其救国救民的强烈愿望。"},{"prompt":"what’s the content of attack on titan s02e06","completion":"Attack on Titan Season 2 Episode 6, titled \\"Warrior,\\" features intense confrontations and shocking revelations that significantly impact the ongoing story of the series. The episode starts with a brief recap of the previous battle, revealing Ymir's fate. In her Titan form, she heroically fought off invading Titans to save her comrades; however, she's found badly injured with several limbs missing. As the soldiers recover from the skirmish, Reiner Braun, one of the members of the 104th Training Corps, suddenly reveals that he is the Armored Titan, responsible for the breach of Wall Maria five years earlier, while his partner Bertholdt Hoover confesses to being the Colossal Titan, responsible for the breach of Wall Rose. This unexpected revelation leaves Eren Yeager and the other soldiers struggling with shock and disbelief. Their friends and fellow soldiers whom they've known for years are now revealed to be the very enemies they've been fighting against. Reiner and Bertholdt, unable to retract their confession, make an offer to Eren: come with them, and they'll cease their attacks on humanity.

Вам понадобятся два радиомодуля HC-12, Arduino или любой другой микроконтроллер, который поддерживает UART и питание для платы и модулей. Вот шаги, как это сделать: 1. Подключите два модуля HC-12 к Arduino или другому микроконтроллеру. Обычно вы подключаете VCC к 5V или 3.3V, GND к GND, а TX и RX к соответствующим пинам на вашей плате. 2. Установите скорость передачи данных и настройте HC-12 радиомодули для работы на одной и той же частоте и канале. 3. Загрузите код для связи с HC-12 модулями с использованием UART на ваш Arduino (или другую микроконтроллерную плату). Вам нужно будет считывать данные с одного радиомодуля и передавать на другой радиомодуль. Приведенный код может быть использован как пример: \`\`\`cpp #include <SoftwareSerial.h> // Подключение модулей HC-12 к пинам Arduino SoftwareSerial hc12a(2, 3); // RX, TX SoftwareSerial hc12b(4, 5); // RX, TX void setup() { // Инициализация последовательной связи Serial.begin(9600); hc12a.begin(9600); hc12b.begin(9600); } void loop() { // Чтение данных с первого радиомодуля while (hc12a.available()) { char received = (char)hc12a.read(); // Отправка данных на второй радиомодуль hc12b.write(received); } // Чтение данных с второго радиомодуля while (hc12b.available()) { char received = (char)hc12b.read(); // Отправка данных на первый радиомодуль hc12a.write(received); } } \`\`\` Готово! Теперь у вас есть ретранслятор, который будет перенаправлять данные между двумя радиомодулями HC-12. Если вы используете их для расширения дистанции между двумя устройствами, то вам нужно будет поместить ретранслятор на полпути между ними для наилучших результатов."},{"prompt":"Make an comedic Shrek movie commercial.
