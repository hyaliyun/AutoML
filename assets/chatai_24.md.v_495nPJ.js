First, we know Napoleon has 56 jelly beans. Sedrich has 9 more jelly beans than 3 times what Napoleon has. So, Sedrich has: 3 * 56 + 9 = 168 + 9 = 177 jelly beans. Daphne has twice as many jelly beans as the difference between Sedrich's and Napoleon's jelly beans. The difference between Sedrich's and Napoleon's jelly beans is: 177 - 56 = 121 jelly beans. So, Daphne has: 2 * 121 = 242 jelly beans. To find out how many jelly beans Alondra has, we first need to calculate the average number of jelly beans that Napoleon, Sedrich, and Daphne have. The sum of their jelly beans is: 56 + 177 + 242 = 475 jelly beans. The average is: 475 / 3 = 158.333... jelly beans. Alondra has 8 fewer jelly beans than this average, so she has: 158.333... - 8 ≈ 150.333... jelly beans. Since the number of jelly beans should be a whole number, we'll round Alondra's jelly beans to the nearest whole number, which is 150. Now, let's find the sum of all four people's jelly beans: 56 (Napoleon) + 177 (Sedrich) + 242 (Daphne) + 150 (Alondra) = 625 jelly beans. The sum of all four people's jelly beans is equal to 5 times the number of jelly beans that Mikey has.

The equation to represent the relationship for the parts made is derived from the proportion of steel used for each part. For part A, x meters cubed of steel produces 40x parts. For part B, (6-x) meters cubed of steel produces 240(6-x) parts.

The slope of the line ( A_i B_j ) is given by: [ frac{x_{A_i} - x_{B_j}}{y_{A_i} - y_{B_j}} = frac{y_{A_i}^2 - y_{B_j}^2}{y_{A_i} - y_{B_j}} = y_{A_i} + y_{B_j} ] 5. The equation of the line ( A_i B_j ) is of the form: [ x = (y_{A_i} + y_{B_j})(y - y_{A_i}) + x_{A_i} ] 6. Substituting ( y = 0 ) to find the ( x )-intercept of the line ( A_i B_j ): [ x = -(y_{A_i} + y_{B_j})y_{A_i} + x_{A_i} ] Since ( x_{A_i} = y_{A_i}^2 ), this becomes: [ x = -y_{A_i} y_{B_j} ] 7. Therefore, the horizontal coordinate of the intersection points of the lines ( A_{i} B_{j} ) with the ( x )-axis are (-y_{A_1} y_{B_1}), (-y_{A_2} y_{B_2}), (-y_{A_1} y_{B_2}), and (-y_{A_2} y_{B_1}). 8. Let ( S ) and ( T ) be the points where ( A_{1}B_{2}) and ( A_{2}B_{1} ) intersect the ( x )-axis respectively: [ x_{S} = -y_{A_1} y_{B_2}, quad x_{T} = -y_{A_2} y_{B_1} ] 9. The dot product ( overrightarrow{OS} cdot overrightarrow{OT} ) evaluates to: [ overrightarrow{OS} cdot overrightarrow{OT} = (-y_{A_1} y_{B_2})(-y_{A_2} y_{B_1}) = y_{A_1} y_{B_2} y_{A_2} y_{B_1} ] 10. The point ( P ) lies on the ( x )-axis, and its ( x )-coordinate is calculated as: [ x_P = -y_{A_1} y_{B_1} = -y_{A_2} y_{B_2} ] 11. Thus, the square of the distance from the origin to ( P ) is given by: [ |OP|^2 = (x_P)^2 = (-y_{A_1} y_{B_1})^2 = y_{A_1}^2 y_{B_1}^2 ] 12. As a result: [ overrightarrow{OS} cdot overrightarrow{OT} = |OP|^2 ] # Conclusion: ( boxed{overrightarrow{OS} cdot overrightarrow{OT} = |OP|^2} )"},{"prompt":"Rihanna has 50 to go to the supermarket.

Given that each dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, a single dog eats ( 4 text{ pounds} times 3 = 12 text{ pounds} ) of food per day. Since there are 3 dogs, the total amount of food the dogs eat in a day is ( 3 text{ dogs} times 12 text{ pounds/dog} = 36 text{ pounds} ). We know that each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy in one meal. Therefore, a puppy eats ( frac{4 text{ pounds}}{2} = 2 text{ pounds} ) of food in one meal. Since we are trying to find out how often puppies eat compared to dogs, we'll multiply the amount a puppy eats in one meal by ( x ) to represent the total amount a puppy eats in a day.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 7, and 9 can be found by multiplying the highest powers of all prime factors present in these numbers. The prime factorization of these numbers is: - 5 is a prime number itself. - 7 is a prime number itself. - 9 is 3^2. The LCM of 5, 7, and 9 is 5 * 7 * 3^2 = 5 * 7 * 9 = 315. Now, we want the remainder to be 4 when this number is divided by 5, 7, or 9. So we add 4 to the LCM to get the number that should be divisible by 5, 7, and 9 with a remainder of 4. LCM + remainder = 315 + 4 = 319. Now, we need to find the largest multiple of 319 that is less than or equal to 642. We can do this by dividing 642 by 319 and taking the integer part of the result. 642 ÷ 319 = 2 (with some remainder) The largest multiple of 319 that is less than or equal to 642 is 2 * 319 = 638. Now, to find the least number that should be subtracted from 642 to get a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, 7, and 9, we subtract 638 from 642. 642 - 638 = 4. However, since we already know that 638 will leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, 7, and 9, we don't actually need to subtract anything further. The number 638 is already the number we are looking for.

Find all the points Z in this plane for which the triangle XYZ is isosceles.","completion":"To find all points ( Z ) in the plane such that the triangle ( XYZ ) is isosceles, we need to consider the geometric properties of isosceles triangles. An isosceles triangle has at least two sides of equal length. Therefore, ( Z ) must satisfy one of the following conditions: 1. ( |XZ| = |YZ| ) 2. ( |XY| = |XZ| ) 3. ( |XY| = |YZ| ) However, since ( X ) and ( Y ) are fixed points, we focus on the condition ( |XZ| = |YZ| ), which implies that ( Z ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment ( overline{XY} ). 1. **Perpendicular Bisector Condition:** - The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is the locus of all points equidistant from the endpoints of the segment. Therefore, any point ( Z ) on the perpendicular bisector of ( overline{XY} ) will satisfy ( |XZ| = |YZ| ), making ( triangle XYZ ) isosceles. 2. **Circle Condition:** - Additionally, ( Z ) can lie on the circles centered at ( X ) and ( Y ) with radius ( |XY| ). These circles are defined as: - Circle centered at ( X ) with radius ( |XY| ) - Circle centered at ( Y ) with radius ( |XY| ) - Any point ( Z ) on these circles will satisfy ( |XZ| = |XY| ) or ( |YZ| = |XY| ), respectively, making ( triangle XYZ ) isosceles. 3. **Exclusion of Specific Points:** - The problem specifies that certain points must be excluded: 1. The midpoint of ( overline{XY} ): This point is equidistant from ( X ) and ( Y ) but does not form a valid triangle. 2. The extreme endpoints of the line segments ( overline{XY} ) and ( overline{YX} ) extended by their own lengths: These points lie on the line through ( X ) and ( Y ) and do not form a valid triangle. 3. The points ( X ) and ( Y ) themselves: These points do not form a valid triangle as they coincide with the vertices of the triangle. Therefore, the points ( Z ) that make ( triangle XYZ ) isosceles are all points on the perpendicular bisector of ( overline{XY} ) and on the circles centered at ( X ) and ( Y ) with radius ( |XY| ), excluding the specified points. The final answer is the set of points ( boxed{ Z } ) on the perpendicular bisector of ( overline{XY} ) and on the circles centered at ( X ) and ( Y ) with radius ( |XY| ), excluding the midpoint of ( overline{XY} ), the extreme endpoints of the line segments ( overline{XY} ) and ( overline{YX} ) extended by their own lengths, and the points ( X ) and ( Y )."},{"prompt":"f sugar is added to a cup of sugar water, the sugar water becomes sweeter.

Since the equation above holds true, we can confirm that our derivation is correct. Now, we can find the area of triangle PF_1 F_2 using the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides and the included angle: begin{align} Delta &= frac{1}{2} cdot d_1 cdot d_2 cdot sin(60^{circ}) &= frac{1}{2} cdot (2a - d_2) cdot d_2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} &= frac{sqrt{3}}{4} cdot (2ad_2 - d_2^2) end{align} 9. To find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area expression with respect to d_2 and set it equal to zero: begin{align} frac{d Delta}{d d_2} &= frac{sqrt{3}}{4} cdot (2a - 2d_2) 0 &= 2a - 2d_2 d_2 &= a end{align} 10. Substituting d_2 = a back into the expression for d_1 = 2a - d_2, we obtain d_1 = 2a - a = a. Now, we can find the maximum area: begin{align} Delta_{max} &= frac{sqrt{3}}{4} cdot (2ad_2 - d_2^2) &= frac{sqrt{3}}{4} cdot (2a^2 - a^2) &= frac{sqrt{3}}{4} cdot a^2 end{align} 11. Since the problem asks for an exact value, we must find the value of a. But, the problem statement only provides a > 2. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific value for the area. However, we can observe that the area is a fraction of a^2, which means the area must be a multiple of sqrt{3}. 12.

We need to show that there exist integers ( a, b, c ) such that ( ar_j + bs_j + ct_j ) is odd for at least ( frac{4N}{7} ) of the indices ( j ). 2. **Setting Up the Problem:** Consider the set (mathbb{Z}_2^3 - {(0,0,0)}), which consists of all non-zero 3-tuples of binary values (0 or 1).

The product of the roots is given by (frac{a}{a} = 1). These results are direct consequences of Vieta's formulas. Let's state these details step-by-step: 1. **Sum of the roots:** By Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) is given by: [ x_1 + x_2 = -frac{b}{a} ] 2. **Product of the roots:** Similarly, the product of the roots ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) is given by: [ x_1 x_2 = frac{c}{a} ] Given our quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + a = 0 ), here ( c = a ).

Hence the triangles ABC and ADC are equal by three sides, implying the diagonal (AC) bisects the angles BAD and BCD. 5. **Equality of Triangles**: Since the triangles ABC and ADC are equal, the angles formed are equal. Therefore, the angle bisectors intersect at a common point O, which lies on the diagonal AC. 6. **Concluding that Circle can be Inscribed**: The point O being the intersection of the angle bisectors means it is equidistant from all sides of the quadrilateral ABCD. Thus, O is the center of the circle that can be inscribed in the quadrilateral ABCD. boxed{text{Since O is equidistant from all sides, a circle can be inscribed within the quadrilateral ABCD.}} **Case When AB > AD**: 1. **Choosing Points on Segments Similarly**: On the segment AB, choose a point T such that AT = AD. Similarly, on the segment BC, choose a point S such that CS = CD. 2. **Triangle Midperpendiculars**: Since AT = AD, CS = CD, and T and S are such that they create isosceles triangles, the bisectors of the angles at B, A, and C are the midperpendiculars to the segments TS, DT and DS respectively. 3. **Intersection at the Center**: The bisectors of the angles intersect at a point (the center of the circle) that is equidistant from each side of the main triangle DTS. In each scenario, we see that the concepts hold true for cases of AB > AD and AB < AD as well. **In Summary**: With the details filled out, we proved that the equality of opposite sides' sums in a convex quadrilateral ensures that we can inscribe a circle within it. Further exploration of cases where AB > AD or AB < AD demonstrated that this holds regardless of relative side lengths, as long as the given sum conditions are met.

We need the probability that there are more black squares than white squares in this subset S to be 48%. 3. First, note that a 5 times 5 square on a uniformly colored alternating pattern chessboard will contain 13 squares of one color and 12 squares of the other — this is due to the parity of the total number of squares (5 each row and 5 each column). 4. The probability that S has more black squares than white squares in a 5 times 5 grid on the complete chessboard can be calculated under the constraint that the 5 times 5 grid placement is uniformly plausible and distributed. 5. Consider the possible placements for this 5 times 5 square within the larger k times k grid: - There are k - 4 options to place the left side of the 5 times 5 square starting from the left and moving to the right side of the k times k board. - Likewise, there are k - 4 options for the top side of the 5 times 5 square starting from the top down to the bottom side of the k times k board. 6.

To determine which of these have more black squares than white squares, observe that more black squares occur whenever the starting cell (top-left corner) of the 5 times 5 square is a black cell. 8. Assuming the chessboard size causes no overlap boundary issues, roughly half the total configurations of the 5 times 5 grid should guarantee more black squares (13 black, 12 white): - This is because if the top-left cell of the 5 times 5 grid is black, there will be more black cells. 9.

The sum of all three throws is 1050 meters, so we can write the equation: 2x (first throw) + x (second throw) + 4x (third throw) = 1050 meters Combining like terms, we get: 2x + x + 4x = 1050 7x = 1050 Now, we solve for x: x = 1050 / 7 x = 150 meters So the second throw was 150 meters.

In the number ab, a is in the tens (even) position and b is in the units (odd) position. So, the rule for divisibility by 11 gives us b - a = 0 or a multiple of 11. Given that the greatest possible value of b × a is 15, and knowing that b must be 0 or 5, we can deduce that b cannot be 0 because then b × a would be 0, which is not the greatest possible value.

Isolate the square root term: [ sqrt{1 + 24a_n} = 16a_{n+1} - 1 - 4a_n ] 4. Square both sides to eliminate the square root: [ 1 + 24a_n = (16a_{n+1} - 1 - 4a_n)^2 ] 5. Expand the right-hand side: [ 1 + 24a_n = (16a_{n+1} - 1 - 4a_n)^2 = (16a_{n+1} - 1 - 4a_n)(16a_{n+1} - 1 - 4a_n) ] [ 1 + 24a_n = (16a_{n+1} - 1)^2 - 2(16a_{n+1} - 1)(4a_n) + (4a_n)^2 ] [ 1 + 24a_n = 256a_{n+1}^2 - 32a_{n+1} + 1 - 128a_{n+1}a_n + 8a_n + 16a_n^2 ] 6. Simplify the equation: [ 1 + 24a_n = 256a_{n+1}^2 - 32a_{n+1} + 1 - 128a_{n+1}a_n + 8a_n + 16a_n^2 ] 7. Notice that the left-hand side is linear in (a_n), while the right-hand side is quadratic. This suggests a simpler approach might be needed. Let's introduce a new variable (b_n) such that: [ b_n = sqrt{24a_n + 1} ] 8. Substitute (b_n) into the recursion: [ b_{n+1} = sqrt{24a_{n+1} + 1} ] 9. From the recursion formula, we have: [ 24a_{n+1} + 1 = left(frac{sqrt{24a_n + 1} + 3}{2}right)^2 ] [ 24a_{n+1} + 1 = left(frac{b_n + 3}{2}right)^2 ] 10. Simplify the right-hand side: [ 24a_{n+1} + 1 = frac{(b_n + 3)^2}{4} ] [ 24a_{n+1} + 1 = frac{b_n^2 + 6b_n + 9}{4} ] [ 24a_{n+1} + 1 = frac{24a_n + 1 + 6b_n + 9}{4} ] [ 24a_{n+1} + 1 = frac{24a_n + 10 + 6b_n}{4} ] 11. Multiply both sides by 4: [ 96a_{n+1} + 4 = 24a_n + 10 + 6b_n ] [ 96a_{n+1} = 24a_n + 6b_n + 6 ] [ 16a_{n+1} = a_n + frac{b_n + 1}{4} ] 12. Since (b_n = sqrt{24a_n + 1}), we have: [ b_{n+1} = frac{b_n + 3}{2} ] 13. This is a linear recurrence relation for (b_n). Solving it, we get: [ b_n = 3 + 2^{2-n} ] 14. Substitute back to find (a_n): [ b_n = sqrt{24a_n + 1} = 3 + 2^{2-n} ] [ 24a_n + 1 = (3 + 2^{2-n})^2 ] [ 24a_n + 1 = 9 + 6 cdot 2^{2-n} + 2^{2(2-n)} ] [ 24a_n = 8 + 6 cdot 2^{2-n} + 2^{2(2-n)} ] [ a_n = frac{8 + 6 cdot 2^{2-n} + 2^{2(2-n)}}{24} ] [ a_n = frac{(3 + 2^{2-n})^2 - 1}{24} ] Conclusion: [ boxed{a_n = frac{(3 + 2^{2-n})^2 - 1}{24}} ]"},{"prompt":"Under what condition does the following sequence of equalities hold? frac{a+frac{abc}{abc+b}}{b+frac{abc}{aac+b}} = frac{afrac{ab}{a+2b}}{bfrac{ab}{2a+b}} = frac{frac{2ab}{ab}+a}{frac{2ab}{ab}b} = frac{a}{b}","completion":"We start by simplifying each equality separated expression in the given equation. 1.

The second fraction simplifies as follows: [ frac{a - frac{ab}{a + 2b}}{b - frac{ab}{2a + b}} ] First we separate the fractions: [ frac{a left(2a + bright) - ab}{b left(a + 2bright) - ab} ] This becomes: [ frac{2a^2 + ab - ab}{ab + 2b^2 - ab} = frac{2a^2}{ab + 2b^2} = frac{a left(2a + bright)}{b left(a + 2bright)} ] 3. The third fraction simplifies as follows: [ frac{frac{2ab}{a - b} + a}{frac{2ab}{a - b} - b} ] Simplifying the fractions: [ frac{2ab + a left(a - bright)}{2ab - b left(a - bright)} ] This becomes: [ frac{a^2 - ab + 2ab}{a - ab - b^2} = frac{a left(a - bright) + b left(2abright)}{left(a - bright) left(a - bright) + left(a - bright)^2} = left(frac{a}{b}right) ] Since all three simplified fractions are set to equal: [ frac{a}{b} ] We aim to find the conditions under which they remain true. 4.

Next, we ensure that they are mutually equal by: For the first two expressions: [ frac{a}{b} left(frac{a - ac + b}{a - bc + b} - 1right) = frac{a}{b} cdot frac{(b - a)c}{a - bc + b} ] This fraction equals (0) only if: [ a, c quad text{or} quad (b - a) = 0 ] Similarly for the other expressions: [ frac{a}{b} left(frac{2a + b}{a + 2b} - 1right) = frac{a}{b} cdot frac{a - b}{a + 2b} ] Again, this fraction equals (0) only if: [ a = 0 ] From above considerations, combining these, the equality holds if: [ a = 0 ] The final conditions can be expressed as: [ b(1 - c) neq 0 quad text{while} quad b neq 0, quad c neq 1 ] Thus, the conditions for equality: [ a = 0, quad b neq 0, quad c neq 1 ] Conclusion: [ boxed{a = 0, quad b neq 0, quad c neq 1} ]"},{"prompt":"Given point (A(1,2)), a line passing through point (D(5,2)) intersects the parabola (y^{2} = 4x) at two additional points (B) and (C).

For an even number of observations, it is the average of the two middle numbers. Given our sorted list, the two middle numbers are the 5^{th} and 6^{th} numbers, which are both 3. Thus, the median is: frac{3 + 3}{2} = 3 **For the mode (Option C):** The mode is the number that appears most frequently. In our list, both 2 and 3 appear three times, making them both modes.

Will the statement of the problem hold if the squares are positioned on the same side of the sides of the parallelogram as the parallelogram itself?","completion":"1. Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as A, B, C, and D. The four squares are constructed outside the parallelogram on the sides AB, BC, CD, and DA, with their centers being M_1, M_2, M_3, and M_4 respectively. 2. We need to prove that the quadrilateral formed by joining M_1, M_2, M_3, and M_4 is a square. 3. Observe that each M_i is the center of a square constructed on one side of the parallelogram, thus: - M_1 is the center of the square on side AB. - M_2 is the center of the square on side BC. - M_3 is the center of the square on side CD. - M_4 is the center of the square on side DA. 4. To show that M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4 form a square, we use symmetry and rotations. If you rotate the entire configuration by 90^circ about any M_i, you map parallelogram ABCD to itself. 5. Consider rotations: - A 90^circ rotation around M_1 maps A to a point A' such that AA' is perpendicular to AB and equal to the length of the side of the square. - Similarly, rotations around M_2, M_3, and M_4 map B, C, and D to B', C', and D' respectively. 6. These rotations imply that M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4 must form a figure with equal sides and right angles at the vertices, i.e., they form a square. 7. Alternatively, consider symmetry pairs: - Reflecting the parallelogram through any diagonal or side line divides it into symmetric configurations. This reflection symmetry and rotational arguments around the central points of the sides guarantee that the formed quadrilateral has the properties of a square due to equal distances maintained from reflections and symmetry. 8. The centers of the squares M_1, M_2, and M_3, M_4 result in a configuration such that the diagonals M_1M_3 and M_2M_4 are equal and intersect at right angles, confirming the square's properties. # Conclusion: Therefore, the centers M_1, M_2, M_3, and M_4 of the squares form a square themselves when constructed outside the given parallelogram ABCD.

In typical angle comparisons and based on standard trigonometric behaviors in the [0, pi/2) interval, cot x decreases as x increases. Since A < C, clearly cot A > cot C.

However, since the problem doesn't explicitly involve the tangent function, this isn't as straightforward without trial and examination specific to supplementary calculations. Therefore, specific verification does not immediately guarantee this answer. 4. **Option D: cos A < cos C** For observations within the [0,pi/2) interval, cos x decreases as x increases.

The reciprocal of 1 is 1, which is an integer. Therefore, ( 10^n ) does not affect the integrality of ( S_n ). 3. **Including 0**: The number 0 is not included in the range from 1 to ( 10^n ), so we do not need to consider it. 4. **Symmetry and Grouping**: Every number from 1 to ( 10^n - 1 ) can be expressed as an ( n )-digit number with leading zeros allowed. We can group numbers based on their digits. For example, the numbers 0113457789, 1224568890, and 2335679901 would be in the same group if we consider their digits cyclically. 5. **Number of Groups**: Each group has 10 numbers because there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9).

Notice that angle AQB = 90^circ because O, the incenter, and MN, the line connecting the points where incircle touches the sides, will be perpendicular. - In triangle AQO, since angle AQO = 90^circ and angle BAQ = 90^circ - frac{B}{2}, we get angle OAQ = 90^circ - frac{B}{2} - frac{A}{2} = frac{C}{2}. - Consequently, OQ = AO sin frac{C}{2}. 3. **Expression for MP**: - We need to express MP in terms of BC and other known quantities.

It is also angle A/2 + angle MPY. - Thus, angle MPY = 90^circ - frac{C}{2} - frac{A}{2} = frac{B}{2}. 4. **Calculating MP**: - By trigonometry, MP = frac{MY}{sin frac{B}{2}}.

Hence ( (b', b) ) is another pair with ( f(b), f(b'-b) geq f(b') ). - However, since ( f(b') < f(b) ), this contradicts the choice of ( (b, r) ). Therefore, such a pair does not exist. 3. **Lemma 3:** For any three distinct primes ( p_1, p_2, p_3 ), if ( log_{p_1} f(p_1) ) is the largest among ( log_{p_i} f(p_i) ) for ( i = 1, 2, 3 ), then ( log_{p_2} f(p_2) = log_{p_3} f(p_3) ). - Assume for the sake of contradiction that ( log_{p_2} f(p_2) > log_{p_3} f(p_3) ). - Let ( alpha = log_{p_2} f(p_2) ) and ( beta = log_{p_3} f(p_3) ). - Let ( k ) be a sufficiently large integer to be chosen later. - Let ( N ) be another sufficiently large integer to be chosen later. - Let ( n ) be the element in ( [N] backslash {1} ) that maximizes the pair ( (-log_n f(n), n) ) with respect to the lexicographical order. - If ( n leq sqrt{N} ), then we see that ( log_{n^2} f(n^2) = frac{1}{2} log_n f(n)^2 = log_n f(n) ) and thus ( (log_{n^2} f(n^2), n^2) ) has an even larger lexicographical order, which is a contradiction. - Therefore, ( n > sqrt{N} ). Let ( gamma = log_n f(n) ). Note that if ( N > p_3 ), then ( gamma leq beta ). Now consider the equation ( p_1^k x + p_2^k y = n ). Since ( gcd(p_1^k, p_2^k) = 1 ), by Bezout's theorem, there exist ( x_0, y_0 in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( p_1^k x_0 + p_2^k y_0 = n ). In general, we thus have ( x = x_0 + p_2^k t ) and ( y = y_0 - p_1^k t ) for ( t in mathbb{Z} ). Pick ( t ) so that ( |p_1^k x - n/2| leq p_1^k p_2^k / 2 ). Then we have ( p_1^k x, p_2^k y geq (n - p_1^k p_2^k) / 2 ). We will now show that the pair ( (n, p_1^k x) ) contradicts the previous lemma as long as we choose the parameters ( k, N ) properly. Indeed, pick ( k ) such that ( p_1^{k(alpha - beta)}, p_2^{k(alpha - beta)} geq 4^{beta} ), and then pick ( N geq max((2 p_1^k p_2^k)^2, p_3) ). Then ( n > 2 p_1^k p_2^k ) and so ( p_1^k x, p_2^k y > n / 4 ). Moreover, we have that ( f(p_1^k x) = f(p_1)^k f(x) geq p_1^{k alpha} x^{gamma} geq p_1^{k(alpha - beta)} (p_1^k x)^{gamma} geq (4 p_1^k x)^{gamma} geq n^{gamma} = f(n) ). Similarly, ( f(p_2^k y) geq f(n) ). This contradicts the previous lemma, as desired. From this lemma, we can easily see that except for a specified prime ( p_0 ), we have ( log_p f(p) ) is a constant. This constant should therefore be an integer, which is positive by the first lemma. Thus we see that ( f(x) = |x|^n s^{v_{p_0}(x)} ) for some positive integers ( n, s ) and some prime ( p_0 ). We now verify that any function of this form is indeed a solution. Indeed, for any ( a, b in mathbb{Z} ) with ( b neq 0 ), we may find ( q, r in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( a = bq + r ) and ( |r| < |b| ) with ( r = 0 ) or ( v_{p_0}(r) leq v_{p_0}(b) ), as otherwise we may instead take ( r' = r - b ) if ( r > 0 ) or ( r' = r + b ) if ( r < 0 ). With this, we now see that ( f(r) < f(b) ) holds when ( r = 0 ), and when ( r neq 0 ) we still have [ f(r) = |r|^n s^{v_{p_0}(r)} < |b|^n s^{v_{p_0}(b)} = f(b) ] as ( |r| < |b| ) and ( v_{p_0}(r) leq v_{p_0}(b) ). The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = |x|^n s^{v_{p_0}(x)} } ) for some positive integers ( n, s ) and some prime ( p_0 )."},{"prompt":"Given that the tendigit number ( N = a2018b2019 ), find the values of ( a ) and ( b ) such that 99 divides ( N ).","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of a and b such that the ten-digit number ( N = a , 2018 , b , 2019 ) is divisible by ( 99 ).

From this, we see it is logically consistent with the constraints and maximizes the number of barons, while ensuring every knight remains within the roles. # Conclusion: [ boxed{7} ]"},{"prompt":"The two squares in the figure share the same center O and each has sides of length 2 units.

For triangle ABC, the base is CB and the height is AC. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is frac{1}{2} times AC times CB. 2. **Calculate the area of triangle PBC**: Similarly, the area of triangle PBC can be calculated using the distance h from point P to line CB as the height. Thus, the area of triangle PBC is frac{1}{2} times h times CB. 3. **Condition for the area of triangle PBC to be less than half of the area of triangle ABC**: We want the area of triangle PBC to be less than half of the area of triangle ABC. This translates to frac{1}{2} times h times CB < frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times AC times CB. Simplifying this inequality, we find that h < frac{AC}{2}. 4. **Determine the location of point P**: For the condition h < frac{AC}{2} to hold, point P must be located below the line that connects the midpoints of AC and AB. Let's denote these midpoints as D and E, respectively. The line segment DE divides the triangle ABC into a smaller triangle ADE and a trapezoid DEBC. 5. **Calculate the ratio of the areas of triangles ADE and ABC**: Since triangles ADE and ABC are similar (by AA similarity), the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Given that D and E are midpoints, AD = frac{AC}{2}. Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle ADE to the area of triangle ABC is left(frac{AD}{AC}right)^2 = left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4}. 6. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that point P falls in the region that makes the area of triangle PBC less than half of the area of triangle ABC corresponds to the area of trapezoid DEBC relative to the area of triangle ABC. Since the area of triangle ADE is frac{1}{4} of the area of triangle ABC, the area of trapezoid DEBC is 1 - frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4}. Therefore, the probability that the area of triangle PBC is less than half of the area of triangle ABC is boxed{frac{3}{4}}."},{"prompt":"On Monday Mike collected 450 cans to recycle.

These edges form a graph where each edge represents one of the valid three-digit numbers ending in a non-zero digit. 4. According to the problem statement, and by Euler's theorem on Eulerian cycles, a Eulerian cycle exists in this graph if and only if all vertices have an even degree. This condition must hold since we need to traverse every edge exactly once. 5. Each digit from 1 to 9 must appear as the last digit of a number which allows us to connect it to the first digit of the next number sequentially.

Understanding Basic Requirements: To solve the problem, we need to ensure that any five people from a group of six can sit around a round table such that each pair of neighbors knows each other. This implies that everyone in the group knows at least three other people, otherwise, it would be impossible to satisfy the condition. 2. Observing the Minimum Number of Acquaintances: Let’s denote the people in the company by P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6. Assume that each person knows at least three others. If any person, say X, knew fewer than three people, we would face a contradiction. 3. Contradiction Argument: If we take person X who knows fewer than three other individuals, removing one of those acquaintances from the company, we would be left with a scenario where X knows one or no people in the group of five remaining individuals. This would make it impossible to arrange the five people such that X sits among them with neighbors being acquaintances, violating the initial assumption. 4. Consideration of All Scenarios: To demonstrate this rigorously, we need to analyze any possible arrangement of the five people excluding one at a time. Since any subgroup of five must meet the criteria of the problem, each person must necessarily have at least three friends among the others. 5. Arranging the Group: Now, let's take any five out of the six people and arrange them around the round table. According to the problem, this arrangement should be such that each neighboring pair knows each other. 6. Including the Sixth Person: Consider the sixth person P_6 who is the excluded one. By the previous arguments, P_6 knows at least three people in this group of five. Given that P_6 knows at least three people, there are three cases to consider: 1. P_6 knows exactly three people in the group. 2. P_6 knows four people in the group. 3. P_6 knows all five people in the group. 7. Finding Room for P_6: Since P_6 must know at least three people seated at the table, among these three people, there must be at least one pair who are neighbors due to the circular arrangement. We can place P_6 between this neighboring pair. This placement maintains the condition that all neighboring pairs are acquaintances. 8.

Therefore, we can write: U/S = 1/7 This means that there is 1 upgraded sensor for every 7 sensors on the satellite. Therefore, there are 6 non-upgraded sensors for every 7 sensors on the satellite. Now, let's denote the number of non-upgraded sensors on one unit as N. Since each unit contains the same number of non-upgraded sensors, the total number of non-upgraded sensors on the entire satellite is 24N.

According to the given information, we can set up the following system of equations: 1. For the total cost of helmets: 20x + 30y = 2920 2. For the difference in unit prices: x - y = 11 Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows: - Multiply the second equation by 20 to align with the coefficient of x in the first equation, giving us 20x - 20y = 220. - Add this result to the first equation to eliminate x: (20x + 30y) + (20x - 20y) = 2920 + 220. - Simplifying, we get 40x + 10y = 3140, and further simplification gives 40x = 3140 - 10y. - Substituting x = y + 11 into the first equation, we get 20(y + 11) + 30y = 2920. - Solving for y, we find y = 54. - Substituting y = 54 into x = y + 11, we find x = 65.

The conditions given are: - The number of type A helmets, m, should be at least half the number of type B helmets purchased, which gives us the inequality m geqslant frac{1}{2}(40 - m). - Solving this inequality, we find m geqslant frac{40}{3}. The total cost, w, considering the discounts, is calculated as: - For type A helmets, the cost after a 20% discount is 65 times 0.8m. - For type B helmets, the cost after a 6 yuan discount per helmet is (54 - 6)(40 - m). - Therefore, w = 52m + 48(40 - m) = 4m + 1920. Since the coefficient of m in the cost function is positive (4 > 0), the cost w increases as m increases. To minimize the cost, we choose the smallest integer value of m that satisfies the inequality, which is m = 14. Calculating the minimum total cost with m = 14: - w = 4 times 14 + 1920 = 1976 yuan.

If a function y=f(x) has an extreme value at a certain point, according to the definition of extreme values, the derivative of the function at this point must be 0.

Let's denote the short side of the rectangular strip as (a), the longer side of the white rectangle as (b), and the longer side of the grey rectangle as (c). 2. Initially, Dasha wrote down the areas of the two rectangles: - Area of the white rectangle: (a times b = ab) - Area of the grey rectangle: (a times c = ac) 3. Next, when the rectangles were overlaid as shown in the diagram, three smaller rectangles were formed. Their areas are: - Area of the rectangle formed by overlapping: (a times (b - a) = a(b - a)) - Area of the rectangle formed by the leftover part of the grey rectangle: (a^2) - Area of the rectangle formed by the leftover part of the white rectangle: (a times (c - a) = a(c - a)) 4. Summing up all the areas we have: ab + ac + a(b - a) + a^2 + a(c - a) 5.

Let circle P be the circumcircle of triangle AEF, which intersects circle O at T. The line TK intersects EF at M. Construct N as an isogonal conjugate point of M concerning triangle ABC. We need to prove that the points D, N, O are collinear. 2. **Connecting Key Points and Angles:** Connect AD which intersects circle P at S. Note that angle UAD = angle EAS = angle BCD since angles subtended by the same arc are equal in a circle. Additionally, the quadrilateral AUV D is cyclic, implying angle UAD = angle UVD = 90^{circ} - angle AVU = 90^{circ} - angle AFE. 3. **Right Angle Relationships:** Since angle EAS + angle AEF = 90^{circ}, it follows that line AS is a diameter of circle P. Thus, A, P, S, and D are concyclic. 4. **Parallel Lines and Similar Triangles:** Assume TK intersects circle P at L. Then, angle TLS = angle TAS = angle TKD. Since SL parallel DK parallel EF, the triangles triangle SEF and triangle LFE are congruent by the AA (Angle-Angle) Similarity Postulate. 5. **Angle Comparisons in Similar Triangles:** Different triangles will share angles: angle SEF = angle DAF = angle DBC and angle SFE = angle DAB = angle DCB. Therefore, triangle SEF is similar to triangle DBC. 6. **Properties of Isogonal Conjugates:** Consider point Q such that angle QEF = angle NBC and angle QFE = angle NCB. Hence, the quadrilateral QESF is similar to NBDC, and by appropriate similar triangles, derive: frac{sin angle QEF}{sin angle AEQ} times frac{sin angle EAS}{sin angle FAS} times frac{sin angle QFA}{sin angle QFE} = 1.

Transforming to lengths, it simplifies to: frac{ME}{BE} times frac{ES}{FS} times frac{CF}{MF} = 1. 8. **Equality Verification:** Given the similar triangle properties from earlier: frac{ME}{BE} times frac{FL}{EL} times frac{CF}{MF} = 1.

It is easy to see that the variable on the left side is (2^n), and the denominator on the right side is always (2), with the numerator being (n+2). From this inductive reasoning, it is not difficult to arrive at the (n)th inequality. The general steps of inductive reasoning are: ((1)) Observing individual cases to discover some common properties; ((2)) From the known common properties, deducing a clearly expressed general proposition (guess)."},{"prompt":"Calculate the expression frac{254_8}{13_3} + frac{203_5}{22_4} in base 10.","completion":"First, convert each number from its given base to base 10. 1.

Let's denote the given pentagon by ABCDE and the midpoints of the sides by A_1B_1C_1D_1E_1. Our objective is to reconstruct ABCDE using these midpoints. 1. **Identify the Midpoints**: First, we need to identify which point corresponds to which midpoint: - Assume B_1 is the midpoint of AB. - Assume C_1 is the midpoint of BC. - Assume D_1 is the midpoint of CD. - Assume E_1 is the midpoint of DE. - Assume A_1 is the midpoint of EA. 2. **Construct Parallel Lines**: - Draw a line segment F such that it connects the midpoint C_1 of BC and the midpoint E_1 of DE. - We know C_1E_1 is parallel to A_1D_1 and B_1E_1, as these are properties of mid-segments in polygons. This gives us the hint that extending these lines will help us in finding the vertices of the pentagon. 3. **Verify Parallelogram Formation**: - Since C_1D_1 is parallel to B_1D_1, and D_1E_1 is parallel to C_1E_1, we form a parallelogram C_1D_1E_1F. This helps in identifying the vertices of the pentagon. 4. **Construct the Missing Vertices**: - From point C_1 and point E_1, draw lines parallel to DE and CD respectively. These lines will intersect at point F. - Through F, draw a line parallel to AB. This will serve as a guide for more construction. 5. **Determine Lengths and Directions**: - The newly formed parallel lines from F intersect each other in such a way that they guide us towards finding B_1 and E_1. - Measure the distance from F to meet A_1 and B_1. Use a compass to ensure accurate transfer of length AB in both directions starting from F. 6. **Forming the Pentagon**: - Place the new point forms B_1 and E_1 which will then be our reference marks to form the entire pentagon. - Finally, connect all vertices B_1, C_1, D_1, E_1 to respective points forming the pentagon. # Conclusion: By using the above construction steps, we successfully build the required pentagon by making use of parallel lines and mid-segment properties. The vertices B_1 and E_1 are critical for laying out the complete pentagon's framework. The completed non-regular pentagon is thus determined. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"40% of a farmer's cattle are males.

Importantly, the turn to move passes to the black player. 3. **Hypothesis of white losing:** Suppose now that white, when both sides play optimally, is destined to lose. This implies that for every move white makes, there exists a counter-strategy for black that ensures a win for black. 4. **Contradiction using the turn switch:** If we consider the knight maneuver from step 2 (making an arbitrary knight move and then returning it), we see that after the knight returns to its initial position, not only is the board reset, but it is now black’s turn to move. This puts black in the same position white was at the start. If white, under optimal play, loses from the initial position, black now should be able to follow the same \\"optimal\\" strategy to defeat itself. 5. **Conclusion:** This forms a contradiction because black cannot have a winning strategy against itself. Therefore, the assumption that white necessarily loses cannot hold. Consequently, there is no guaranteed winning strategy for black, which means white has a strategy to avoid a loss (either win or draw).

We start by considering the equation of the circle: [ x^2 + y^2 = 1 ] This equation is satisfied by the point (0, 1), which lies on the y-axis. 2.

To find the intersection points of this line with the circle, substitute y = m x + 1 into the circle's equation: [ x^2 + (m x + 1)^2 = 1 ] 4.

The first solution, x_1 = 0, corresponds to the initial point (0,1). The second solution is x_2 = -frac{2m}{1 + m^2}. 8.

Thus, the second intersection point is: [ left( -frac{2m}{1 + m^2}, frac{1 - m^2}{1 + m^2}right) ] 10. If (m) is a rational number, both coordinates of the intersection point are rational. Since there are infinitely many rational numbers for (m), there are infinitely many points on the circle with rational coordinates. # Conclusion: There are indeed infinitely many points on the circle (x^2 + y^2 = 1) with rational coordinates as shown by the detailed steps above.

Since 450 has three prime factors (2, 3, and 5): - The exponent of 2 in any perfect square factor must be 0 (since any non-zero even number would exceed the exponent in the prime factorization of 450, as 450 only has one 2). - The exponents for 3 and 5 can be either 0 or 2 since both are already even and do not exceed their exponents in 450's prime factorization.

Suppose that ( zeta : mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) is a nonconstant function having the property that, for all ( l geq l_0 ), there exists a sequence of distinct positive integers ( a_1, ldots, a_l ) with [ zeta(a_1) = cdots = zeta(a_l). ] Then, there is no rational function ( f ) satisfying ( zeta(n) = f(n) ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). 3. **Proof of the Theorem**: Assume to the contrary that there exists a rational function ( f ) such that ( zeta(n) = f(n) ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). Since ( f ) is rational, we can write ( f(x) = frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} ) for some polynomials ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) in mathbb{R}[x] ). 4. **Choosing ( l )**: Take a sufficiently large positive integer ( l ) such that ( l > max(deg P, deg Q) ). By the assumption, we can write [ zeta(a_1) = cdots = zeta(a_l) = lambda ] for some positive integers ( a_1, ldots, a_l ) and ( lambda in mathbb{R} ). 5. **Constructing the Polynomial ( Omega(x) )**: Introduce the polynomial ( Omega(x) in mathbb{R}[x] ) defined by [ Omega(x) = P(x) - lambda Q(x). ] Since ( lambda = zeta(a_k) = f(a_k) = frac{P(a_k)}{Q(a_k)} ), we find that ( Omega(a_k) = 0 ) for all ( k leq l ). This implies that the polynomial ( Omega(x) ) has ( l ) distinct roots. 6. **Degree Argument**: Since ( deg(P(x) - lambda Q(x)) leq max(deg P, deg Q) < l ), the fundamental theorem of algebra implies that ( Omega ) is identically zero, so that ( P(x) equiv lambda Q(x) ). 7. **Conclusion for Rational Function**: Since ( f(x) = frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} ), this implies that ( f(x) equiv lambda ). It follows that ( zeta(n) = f(n) = lambda ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ), so that ( zeta : mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) is a constant function. This is a contradiction. 8. **Application to ( pi(x) )**: Now, we prove the main result. We need to show that the function ( pi ) satisfies the conditions in the theorem. 9. **Proposition for ( pi(x) )**: Let ( pi : mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{Z}_{geq 0} ) be the function defined by [ pi(n) = leftvert { p leq n mid p text{ is prime} } rightvert ] for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). Then, ( pi ) is nonconstant. However, for any ( l in mathbb{N} ), there exists a sequence of consecutive positive integers ( c+1, ldots, c+l ) such that [ pi(c+1) = cdots = pi(c+l). ] 10. **Proof of Proposition**: Since there are infinitely many primes, it's immediate that ( pi ) is not a constant function. The second assertion also follows from the fact that there exist arbitrary length sequences of consecutive composite numbers. 11. **Lemma for Composite Numbers**: Let ( l in mathbb{N} ). There are infinitely many ( c in mathbb{N} ) such that ( c+1, cdots, c+l ) are all composite numbers. 12. **First Proof of Lemma**: Since there are infinitely many primes, we can pick distinct primes ( p_1, cdots, p_l ). Consider the system of linear congruences [ begin{cases} x equiv -1 pmod{p_1}, x equiv -2 pmod{p_2}, vdots x equiv -l pmod{p_l}. end{cases} ] Since ( gcd(p_i, p_j) = 1 ) for all ( i neq j ), the Chinese Remainder Theorem implies that it has a unique solution modulo ( p_1 cdots p_l ). Hence, one may take a sufficiently large integer ( c > p_1 cdots p_l ) so that [ p_k mid c + k ] for all ( k leq l ). Since ( c + k > p_k ) and ( c + k ) is divisible by ( p_k ), we find that ( c + k ) is always composite. 13. **Second Proof of Lemma**: The ( l ) consecutive integers [ (l+1)! + 2, cdots, (l+1)! + l + 1 ] are all composite because ( (l+1)! + k ) is divisible by ( k ) for all ( k in {2, cdots, l+1} ). 14. **Conclusion**: Since ( pi ) satisfies the conditions of the theorem, there is no rational function ( f ) such that ( pi(n) = f(n) ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ).

Substituting k = 2, we get: [ c = sqrt{2} times 2 = 2sqrt{2}. ] Thus, the foci of the hyperbola xy = 4 are (2sqrt{2}, 2sqrt{2}) and (-2sqrt{2}, -2sqrt{2}). **Calculating the distance between the foci:** The distance between the points (2sqrt{2}, 2sqrt{2}) and (-2sqrt{2}, -2sqrt{2}) is given by the distance formula: [ text{Distance} = sqrt{[(2sqrt{2}) - (-2sqrt{2})]^2 + [(2sqrt{2}) - (-2sqrt{2})]^2} = sqrt{(4sqrt{2})^2 + (4sqrt{2})^2}. ] [ text{Distance} = sqrt{32 + 32} = sqrt{64} = 8. ] Thus, the distance between the foci is boxed{8}.

If the graph of f(x) coincides with its original graph after being rotated counterclockwise by dfrac{pi}{6} radians around the origin, the following steps describe the process to find the possible value of f(1). 1. Since the graph of f(x) is unchanged after a rotation of dfrac{pi}{6} radians around the origin, it means that for any point (x, f(x)) on the graph, its rotated image, which can be obtained using rotation matrix, (x', f(x')), should still lie on the graph of f(x). 2. The rotation matrix for an angle theta counterclockwise is given by: begin{bmatrix} costheta & -sintheta sintheta & costheta end{bmatrix} 3. For theta = dfrac{pi}{6}, the rotation matrix becomes: begin{bmatrix} cosdfrac{pi}{6} & -sindfrac{pi}{6} sindfrac{pi}{6} & cosdfrac{pi}{6} end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} & -dfrac{1}{2} dfrac{1}{2} & dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} end{bmatrix} 4. The point (1, f(1)) after rotation by dfrac{pi}{6} should yield a point (x', f(x')) that is still on the graph of f(x).

Simplifying the rotation operation, we obtain: begin{bmatrix} dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} - dfrac{1}{2}f(1) dfrac{1}{2} + dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}f(1) end{bmatrix} Since this rotated point is supposed to be on the original graph, its coordinates must satisfy the equation of f(x). 6. Given that the graph must coincide with itself, we consider the invariance of the point (1, f(1)). This leads us to the conclusion that f(1) must be equal to its y-coordinate after rotation: f(1) = dfrac{1}{2} + dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}f(1) 7. Solving for f(1) yields: dfrac{1}{2} = left( 1 - dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) f(1) f(1) = dfrac{dfrac{1}{2}}{1 - dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = dfrac{dfrac{1}{2}}{dfrac{2 - sqrt{3}}{2}} = dfrac{1}{2 - sqrt{3}} 8. Multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate 2 + sqrt{3} gives us: f(1) = dfrac{1}{2 - sqrt{3}} cdot dfrac{2 + sqrt{3}}{2 + sqrt{3}} = dfrac{2 + sqrt{3}}{(2 - sqrt{3})(2 + sqrt{3})} = dfrac{2 + sqrt{3}}{2^2 - left(sqrt{3}right)^2} = dfrac{2 + sqrt{3}}{4 - 3} 9.

However, we might have made a mistake in our assumption that f(1) equates to the y-coordinate after rotation. The correct approach would not involve solving for f(1) explicitly but rather realizing that after rotation, the coordinates of any point, and in particular the point where x = 1, must still satisfy f(x). Essentially, the point (1, f(1)) is invariant under the rotation. We know that rotating (1, 0), which is the point on the x-axis, by frac{pi}{6} radians counterclockwise will place it at (cos frac{pi}{6}, sin frac{pi}{6}), which is (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{1}{2}).

First, we are given two functional equations: 1. f(x) = x^3fleft(frac{1}{x}right), which applies for all x in the domain (-infty, 0) cup (0, +infty). 2. f(x) + f(y) - 2xy = f(x+y), which applies for all x, y in the domain. **Step 1:** Find the value of f(0). Given the second functional equation, let's substitute x=y=0: [f(0) + f(0) - 2cdot0cdot0 = f(0+0) implies 2f(0) = f(0).] Subtracting f(0) from both sides gives f(0) = 0. **Step 2:** Use the functional equations to find f(1) and f(-1). Substituting x=1 and y=-1 into the second functional equation gives: [f(1) + f(-1) - 2cdot1cdot(-1) = f(1-1) implies f(1) + f(-1) + 2 = f(0).] Since we know f(0) = 0, this simplifies to f(1) + f(-1) = -2. Now, using the first functional equation with x=-1, we get: [f(-1) = (-1)^3fleft(frac{1}{-1}right) = -f(-1).] This implies f(-1) = 0. Substituting this into our equation for f(1) + f(-1) = -2, we find f(1) = -2. **Step 3:** Find the value of f(2). Substituting x=y=1 into the second functional equation: [f(1) + f(1) - 2cdot1cdot1 = f(1+1) implies 2f(1) - 2 = f(2).] Substituting the value of f(1) = -2, we get f(2) = 2(-2) - 2 = -4 - 2 = -6. **Step 4:** Finally, find the value of f(4).

The cost of jags, jigs, and jogs are 1, 2, and 7 each, respectively. Bill must buy at least one of each item, which means the minimum amount he has to spend on jags and jigs is 1 + 2 = 3. Now, let's consider the maximum number of jogs Bill can buy. If he were to buy 7 jogs, the cost would be 7 times 7 = 49.

Step 1: Express the term: [ left(1 + x^5 + x^7 + x^9right)^{16} ] The term ( x^{29} ) is to be obtained by selecting specific combinations of the terms ( 1, x^5, x^7, x^9 ) from the 16 binomial factors. The exponent sum must equal 29. Step 2: Setup for ( x^{29} ): Identify how selecting ( x^5, x^7, x^9 ) repeatedly sums up to 29. Suppose we pick ( a ) times ( x^5 ), ( b ) times ( x^7 ), and ( c ) times ( x^9 ). Thus, we need: [ 5a + 7b + 9c = 29 ] and [ a + b + c = 16 ] Step 3: Logical combinations: We need ( 5a + 7b + 9c = 29 ). By checking viable integer solutions for ( a, b, c ), it can be determined: - ( a = 3 ) - ( b = 2 ) - ( c = 11 ) This doesn’t fit because ( a + b + c ) needs to be 16 (since there are 16 terms), so let's review the missing logic in the sums: Let's correct that ( 5 + 5 + 9 neq 4k).

Thus, (FN) bisects (angle AFG). - Since (FN) is the angle bisector, we have (angle GFN = angle AFN). 3. **Angle Relationships:** - Note that (angle AFN = angle EFK) because (F) is the point of tangency and (FN) is the angle bisector. - Also, (angle EFK = angle EKF) because (F) and (K) are points of tangency. - Therefore, (angle GFN = angle EKF). 4. **Similar Triangles:** - Since (angle EKF = angle BKM) (both are angles subtended by the same arc in the circle (omega)), we have (angle GFN = angle BKM). - Also, (angle GNF = 180^circ - angle ANF = angle BMK) because (FN) is the angle bisector and (M) and (N) lie on the same line. - Thus, (triangle GFN sim triangle BKM) by AA similarity criterion. 5. **Proportionality:** - From the similarity of (triangle GFN) and (triangle BKM), we get: [ frac{GF}{GN} = frac{BK}{BM} ] - Since (F) and (K) are points of tangency, we have: [ frac{FA}{AN} = frac{AP}{AN} ] - Therefore, combining these ratios, we get: [ frac{BP}{BM} = frac{AP}{AN} ] 6. **Right Angles and Similar Triangles:** - Since (angle PBM = angle PAN = 90^circ), it follows that (triangle BPM sim triangle APN) by AA similarity criterion. 7. **Arc and Angle Relationships:** - In the circle (omega), the angles subtended by the same arc are equal.

Looking at divisibility by 5, since p is prime and greater than 5, p has to leave a remainder of 1, 2, 3, or 4 when divided by 5. This means p^2 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 (since 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2 all leave remainder 1 mod 5). Thus, p^2 - 1 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 5. Next, for divisibility by 3, similar to the original problem, since p is not divisible by 3, then p must be 1 or 2 more than a multiple of 3, making either p-1 or p+1 divisible by 3.

We need to demonstrate that it is possible to partition the students into two groups such that within each group, each student knows at most one other student. 2. **Choosing an Optimal Partition**: We'll select a partition of students into two groups in such a way that the total number of acquaintances within the same group is minimized. 3. **Proof by Contradiction**: Suppose, for contradiction, that in one of the groups, there is a student who knows at least two other students within the same group. Let's say this student is in group A and knows at least two other students within group A. We aim to show that moving this student to the other group (group B) reduces the overall number of intra-group acquaintances. 4. **Reduction Argument**: - Assume the student in question is named ( S ). - If ( S ) knows at least two other students within group A, then moving ( S ) to group B means ( S ) would then know fewer students within group A. - By moving ( S ), we ensure that ( S ) knows no more than one other person in the new group B. 5. **Minimizing Acquaintances**: By moving ( S ) to group B, we reduce the count of intra-group acquaintances for group A without increasing it for group B, thus reducing the cumulative total number of intra-group acquaintances. This contradicts our initial assumption about having selected a partition that minimizes the total acquaintances. 6. **Optimal Partition Achievement**: The contradiction implies that there cannot exist a student within any group who knows more than one other student within the same group once the partition is optimal. 7. **Conclusion**: Hence, we can partition the students into two groups such that within each group, each student is acquainted with at most one other student.

Using the assumed condition for k and working backward, we obtain: [ a_{k-1} > frac{k-1}{k} left(1 + a_kright) ] [ = frac{k-1}{k} + frac{k-1}{k} cdot a_k ] [ > (k-1) left(frac{1}{k} + frac{1}{k+1} + cdots + frac{1}{n+1}right) ] 6. Since the assumption is true for arbitrary k leq n, it extends all the way back to: [ a_1 > frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + cdots + frac{1}{n+1} ] 7. Now, let's analyze the harmonic series' growth. Notice the harmonic series' properties: [ frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{4} + cdots + frac{1}{n+1} > frac{1}{2} + left(frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4}right) + cdots + left(frac{1}{2^n} + cdots + frac{1}{2^n}right) ] [ = frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{4} + frac{4}{8} + cdots approx frac{1}{2} cdot n ] # Conclusion: Given the bound of the harmonic series and the inequality established, it is evident that it diverges, making the sequence unbounded—contradicting the possibility of having a finite {a_n} sequence satisfying the conditions.

Triangle AMB is congruent to triangle DMC, hence triangles ABC and ACD have equal area. Using the relationship AD = 2AM, we find AD = 24, and since AM = 12, BC = AB + AC = 9 + 17 = 26. Here AD = 24, not simply the sum of AB and AC due to the effect of extending AM. The semi-perimeter of triangle ACD would be (9 + 17 + 26)/2 = 26. Using Heron's formula, the area A of triangle ACD is: A = sqrt{26 times (26 - 9) times (26 - 17) times (26 - 26)} However, (26 - 26) = 0, thus: A = sqrt{0} = 0 This reveals an inconsistency as the calculation does not reflect the true geometry of the problem which expects a non-zero area. Re-examining, we realize that the actual side BC should be determined correctly by applying the Apollonius theorem involving the median, not just added. Recomputing BC using properties of medians: BC^2 = 2(AB^2 + AC^2) - frac{1}{2}AD^2 BC^2 = 2(9^2 + 17^2) - frac{1}{2}(24^2) = 2(81 + 289) - frac{1}{2}(576) BC^2 = 740 - 288 = 452 BC = sqrt{452} Now recalculate the semi-perimeter s = frac{9 + 17 + sqrt{452}}{2} and use Heron’s formula: A = sqrt{s(s - 9)(s - 17)(s - sqrt{452})}.

Since the average price of a pencil before tax is 2.00 USD, the total cost for 75 pencils would be: 75 pencils * 2.00 USD/pencil = 150 USD Now, we know that a tax of 5% was added to the pencils, so the total cost of pencils after tax would be: 150 USD + (5% of 150 USD) = 150 USD + (0.05 * 150 USD) = 150 USD + 7.5 USD = 157.5 USD Now, let's calculate the total cost of pens before the discount. We know the total cost of pens and pencils together is 570 USD, and we have already calculated the cost of pencils after tax, so: Total cost of pens and pencils = 570 USD Total cost of pencils after tax = 157.5 USD Total cost of pens before discount = 570 USD - 157.5 USD = 412.5 USD Since a discount of 10% was applied to the pens, the cost before the discount was higher. Let's find the original price before the discount: Let the original price of pens be P USD. After a 10% discount, the price becomes P - (10% of P) = P - (0.10 * P) = 0.90P We know that 0.90P = 412.5 USD, so: P = 412.5 USD / 0.90 = 458.33 USD (rounded to two decimal places) Now, we have the total cost of pens before the discount. To find the average price of one pen before the discount, we divide this total cost by the number of pens: Average price of one pen before discount = 458.33 USD / 30 pens = 15.28 USD/pen (rounded to two decimal places) Finally, we need to convert this average price from USD to Euros using the given conversion rate of 1 USD = 0.85 Euros: Average price of one pen before discount in Euros = 15.28 USD/pen * 0.85 Euros/USD = 12.99 Euros/pen (rounded to two decimal places) So, the average price of a pen before the discount in Euros is approximately boxed{12.99} Euros."},{"prompt":"A kitten and two dogs together weigh 36 pounds.

Now combine p(x) and q(x): [ p(x) + q(x) = 2 - 3x^2 + 18x - 24 ] Simplify to: [ p(x) + q(x) = -3x^2 + 18x - 22 ] Thus, the final expression for p(x) + q(x) is boxed{-3x^2 + 18x - 22}."},{"prompt":"Prove that a convex regular polygon with ( 3k ) sides, where ( k > 4 ) is an integer, has diagonals whose lengths are equal to the sum of the lengths of two shorter diagonals.","completion":"We need to prove that in a convex regular polygon with 3k sides, where k>4 is an integer, there exist diagonals whose lengths are equal to the sum of the lengths of two shorter diagonals. 1. **Setup of the Geometric Configuration**: - Consider a regular polygon with 3k sides denoted as A_0, A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{3k-1}. We aim to show that there are diagonals meeting the given criteria. - Let's examine a triangle ABC where angle C = 120^circ, with CA geq CB. - Extend AC beyond C to a point D such that CD = CB. - Reflect point D over line AB to get point E. 2. **Properties and Observation**: - The triangle BCD is equilateral because all sides are equal (BC = CD = BD). - Thus, angle AEB = angle ADB = 60^circ. - This means that AECB forms a cyclic quadrilateral because angle AEB = 180^circ - angle ACB, and point E lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. - Furthermore, AE = AD = AC + CB, which is the required property we need to show for the diagonals of our polygon. 3. **Connecting to the Regular Polygon**: - To demonstrate this for any regular polygon with 3k sides, place our vertices A = A_k, B = A_0. The central angle subtended by these vertices will be angle A_0 O A_k = frac{360^circ k}{3k} = 120^circ. - Conversely, the longer arc subtends a central angle of 240^circ, ensuring that any vertex C on the shorter arc A_0A_k (not adjacent to A_0 or A_k) will create an angle angle A_0CA_k = 120^circ. 4. **Choosing Points**: - We choose any A_i for C, where 2 leq i leq k-2 (ensuring C is neither A_1 nor A_{k-1}). - For such configurations, E will also be another vertex (since E is the reflection of C about AO). 5. **Conclusion**: - This shows that for the given k > 4, there are particular diagonals in a 3k-gon where one diagonal’s length is equal to the sum of two shorter diagonals’, affirming the statement. Hence, the proof concludes that the given claim holds for any convex regular polygon with 3k sides, where k>4. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A train 180 m long running at the speed of 72 km / hr takes to cross a bridge 270 m in length.

According to the ratio, we have: Pa / Pb / Pc = 4 / 5 / 6 We also know that the difference between the profit shares of a and c is Rs. 599.9999999999999 (which we can round to Rs. 600 for simplicity). Therefore: Pc - Pa = Rs. 600 Using the ratio, we can express Pc and Pa in terms of the total profit P: Pa = (4/15) * P Pc = (6/15) * P Substituting these expressions into the difference equation, we get: (6/15) * P - (4/15) * P = Rs. 600 (2/15) * P = Rs. 600 Now, we can solve for the total profit P: P = Rs. 600 * (15/2) P = Rs. 4500 Now that we have the total profit, we can find the profit share of b (Pb): Pb = (5/15) * P Pb = (5/15) * Rs. 4500 Pb = (1/3) * Rs. 4500 Pb = Rs. 1500 Therefore, the profit share of b is Rs. boxed{1500} ."},{"prompt":"A particular solution ( y_{1}(x) = e^{x} ) of the Riccati equation (frac{d y}{d x} + 2 e^{x} y y^{2}(x) = e^{x} + e^{2 x}) is known.

When extended these lines define additional intersection points on the sides of the square. 6. **Choose points to ensure a convex structure:** - If these points do not line up collinearly and consider the combination of points like A, P, F, G, Q.

If intersections occur on different boundaries or edges of the square not including one side, then a convex pentagon is formed by chosen points which lie on the outside along with inner point A.

This means each ( E_i ) is itself a convex set since the homothety of a convex set is convex. 6. **Applying Helly’s Theorem:** By Helly's Theorem, for any collection of convex sets in ( mathbb{R}^2 ), if the intersection of every three sets is non-empty, then the intersection of all the sets is non-empty. 7. **Checking Intersection of Triplets:** To use Helly’s Theorem, we need to show that any three such sets ( E_i, E_j, E_k ) have a common intersection point. 8. **Finding a Common Point:** Consider the triangle formed by any triplet of points ( A_i, A_j, A_k ). The centroid (barycenter) of this triangle is given by: [ G = frac{A_i + A_j + A_k}{3} ] This centroid lies within the convex polygon ( P ) as the polygon is convex, and a homothety of ( P ) centered at each ( A_i, A_j, A_k ) and a ratio of ( frac{2}{3} ) will include ( G ). 9. **Conclusion:** Since ( G ) lies within ( P ) and is within each of the homothety sets ( E_i, E_j, E_k ), thus these sets intersect in ( G ). By Helly’s Theorem, we conclude that the intersection of all sets ( E_i ) is non-empty.

Therefore, the total cost after the discount for the novels is 130 - 26 = 104. Next, the cost of lunch: The cost of one novel is 13, so three times this cost is 13 * 3 = 39. The tax on the lunch is 12%, so the tax amount is (12/100) * 39 = 4.68. Therefore, the total cost for lunch including tax is 39 + 4.68 = 43.68.

We know that: Machine A processes 6000 envelopes in 3 hours, so A = 6000 envelopes / 3 hours = 2000 envelopes/hour. Machines B and C together process 6000 envelopes in 2.5 hours, so B + C = 6000 envelopes / 2.5 hours = 2400 envelopes/hour. Machines A and C together process 3000 envelopes in 1 hour, so A + C = 3000 envelopes / 1 hour = 3000 envelopes/hour. We already know that A = 2000 envelopes/hour, so we can substitute this into the equation for A + C to find C: 2000 + C = 3000 C = 3000 - 2000 C = 1000 envelopes/hour. Now we can find B by subtracting C from the combined rate of B and C: B + C = 2400 B + 1000 = 2400 B = 2400 - 1000 B = 1400 envelopes/hour. Now, if we want to find out how many hours it would take Machine B to process a certain number of envelopes, let's call that number X.

If S_{3}=a_{6}, then a_{2}=______.","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the properties of an arithmetic sequence and the formula for the sum of its first n terms. Given that the common difference is 1, we can express the terms of the sequence as follows: - The first term is a_{1}. - The second term is a_{2} = a_{1} + 1. - The third term is a_{3} = a_{2} + 1 = a_{1} + 2. - And so on. The sum of the first n terms, S_{n}, can be calculated using the formula S_{n} = frac{n}{2}(2a_{1} + (n-1)d), where d is the common difference. Since d=1, for S_{3}, we have: [S_{3} = frac{3}{2}(2a_{1} + (3-1)cdot1) = frac{3}{2}(2a_{1} + 2) = 3a_{1} + 3] Given that S_{3} = a_{6}, and knowing that a_{6} = a_{1} + 5, we can set up the equation: [3a_{1} + 3 = a_{1} + 5] Solving for a_{1}, we subtract a_{1} and 3 from both sides: [2a_{1} = 2] [a_{1} = 1] Knowing a_{1}, we can find a_{2}: [a_{2} = a_{1} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2] Therefore, the value of a_{2} in the given arithmetic sequence is boxed{2}."},{"prompt":"Find the total number of prime factors in an expression where 4 is raised to the power of 11, 7 is raised to a certain power, and 11 is raised to the power of 2.

The term (11^2) is already a prime number raised to a power, so it has 2 prime factors of 11. Now, we are told that the total number of prime factors is 29. We already have 22 from (4^{11}) and 2 from (11^2), which adds up to 24 prime factors. To find the number of prime factors that 7 contributes, we subtract the known prime factors from the total: (29 - 24 = 5) So, 7 must be raised to the power of 5 to contribute 5 prime factors.
