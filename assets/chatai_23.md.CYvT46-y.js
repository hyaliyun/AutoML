Also, since x = 0 is an extremum point of f(x), Therefore, f'(0) = 1 - frac{1}{m} = 0, solving this gives m = 1. (2) From (1), we know that the function f(x) = e^x - ln(x + 1), whose domain is (-1, +infty). Since f'(x) = frac{e^x(x + 1) - 1}{x + 1}. Let g(x) = e^x(x + 1) - 1, Then g'(x) = e^x(x + 1) + e^x > 0, Thus, g(x) is increasing on (-1, +infty), Also, since g(0) = 0, Therefore, when x > 0, g(x) > 0, i.e., f'(x) > 0; When -1 < x < 0, g(x) < 0, f'(x) < 0.

Knowing that the slope of line AB is 1 (since coefficients of x and y in its equation are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign), the slope of the perpendicular bisector is -1. Therefore, using the point-slope form, the equation of the perpendicular bisector passing through (0,1) is y - 1 = -1(x - 0), which simplifies to x + y - 1 = 0, making option D boxed{text{correct}}.

This means that if x > y, then ln x > ln y. Conversely, if ln x > ln y, then x > y. 2. **Relating x > y to x^3 > y^3**: - If x > y and both x, y > 0, then raising both sides to the third power preserves the inequality, so x^3 > y^3. - However, the reverse is not necessarily true in the general case without additional conditions because the cube root function is also strictly increasing. Thus, if x^3 > y^3, then x > y. 3. **Conclusion**: - Since \\"ln x > ln y\\" implies \\"x > y\\" and, under the condition that x, y > 0, \\"x > y\\" implies \\"x^3 > y^3\\", we can conclude that \\"ln x > ln y\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"x^3 > y^3\\". - However, it is not a necessary condition because \\"x^3 > y^3\\" can be true without specifically requiring the logarithmic relationship, as long as x > y holds.

[ n^3 equiv 0, pm1 pmod{9} quad text{for} quad n = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 8 ] This means: [ a^3 equiv 0, pm1pmod{9} quad text{and} quad b^3 equiv 0, pm1pmod{9} ] 2. **Analyze the equation modulo 9**: [ a^3 + 5b^3 equiv 2016 pmod{9} ] Since (2016 div 9 = 224) with a remainder of 0, we have: [ 2016 equiv 0 pmod{9} ] So the equation can be written as: [ a^3 + 5b^3 equiv 0 pmod{9} ] 3. **Possible combinations of (a^3) and (5b^3) modulo 9**: [ begin{aligned} &text{If } a^3 equiv 0 pmod{9}, & 5b^3 &equiv 0 pmod{9} &text{If } a^3 equiv 1 pmod{9}, & 5b^3 &equiv -1 pmod{9} &text{If } a^3 equiv -1 pmod{9}, & 5b^3 &equiv 1 pmod{9} end{aligned} ] However, for (5b^3) to be any of these possibilities, (b^3) must be such that (5b^3) is congruent to (pm1) modulo 9 or 0 modulo 9. However, examining this closely, we see that possible combinations do not add up correctly to (0) modulo 9 necessarily. 4. **Conclusion for modulo 9**: The only way (a^3 + 5b^3 equiv 0pmod{9}) is if both (a^3equiv0 pmod{9}) and (5b^3equiv0 pmod{9}) implying (a equiv 0pmod{3}) and (b equiv 0pmod{3}). Step 2: Analyze the resulting constraints 1. If (a = 3k) and (b = 3m) for integers (k, m), then: [ a^3 + 5b^3 = (3k)^3 + 5(3m)^3 = 27k^3 + 135m^3 = 27(k^3 + 5m^3) ] This must imply: [ 27(k^3 + 5m^3) = 2016 ] Dividing both sides by 27: [ k^3 + 5m^3 = 2016 div 27 = 74.6667 ] This implies (k^3 + 5m^3) must be an integer, but 74.6667 is not an integer, a contradiction arises. Based on modulo 9 analysis, (a^3 + 5b^3 = 2016) is impossible. To strengthen the proof, we can consider an alternate modular analysis. Step 3: Analyze modulo 7 1. **Cubic residues modulo 7**: We consider the possible values for (a^3) and (b^3) modulo 7. The cubes of integers modulo 7 can be: (0, pm1). [ n^3 equiv 0, pm1 pmod{7} quad text{for} quad n = 0, 1, 2,...,6 ] This means: [ a^3 equiv 0, pm1 pmod{7} quad text{and} quad b^3 equiv 0, pm1 pmod{7} ] 2. **Analyze the equation modulo 7**: [ a^3 + 5b^3 equiv 2016 pmod{7} ] Since (2016 div 7 = 288) with a remainder of 0, we have: [ 2016 equiv 0 pmod{7} ] So the equation can be written as: [ a^3 + 5b^3 equiv 0 pmod{7} ] 3. **Possible combinations modulo 7**: [ begin{aligned} &text{If } a^3 equiv 0 pmod{7}, & 5b^3 &equiv 0 pmod{7} &text{If } a^3 equiv 1 pmod{7}, & 5b^3 &equiv -1 pmod{7} &text{If } a^3 equiv -1 pmod{7}, & 5b^3 &equiv 1 pmod{7} end{aligned} ] However, in modulo 7, 5b^3 means (5b^3 equiv 0 pmod{7}) again requires (b equiv 0 pmod{7}). 4. **Conclusion modulo 7**: If (a = 7k) and (b = 7m) for integers (k, m), it fails because (7^3 | 2016). Hence analyzing both modulo 9 and modulo 7 rules out the possibilities, confirming that [ boxed{a^3 + 5 b^3 neq 2016} ]"},{"prompt":"Determine the real numbers x , y , z > 0 for which xyz leq minleft{4(x frac{1}{y}), 4(y frac{1}{z}), 4(z frac{1}{x})right}","completion":"1.

To verify if a number (N_i) is a perfect square, one effective method is to examine the sum of its digits. A key property of perfect squares concerning their digit sums is: - If a number is a perfect square, the sum of its digits must be congruent to (0, 1, 4, 7,) or (9 mod 9). 3.

To prove the diagonals of the hexagon formed by these lines intersect at a single point, we can utilize affine transformations. - Affine transformation preserves the collinearity and ratios of distances along parallel lines. This property allows us to simplify the problem by transforming any given triangle into an equilateral triangle (as stated in Problem 29.6(b)) while preserving the equality of the divided segments along the sides (as stated in Problem 29.5). 2. **Reduction to Equilateral Triangle**: Thus, it suffices to prove the claim for an equilateral triangle. Let's consider such a triangle A B C where each side is divided into three equal segments by points A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, C_2 and the midpoints of the sides are A', B', C' respectively (Refer to Figure 29.3). [ text{For instance, } A_1, A_2 text{ divide side } BC text{ into three equal parts; similarly, other points divide } AB text{ and } AC. ] 3. **Symmetry Consideration**: - By reflecting the side B B_1 across the median A A', the line B B_1 transforms into C C_2, and similarly, B B_2 reflects to C C_1. Since these pairs of reflected lines intersect on the line of symmetry A A', it's clear that A A' contains one of the diagonals of the hexagon. 4. **Remaining Diagonals**: - By symmetry, a similar argument applies to the other vertices. The lines joining the midpoints of sides analogous to the previous step form the remaining diagonals. Specifically, the considered reflected lines imply that the diagonals also lie along B B' and C C'. 5. **Intersection of Medians**: - These medians A A', B B', and C C' are known to intersect at a single point, which is the centroid of triangle ABC. Therefore, since the diagonals of the hexagon formed by the lines dividing the sides of the triangle into three equal parts lie along these medians, the diagonals intersect at the centroid of the triangle. # Conclusion: Hence, the diagonals connecting opposite vertices of the hexagon intersect at a single point, which is the centroid of the original triangle ABC.

Consequently, as f(x) is even, it must be increasing on (0, +infty). To solve the inequality f(2x - 1) < f(3), we consider the properties of f(x): 1. Since f(x) is even, f(3) is equal to f(-3). 2.

The lines ( AA_1 ), ( AA_2 ); ( BB_1 ), ( BB_2 ); and ( CC_1 ), ( CC_2 ) are drawn in such a way that each of these lines trisects the opposite side of the triangle into three equal parts. 3. These lines create a hexagon in the center of the triangle. We aim to prove that the area of this central hexagon is ( frac{1}{10} ) of the area of triangle ( ABC ). 4. To find the ratio of areas, we use Menelaus' Theorem. Menelaus' Theorem states that for a transversal cutting through the triangle’s sides (or their extensions), the product of the ratios of the segments it divides is equal to 1. 5. Without losing generality, assume the triangle is equilateral and use symmetric properties. The hexagon formed by these trisection lines dividing the triangle is symmetric in all directions. 6. We define the critical points: - Let ( M ) be the intersection of ( AA_1 ) and ( BB_2 ). - Let ( N ) be the intersection of ( AA_1 ) and ( BG ). - Let ( G ) be the centroid of the triangle. 7. By properties of the centroid, the centroid divides each median into a ( 2:1 ) ratio from the vertex to the midpoint of the side. 8. We now calculate the specific areas formed: - The ratio ( GM : GM_3 = 2:5 ). - Let ( G ) be close to ( M ) and ( M_3 ). 9. Since we are given ( GM : GM_3 = 2:5 ) and ( GN : GB = 1:4 ), consider these ratios in the context of area. If triangles are formed symmetrically, their area ratios around the centroid must maintain these proportional relationships. 10. Therefore, given the related triangles and their resulting areas, the ratio of the area of ( GMN ) to ( GBM_3 ) is ( 1:10 ). 11.

The remaining three positions will automatically be filled by the second digit. There are ( 1 ) permutation for these remaining digits (since both digits similar in two positions). So, the total for this case is: [ binom{3}{1} cdot binom{6}{1} cdot binom{5}{2} cdot 1 = 3 cdot 6 cdot 10 cdot 1 = 180 ] Case 3: All Three Digits Appear Twice 1. **Choosing the positions for the first digit**: (binom{6}{2}) ways. 2. **Choosing the positions for the second digit**: From the remaining 4 positions, (binom{4}{2}) ways. 3. **The last two positions are automatically assigned to the last digit**. Since no different arrangement for the selected positions, each combination is counted once. So the total for this case is: [ binom{6}{2} cdot binom{4}{2} cdot 1 = 15 cdot 6 cdot 1 = 90 ] The total number of eligible 6-digit numbers is the sum of all cases: [ 120 + 180 + 90 = 390. ] So, the number of six-digit numbers composed of digits 1, 2, and 3, with each digit appearing at least once is: [ boxed{390}. ]"},{"prompt":"Let the universal set be mathbb{R}, A={x|3leq x<7}, B={x|4<x<10}.

According to the surface area formula for a cylinder, the total surface area S consists of the areas of the two circles (bases) and the rectangular area that wraps around the side when it is unrolled, which has the height of the cylinder and the circumference of the base as its dimensions. We can calculate the surface area of the cylinder as follows: S = 2(pi r^2) + (2pi r)h Where: - S is the surface area of the cylinder. - h is the height of the cylinder (given as 8 cm). - r is the radius of the base circle. - pi r^2 is the area of one circle (base) of the cylinder. - 2pi r is the circumference of the base circle. - (2pi r)h is the area of the side surface of the cylinder (the rectangle).

We seek four-digit numbers where the sum of their digits, (a+b+c+d), equals 12. Since (a+b+c+d) = 12, which is even, and (a+c)-(b+d) = 0, we can break it down by looking at possible cases for (a+c) and (b+d).

We investigate cases where (a+b+c+d) = 12 with various digit arrangements and check for divisibility. 1. **Case (a+c) = 6 and (b+d) = 6:** - If a=1, b=5 and we adjust c and d, then (c,d) could be (5,1) or (4,2) or (3,3) etc., maintaining (b+d) = 6. - Other possible values for a, b, c, and d such as (2,4; 4,2), (3,3; 3,3) (and permutations) must be checked similarly.

After systematically going through all values from 1 to 9 for a, b, c, d (keeping the first digit a non-zero), we find that there are indeed combinations that satisfy the criteria. **Conclusion with boxed answer**: The total number of such four-digit numbers can be summed by the count of valid digit combinations, after detailed counting and optimization.

Each circuit around the post is equal to the circumference of the post, which is 3 feet. Therefore, the horizontal distance the squirrel travels is 5 circuits * 3 feet/circuit = 15 feet. However, we also need to consider the vertical distance the squirrel travels. The squirrel travels a vertical distance of 25 feet (the height of the post). To find the total distance the squirrel travels, we need to calculate the length of the helical path. This can be done by considering the helix as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where one leg is the vertical height of the post (25 feet) and the other leg is the horizontal distance around the post (15 feet). Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the helix (hypotenuse) is: Length of helix = √(vertical distance^2 + horizontal distance^2) Length of helix = √(25^2 + 15^2) Length of helix = √(625 + 225) Length of helix = √850 Length of helix ≈ 29.15 feet Therefore, the squirrel travels approximately boxed{29.15} feet up the post."},{"prompt":"Twice Angie's age, plus 4, is 20.

(2) To find the value of dfrac{2sin x cos x}{sin^2{x} - cos^2{x}}, we can use the identity sin^2{x} + cos^2{x} = 1. Knowing that tan x = 2, we can also express sin x in terms of cos x. From the identity, we can write: sin^2{x} = 1 - cos^2{x}. Now we plug sin x = 2cos x into the denominator: sin^2{x} - cos^2{x} = (1 - cos^2{x}) - cos^2{x} = 1 - 2cos^2{x}.

First, we perform a substitution: Let ( x = frac{1}{t} ). Then, ( dx = -frac{dt}{t^2} ). The limits of integration change accordingly: when ( x ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( 1 ), ( t ) ranges from ( infty ) to ( 1 ).

We can split this integral into parts: [ left| int_{n_{1}}^{n_{2}} frac{(-1)^{[t]}}{t} , dt right| = left| sum_{p=n_{1}}^{n_{2}-1} int_{p}^{p+1} frac{(-1)^{p}}{t} , dt right|. ] Each integral inside the sum evaluates to: [ int_{p}^{p+1} frac{(-1)^{p}}{t} , dt = (-1)^{p} left[ ln frac{t}{p} right]_p^{p+1} = (-1)^{p} ln frac{p+1}{p}. ] Therefore, [ left| sum_{p=n_{1}}^{n_{2}-1} (-1)^{p} ln frac{p+1}{p} right| < ln frac{n_{1} + 1}{n_{1}}. ] 4. **Using the Cauchy Criterion:** We select ( n_{0} ) such that for any ( n_{1} ge n_{0} > 1 ), [ ln frac{n_{1}}{n_{1} - 1} < frac{varepsilon}{3}. ] A suitable choice for ( n_{0} ) is: [ n_{0} = leftlbrack frac{e^{varepsilon / 3}}{e^{varepsilon / 3} - 1} rightrbrack + 1. ] For ( x_{2} > x_{1} ge n_{0} + 1 ), selecting ( n_{1} ) and ( n_{2} ) such that ( x_{1} le n_{1} < n_{2} le x_{2} ) and ( n_{1} - x_{1} < 1 ), ( x_{2} - n_{2} < 1 ): [ left| int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} frac{(-1)^{[t]}}{t} , dt right| le left| int_{x_{1}}^{n_{1}} frac{(-1)^{[t]}}{t} , dt right| + left| int_{n_{1}}^{n_{2}} frac{(-1)^{[t]}}{t} , dt right| + left| int_{n_{2}}^{x_{2}} frac{(-1)^{[t]}}{t} , dt right| le ln frac{n_{1}}{n_{1} - 1} + ln frac{n_{1} + 1}{n_{1}} + ln frac{n_{2} + 1}{n_{2}} < varepsilon. ] Therefore, according to the Cauchy criterion, the integral converges conditionally.

So far, she has spent 75 minutes on TV episodes and 270 minutes sleeping, which adds up to 75 + 270 = 345 minutes.

There are ( varphi(p-1) ) such primitive roots, where ( varphi ) is the Euler's totient function. 2. **Sum of Products Using Primitive Root**: Consider the sequence ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{p-1}) ) where ( x_i = g^i ).

Tangents parallel to the line y=x-2 will have the same slope as this line, which is 1. Therefore, we need to find when the derivative of the equation of the curve matches this slope. Taking the derivative of y=x^{2}-ln x, we get: y' = 2x - frac{1}{x}. Setting the derivative equal to 1 gives us: 2x - frac{1}{x} = 1. Multiplying everything by x to clear the fraction, we have: 2x^2 - 1 = x. Rearranging terms, we get: 2x^2 - x - 1 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation yields two potential x-values, but we only consider the positive value since the domain of y=x^{2}-ln x only allows for x > 0. Therefore, x = 1. With x = 1, we plug this value back into our curve equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate for point P: y = 1^{2} - ln 1 = 1 - 0 = 1. Thus, the tangent passes through point (1,1). Now, to find the distance d from (1,1) to the line y=x-2, we use the formula for distance from a point to a line: d = frac{|Ax_{1}+By_{1}+C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}, where the line is given by Ax + By + C = 0. For the line y=x-2, we have A=1, B=-1, and C=2, and for the point (1,1), we have x_{1}=1 and y_{1}=1. Plugging these into the formula, we get: d = frac{|1cdot1+(-1)cdot1+2|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|1-1+2|}{sqrt{2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}.

The points of tangency of the trapezoid with the circle are given as ( N, L, M, ) and ( K ). 3. By the properties of tangents to a circle from a common external point, the tangent segments from the same point are equal. Thus: [ BM = BN quad text{and} quad CN = CL ] and, due to symmetry, ( M ) and ( L ) lie on the legs of the trapezoid which are parallel to the bases ( BC ) and ( AD ). Thus, [ ML parallel BC ] 4. According to the given problem, the distance between the points of tangency of the legs (or the length of the segment (ML)) is 8 cm. We need to find the area of the trapezoid (ABCD). 5.

The area covered by exactly two layers of runner is given as 24 square inches. Let's denote the area covered by three layers of runner as X, which is what we want to find. When the runners are overlapped to cover the table, there are three possibilities for the layers of coverage: 1. Some areas are covered by one layer of runner. 2.

Thus: 0+a=0, solving this gives a=0, then: f(x) = frac{x}{x^2+bx+1}. From f(-1)=-f(1), we get: frac{-x}{x^2-bx+1} = -frac{x}{x^2+bx+1}. Solving this gives: b=0. Therefore: f(x) = frac{x}{x^2+1}.

The Law of Sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant. 2. **Applying the Law of Sines:** For triangle ABP, we obtain: [ frac{AP}{sin angle ABP} = frac{BP}{sin angle BAP} ] For triangle ABL, we obtain: [ frac{AL}{sin angle ABL} = frac{BL}{sin angle BAL} ] For triangle CBP, we obtain: [ frac{CP}{sin angle CBP} = frac{BP}{sin angle BCP} ] For triangle CBL, we obtain: [ frac{CL}{sin angle CBL} = frac{BL}{sin angle BCL} ] 3. **Express the ratios of sides in terms of sine:** Since P is the midpoint of AC, then: [ frac{AP}{CP} = 1 ] And hence, using the Law of Sines: [ frac{AL}{CL} = left(frac{AB}{CB}right)^2 ] Similarly, for the other pair of diagonals: [ frac{AL}{CL} = left(frac{AD}{CD}right)^2 ] 4. **Equating the ratios:** Therefore: [ frac{AB}{CB} = frac{AD}{CD} implies AB cdot CD = AD cdot CB ] By the Ptolemy's Theorem, we know that the sum of the products of the lengths of two pairs of opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the product of the lengths of its diagonals. Thus: [ AB cdot CD + AD cdot BC = AC cdot BD ] 5. **Symmetry considerations for diagonals relative to bisectors:** Since the diagonals are symmetric relative to the bisectors of angles A and C, consider the point Q. Let Q be the intersection point of diagonal AC with diagonal BD. The triangles ABQ and ACQ are similar due to symmetry and bisector properties. Therefore: [ frac{AB}{AC} = frac{BQ}{BD} ] From the midpoint property, BQ = frac{1}{2} BD.

This implies: [ 2 = (x^n + 1) - a(x) cdot (x+1) ] Raising both sides to the ( n )-th power, we get: [ 2^n = (a(x) cdot (x+1))^n + b(x) cdot (x^n + 1) ] for some polynomial ( b(x) ). 3. **Existence of minimal ( k ):** This shows that some minimal ( k ) with: [ k = f(x) cdot (x+1)^n + g(x) cdot (x^n + 1) ] exists. If we subtract this equation ( lfloor 2^n/k rfloor ) times from the previous equation, the left-hand side must be 0 (or else the minimality of ( k ) is contradicted).

Substituting this into the equation, we get: [ 2^c = h(x) cdot ((x+1)^{2^r} - (x^{2^r} + 1)) + 2p(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} ] Let ( e(x) = frac{(x+1)^{2^r} - (x^{2^r} + 1)}{2} ). Note that ( e(x) ) is an integer polynomial, and ( e(1) = 2^{2^r - 1} - 1 ) is odd. Dividing by 2, we get: [ 2^{c-1} = h(x) cdot e(x) + p(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} ] Since ( 2^{c-1} ) is even, considering this in ( F_2 ), we get: [ p(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} = -h(x) cdot e(x) ] Since ( e(1) ) is odd, ( (x+1)^{2^r} ) and ( e(x) ) are coprime in ( F_2 ). Thus, ( (x+1)^{2^r} ) divides ( -h(x) ) in ( F_2 ), implying ( h(x) = c(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} + 2d(x) ). This implies ( deg h geq 2^r ) or ( h ) is zero in ( F_2 ), both contradictions.

This is due to the effect described by the digit pattern change without crossing the place value of hundreds. 4. **Distribution and 10's increment analysis:** With 39 numbers, either: - There are at least 20 consecutive numbers before a 100's increment, or - There are at least 20 consecutive numbers after a 100's increment. - There could be 20 consecutive numbers encompassing only one possible 100's increment. 5. **Sum of digits progression for a specific block of 20 numbers:** Consider two cases: - textbf{Case 1: Before 100's increment:} The sum of the digits for the first block of 20 numbers will form a sequence incrementing by 1 with at most one adjustment for the 10's increment. For a sequence starting from a sum (a), the numbers will have the following sum of digits progression: [ a, a+1, a+2, dots, a+9, a+1, a+2, dots, a+10 ] This applies, for example, to ( 80, 81, 82, ldots, 89, 90, 91, ldots, 99 ). - textbf{Case 2: After 100's increment:} Similar behavior as the first case is observed post 100's increment: [ a, a+1, a+2, dots, a+9, a+1, a+2, dots, a+10 ] such as (2000, 2001, 2002, dots, 2009, 2010, 2011, ldots, 2019). 6. **General case of no 100's increment:** - If there's no 100's increment, it’s clear that among 39 numbers, at least a block of 20 consecutive numbers will have just one 10's increment with the pattern described above. 7. **Conclusion based on mathematical properties:** Since the sum of the digits in each set of 11 consecutive numbers: [ a, a+1, dots, a+10 ] always covers an entire modulo 11 span (reminder properties), there is guaranteed to be one number in each such block whose digit sum is divisible by 11. This ensures that among 39 consecutive numbers, at least one such number can be found, as sought. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Let a,b be the smaller sides of a right triangle.

We know that the sum of three numbers is odd if and only if either all three numbers are odd or exactly one of them is odd (and the other two are even). Step 1: Counting Odd and Even Numbers From the numbers 1, 2, dots, 9, there are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and 4 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8). Step 2: Configuration of Odd and Even Numbers To achieve an odd sum in each row and column, we can either have: - Three odd numbers in a row/column, or - One odd and two even numbers in a row/column. Step 3: Analyzing the Grid A 3 times 3 grid has 3 rows and 3 columns. We need to place the numbers such that each row and each column has an odd sum. Step 4: Placing Even Numbers Since there are 4 even numbers, and we need to place them in a way that allows each row and column to have an odd sum, we can place two even numbers in one row and two in another row, or place them in columns similarly. This ensures that each row and column can have at least one odd number. Step 5: Counting Valid Arrangements - Choose 2 rows (or columns) to place the 4 even numbers: binom{3}{2} = 3 ways. - Arrange the 4 even numbers within these selected rows (or columns): 4! ways. - Arrange the 5 odd numbers in the remaining spaces: 5! ways.

We need to reconsider the arrangement strategy. Correct Approach: We need to ensure that each row and each column has an odd sum. This can be achieved by having exactly one row and one column filled entirely with odd numbers. This configuration ensures that all rows and columns will have an odd sum. - Choose 1 row for all odd numbers: 3 choices. - Choose 1 column for all odd numbers (not overlapping with the chosen row): 3 choices. - Arrange the 5 odd numbers in the chosen row and column: P(5,3) = 60 ways. - Arrange the remaining 2 odd numbers and 4 even numbers in the rest of the grid: 2! cdot 4! = 48 ways. The probability is then: [ frac{3 cdot 3 cdot 60 cdot 48}{9!} = frac{8640}{362880} = frac{1}{42} ] This calculation still seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the number of valid configurations: - There are 9 ways to choose one row and one column to be filled with odd numbers. - The remaining placements and arrangements of odd and even numbers must be reconsidered. Final Calculation: The correct number of valid configurations is 9, and the total configurations are binom{9}{4} = 126 (choosing positions for 4 even numbers).

This will allow us to calculate the desired probability. **Total Ways to Select 2 Students:** The total number of ways to select 2 students out of 5 can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n=5 (total students) and k=2 (students to be selected), so we have: [C_{5}^{2} = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10] **Ways to Select Exactly 2 Female Students:** Similarly, to find the number of ways to select exactly 2 female students out of the 3 available, we use the combination formula again with n=3 (total female students) and k=2 (female students to be selected): [C_{3}^{2} = frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = frac{3 times 2}{2 times 1} = 3] **Calculating the Probability:** The probability of selecting exactly 2 female students is the ratio of the number of ways to select 2 female students to the total number of ways to select any 2 students.

Therefore, the power of M with respect to these circles is: [ operatorname{Pow}_{(BPC)}(M) = BM^2 quad text{and} quad operatorname{Pow}_{(EPD)}(M) = EM^2 ] Since PQ is the radical axis of these circles, BM = EM, making M the midpoint of EB. 5. **Collinearity:** Since ABPE is a parallelogram, the midpoint of EB is also the midpoint of AP.

We note that M contains 10 elements, thus there are 2^{10} - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023 non-empty subsets of M. These subsets are denoted as M_i where i=1,2,ldots,1023, and the product of all elements in each M_i is denoted as m_i. We are to find the sum sum_{i=1}^{1023} m_i. Let's analyze the situation step-by-step: 1. **Subsets Containing 0:** Since any subset that includes 0 will have a product of 0, we first identify how many such subsets exist. Because 0 guarantees a product of 0 regardless of the other elements, any subset of the remaining 9 elements can be combined with 0 to form a subset with a product of 0. There are 2^9 = 512 subsets formed this way, contributing 512 times 0 = 0 to the sum. 2. **Subsets Not Containing 0 or -1:** Next, we consider subsets that do not contain 0 and also exclude -1. There are 8 elements left to choose from, leading to 2^8 = 256 subsets, but since we're excluding the empty set in this counting, there are actually 255 valid subsets. These subsets contribute 255 times 0 = 0 to the sum because for each subset not containing -1, there is a corresponding subset that does contain -1 and has a product that is the opposite sign, canceling each other out. 3. **Subsets Containing -1 but Not 0:** Similarly, there are 255 subsets that include -1 but not 0, alongside other elements. Just like the previous step, these subsets will have their contributions canceled out by the corresponding subsets not containing -1. 4. **The Subset {-1}:** The subset consisting solely of -1 is a special case. It doesn't get canceled out by any other subset since it directly contributes -1 to the sum. Combining these observations, we find the total sum to be: [m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3}+ldots +m_{1023} = 512 times 0 + 255 times 0 + 255 times 0 - 1 = -1.] Therefore, the final sum of the products of all elements in each non-empty subset of M is boxed{-1}."},{"prompt":"A number divided by 0.06 is equal to 16.666666666666668.

The numbers we have are: - Plates: 3,219 - Spoons: 5,641 - Glasses: 1,509 - Bowls: 2,387 Let's find the GCD of these four numbers. First, we find the GCD of the first two numbers, 3,219 and 5,641.

Since the GCD of the first two numbers is 1, and 1 is the smallest positive integer, the GCD of all four numbers will also be 1.

This implies that if A > B, then a > b due to the property that in any triangle, larger angles are opposite longer sides. Consequently, since a > b, it follows that sin A > sin B because the sine of an angle increases with the angle in the interval [0, pi]. Therefore, statement A is correct. **Statement B: If frac{cos A}{a} = frac{cos B}{b} = frac{cos C}{c}, then triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle** Given frac{cos A}{a} = frac{cos B}{b} = frac{cos C}{c}, and applying the law of sines, frac{sin A}{a} = frac{sin B}{b} = frac{sin C}{c}, we can rewrite the given condition as frac{cos A}{sin A} = frac{cos B}{sin B} = frac{cos C}{sin C}. This simplifies to frac{1}{tan A} = frac{1}{tan B} = frac{1}{tan C}. For this to hold, A = B = C, indicating that triangle ABC is equilateral. Thus, statement B is correct. **Statement C: If acos A = bcos B, then triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle** From the law of sines, frac{sin A}{a} = frac{sin B}{b}, and given acos A = bcos B, we can derive sin A cos A = sin B cos B. This leads to sin 2A = sin 2B. Solving sin 2A = sin 2B could imply 2A = 2B or 2A + 2B = pi, which means A = B or A + B = frac{pi}{2}. This does not necessarily mean triangle ABC is isosceles, as it could also be a right triangle. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. **Statement D: If bcos C + ccos B = asin A, then triangle ABC is a right triangle** Given bcos C + ccos B = asin A and applying the law of sines, we can rewrite this as sin B cos C + sin C cos B = sin^2 A. This simplifies to sin(B + C) = sin^2 A. Since A + B + C = pi, it follows that sin(B + C) = sin A. For sin A = 1, A must be frac{pi}{2}, indicating that triangle ABC is a right triangle.

Substituting x_1=1, y_1=frac{e}{2}, and m=frac{e}{4}, we get: [ y-frac{e}{2}=frac{e}{4}(x-1) ] Simplifying this equation, we distribute frac{e}{4} and then add frac{e}{2} to both sides: [ y=frac{e}{4}x-frac{e}{4}+frac{e}{2}=frac{e}{4}x+frac{e}{4} ] Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point (1, frac{e}{2}) is y=frac{e}{4}x+frac{e}{4}, which matches option C.

Alice starts by placing 100 pennies, 100 nickels, 100 dimes, and 100 quarters such that each square has exactly one coin, and she then removes 59 coins. We will analyze the perimeter of the region of empty squares to show that Alice cannot win the game by removing all coins under the given rules. 1. **Initial Perimeter Calculation:** - Initially, there are 59 empty squares, and the perimeter of these squares is at most (4 times 59 = 236). This is because each empty square can contribute at most 4 to the perimeter when none of the squares are adjacent. 2. **Changing the Perimeter:** - A penniness removed will always decrease the perimeter by exactly 4 because it must be completely surrounded by empty squares. - Removing a nickel can change the perimeter in multiple ways: - If surrounded by four empty squares: decreases by 4. - If surrounded by three empty squares: decreases by 2. - Hence, removing a nickel decreases the perimeter by at least 2. - Removing a dime can also change the perimeter in multiple ways: - If surrounded by two or more empty squares: - Can decrease by 4, 2, or remain the same. - Hence, removing a dime decreases the perimeter by at least 0 (it does not increase). - Removing a quarter can also change the perimeter: - If completely surrounded by one or more empty squares: - Can decrease by 4, 2, remain the same, or increase by 2. - Hence, removing a quarter *can* increase the perimeter by at most 2 but usually decreases it or remains the same. 3. **Final State Analysis:** - For Alice to win, all remaining coins must be removed, resulting in all 400 squares being empty. This would mean the perimeter would be a maximum value corresponding to a completely empty (20 times 20) chessboard, which equates to (4 times 20 = 80). - However, based on the initial perimeter calculation and the analysis of how removing coins affects it, we derive the following formula for the final perimeter: [ text{Final Perimeter} leq 4 times k - 4(t^2 - p) - 2(t^2 - n) + 2(t^2 - q) ] Substituting (k) with 59 and (t) with 20, we obtain: [ text{Final Perimeter} leq 4 times 59 - 4 times 100 + 4p + 2n - 2q ] Simplifying: [ text{Final Perimeter} leq 236 - 400 + 4p + 2n - 2q = -164 + 4p + 2n - 2q ] Since (4p + 2n - 2q) is always less than or equal to (4(p+n+d+q)=4 times 59=236), the smallest that the perimeter can permissibly go down to is (4(100mathrm{ pennies} + 100mathrm{ nickels} + 100mathrm{ dimes} + 41mathrm{ quarters}) = 764 mathrm{ initial}): [ text{Final Perimeter} leq 76 < 80 rightarrow text{IMPLAUSIBLE}. ] Because (80) is expected, but our calculations show that we can not actually reduce the perimeter under the constraints to zero, thus: # Conclusion: It is impossible for Alice to remove all the coins completely.

However, -a for positive a would be negative, which contradicts the condition |a| = -a for positive a. 4. Therefore, a cannot be positive. 5. If a is zero or negative, then |a| = -a holds true. For a = 0, |0| = 0 = -0. For negative a, |a| = -a by the definition of absolute value for negative numbers. 6. Thus, a must be either zero or negative, which is defined as non-positive.

What is the selling price of the cricket bat?","completion":"To find the selling price of the cricket bat, we first need to determine the cost price (the price at which the bat was originally bought before selling it for a profit). Given that the profit made is 225 and the profit percentage is 33.33%, we can use the formula for profit percentage: Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100 We can rearrange this formula to solve for the Cost Price: Cost Price = Profit / (Profit Percentage / 100) Substituting the given values: Cost Price = 225 / (33.33 / 100) Cost Price = 225 / 0.3333 Cost Price = 675 Now that we have the cost price, we can find the selling price by adding the profit to the cost price: Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit Selling Price = 675 + 225 Selling Price = 900 Therefore, the selling price of the cricket bat is boxed{900} ."},{"prompt":"On the extension of the longest side ( AC ) of triangle ( ABC ) beyond point ( C ), point ( D ) is taken such that ( CD = CB ).

A point D is taken on this continuation such that CD = CB. We need to prove that the angle angle ABD is not acute. 2. **Notations and Initial Observations:** - Let angle BAC = alpha, angle ABC = beta, and angle ACB = gamma with alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ. - Since angle BAC and angle ACB lie within triangle ABC, beta + gamma < 180^circ. - We know that CD = CB by given information. 3. **Analyze the Angle angle CBD:** - Since CD = CB, triangle CBD is an isosceles triangle with CB = CD. - Hence, angle BCD = angle CBD. Let angle CBD = x. 4. **Relationship Between angle ACB and angle CBD:** - In triangle ABC, angle ACB = gamma. - Since CD is a continuation of AC beyond point C, the external angle angle DCB can be expressed as angle DCB = 180^circ - gamma. - Because triangle CBD is isosceles with CB = CD, we have: [ angle CBD = angle BCD = x. ] - Moreover, angle BCD + angle CBD + angle BDC = 180^circ implying: [ x + x + angle BDC = 180^circ. ] Simplifying, we get: [ 2x + angle BDC = 180^circ implies angle BDC = 180^circ - 2x. ] - But angle BDC is also the supplement of gamma: [ angle BDC = 180^circ - gamma implies 180^circ - 2x = 180^circ - gamma implies 2x = gamma implies x = frac{gamma}{2}. ] 5. **Calculate angle ABD:** - Now, angle ABD = angle ABC + angle CBD. - Recall that angle ABC = beta and angle CBD = frac{gamma}{2}. - Therefore,: [ angle ABD = beta + frac{gamma}{2}. ] 6. **Comparing angle ABD with 90^circ:** - We need to show angle ABD geq 90^circ. - Consider the sum of the angles in triangle ABC: [ alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ. ] - Since beta + gamma is less than 180^circ and beta is one of the angles of the triangle, [ beta leq frac{180^circ - alpha}{2}. ] - This means, gamma geq alpha because alpha is the smallest angle in triangle ABC. - Given beta geq alpha means beta + frac{gamma}{2} geq 90^circ: [ beta + frac{gamma}{2} geq frac{alpha + beta + gamma}{2} = frac{180^circ}{2} = 90^circ. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{angle ABD geq 90^circ} ] This verifies that angle ABD is not an acute angle."},{"prompt":"Sami recalls that the digits in her friend's threedigit area code are 6, 5, and 4, but she doesn't remember the order.

Each component is a tree containing exactly one designated city. 4. **Direction Check:** - Every tree in the k-set oriented graph directs roads such that they lead to a designated city.

If ( n ) is divisible by 3, then ( a_n ) is divisible by 3. This is because: [ 10^n - 1 = (10^3)^{n/3} - 1 = 1000^{n/3} - 1 ] and by the difference of cubes, we have: [ 1000^{n/3} - 1 = (10^{n/3} - 1)(10^{2n/3} + 10^{n/3} + 1) ] Since ( 10^{n/3} - 1 ) and ( 10^{2n/3} + 10^{n/3} + 1 ) are both integers, ( a_n ) is not prime for ( n ) divisible by 3. 5. Applying these rules, we can eliminate the following values of ( n ): - ( n = 3 ) (divisible by 3) - ( n = 4 ) (even) - ( n = 6 ) (even and divisible by 3) - ( n = 8 ) (even) - ( n = 9 ) (divisible by 3) - ( n = 10 ) (even) 6. This leaves us with ( n = 2, 5, 7 ). We need to check if ( a_2, a_5, a_7 ) are prime: - ( a_2 = 11 ), which is prime. - ( a_5 = 11111 ), which is prime. - ( a_7 = 1111111 ), which is prime. 7.

This can be achieved by moving the vertical matchstick to the top-left position and removing the horizontal matchstick. 3. **Second Digit Analysis:** - The second digit is 4. The possibilities of forming larger digits by moving at most two matchsticks from 4 are: - 9: Requires adding two matchsticks, forming a closed loop at the top and adding one vertically on the left of the horizontal line.

With 0, the possibilities are: - 8: Adding matchsticks, not used. - 6: Adding matchsticks, not used. - 9: Adding matchsticks, not used. - Retaining 0 or transforming to 7 or 3 by moving or removing matchsticks only reduces the number, thus keeping 0 is optimal. 5. **Final Digit Analysis:** - The fourth digit is 5.

The total number of possible outcomes when rolling the two dice is the product of the number of sides on each die, which is 8 * 10 = 80.

Now, we need to find all the even multiples of 25 between 300 and 600 inclusive. We can do this by finding the difference between the two bounds (600 - 300 = 300), dividing by 50 (since we're looking for every other multiple of 25, which is 50), and then adding 1 to include both ends of the range.

However, the reference solution mentions 60 black cells and 40 white cells.

Given the jump mechanics, grasshoppers originally on black cells will move to white cells and vice versa. - Thus, we had 50 grasshoppers on black cells initially. These 50 black cells are now empty because their grasshoppers jumped to white cells. - There were also 50 grasshoppers on white cells. These white cells now have an additional 50 grasshoppers from the original black cells. 6. **Empty Cells Calculation**: - Now, we have 50 black cells that are empty. - The white cells have 100 grasshoppers (original 50 from white cells + 50 grasshoppers from black cells). - Since every white cell can have more than one grasshopper, we need to consider that there are still 50 black cells empty. 7. **Conclusion**: Since all grasshoppers have moved in such a way that they change their original cell colors, at least 20 of the black cells will remain empty.

What is the minimum number of participants required to arrange a schedule that meets the above rules and makes the match set exactly ( A )?

Hence, there must be at least a_k + 1 participants to form these a_k pairs. - Including the participant itself who plays a_k matches against these a_k pairs, the total minimum number of participants required is: [ a_k + 2 ] 3. **Analyze the Number of Matches for Double Membership**: - If the participant belongs to two different pairs, then each pair must contain at least another pair of participants for a matching with the specified number of matches. Thus, we need at least: [ frac{a_k}{2} text{ pairs} + 2 text{ (each participant belongs to two pairs)} = frac{a_k}{2} + 2 + 1 (for extra flexibility) ] This leads to a total minimum number of participants required as: [ frac{a_k}{2} + 3 ] 4. **Generalization for Achieving Minimum Participants**: - We need to ensure at least the term frac{a_k}{2} + 3 since: [ frac{a_k}{2} + 3 < a_k + 2 ] results in fewer participants being required. 5. **Constructing Proof by Mathematical Induction**: - Base Case (k=1): When k=1, split frac{a_1}{2} + 3 participants into three small groups. Each group forms pairs, and all distinct pairs engage in matches such that each participant reaches a_1 matches. - Induction Step: Assume the conclusion holds for k = h-1 and k=h. Now consider k = h+1, Suppose: [ A = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_h, a_{h+1}} quad text{and} quad a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_h < a_{h+1} ] Using frac{a_{h+1}}{2} + 3 participants. We then divide these participants into three groups S, T, U with: [ |S| = frac{a_1}{2}, quad |T| = frac{a_h - a_1}{2} + 3, quad |U| = frac{a_{h+1} - a_h}{2} ] We establish within each group, forming pairs and scheduling matches, ensuring all group members participate as their match count equals corresponding a values. - Inductively, given proper scheduling and pair matching, the minimum number of participants needed to ensure matches consistency with set A is achieved. Thus, we have shown that if we have frac{a_k}{2} + 3 participants, we can create a tournament schedule meeting the given rules with exactly the match count set A.

Thus, the standard equation of ellipse C is frac{x^2}{6} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1. (II) (i) From equation (1), we find that the coordinates of focus F are (-2, 0). Let the coordinates of point T be (-3, m). Then, the slope of line TF is k_{TF} = frac{m - 0}{-3 - (-2)} = -m. When m neq 0, the slope of line PQ is k_{PQ} = frac{1}{m}, and the equation of line PQ is x = my - 2. When m = 0, the equation of line PQ is x = -2, which also conforms to the form x = my - 2. Let P(x_1, y_1) and Q(x_2, y_2). By solving the system of equations begin{cases} x = my - 2, frac{x^2}{6} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1, end{cases} we obtain the coordinates of points P and Q. Eliminating x, we have (m^2 + 3)y^2 - 4my - 2 = 0. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is Delta = 16m^2 + 8(m^2 + 3) > 0.

Then, the coordinates of M are (frac{-6}{m^2 + 3}, frac{2m}{m^2 + 3}). The slope of line OM is k_{OM} = -frac{m}{3}. The slope of line OT is also k_{OT} = -frac{m}{3}. Therefore, point M lies on line OT. This implies that line OT bisects line segment PQ. (ii) From part (i), we have |TF| = sqrt{m^2 + 1} and |PQ| = sqrt{(m^2 + 1)left[(y_1 + y_2)^2 - 4y_1y_2right]} = frac{sqrt{24}(m^2 + 1)}{m^2 + 3}.

This strategy capitalizes on placing the ( circ ) symbols in such a manner that even if one row or column is blocked, the other paths remain open. - For example, after filling in positions strategically, ( B ) continues occupying lines until managing to place five in one line. 8. **Conclusion:** - By carefully analyzing each move and placing symbols strategically, player ( B ) can secure a win. Blocking ( A ) while prioritizing their lines with minimal disruption ensures a structured path to victory.

Let's construct the function h(x) = e^{x-1} - ln x - 1 for x > 0. We then find the derivative of h(x), which is h'(x) = e^{x-1} - frac{1}{x}. Observing h'(x), we note that it is a monotonically increasing function because its derivative is positive for x > 1 and negative for 0 < x < 1. Specifically, at x=1, we have h'(1) = e^{1-1} - frac{1}{1} = 0. This implies that for x in (0, 1), h'(x) < 0 and hence h(x) is monotonically decreasing. For x in (1, +infty), h'(x) > 0 and hence h(x) is monotonically increasing. The minimum value of h(x) occurs at x=1, where h(1) = e^{1-1} - ln 1 - 1 = 0.

For this line to also be tangent to y = g(x), the equation e^{t-1}x + e^{t-1}(1 - t) = ln x - 1 must have exactly one solution in x. Let m(x) = e^{t-1}x + e^{t-1}(1 - t) - ln x + 1. The derivative of m(x) with respect to x is m'(x) = e^{t-1} - frac{1}{x}. Setting m'(x) = 0 gives x = frac{1}{e^{t-1}}. For 0 < x < frac{1}{e^{t-1}}, m'(x) < 0, and m(x) is monotonically decreasing. For x > frac{1}{e^{t-1}}, m'(x) > 0, and m(x) is monotonically increasing. To ensure m(x) = 0 has exactly one solution, we need m(frac{1}{e^{t-1}}) = 0, leading to the equation e^{t-1} - te^{t-1} + t + 1 = 0. Let n(t) = e^{t-1} - te^{t-1} + t + 1. The derivative of n(t) is n'(t) = 1 - te^{t-1}. Setting n'(t) = 0 gives t = 1. For t < 1, n'(t) > 0, and n(t) is monotonically increasing. For t > 1, n'(t) < 0, and n(t) is monotonically decreasing. The maximum value of n(t) is at t = 1, where n(1) = 2. As t approaches -infty or +infty, n(t) approaches -infty.

Breakdown the combinations considering constraints if all four digits are identical, if three are identical, and so forth. - **Case 1: All four digits are the same** Here, the only possibility is if each digit is (5): [ 5+5+5+5 = 20. ] Hence, this case has (1) password: (5555). - **Case 2: Three digits are the same** Consider digits that can sum to 20 with three identical digits: [ begin{aligned} & 6+6+6+2 = 20 quad text{(Passwords: (6662))}, & 4+4+4+8 = 20 quad text{(Passwords: (4448))}. end{aligned} ] The number of permutations for each is (C_4^1 = 4). Therefore, we get (2 times 4 = 8) passwords. - **Case 3: Two pairs of identical digits** Next, consider cases where there are two pairs of identical digits: [ begin{aligned} & 9+9+1+1 = 20 quad text{(Passwords: (9911))}, & 8+8+2+2 = 20 quad text{(Passwords: (8822))}, & 7+7+3+3 = 20 quad text{(Passwords: (7733))}, & 6+6+4+4 = 20 quad text{(Passwords: (6644))}. end{aligned} ] The number of permutations for each is (C_4^2 = 6).

D: When ACbot BD, the parallelogram ABCD is a rhombus.","completion":"Let's analyze each statement step by step: A. When OA = OC, it means that the diagonals of the parallelogram are bisected at their intersection point. However, this condition alone does not guarantee that all angles are right angles, which is a necessary condition for a parallelogram to be a rectangle. Therefore, we cannot conclude that ABCD is a rectangle solely based on OA = OC. B. When AB = AD, it indicates that two adjacent sides of the parallelogram are equal. According to the properties of parallelograms, if one pair of adjacent sides is equal, the parallelogram is a rhombus. However, being a rhombus does not automatically make it a square, as a square requires all angles to be right angles in addition to having all sides equal. Thus, ABCD being a rhombus does not necessarily make it a square. C. When angle ABC = 90^{circ}, this condition implies that there is at least one right angle in the parallelogram. A defining property of rectangles is that all angles are right angles. Since a parallelogram with one right angle necessarily has all right angles (due to the properties of parallelograms), ABCD must be a rectangle under this condition. D. When AC bot BD, meaning the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular to each other, this is a specific property of rhombuses among parallelograms. This condition ensures that ABCD is a rhombus because the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Therefore, the correct statement that matches the condition given in the problem is: boxed{D} When ACbot BD, the parallelogram ABCD is a rhombus."},{"prompt":"An art gallery has only paintings and sculptures.

According to the problem, ( A = 2700 ). We are given that 1/6 of the pieces on display are sculptures. Let's denote the number of pieces on display as ( D ), so the number of sculptures on display is ( D/6 ). We are also given that 1/3 of the pieces not on display are paintings. Since 1200 sculptures are not on display, this means that the number of paintings not on display is ( 1200/3 = 400 ). Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces not on display. We know that 1200 sculptures are not on display, and there are 400 paintings not on display, so the total number of pieces not on display is ( 1200 + 400 = 1600 ). Since the total number of pieces of art in the gallery is 2700, and 1600 are not on display, the number of pieces on display is ( A - 1600 = 2700 - 1600 = 1100 ). Now we can find the ratio of the pieces of art displayed to the total pieces of art in the gallery: ( frac{D}{A} = frac{1100}{2700} ) To simplify this ratio, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 100: ( frac{1100}{2700} = frac{11}{27} ) So the ratio of the pieces of art displayed to the total pieces of art in the gallery is boxed{11:27} ."},{"prompt":"Let ( U ) be a finite set and let ( f ) and ( g ) be bijective functions from ( U ) onto itself.

In both cases, ( x in S cap T ). **Lemma 2: ( f(S cap T) = g(S cap T) = S cap T ).** **Proof of Lemma 2:** By symmetry, it suffices to prove ( f(S cap T) = S cap T ), which means ( f^{-1}(S cap T) = S cap T ). Since ( S cap T ) is finite, this is equivalent to proving ( f(S cap T) subseteq S cap T ). Let ( f(x) in S cap T ).

(2) The graph of the function y=sin omega x, xinmathbb{R} (omega > 0 and omeganeq1), can be seen as compressing (if omega > 1) or extending (if 0 < omega < 1) the x-coordinates of all points on the sine curve to frac {1}{omega } times the original (y-coordinates unchanged). (3) The graph of the function y=sin (x+phi), xinmathbb{R} (where phineq 0), can be seen as shifting all points on the sine curve to the left (when phi > 0) or to the right (when phi < 0) by |phi| units (use the method of shifting and pay attention to the direction: \\"add left\\", \\"subtract right\\"). It is possible to first perform the shifting transformation and then the stretching/compressing transformation, or vice versa, but note: when stretching/compressing first, extract the coefficient in front of x for the shifting unit."},{"prompt":"What is the slope angle of the line y = x + sqrt{3}?

So, we can set up the equation: [ frac{0 cdot x + 1 cdot 12 + 2 cdot 13 + 3 cdot (40 - (x + 12 + 13))}{40} = 2 ] Now, let's solve for ( x ): [ frac{0 cdot x + 12 + 26 + 3 cdot (40 - x - 25)}{40} = 2 ] [ frac{12 + 26 + 120 - 3x - 75}{40} = 2 ] [ frac{83 - 3x}{40} = 2 ] [ 83 - 3x = 80 ] [ -3x = 80 - 83 ] [ -3x = -3 ] [ x = 1 ] So, boxed{1} student did not borrow any books from the library."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function L(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
