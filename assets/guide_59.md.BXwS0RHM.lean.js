Knowing that the function attains its minimum value at the axis of symmetry x = -1 and the parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of x^2 is positive), we can conclude that f(-1) is less than both fleft(-frac{3}{2}right) and fleft(frac{3}{2}right). To determine the relationship between fleft(-frac{3}{2}right) and fleft(frac{3}{2}right), we consider the fact that for x values equidistant from the axis of symmetry, the function values are equal because of the parabola's symmetric nature. Here, -frac{3}{2} and frac{3}{2} are equidistant from -1. However, since both x = -frac{3}{2} and x = frac{3}{2} are on the same side of the axis of symmetry and one is further away, the function value at the point that is further away from the axis will be larger because the parabola is increasing as you move away from the vertex on either side. Thus, f(-1) is the minimum among the three, and fleft(-frac{3}{2}right) = fleft(frac{3}{2}right) due to the symmetry of the function f(x - 1) around x = -1.

Let this smallest triangle have side length ( a ). 3. **Examining the Partition**: All the smaller triangles within the partition are also equilateral triangles, but by assumption, no two triangles can have the same side length. Hence, the smallest triangle with side length ( a ) must coexist with other triangles whose sides are strictly greater than ( a ). 4. **Implications of the Partition**: Consider how these triangles could be arranged to form the original equilateral triangle. The smallest triangle, by virtue of having the smallest side length ( a ), could not fill any gaps with its congruent copies because no other triangle has side length ( a ). 5. **Contradiction**: Since the triangles are unequal in size, it is necessary to identify the combinations and angles at which they fit precisely into the original triangle. However, the strict inequality in sizes implies that this fitting would be non-trivial and would require specific configurations. It is impossible to fit non-identical equilateral triangles perfectly into a larger equilateral triangle because any attempt to perfectly match smaller triangles would lead to constraints that contradict the required unequal side lengths. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, it is impossible to partition an equilateral triangle into a finite number of smaller equilateral triangles such that each smaller triangle is of distinct size. Hence, the original equilateral triangle cannot be partitioned into pairwise unequal smaller equilateral triangles. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Two rectangles, 8 times 10 and 12 times 9, are overlaid on each other as shown in the diagram.

Assume two parallel faces of the cube are (ABCD) and (EFGH), such that the edges (AE), (BF), (CG), and (DH) are parallel. 2. **Introducing Planes through Diagonals:** Let's consider the body diagonal (AG) of the cube. To understand the impact of planes perpendicular to this diagonal, first consider them at the midpoint and trisection points of (AG). These planes are called (S_0), (S_1), and (S_2), respectively. - (S_1) and (S_2) are the planes perpendicular to (AG) at points dividing (AG) into three equal parts. - (S_1) passes through points (B, D,) and (E) extended as a plane. - (S_2) passes through points (C, F,) and (H) extended as a plane. 3. **Intersection Explanation:** The construction follows from the fact that triangles (ABG), (ADG), (AEG) formed by vertices at (A, G) connecting through cube edges, are congruent triangles. - The height from (B), (D), and (E) to the diagonal (AG) intersects at the same point, confirming (S_1). - Similarly, (S_2) is perpendicular to (AG) and parallels this construction at the third sections. These (S_1) and (S_2) planes are equidistant from each other and form midsections of corresponding edges (AG). 4. **Midsurface Plane (S_0):** The midsurface plane (S_0) is perpendicular to (AG) and passes through the midpoint, thus dividing edges connected opposite to (A) and (G), like: [ BF, FE, EH, HD, DC, CB ] These edges are bisected by (S_0). 5. **Considering Other Diagonals:** Now consider body diagonals (BH, CE, DF). Construct planes perpendicular to these diagonals at their third sections. - The intersections of these planes at cube vertices divide each diagonal and face intersections consistently. - All cube faces witness consistent division into (24) right-angled triangles forming (12) larger sections by unifying each opposite side pairs forming continuations at vertex intersections. 6. **Progress to the Initial Problem:** Including (S_0), which additionally divides each face into distinct symmetry. - Each face splits into four right-angled triangles, isolated by perimeters forming distinct parts. - The right-angled triangles unify three meeting at the vertices into connected sections.

If the sum of these is even, A wins; otherwise, B wins. For which values of ( k ) are the winning chances of ( A ) and ( B ) equal?","completion":"To determine the values of k for which players A and B have equal chances of winning, we need to carefully analyze the parity of the sum of k randomly selected numbers from the first 100 positive integers. This analysis involves understanding when the sum is even and when it is odd. Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Even and Odd Sum Selection:** Consider the first 100 positive integers {1, 2, ..., 100}. We need to select k numbers randomly and check the parity of their sum. For the sum to be even, the number of odd numbers selected must be even; otherwise, the sum will be odd. 2. **Handling Edge Cases with 1 and 100:** Start by examining groups that include either 1 or 100, but not both. These groups can be paired such that one group’s sum is even and the other’s is odd. This method can be generalized: choose (k-1) numbers from the first 98 numbers and add either 1 or 100 as the k-th number. This ensures each pair has one even and one odd sum. 3. **Generalizing for all Adjacent Pairs:** Extend this idea to other adjacent number pairs like {2, 99}, {3, 98}, and so on up to {50, 51}. For each pair, consider (k-1) numbers selected from the remaining numbers in the set, combined with one of the pair, ensuring that within each group the sums are balanced between even and odd. 4. **Impact of Parity on k:** When k is odd, there is an equal amount of even and odd sums for the combinations that include any particular number combination. The reasoning follows that pairing always includes an odd number at least once, leading to the sum-changing nature evenly distributed. 5. **Counting Non-Paired Selections for Even k:** For the remaining selections that can’t be paired using the method above, these selections must include both elements from several pairs. All combinations involving exact pairs will result in \`k\` group sums being all even or all odd, based on whether k/2 is odd or even. 6. **Conclusion for Winning Odds:** - **Odd k:** Any sum-parity balancing rests on the equal distribution and such balance will favor neither player. [ boxed{text{For odd } k, text{ both } A text{ and } B text{ have equal chance of winning.}} ] - **Even k:** Only those selections where exactly k/2 is even produce strictly even sums and exact k/2 odd remain odd: - If k/2 is even, sums become naturally even, and hence A wins. - If k/2 is odd, sums become odd, favoring B. 7. **Formalizing the Case with Combinations:** Using combinatorial calculations, verify the counts associated with text{choose } k from 100: [ binom{100}{k} ] Different solutions using combinatorial differences can confirm: [ text{For } k text{ odd: } ] [ frac{1}{2}binom{100}{k} ] For the exact difference in cases: [ frac{1}{2}left( binom{100}{k} - binom{50}{k/2} right) ] # Conclusion: The equal winning chances are thus specifically under the condition of odd selections (k being odd).

Calculate ( S ) by considering each characteristic separately. Let ( m_i ) be the number of plants having the ( i )-th characteristic.

The expression ( frac{10^{2019} - 10}{9} - 2018 ), when expanded, will be dominated by the large term ( 10^{2019} ) which produces a number with 2019 digits where a significant number will be ones when factored out in the alternate step. 10. Specifically, the way the terms break into 2019 places after carrying out the subtractions, digit '1' repetitively appears due to the cyclic nature of the subtractions around base 10 carryovers. 11.

First, let's find the LCM of the given numbers: - The LCM of 5 and 850 is 850 because 850 is a multiple of 5. - The LCM of 850 and 35 can be found by prime factorizing both numbers: - 850 = 2 * 5^2 * 17 - 35 = 5 * 7 The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in either number, so: LCM(850, 35) = 2 * 5^2 * 7 * 17 = 850 * 7 = 5950 - The LCM of 5950 and 27 can be found similarly: - 5950 = 2 * 5^2 * 7 * 17 - 27 = 3^3 LCM(5950, 27) = 2 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7 * 17 = 5950 * 27 / gcd(5950, 27) Since 27 is not a factor of 5950 and they share no common prime factors, their gcd is 1. So: LCM(5950, 27) = 5950 * 27 - The LCM of 5950 * 27 and 90 can be found similarly: - 5950 * 27 = 2 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7 * 17 - 90 = 2 * 3^2 * 5 LCM(5950 * 27, 90) = 2 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7 * 17 = 5950 * 27 (since 90's prime factors are already included in 5950 * 27 with equal or higher powers) Now, we calculate 5950 * 27: 5950 * 27 = 160650 Since we are looking for the least 7-digit number, we need to find the first multiple of 160650 that is a 7-digit number. We can do this by dividing 1,000,000 (the smallest 7-digit number) by 160650 and then taking the ceiling of the result to find the next whole multiple. 1,000,000 / 160650 ≈ 6.225 (approximately) Taking the ceiling of this quotient gives us 7. Therefore, the first multiple of 160650 that is a 7-digit number is: 160650 * 7 = 1124550 Now, we add 4 to this number to get the number that leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by each of the given numbers: 1124550 + 4 = 1124554 Finally, we find the sum of the digits in 1124554: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 22 The sum of the digits in n is boxed{22} ."},{"prompt":"Find the corrected sample variance for the given sample distribution ( n=10 ) : begin{array}{lccc} x_{i} & 102 & 104 & 108 n_{i} & 2 & 3 & 5 end{array}","completion":"To find the corrected sample variance for the given distribution where ( n = 10 ): **Given:** [ begin{array}{lccc} x_{i} & 102 & 104 & 108 n_{i} & 2 & 3 & 5 end{array} ] 1. **Define new variables:** Let ( u_{i} = x_{i} - 104 ).

The roles of p and q are symmetric in the equation. 3. **Divisibility Conditions**: - Since p divides 3(q-1) and p geq q, it follows that 3(q-1) leq 3(p-1) < 3p. - Therefore, we have the possibilities 3(q-1) = 2p or 3(q-1) = p. 4. **Case 1: 3(q-1) = 2p**: - Substituting, we get q = frac{2p}{3} + 1. - For q to be an integer, 2p must be divisible by 3.

Since q must divide 3(p-1), we replace: [ q mid 3(3(q-1) - 1) = 9q - 12 ] So, q must divide 12.

As we move from one person to the next, we encounter either an interesting pair (opposite genders) or a non-interesting pair (same gender). 4. Since the table is round, the number of interesting pairs must be even. This is because we must return to the starting person, who has the same gender as when we started.

We need to find the smallest diameter ( d_n ) for the sphere for ( n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ) and ( 8 ). Below we calculate these diameters step-by-step. For ( n = 2 ): 1. When placing 2 points on a sphere, the distance between these two points can only be 1 unit if they are antipodal points (exactly opposite each other). 2. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere must be at least 1 unit. Conclusion: [ d_2 = 1 ] For ( n = 3 ): 1. Three points on a sphere form a plane passing through the center of the sphere, making a circle on the sphere's surface. 2. The smallest such circle can be inscribed in an equilateral triangle with side length 1. 3. The diameter of the circle is equal to the circumradius of the equilateral triangle with side length 1. 4. Using the formula for the circumradius ( R ) of an equilateral triangle, we get: [ R = frac{s}{sqrt{3}} ] where ( s = 2 ) (since distance between points is 1), [ R = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} approx 1.155 ] Conclusion: [ d_3 = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} approx 1.155 ] For ( n = 4 ): 1. Four points in a plane can form a square with side length 1, which can be inscribed in a circle. 2. The diameter of this circle, hence the diameter of the sphere, is the diagonal of the square: [ d = sqrt{2} ] 3. Alternatively, the four points can form a tetrahedron. The circumradius of such a tetrahedron is given by the formula: [ R = frac{sqrt{6}}{4} times s ] where ( s = 1 ), so: [ R = frac{sqrt{6}}{4} times 1 = sqrt{frac{3}{2}} approx 1.225 ] Conclusion: [ d_4 = sqrt{frac{3}{2}} approx 1.225 ] For ( n = 5 ): 1. Five points cannot lie entirely in a plane in such a way that all distances are at least 1 unit apart without forming a larger diameter. 2. Considering spatial arrangement, we place four points at the vertices of a tetrahedron and the fifth point such that it maintains a distance of at least 1 unit with all other points. 3. This is achievable if they form a square pyramid structure ensuring the minimum diameter to be slightly larger than previous cases. Conclusion: [ d_5 = sqrt{2} approx 1.414 ] For ( n = 6 ): 1. Six points can be placed at the vertices of a regular octahedron, which is formed by reflecting the tetrahedron. 2. The diameter remains the same as in the tetrahedron case since all distances are maintained, and no larger diameter is formed by moving to an octahedral configuration.

By rearranging, we can achieve a smaller diameter by forming an anti-prism-like structure in which points move closer while maintaining the required distance. 3.

Since ( f(x) f(x + f(y)) > 0 ) for all ( x, y in mathbb{R}^+ ), we can divide both sides of the inequality by ( f(x + f(y)) ) (assuming ( f(x + f(y)) neq 0 )): [ f(x + f(y)) geq f(x) + frac{f(x) f(y)}{f(x + f(y))} ] 4. Since ( f(x) < N ) for all ( x in mathbb{R}^+ ), we have: [ f(x + f(y)) < N ] 5. Combining the inequalities, we get: [ N^2 > f(x + f(y))^2 geq f(x) f(x + f(y)) + f(x) f(y) > f(x)^2 + f(x) f(y) ] 6.

By induction, we can show that: [ f(x) < frac{N}{(sqrt{2})^n} ] for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). 8. Sending ( n ) to infinity, we get: [ frac{N}{(sqrt{2})^n} to 0 text{ as } n to infty ] which implies ( f(x) to 0 ) for all ( x in mathbb{R}^+ ). 9. This is a contradiction because ( f ) maps ( mathbb{R}^+ ) to ( mathbb{R}^+ ), and thus ( f(x) ) cannot be arbitrarily small. 10.

This directly implies the drawing does not rotate merely by 90 degrees if the cube returns to its original place, as the cube’s true geometric symmetry ensures either 0 or a multiple of 180-degree rotations. # Conclusion for Part (b): [ boxed{text{No, it cannot be rotated by 90 degrees.}} ]"},{"prompt":"The perimeter of an isosceles triangle is 15, with one side length being 3.

A: 3 B: 4 C: 5 D: 6","completion":"To solve the problem, we start with the given information that the perimeter of the isosceles triangle is 15, and one side length is 3. We need to determine if this side length of 3 is a leg or the base of the triangle to find the length of the base. **Case 1: Assuming the side length of 3 is one of the legs** If we assume the given side length of 3 is one of the legs, then the other leg would also be 3 (since it's an isosceles triangle). The perimeter is the sum of all sides, so we calculate the length of the base as follows: [ text{Perimeter} = text{Base} + text{Leg}_1 + text{Leg}_2 ] [ 15 = text{Base} + 3 + 3 ] [ 15 = text{Base} + 6 ] [ text{Base} = 15 - 6 ] [ text{Base} = 9 ] However, for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. In this case, we check if 3 + 3 > 9. Since this is not true, a triangle with two legs of 3 and a base of 9 cannot exist. Thus, we discard this case. **Case 2: Assuming the side length of 3 is the base** If the given side length of 3 is the base of the isosceles triangle, then the two legs must be equal, and their combined length plus the base must equal the perimeter.

Pipe 2 fills the tank in 30 hours, so its rate is 1/30 of the tank per hour. Pipe 3 fills the tank in 40 hours, so its rate is 1/40 of the tank per hour. When all three pipes are open, they fill the tank at a combined rate of: (1/20) + (1/30) + (1/40) = (6/120) + (4/120) + (3/120) = 13/120 of the tank per hour. Now, let's find out how long it takes to fill 80% of the tank without the leak: 80% of the tank is 0.8 of the tank. At the combined rate of 13/120 per hour, we can calculate the time to fill 80% of the tank as follows: 0.8 = (13/120) * t t = 0.8 / (13/120) t = 0.8 * (120/13) t = 96/13 t ≈ 7.38 hours After the tank is 80% full, a leak develops, and one-fourth of the water supplied goes out. This means that the effective rate of filling the tank is reduced to three-fourths of the combined rate: Effective rate = (3/4) * (13/120) = (39/480) = (13/160) of the tank per hour.

Consider the kilometer posts C_1 and C_2 mentioned in the problem, where: - C_1A and C_1B are the distances from post C_1 to cities A and B respectively. - C_2A and C_2B are the distances from post C_2 to cities A and B respectively. 2. **First Situation Analysis:** Since one of the distances on C_1 is twice the other, there are two possibilities: - C_1A = 2C_1B. - C_1B = 2C_1A. Assume that the tourist travels from A to B. 3. **Subcase 1: C_1A = 2C_1B:** - If C_1A = 2C_1B, then the total distance from A to B can be expressed as: [ C_1A + C_1B = d ] Given C_1A = 2C_1B, substitute to get: [ 2C_1B + C_1B = 3C_1B = d implies C_1B = frac{d}{3} ] Therefore, C_1A = 2 cdot frac{d}{3} = frac{2d}{3}. 4. **Subcase Analysis for C_2:** After traveling 10 km further to C_2, there's a new relation C_2A = 3C_2B. We now have: [ C_2A + C_2B = d ] Given C_2A = 3C_2B, we substitute to get: [ 3C_2B + C_2B = 4C_2B = d implies C_2B = frac{d}{4} ] Therefore, C_2A = 3 cdot frac{d}{4} = frac{3d}{4}. 5. **Verification of Movement and Distance:** The distance traveled by the tourist between C_1 and C_2 is 10 km: [ C_2A - C_1A = 10 implies frac{3d}{4} - frac{2d}{3} = 10 ] Finding a common denominator (12) for subtraction: [ frac{9d}{12} - frac{8d}{12} = 10 implies frac{d}{12} = 10 implies d = 120 ] 6. **Subcase 2: C_1B = 2C_1A:** - If C_1B = 2C_1A, then the total distance d: [ C_1A + C_1B = d ] Given C_1B = 2C_1A, substitute to get: [ C_1A + 2C_1A = 3C_1A = d implies C_1A = frac{d}{3} ] Therefore, C_1B = 2 cdot frac{d}{3} = frac{2d}{3}. 7. **Subcase Analysis for C_2:** Continuing similar calculations for C_2: [ C_2A + C_2B = d ] Given C_2A = 3C_2B, substitute to get: [ 3C_2B + C_2B = 4C_2B = d implies C_2B = frac{d}{4} ] Therefore, C_2A = 3 cdot frac{d}{4} = frac{3d}{4}. Considering the distance traveled by the tourist is 10 km: [ C_2A - C_1A = 10 implies frac{d}{3} - frac{d}{4} = 10 ] Finding a common denominator (12) for subtraction: [ frac{4d}{12} - frac{3d}{12} = 1 implies frac{d}{12} = 1 implies d = 24 ] # Conclusion: Thus, the possible distances from city A to city B are: [ boxed{120 text{ km} text{ or } 24 text{ km}} ] Only these two distances satisfy all given conditions in the problem."},{"prompt":"triangle ( ABC ), the lines connecting the vertices of the triangle with the center of the inscribed circle divide this circle into arcs whose lengths are in the ratio ( p: q: r ).

Additionally, in an orthocentric tetrahedron, this sphere also passes through the orthocenters of the faces. 2. **Assumption:** Let ( f ) be the first Feuerbach sphere and ( g ) be the incircle sphere of the tetrahedron. Assume that our tetrahedron is orthocentric and that ( f ) coincides with ( g ). 3. **Analyzing points on the sphere:** Since ( f ) and ( g ) coincide, every face of the tetrahedron has exactly one common point with the sphere ( f ), which is the point of tangency. Hence, for each face ( Delta_i ) (where ( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 )), the centroid ( S_{i} ) coincides with the orthocenter ( M_{i} ). 4. **Properties of centroids and orthocenters:** For a centroid ( S ) to coincide with the orthocenter ( M ) in a triangle, the triangle must be regular (equilateral). This follows from the property that in regular triangles, the altitude, median, and perpendicular bisector coincide. 5. **Conclusion about the faces:** Since each face of the tetrahedron must be equilateral for the centroids to coincide with the orthocenters, all faces of the tetrahedron are equilateral triangles. 6. **Implication for the tetrahedron:** If all the faces of a tetrahedron are regular, then the tetrahedron itself must be a regular tetrahedron. # Sufficient Condition: 1. **Reverse implication:** Consider a regular tetrahedron where all faces are equilateral triangles. 2. **Properties of regular tetrahedra:** In a regular tetrahedron, all centroids of the faces coincide with their respective orthocenters, and hence the circumcenter of the tetrahedron is equidistant from all vertices and tangential points. 3. **Feuerbach sphere and incircle sphere:** For the regular tetrahedron, the Feuerbach sphere defined through the centroids (and orthocenters) of the faces perfectly matches the incircle sphere ( g ), fulfilling the coincidence condition. # Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the necessity (if ( f ) coincides with ( g ), then the tetrahedron is regular) and sufficiency (if the tetrahedron is regular, then ( f ) coincides with ( g )) conditions hold.

Now, let's substitute the calculated values back into the equation for f(3): f(3) = f(2) - f(1) = (f(1) - f(0)) - f(1) = (0 - 1) - 0 = -1. Hence, the correct answer is boxed{B}.

Since the points are on the surface of the sphere, these lines are radii of the sphere. Given that the distance between any two points on the surface is at least 1, the angle between any two such radii lines must be at least (60^circ). This is derived from the fact that the arc length on the unit sphere corresponding to an angle of (60^circ) is 1. 3. **Spherical caps analysis**: We focus on the spherical caps formed by considering a spherical cap for each point on the sphere with an apex angle of (60^circ).

Speed of the man's train = 70 kmph Speed of the goods train = 42 kmph Relative speed = 70 kmph + 42 kmph = 112 kmph Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the length of the goods train which is given in meters. 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds (since 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds) So, 112 kmph = 112 * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) = 112 * (10/36) m/s = 31.111... m/s (rounded to 3 decimal places) Now we have the relative speed in meters per second, we can calculate the time it takes for the goods train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance to be covered is the length of the goods train, which is 280 meters.

We need to show that P(m+1) holds, i.e., (k_{m+1} + 1)^2 geq 4s_{m+1}. Since k_{m+1} > k_m and they are not consecutive, we have k_{m+1} geq k_m + 2.

This measure helps to prevent the application from storing users' credit card information and shifts the responsibility for handling sensitive card data to specialized payment processors that are designed with security in mind. 2. **Encryption of Stored Data:** - Ensure that all data stored by the application, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as Full Name (FIO), delivery address, and card numbers, are encrypted. - In cases where storing card information is necessary, it should be securely encrypted. This adds a layer of security by making the data unreadable to unauthorized persons. - Additionally, request a PIN code for accessing the application to prevent unauthorized access. 3. **Encryption of Data in Transit:** - Secure the data during transmission between the user's device and the server infrastructure using encryption protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security). This prevents data from being intercepted and read by malicious actors during transmission. 4. **Code Obfuscation and Security Measures:** - Implement code obfuscation techniques and other measures to protect the application's code. This makes it difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer the application and add malicious functionalities such as sending copies of intercepted data to remote servers. 5. **Restriction on Rooted Devices:** - Prohibit the installation of the application on devices that have been rooted or jailbroken. Such actions compromise the security level of the device and all installed applications, making them vulnerable to malicious attacks. 6. **Antivirus Protection Agent:** - Include an antivirus protection agent within the application's framework.

If (N) is the intersection of the median (BM) and the perpendicular from (H) to (B_1), then it has to coincide with the point (P) since the centroid divides the median in the ratio 2:1. 4.

We shall observe the position of ( A' ). 3. **Properties of Symmetry**: Since ( CP = CQ ), the angle bisector of ( angle C ) is also the perpendicular bisector of segment ( PQ ). This implies that the segments ( PA ) and ( QA ) are reflected symmetrically through the angle bisector to form ( PA' ) and ( QA' ). 4. **Formation of Isosceles or Rectangle**: Notice that quadrilateral ( PQA'A ) forms either an isosceles trapezoid (if ( AB neq BC )) or a rectangle (if ( AB = BC )). This is due to the equal distances and symmetrical properties established by the initial conditions. 5. **Circumcircle on ( A', P, Q )**: Because ( PA' = QA' ), point ( A' ) is equidistant from ( P ) and ( Q ). We can infer that ( A' ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( PQ ), which is actually the angle bisector of ( angle C ). Thus, point ( A' ) is a common point on the circumcircles of ( triangle APQ ) for any selection of ( P ) and ( Q ). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the circumcircle of ( triangle APQ ) always passes through the unique point ( A' ), regardless of the chosen points ( P ) and ( Q ).

For these triples, we need to evaluate if the expression [d = a^{1999} + b^{1999} + c^{1999}] can take the value 2 or be a prime number. 1. **Expression Evaluation:** First, note that for any integer (a), we can write: [ a^{1999} - a = a(a^{1998} - 1) ] The term (a^{1998} - 1) can be factored further as a product. However, the critical insight is that (a^{1999} - a) contains the factor (a(a^2 - 1) = a(a - 1)(a + 1)). 2. **Divisibility by 6:** Observe that (a(a - 1)(a + 1)) is the product of three consecutive integers. The product of any three consecutive integers is always divisible by 6 because it includes (at least) one multiple of 2 and one multiple of 3.

Hence, [ d equiv 0 pmod{6} ] This implies that (d) is divisible by 6. 5. **Checking Specific Values:** - **For (d = 2):** Since (d) is divisible by 6, it is impossible for (d) to equal 2. - **For (d) being a prime number:** The only prime number divisible by 6 is 6 itself (since other numbers divisible by 6 are composite).

Let ( x ) and ( y ) be the two-digit numbers that satisfy the given conditions. According to the problem, the equation to satisfy is: [ (x + 15)(y - 20) = xy ] 2. Expanding the left-hand side: [ xy - 20x + 15y - 300 ] 3. Setting the expanded left-hand side equal to the right-hand side: [ xy - 20x + 15y - 300 = xy ] 4. Subtract ( xy ) from both sides: [ -20x + 15y - 300 = 0 ] 5. Rearrange the equation to isolate the terms involving ( x ) and ( y ): [ 15y - 20x = 300 ] 6. Simplifying this equation, we get: [ 3y - 4x = 60 ] 7. From the equation ( 3y - 4x = 60 ), we see that ( x ) must be divisible by 3 and ( y ) must be divisible by 4. Hence, let's assume: [ x = 3x_1 quad text{and} quad y = 4y_1 ] 8. Substitute ( x ) and ( y ) into the equation ( 3y - 4x = 60 ): [ 3(4y_1) - 4(3x_1) = 60 ] 9.

Now, we need ( x ) and ( y ) to be two-digit numbers. The inequality constraints for ( x ) are: [ 10 leq x < 100 ] Given ( x = 3x_1 ), thus: [ 10 leq 3x_1 < 100 ] 13. Dividing the inequalities by 3: [ frac{10}{3} leq x_1 < frac{100}{3} ] Which simplifies to: [ 4 leq x_1 leq 28 ] 14. And for ( y ): [ 30 leq y < 100 ] Given ( y = 4y_1 ), thus: [ 30 leq 4y_1 < 100 ] 15. Dividing the inequalities by 4: [ frac{30}{4} leq y_1 < frac{100}{4} ] Which simplifies to: [ 7.5 leq y_1 < 25 ] Since ( x_1 = y_1 - 5 ) and ( y_1 = x_1 + 5 ), substitute: [ y_1 = 4 + 5, ldots, 28 + 5 ] Hence, [ 9 leq y_1 leq 33 ] 16.

Let a triangle triangle ABC be given with a point P inside the triangle and a point D outside the plane of the triangle. We are tasked with proving that if there is an acute angle among angle APD, angle BPD, and angle CPD, then there must also be an obtuse angle among them. First Solution 1. **Projection of Point D**: Let D' be the orthogonal (perpendicular) projection of D onto the plane of the triangle, and P neq D'. Then, the ray PD forms an acute angle with the ray PD'. 2. **Comparing Angle Magnitudes**: We first show that among two rays starting from P in the plane, the one forming a larger angle with PD' will form a larger angle with the spatial line PD. - Consider any two arbitrary rays starting from P, intersecting points Q and Q_1 such that PQ = PQ_1 = PD'. - If angle QPD' < angle Q_1PD' (according to Figure 1), then D'Q < D'Q_1, consequently, in the right-angled triangles QDD' and Q_1DD', we have: QD < Q_1D - Therefore, in the triangles QDP and Q_1DP: angle QPD < angle Q_1PD 3. **Plane and Perpendicular Line Intersection**: Let us consider the plane intersecting at P and perpendicular to PD. This plane, when intersecting the plane of the triangle, will give a line e perpendicular to PD. 4. **Angle Properties Relative to Line e**: - For every point Q on the line e, angle QPD = 90^circ. - Thus, for any point Q in the same half-space defined by the line e as where D' lies, angle QPD < 90^circ. 5. **P and Triangle Geometry**: Since P is an internal point of the triangle, the line e must separate at least one triangle vertex (in Figure 1, vertex A) from D', as well as at least one other vertex. - This implies angle PD^{prime}A < 90^circ. - Meanwhile, angle PD^{prime}B > 90^circ if they are separated by line e. Hence, there will always be an angle among angle APD, angle BPD, and angle CPD that is obtuse. blacksquare Second Solution 1. **Semispheres and Thales's Theorem Application**: Consider the spheres with diameters AD, BD, and CD. Denote these spheres by mathbf{G}_1, mathbf{G}_2, and mathbf{G}_3 respectively. - By Thales' theorem, angle APD is obtuse, right, or acute according to whether P is inside mathbf{G}_1, on mathbf{G}_1, or outside mathbf{G}_1, respectively. Similar considerations apply to angle BPD and angle CPD with respect to mathbf{G}_2 and mathbf{G}_3. 2. **Intersection of Spheres with the Triangle Plane**: Each of the spheres intersects the plane of the triangle along circles k_1, k_2, and k_3. - The diameters of these circles are projections of AD', BD', and CD'. These circles all pass through the point D'. The intersections of pairs of these circles form points such as A_1, B_1, and C_1, which, by Thales' theorem, lie on or extend from the sides of the triangle (or their extensions if D' is outside). 3. **Geometry of the Circle and Triangle Plane**: The combination of these circles completely covers the triangle. Therefore, any point P inside the triangle but distinct from D' lies inside at least one circle and outside another. - This implies P is inside at least one sphere and outside another, confirming mixed angular properties for angle APD, angle BPD, and angle CPD. Thus, if one of these angles is acute, another must be obtuse. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the sets P={x|1<3^xleq9}, Q={xinmathbb{Z}|y=ln(2x^2+7x)}, then Pcap Q= ( ) A: {1} B: {1,2} C: {2,3} D: {1,2,3}","completion":"For the set P={x|1<3^xleq9}={x|0<xleq2}, and Q={xinmathbb{Z}|y=ln(-2x^2+7x)}={xinmathbb{Z}|-2x^2+7x>0}={1,2,3}, then Pcap Q={1,2}.

Again, since adding a constant to each data point does not affect the variance, the variances of Sets B and D are equal. Therefore, we have: [ text{Variance of Set B} = text{Variance of Set D} ] 3. **Conclusion:** Since the variances of Sets A, B, and D are equal due to the addition of a constant to each set, and variance is unaffected by such an addition, the set that is different in terms of variance must be Set C.

For every 1 yuan increase in the selling price, the sales volume decreases by 10 units. This relationship can be expressed as: [y = 600 - 10(x - 40) = -10x + 1000.] Next, we need to find the functional relationship between the profit w (yuan) and the selling price x (yuan). The profit per unit is the difference between the selling price and the purchase price, which is x - 30. Therefore, the total profit w can be calculated as: [w = y cdot (x - 30) = (1000 - 10x)(x - 30) = -10x^2 + 1300x - 30000.] Part 2: Maximum Profit **(2)** To determine the maximum profit when the selling price x is not less than 44 yuan and the sales volume is at least 540 units, we first establish the constraints for x: [x geqslant 44 quad text{and} quad 1000 - 10x geqslant 540.] Solving 1000 - 10x geqslant 540 gives us x leqslant 46. Thus, we have 44 leqslant x leqslant 46. The profit function w can be rewritten as: [w = -10x^2 + 1300x - 30000 = -10(x - 65)^2 + 12250.] Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative (a = -10 < 0), the profit function opens downwards, and its maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The axis of symmetry is x = 65, but since x is constrained between 44 and 46, we evaluate the profit at the endpoints of this interval. Given that the profit increases as x increases within the interval 44 leqslant x leqslant 46, we find the maximum profit when x = 46: [w_{text{max}} = -10(46)^2 + 1300(46) - 30000 = 8640 , text{yuan}.] Therefore, the maximum profit obtained by the shopping mall from selling this brand of toys is boxed{8640 , text{yuan}}."},{"prompt":"An equilateral triangle ABP, with side AB of length 3 inches, is placed inside a square AXYZ with a side of length 6 inches so that vertex B is on side AX.

Speed of first train = 60 km/hr Speed of second train = 40 km/hr Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the lengths of the trains which are given in meters. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 100 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (100 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (500/18) m/s Relative speed ≈ 27.78 m/s The combined length of the two trains is: Combined length = Length of first train + Length of second train Combined length = 120 m + 160 m Combined length = 280 m Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the trains to cross each other using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = Combined length / Relative speed Time = 280 m / 27.78 m/s Time ≈ 10.08 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{10.08} seconds for the two trains to cross each other."},{"prompt":"Given positive integers x and y satisfy (2x5)(2y5)=25, the value of x+y is ( ) A: 10 B: 18 C: 26 D: 10 or 18","completion":"Since x and y are positive integers, we have the following cases: - Case 1: begin{align*} 2x-5 &= 5 2y-5 &= 5 end{align*} - Case 2: begin{align*} 2x-5 &= -5 2y-5 &= -5 end{align*} - Case 3: begin{align*} 2x-5 &= 1 2y-5 &= 25 end{align*} - Case 4: begin{align*} 2x-5 &= -1 2y-5 &= -25 end{align*} Solving these, we get x=5, y=5, or x=3, y=15.

Given that 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees, which lies in the first quadrant where all three functions are positive, we can compare their values directly. 1. In the first quadrant, for angles between 0 and frac{pi}{2} radians (90 degrees), we know that the sine function increases from 0 to 1, and the cosine function decreases from 1 to 0. Therefore, sin 1 < sin frac{pi}{2} = 1 and cos 1 < cos 0 = 1. 2. Moreover, since tan x = frac{sin x}{cos x}, we can infer that tan 1 = frac{sin 1}{cos 1}. Since sin 1 < 1 and cos 1 < 1, tan 1 will be further from 1 than sin 1 but not necessarily further than cos 1. However, because the tangent function increases faster than both sine and cosine as we approach frac{pi}{2} radians from 0, we know that tan 1 > sin 1 and tan 1 > cos 1. 3. To determine the exact relationship, we need to decide between sin 1 and cos 1. Since the sine starts at 0 and increases to 1, while the cosine decreases from 1 to 0 in the first quadrant, sin 1 will be greater than cos 1 because the angle 1 radian is closer to frac{pi}{2} than to 0.

This is possible as every vertex shares the common point ( O ). 2. **Alternative for ( n = 4 ) when ( O ) is Not Inside**: - Choose vertices ( C ) and ( D ) of the quadrilateral ( ABCD ) which form the obtuse angles. Draw perpendiculars from these vertices to the sides ( BC ) and ( AD ) respectively. Let these perpendicular lines intersect at points ( P ) and ( Q ) such that ( PQ parallel AB ). This construction will decompose ( ABCD ) into four smaller cyclic quadrilaterals due to perpendicularity and the preservation of cyclic properties. 3. **Case for ( n = 5 )**: - If ( ABCD ) is an isosceles trapezoid with ( AB parallel CD ) and ( AD = BC ), the quadrilateral can trivially be decomposed using lines parallel to ( AB ) which inherently create cyclic quadrilaterals because parallelograms within a cyclic quadrilateral remain cyclic. - For non-isosceles trapezoids, we can decompose ( ABCD ) into a cyclic quadrilateral and a smaller trapezoid. - Further decompose the smaller trapezoid into an isosceles trapezoid and a triangle. The triangle can be divided further into cyclic quadrilaterals by the same lines based on perpendiculars and sides. 4. **General Case for ( n geq 6 )**: - By induction, suppose it is true for ( k geq 6 ). Consider how we can add another diagonal or side that intersects the quadrilateral inside the circle. - Each internal vertex of the cyclic quadrilateral will maintain properties of cyclicity when subdividing further. - Hence, the existing subdivided quadrilaterals can further be divided to include ( n+1 ) quadrilaterals.

To verify Baron Munchausen's claim, we will use visual aids and logical arguments based on geometric properties. 1. **Consideration of Polygon and Point Placement:** - Let's draw a polygon and a point inside it. The essential criteria are that any line passing through this point should divide the polygon into exactly three smaller polygons. 2. **Examine Lines Passing Through the Point:** - Draw lines passing through the point that intersect the polygon at various points. - Note that each line will intersect the polygon at two places (vertices or edges). 3. **Explore Traditional Polygon Properties:** - Typically, lines passing through an internal point of a polygon will divide it into two regions. For example, in a triangle, any line through an internal point divides the triangle into two smaller triangles. - However, for any arbitrary polygon like a quadrilateral or a higher-order polygon, lines generally result in two divisions, not three. 4. **Hypothesis Verification via Diagrams:** - Use the illustration provided in the original problem as a reference. Notice that the placement of specific triplets of points (A, O, A'), (B, O, B'), and (C, O, C') shows that lines through point O divide the polygon into segments (areas). 5. **Mathematical Demonstration:** - Draw a polygon and internal lines connecting point O to the polygon's vertices. - Observe the created smaller regions and verify whether each line indeed results in three distinct smaller polygons. Conclusion: Based on the visual and logical analysis illustrated through diagrams, we find that Baron Munchausen's claim can hold true under specific polygonal configurations (especially when the placement of intersecting lines creates distinct regions correctly).

However, since we are looking for 3-digit numbers, the last digit cannot be 0. Therefore, we only consider squares ending in 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. 2. **Palindromes**: A palindrome reads the same backward as forward.

Let's examine each possible last digit: - **Last Digit 1**: The only 3-digit square that starts and ends with 1 is 121. - **Last Digit 4**: The only 3-digit square that starts and ends with 4 is 484. - **Last Digit 5**: No 3-digit square starts and ends with 5 because the only square ending in 5 is 25, and its multiples will not result in a 3-digit palindrome. - **Last Digit 6**: The only 3-digit square that starts and ends with 6 is 676. - **Last Digit 9**: No 3-digit square starts and ends with 9 because the squares of numbers ending in 3 or 7 (which could potentially lead to a square ending in 9) do not form 3-digit palindromes.

Given ( h ) such chessboards, we are to number the squares such that any two positions from different chessboards cannot have the same number. 2. **Dividing the Chessboard:** Each chessboard of 64 squares can be divided into 16 groups where each group contains 4 numbers sequentially as shown below: [ { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, ldots, {61, 62, 63, 64} }. ] 3. **Filling the First Chessboard:** We fill the first board, ( B_1 ), with these 16 groups such that each group ( G_1, G_2, ldots, G_{16} ) is placed in positions ( A, B, C, ldots, P ) respectively. 4. **Filling Subsequent Chessboards:** For the second chessboard, ( B_2 ), we cyclically shift the groups by one position and place ( G_1, G_2, ldots, G_{16} ) in positions ( B, C, ldots, P, A ). We continue this shifting process for all subsequent chessboards up to ( B_{16} ). 5. **Ensuring Unique Numbers:** Since we are shifting cyclically, each position across the ( 16 ) chessboards will contain a unique set of numbers. For example, the group ( G_1 = {1, 2, 3, 4} ) will be uniquely placed in positions ( A, B, ldots, P ) across different chessboards. 6. **Maximum Value of ( h ):** The above arrangement guarantees that ( h = 16 ) such boards can be labeled without any conflict between the positions across the boards.

This is because for x > 0, y will be negative (fourth quadrant), and for x < 0, y will be positive (second quadrant). 2. **Behavior of y with respect to x**: In each of the quadrants where the graph is present (second and fourth), the value of y increases as x increases. This is due to the nature of the inverse proportionality, where a decrease in x (moving towards the origin from the negative side) results in an increase in y, and an increase in x (moving away from the origin in the positive direction) results in a decrease in y. 3. **Applying the Given Conditions**: Given that x_{1} < x_{2} < 0 < x_{3}, we analyze the positions and corresponding y values: - Since x_{1} < x_{2} < 0, both x_{1} and x_{2} are in the second quadrant, where y is positive and increases as x increases. Therefore, y_{1} < y_{2}. - x_{3} > 0, which places point C in the fourth quadrant, where y is negative.

The key operation described (cutting off necks from a head (A) and new necks growing instantaneously) can be modeled as inverting the connections of vertex (A) with all other vertices it was not previously connected to. 2. **Invertibility of Vertices:** For any vertex (X) with degree (number of edges) not greater than 10, Heracles can cut at (X)'s edges. Once this operation is done, (X) will form new connections with every other vertex it was not previously connected to, effectively isolating (X) and breaking the graph into two disconnected parts. 3. **Strategy for Vertices with Higher Degree:** If there exists a vertex (Y) connected to every vertex except (k leq 9), Heracles should first invert (Y) and then invert the (k) vertices that were not initially connected to (Y).

Similarly, each vertical move (up or down) will have a corresponding reverse vertical move (down or up). 5. **Even Perimeter Argument:** By the walk, every horizontal move has its opposite move: [ text{Right move} Rightarrow text{Left move} ] Similarly, every vertical move has its opposite move: [ text{Up move} Rightarrow text{Down move} ] Thus, the total number of horizontal moves is even, and the total number of vertical moves is even. Adding these two even numbers results in an even perimeter. 6. **Example of Perimeters:** Let's consider a few geometric shapes to verify this argument: - Rectangle of dimensions 1 times (n-1): [ text{Perimeter} = 1 + (n-1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n ] Hence, for any n geq 2, the perimeter is 2n, which is always an even number. 7. **Verification of Evenness:** - Assume a polygon, with P perimeter. - As shown, P = 2k (sum of even number of horizontal and vertical moves), implying P is even. 8. **Impossible Odd Perimeter:** If we assume for contradiction that a polygon can have an odd perimeter, it contradicts our established even summation of moves since both horizontal and vertical moves are paired off. Therefore, no polygon in such a grid can have an odd perimeter. # Conclusion: The possible perimeters are all even numbers greater than 2 for polygons whose edges lie along the grid lines on a 1-unit spaced graph paper.

Define ( k ) as the largest integer such that: [ a_k neq b_k ] Without loss of generality, assume: [ a_k > b_k ] Therefore: [ P(X) - Q(X) = (a_0 - b_0) + (a_1 - b_1)X + cdots + (a_k - b_k)X^k + cdots ] The degree of ( P(X) - Q(X) ) is ( k ), and the leading coefficient is ( a_k - b_k > 0 ).

For sufficiently large ( x ), since ( P(x) > Q(x) ), we have: [ P(P(x)) > P(Q(x)) ] Since ( P ) is strictly increasing, then: [ P(Q(x)) > Q(Q(x)) ] Therefore: [ P(P(x)) > P(Q(x)) > Q(Q(x)) ] This leads to a contradiction because ( P(P(X)) = Q(Q(X)) ). # Conclusion: Given the contradiction, the assumption ( P neq Q ) is false.

Therefore, the trajectory of point M, which is the curve C, is a parabola with F as the focus and l' as the directrix. So, the equation of the curve C is x^2 = 4y. (2) When the slope of line m does not exist, it intersects curve C at only one point, which does not satisfy the conditions of the problem. Assuming the line m has the equation y - 2 = k(x - 2), that is, y = kx + (2 - 2k), substituting into x^2 = 4y, we get x^2 - 4kx + 8(k - 1) = 0 (*).

Since S_{Delta ABO} = 4 sqrt{2}, it follows that 4 sqrt{(k - 1)^4 + (k - 1)^2} = 4 sqrt{2}.

First, let's simplify the expression (3^a)^b. By the laws of exponents, we know that (x^m)^n = x^(m*n). So, (3^a)^b = 3^(a*b). Now, let's look at the second condition, 3^a * 3^b = 81. We can combine the exponents on the same base by adding them, so we get 3^(a+b) = 81. We know that 81 is a power of 3, specifically 3^4, because 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81. So, we have 3^(a+b) = 3^4, which means a + b = 4. Now we need to find the positive integer values of a and b that satisfy this equation. The possible pairs (a, b) that are positive integers and add up to 4 are (1, 3) and (3, 1). If we choose (a, b) = (1, 3), then (3^a)^b = (3^1)^3 = 3^3, which is 27, not a power of 3 that equals 81. If we choose (a, b) = (3, 1), then (3^a)^b = (3^3)^1 = 3^3, which is also 27, not a power of 3 that equals 81. However, we made a mistake in our assumption. The power of 3 in the expression (3^a)^b = 3^(a*b) can indeed be equal to 81 if a*b = 4. Since a and b are positive integers, the only way for a*b to equal 4 is if a = 1 and b = 4, or a = 4 and b = 1. If a = 1 and b = 4, then (3^a)^b = (3^1)^4 = 3^4 = 81, which is the power of 3 we are looking for. If a = 4 and b = 1, then (3^a)^b = (3^4)^1 = 3^4 = 81, which is also the power of 3 we are looking for.

Prove that it is possible to choose a quadrilateral with vertices at the vertices of the pentagon such that both chosen points fall inside it.","completion":"Given a convex pentagon (ABCDE) and two interior points (M) and (N), we aim to prove that there exists a quadrilateral with vertices at the vertices of the pentagon such that both points (M) and (N) lie within this quadrilateral. Let's consider two methods to achieve this proof: First Method: 1. **Pentagon Division into Triangles:** Notice that the convex pentagon (ABCDE) can be divided into five triangles as follows: - (triangle ABC) - (triangle BCD) - (triangle CDE) - (triangle DEA) - (triangle EAB) 2. **Positioning of Points (M) and (N):** Each point (M) and (N) can lie in at most two of these triangles due to the convex nature and non-overlapping interiors of triangles. 3. **Finding a Triangle Without Both Points:** Since there are five triangles and two points, there must be at least one triangle that does not contain either point (M) or (N). Without loss of generality, assume this triangle is (triangle ABC). 4. **Forming the Quadrilateral:** This implies that both points (M) and (N) must be in the remaining area of the pentagon that excludes (triangle ABC). Therefore, they must lie inside the quadrilateral (ACDE). Hence, we have a quadrilateral (ACDE) where both points (M) and (N) are inside. Second Method: 1. **Drawing the Line (MN):** Draw a straight line segment (MN) connecting the points (M) and (N). 2. **Intersection with Pentagon Sides:** Since (MN) is inside the convex pentagon, it divides the pentagon into two regions (semiplanes). 3. **Counting Vertices on Either Side of (MN):** By the properties of a convex shape, in one of these regions (determined by the line (MN)), there must be at least three of the vertices of the pentagon. Assume that these vertices are, for example, (A, C,) and (D). 4. **Choosing the Quadrilateral:** At most, two of the vertices (in this case 0, 1, or 2) will lie exactly on the line (MN). To ensure both (M) and (N) are inside a four-sided figure using pentagon vertices, we thus can select three vertices, say (A, C, D), and close it with another vertex to form a quadrilateral (ACDE) (choosing the fourth vertex (E), if necessary). Therefore, the quadrilateral (ACDE) contains both points (M) and (N). # Conclusion: In both approaches, the quadrilateral (ACDE) successfully includes the points (M) and (N). Thus, it is always possible to select such a quadrilateral from the vertices of the pentagon.

Therefore, the egg production per chicken per day is frac{6}{6} = 1 egg. 2. **Scaling up to 10 chickens**: If one chicken produces 1 egg per day, then 10 chickens will produce 10 times 1 = 10 eggs per day. 3. **Extending to 8 days**: If 10 chickens produce 10 eggs per day, then over 8 days, they will produce 10 times 8 = 80 eggs. 4. **Conclusion**: The total amount of eggs produced by 10 chickens in 8 days, at the rate given, is 80 eggs.

As a result, successful placement for all ships following the order: one 1 times 4, two 1 times 3, three 1 times 2, and four 1 times 1 is verified. blacksquare (b) Proof of Possible Placement Failure When Starting with the Smallest Ships 1. **Counterexample Illustration**: - Consider the provided image or create an analogous situation with partial placements of the smallest ships preventing adequate space for larger ones. - A 10 times 10 grid might become inefficiently used if smaller ships occupy critical space intersections needed for larger ship placements. - Specifically, by placing 1 times 1 ships in a manner that blocks adequate room for any 1 times 4 or 1 times 3 ships, the larger ships cannot be placed later, rendering the process infeasible. Conclusion When placing ships in reverse order (smallest to largest), it is possible to encounter configurations where a subsequent larger ship cannot be fit into the remaining space, thus proving potential placement failure. boxed{text{b}}"},{"prompt":"f sqrt{2x+8}=4, then what is the value of (3x + 12)^2?

If A, B, and C start working on the project together, and A quits 10 days before the project is completed, while B doubles his efficiency after A quits, in how many days will the project be completed?","completion":"Let's first find out how much of the project each person can complete in one day: - A can complete 1/20 of the project per day. - B can complete 1/30 of the project per day. - C can complete 1/40 of the project per day. When they work together, they can complete (1/20 + 1/30 + 1/40) of the project per day.

For the first (x - 10) days, A, B, and C work together, completing 13/120 of the project per day. So, they complete (x - 10) * (13/120) of the project. For the last 10 days, B doubles his efficiency, so he can complete 2 * (1/30) = 1/15 of the project per day, which is 8/120 of the project per day. So, B and C together complete (8/120 + 3/120) = 11/120 of the project per day for the last 10 days. The total work done is then: (x - 10) * (13/120) + 10 * (11/120) = 1 (the whole project) Now, let's solve for 'x': (13/120)(x - 10) + (11/120)(10) = 1 (13/120)x - (13/120)(10) + (11/120)(10) = 1 (13/120)x - 130/120 + 110/120 = 1 (13/120)x - 20/120 = 1 (13/120)x = 1 + 20/120 (13/120)x = 120/120 + 20/120 (13/120)x = 140/120 x = (140/120) * (120/13) x = 140/13 x ≈ 10.77 Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole day.

Person c can complete the job in 12 days, so c's work rate is 1/12 of the job per day. When they work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: Combined work rate = a's work rate + b's work rate + c's work rate Combined work rate = (1/6) + (1/8) + (1/12) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

Therefore, in base two, the number (63) is represented as six consecutive ones. 2. **Expression Transformation:** Observe how the multiplication involving (63) transforms.

Next, simplifying (frac{(cos i - i sin i)^n}{(cos i + i sin i)^n}): [ cos i - i sin i = e^{-i}, quad cos i + i sin i = e^{i}. ] So, [ frac{(cos i - i sin i)^n}{(cos i + i sin i)^n} = frac{e^{-in}}{e^{in}} = e^{-2in}. ] 4.

Since sin(120^circ) = sin(180^circ - 60^circ) = sin(60^circ), we have sin(-120^circ) = -sin(60^circ). - cos(1290^circ) simplifies to cos(1290^circ - 3 times 360^circ) = cos(210^circ).

Jahrhundert), Unabhängigkeitskrieg], In der Belgischen Revolution von 1830 erhob sich die überwiegend katholische Bevölkerung der südlichen Provinzen des Vereinigten Königreichs der Niederlande gegen die Vorherrschaft der mehrheitlich protestantischen Nordprovinzen. Innerhalb weniger Wochen im August und September führte der Aufstand zur Aufteilung des Königreiches in zwei Staaten. Das überwiegend niederländischsprachige Flandern und das überwiegend französischsprachige Wallonien begründeten das neue Belgien. Nur Teile Luxemburgs blieben bis 1890 in Personalunion mit den Niederlanden verbunden., Vom 14. bis zum 16. Jahrhundert hatten alle Teile der Niederlande eine gemeinsame (burgundische, habsburgische bzw. spanische) Geschichte. Im Zuge der Reformation und Gegenreformation und des Achtzigjährigen Krieges löste sich der reformiert (calvinistisch) regierte Norden als Republik der Sieben Vereinigten Niederlande von den spanischen Niederlanden im Süden. Nach dem Wiener Kongress 1815 wurden Nord und Süd –gemeinsam mit dem ehemaligen Hochstift Lüttich und dem heutigen Großherzogtum Luxemburg– wieder vereinigt. Die religiöse, sprachliche und wirtschaftliche Kluft, die 1581/1648 zur Trennung geführt hatte, hatte sich in den rund 250 Jahren getrennter Geschichte weiter vertieft, zumal die calvinistische Religionspolitik mit ihrer Einschränkung der katholischen Religionsausübung nicht aufgehoben wurde. Die Kluft erwies sich bald als unüberbrückbar. Die Folge war die bürgerliche, liberale Revolution, die auch im europäischen Kontext der französischen Julirevolution zu sehen ist. Der junge belgische Staat erlangte bis 1839 die volle Unabhängigkeit und legte in dieser Zeit das politische System fest, das in seinen Grundzügen bis heute besteht., Belgien und die Niederlande bis 1815., Gemeinsame Geschichte., Die Territorien, die heute die Niederlande, Belgien und Luxemburg umfassen, waren im Mittelalter kulturell und politisch miteinander verbunden und gehörten mit Ausnahme des Bistums Lüttich vom 14./15. Jahrhundert bis ins 16. Jahrhundert als Burgundische Niederlande, zuletzt als Burgundischer Reichskreis, gemeinsam zum Heiligen Römischen Reich deutscher Nation. Die Grafschaft Flandern und das Herzogtum Brabant nahmen mit ihren Städten (Antwerpen, Brügge, Gent, Brüssel, Ypern, Mechelen) eine kulturelle und wirtschaftliche Führungsrolle im niederländischen Raum ein. Die 1464 zum ersten Mal einberufenen Generalstaaten der Niederlande tagten in Brüssel, das höchste Gericht kam in Mechelen zusammen. Vom Haus Burgund waren die Niederlande 1482 durch Erbfolge auf die Habsburger übergegangen und erlebten unter KarlV. eine Blütezeit als bedeutender Teil seines Weltreiches. Nach seiner Abdankung 1555 kam das Territorium als Spanische Niederlande an seinen Sohn PhilippII. und damit an Spanien., Getrennte Geschichte., Zur Trennung kam es im Zuge der Glaubensspaltung. Zunächst wurden die politischen Eliten der niederländischsprachigen Provinzen bis weit in den Süden der spanischen Niederlande vom Calvinismus erfasst. Infolgedessen brach 1568 der Achtzigjährige Krieg zwischen Spanien und den protestantisch bestimmten Landesteilen aus. Während sich die wallonischen Provinzen in der Union von Arras (niederländisch \\"Unie van Atrecht\\") ausdrücklich zum katholischen Spanien stellten, schlossen sich 1579 die nördlichen Territorien, einschließlich Flanderns und Brabants, in der Utrechter Union zusammen. 1581 lösten sich die nördlichen Provinzen als Republik der Sieben Vereinigten Niederlande von der spanischen Oberhoheit und vom Deutschen Reich, mit dem sie ohnehin nur noch lose verbunden waren. Die Calvinisten betrieben eine konsequente calvinistische Konfessionalisierung durch das 1581 umgesetzte Verbot der katholischen Kirche und der katholischen Religionsausübung. Verbunden waren damit berufliche, gesellschaftliche und politische Ausgrenzung für die verbliebenen Katholiken., Der Fall Antwerpens 1585 markiert eine Zäsur in der Geschichte beider Länder. Mit ihm fiel der Süden dauerhaft an Spanien und wurde bis in die Eliten rekatholisiert. Zahlreiche Intellektuelle, Künstler und Kaufleute flohen in den Norden. Die Folge war der Verlust der dominierenden Stellung der flämischen Städte und ein gleichzeitiges wirtschaftliches Aufblühen im Norden, wo jetzt das Goldene Zeitalter anbrach. Während im Norden eine Oligarchie weniger patrizischer Familien herrschte, unterstanden die südlichen Niederlande der Habsburgermonarchie. Die Interessen Madrids nahm ein Provinzstatthalter wahr, der von Brüssel aus regierte. Der fast ununterbrochene Krieg Spaniens mit den Niederlanden fand erst 1648 mit dem Frieden von Münster ein Ende, in dem die Trennung von Nord und Süd zementiert wurde. Da die Scheldemündung an die Niederländer ging, die diese schlossen, wurde Antwerpen von der See abgeschnitten und sein Handel erlag nun völlig. Einige von der Republik der Sieben Vereinigten Niederlande seit langem militärisch besetzte Gebiete wie etwa Nordbrabant wurden nun offiziell der Republik angeschlossen, die damit wieder eine offizielle Minderheit von 35 Prozent Katholiken zählte. Diese neugewonnenen katholischen Gebiete wurden als Untertanenland behandelt, den religiösen Minderheiten und damit auch den Katholiken wurden jedoch in den Republiken – im Gegensatz zu den sieben Provinzen nach 1581 – zumindest im privaten Bereich die katholische Religionsausübung gestattet. In dieser Zeit gab es zwar Gesetze gegen Katholiken, aber diese Gesetze wurden im Laufe der Zeit immer weniger streng angewandt., Auch durch den habsburgisch-französischen Gegensatz waren die Spanischen Niederlande ständiger Schauplatz kriegerischer Auseinandersetzungen und verloren im Pyrenäenfrieden (1659) und im Devolutionskrieg (1667–1668) wichtige Gebiete und Städte an Frankreich, darunter Lille, Arras, Cambrai und die Grafschaft Artois. Nach dem zum Teil auf niederländischem Gebiet ausgefochtenen Spanischen Erbfolgekrieg wurde das bisher spanische Gebiet im Frieden von Utrecht 1714 als nunmehr Österreichische Niederlande den österreichischen Habsburgern zugesprochen., Die Entwicklung seit der Französischen Revolution., 1789/90 kam es nach Auseinandersetzungen mit Kaiser JosefII. in Brabant zur Revolution unter Führung von Hendrik van der Noot und Jan Frans Vonck, die am 11. Januar 1790 in der Unabhängigkeitserklärung der südlichen Niederlande als \\"Etats Belgiques Unis\\" (Vereinigte Belgische Staaten) mündete. Diese konföderierte Republik hatte zwar nur kurze Zeit Bestand, war jedoch Ausdruck der bereits entwickelten Unabhängigkeitsbestrebungen, die in Abgrenzung zu den zentralistischen Reformbestrebungen JosefsII. entstanden waren. In diesem Zusammenhang kamen verschiedene Konzepte einer „belgischen Nation“ auf, ohne dass man sich aber auf eine gemeinsame Definition dieses Begriffs hätte einigen können. Immerhin sollte das Gefühl der Zusammengehörigkeit aber auch nach dem Scheitern der Republik lebendig bleiben und unter ganz anderen Vorzeichen in der Revolution des Jahres 1830 wieder zum Ausbruch kommen. Gleichzeitig zur Revolution in Brabant kam es auch im Hochstift Lüttich zu einem von der französischen Revolution beeinflussten Umsturz., Nachdem sowohl die österreichischen als auch die nördlichen Niederlande während des Ersten Koalitionskrieges 1794 bzw. 1795 durch französische Revolutionstruppen besetzt worden waren, wurde Belgien durch den Friedensvertrag von Campo Formio für die nächsten zwanzig Jahre ein Teil Frankreichs. Langfristig bedeutsam wurde, dass sich trotz anfänglicher Proteste gegen die Einverleibung das belgische Bürgertum in dieser Phase mehr und mehr der französischen Kultur und Sprache zuwandte. Die nördlichen Niederlande entwickelten sich zunächst zur von Frankreich abhängigen Batavischen Republik (1795–1806), dann zum Königreich Holland unter Napoleons Bruder Louis Bonaparte (1806–1810), und schließlich wurden sie ebenfalls in den französischen Staat eingegliedert. Als 1810 die Kontinentalsperre gegen England verhängt wurde, kam es zu einer Wirtschaftskrise, von der sich die Niederlande nicht mehr erholten, bis sich die französischen Truppen 1813 nach der Völkerschlacht bei Leipzig auch aus den Niederlanden zurückzogen., Vereinigtes Königreich der Niederlande 1815–1830., Wiener Kongress., Im November 1813 übernahmen orangistisch gesinnte Politiker die öffentliche Gewalt in Den Haag und schon im Dezember ließ sich Erbprinz WilhelmI. unter der Bürgschaft einer freien Verfassung zum souveränen Fürsten der Niederlande ausrufen. Noch vor der Schlacht bei Waterloo 1815 überzeugte Großbritannien, das die eigene Sicherheit durch ein Kräftegleichgewicht auf dem europäischen Festland gewahrt wissen wollte, die anderen Großmächte Österreich, Preußen und Russland davon, die frühere Republik der Sieben Vereinigten Niederlande, die ehemaligen österreichischen Niederlande (inkl. Luxemburg) und Lüttich zum Vereinigten Königreich der Niederlande zusammenzufügen, um einen Puffer sowohl gegen Frankreich als auch gegen Preußen zu errichten. Gleichzeitig entschädigten die Briten mit diesem territorialen Zugewinn die Niederlande für die Inbesitznahme der Kapkolonie., Die Hoffnung der Konservativen in Belgien war die Restauration der österreichischen Herrschaft, doch da Wien daran offensichtlich kein Interesse mehr hatte, freundete man sich im Norden wie im Süden leicht mit der Alternative einer Vereinigung der Niederlande an. Entsprechende Pläne hatte im Londoner Exil bereits der Führer der Statisten während der Brabantischen Revolution, Hendrik van der Noot, mit Vertretern der Orangisten besprochen. Die Vereinigung wurde auf dem Wiener Kongress bestätigt. Der Kompromissvorschlag eines unabhängigen Staates unter einem österreichischen Prinzen fand keine Zustimmung, da ein solcher Staat als zu schwach eingeschätzt wurde., Gemeinsamer Staat., Der neue Staat wurde nicht als föderaler, sondern als Einheitsstaat aufgebaut. Dies sollte sich als schwere Bürde herausstellen, denn schnell wurden die Gegensätze zwischen Nord und Süd zum Problem für das Vereinigte Königreich. Hauptsächliche Faktoren dafür waren religiöse und sprachliche Unterschiede, verschärft wurde die Entwicklung durch wirtschaftliche Probleme und die Nichterfüllung liberaler Forderungen. Das Ungleichgewicht wurde noch dadurch verstärkt, dass auf allen Gebieten der Norden dominierte, obwohl er mit zwei Millionen Einwohnern gegenüber 3,5 Millionen im Süden die deutlich geringere Bevölkerungszahl aufwies.

Sie kommt im Süden Nordamerikas und vorwiegend in Mittelamerika vor und ist eine der bekanntesten Arten der Familie. Die Große Wanderspinne erhält eine gewisse Bedeutung dadurch, dass sie nicht selten als Forschungsobjekt wissenschaftlicher Untersuchungen Verwendung findet und gelegentlich als Heimtier in der Terraristik gehalten wird. Die Bezeichnung „Tigerspinne“ rührt von den Ringeln der Beine beim Weibchen her., Die nachtaktive Große Wanderspinne legt entsprechend ihrer Trivialbezeichnung in der Nacht weite Wanderungen zurück und legt kein Spinnennetz an, sondern erlegt Beutetiere freilaufend als Lauerjäger. In das Beuteschema der vergleichsweise großen Spinne fallen dabei neben anderen Gliederfüßern auch kleinere Wirbeltiere. Die Große Wanderspinne verbringt den Großteil des Tages in selbst geschaffenen Zufluchtsorten an von der Art bevorzugten Pflanzen, etwa einigen Bromeliengewächsen oder in Plantagen angebauten Pflanzen der Dessertbanane (\\"Musa × paradisiaca\\"). Das Paarungsverhalten verläuft wie bei anderen Mitgliedern der Überfamilie der Lycosoidea und schließt somit ein Balzverhalten, jedoch wie bei der Gattung üblich auch eine Kommunikation über Vibrationen und Pheromone (Botenstoffe) mit ein. Das begattete Weibchen fertigt nacheinander mehrere Eikokons und bewacht diese zumeist bis zum Schlupf der Nachkommen in seinem Wohngespinst. Sollte die Möglichkeit gegeben sein, taucht die Spinne in den dann mit Wasser gefüllten Zufluchtsorten (dabei insbesondere in den Blatttrichtern von Bromeliengewächsen) unter und verbleibt dort für einige Zeit. Die geschlüpften Jungtiere wachsen selbstständig heran., Die Große Wanderspinne wird wie einige andere Arten der Gattung \\"Cupiennius\\" gelegentlich als Bananenspinne bezeichnet, was daher rührt, dass einzelne Exemplare der Art gelegentlich an Bananenstauden befindlich von Mittelamerika aus in andere Kontinente exportiert werden. Aus dem gleichen Grund erhalten auch die optisch ähnlichen, teilweise deutlich gefährlicheren Vertreter der Gattung \\"Phoneutria\\" aus der Familie der Kammspinnen (Ctenidae) diese Bezeichnung. Der englische Trivialname der Großen Wanderspinne lautet \\"Tiger wandering spider\\", was in etwa mit der deutschen Trivialbezeichnung „Wandernde Tigerspinne“ identisch ist. Die englische Trivialbezeichnung \\"Banana spider\\" wird genau wie das deutschsprachige Pendant auch für die Arten der Gattung \\"Phoneutria\\" und hier zusätzlich für die Warmhaus-Riesenkrabbenspinne (\\"Heteropoda venatoria\\") innerhalb der Familie der Riesenkrabbenspinnen (Sparassidae) verwendet. Wie diese ist die Große Wanderspinne, anders als einige Vertreter der Gattung \\"Phoneutria\\", etwa der Brasilianischen Wanderspinne (\\"P. nigriventer\\"), für den Menschen weitestgehend harmlos., Merkmale., Mit einer Körperlänge von 27 bis 45 Millimetern als Weibchen und 22 bis 30 Millimetern als Männchen ist die Große Wanderspinne die größte Art der Gattung \\"Cupiennius\\". Der grundsätzliche Körperbau entspricht dem anderer Arten der Gattung, womit auch die Große Wanderspinne ein langbeiniges Erscheinungsbild besitzt. Die Beinspannweite beider Geschlechter kann über 100 Millimeter betragen. Die Beine ermöglichen der Spinne eine agile und schnelle Fortbewegung. Die dichte Scopula (Beinbehaarung), die die Extremitäten einschließlich der Tarsen (Fußglieder) der Großen Wanderspinne bedeckt, ermöglicht ihr zudem die problemlose Fortbewegung auf glatten Oberflächen, etwa Glasscheiben., Zumindest das Weibchen der Großen Wanderspinne kann überdies erfolgreich untertauchen und sich unter Wasser fortbewegen. Der Sauerstoffvorrat wird dabei mithilfe der Setae (Behaarung) gespeichert, was der Spinne ein maximal 90-minütiges Aufhalten unter Wasser ermöglicht. Dies wird aber nur von Weibchen angewandt, die einen Eikokon bewachen. Ob das Männchen der Art schwimmen kann, ist unbekannt., Wahrnehmungsvermögen., Die Große Wanderspinne verfügt über ein gutes Wahrnehmungsvermögen durch ihren guten Seh- und Vibrationssinn. Diese Eigenschaften haben die Art zu einem begehrten Forschungsobjekt der Arachnologie (Spinnenkunde) gemacht., Sehsinn., Der gute Sehsinn der Großen Wanderspinne wird ihr durch die wie bei vielen der Überfamilie \\"Lycosoidea\\" angehörigen Spinnenarten leistungsfähigen Augen verliehen. Die acht Augen sind in die zwei geringfügig größeren und nach vorne gerichteten Haupt- und die sechs kleineren, entweder zur Seite oder nach hinten gerichteten Nebenaugen aufgeteilt. Die Hauptaugen dienen zur Wahrnehmung von Formen, die seitlichen Nebenaugen zur Wahrnehmung von Bewegungen. Ebenso ermöglicht der Sehsinn der Spinne das Abschätzen von Entfernungen und Formen und hilft bevorzugt dabei, Unterschlüpfe zu finden. Der Aufbau der Augen der Großen Wanderspinne und deren Stellung ist mit der anderer Vertreter der Gattung \\"Cupiennius\\" identisch und gliedert sich, wie für Spinnen der Überfamilie Lycosoidea üblich, in zwei übereinander gegliederte Augenreihen, die je vier Augen enthalten. Die zwei Hauptaugen, denen ein Tapetum lucidum (reflektierende Netzhaut) fehlt, sind im Zentrum der oberen Reihe angelegt. Im Gegensatz dazu weisen die Nebenaugen ein rostfarbenes Tapetum lucidum mit in Reihen angeordneten Rezeptoren auf. Die Winkelabstände dieser Rezeptoren entlang und zwischen den Reihen betragen 3,6° und 9,3°, 0,9° und 2,3° sowie 1,0° und 3,0°., Früher wurde aufgrund der Nachtaktivität der Art vermutet, dass ihr Sehsinn eine untergeordnete Rolle spielt. Diese Annahme wurde bei 2015 stattgefundenen Versuchen, die dazu dienten, den Sehsinn der Großen Wanderspinne zu erforschen, widerlegt. Dabei wurde auch herausgefunden, dass die Augen aufgrund der nachtaktiven Lebensweise äußerst lichtempfindlich sind und die Spinne insbesondere größere und dunklere Objekte (bei den Versuchen in Form von Projektionen) aufsucht, was vermutlich daran liegt, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass diese sich als geeigneter Unterschlupf erweisen können, größer ausfällt. Auch werden näher gelegene Objekte dieser Art bevorzugt aufgesucht, was die Fähigkeit zur Abschätzung von Entfernung seitens der Großen Wanderspinne bestätigt. Diese Fähigkeit ist für Wirbellose und für Tiere, die kein stereoskopisches Sichtfeld besitzen, ungewöhnlich. Da die Versuchstiere der Großen Wanderspinne sich nicht in einer geraden Linie, sondern im Zickzack auf die dunklen Projektionen zubewegten, wird angenommen, dass die Art Bewegungsparallaxen nutzt, sich also im Sichtfeld nähergelegene Objekte schneller verrücken als solche, die weiter entfernt liegen., Vibrationssinn., Der wie der Sehsinn gut entwickelte Vibrationssinn der Großen Wanderspinne ermöglicht ihr das Wahrnehmen von sehr leichten Vibrationen und anderen Luftbewegungen. Dieser Sinn spielt besonders beim Jagen eine wichtige Rolle und ermöglicht es der Spinne unter anderem, fliegende Insekten in der Luft zu lokalisieren., Der feine Vibrationssinn wird durch über 3.000 über das gesamte Exoskelett (Chitinpanzer) der Spinne verteilte Sensillen (Spaltsinnesorgane, bzw. Sensormembranen) ermöglicht. Davon sind bis zu 30 nah an den Gelenken gelegene und dort fast parallel angeordnete Sensillen zu sog. Lyraförmigen Organen ausgebildet. Sie sind die Sensillen mit dem höchsten Wahrnehmungsvermögen und ermöglichen es der Spinne auch, Vibrationen, die nur noch im Nanometer-Bereich messbar sind, zu registrieren. Die Formation der Lyraförmigen Organe ist ebenfalls mit der anderer Arten der Gattung identisch. Bedingt durch die Lage registriert die Spinne Auslenkungen benachbarter Beinglieder, die auf bewegungsbedingte Kräfte im Exoskelett reagieren. Die Strukturen der einzelnen Lyraförmigen Organe, die der Registrierung von Erschütterungen dienen, sind ungefähr zwei Mikrometer breit und bis zu 200 Mikrometer lang. Bedeckt werden sie von einer Hautmembran des Exoskeletts, die wiederum einen sog. Kopplungszylinder beinhaltet, in dem der Dendrit einer Nervenzelle endet., Mithilfe der Weißlichtinterferometrie und Mikrokraftmessungen ließen sich die Reiztransformation in Dehnungssensoren analysieren. Erforscht wurde u. a. das propriorezeptive Lyraförmige Organ HS-8 nahe der Distalseite der Gelenke der Tibien, das eine Länge von 1,4 und, abhängig von der Anordnung des Schlitzes, eine Breite von geringfügig mehr als 30 Nanometern aufweist. Die mechanische Empfindlichkeit dieser Organe gegenüber äußeren Krafteinwirkungen lag bei im Rahmen von Versuchen erfolgten Messungen, bei denen Kräfte im Bereich von 0,01 Millinewton angewandt wurden, im Bereich von 106 bis 13 Nanometern pro Mikronewton und nahm mit abnehmender Schlitzlänge im minimalen Ausmaß ab. Dieses Lyraförmige Organ ist an der kinästhetischen (bewegungsempfindlichen) Orientierung beteiligt und löst bei Stimulation Muskelreflexe aus. Direkte Messungen von Dehnungen in der Nagelhaut ungehindert freilaufender Individuen der Großen Wanderspinne unter Verwendung miniaturisierter technischer Dehnungsmessstreifen zeigten, dass das Organ während der Standphase eines Schritts komprimiert und stimuliert wird und somit als Belastungssensor des Exoskeletts fungiert., Anders verhält es sich bei der zweiten untersuchten Gruppe dieser Organe, dem Lyraförmigen Organ HS-10, das am Metatarsus befindlich ist. Die Lage dieses Organs verrät, dass es an die Erfassung von Schwingungsamplituden angepasst ist, wie sie unter natürlichen Bedingungen in größerer Varietät vorkommen können. Mit einer Empfindlichkeit von 522 und 195 Nanometern je Mikronewton bei den untersuchten Schlitzstrukturen dieses Lyraförmigen Organs konnte ein fast dreifacher Unterschied vermerkt werden, was die Fraktionierung des Reizbereichs zwischen diesen Schlitzen hinsichtlich ihrer Anordnung widerspiegelt. Diese Sensoren werden simuliert, wenn sich der Tarsus der Spinne nach oben bewegt und gegen den Metatarsus mitsamt dem dort befindlichen Organ drückt. Das Lyraförmige Organ HS-10 ist ein hochempfindlicher Vibrationssensor, mit dem die Spinne Vibrationen wahrnehmen und unterscheiden kann, die von Beutetieren, Geschlechtspartnern oder Prädatoren (Fressfeinden) stammen.

Februar 1883 auf Hayling Island, Hampshire; † 3. Oktober 1958 in Canterbury) war Bischof der Church of England (Anglikaner) und führender Vertreter der Ökumene. Er ist in Deutschland und Großbritannien als enger Freund Dietrich Bonhoeffers, als Gegner der britischen Luftkriegsstrategie im Zweiten Weltkrieg und für seine ökumenische Friedens- und Versöhnungsarbeit bekannt., Sozial engagierter Ökumeniker., Bell wurde als Sohn des Pfarrers von Hayling Island und späteren Domherrn von Norwich, James Allen Bell, und dessen Frau Sarah Georgina Megaw geboren. Er studierte Theologie in Oxford (England) und wurde 1907 zum anglikanischen Priester geweiht. Dann arbeitete er drei Jahre als Sozialpfarrer in den Slums der englischen Industriestadt Leeds. Seine Aufgabe war die christliche Mission unter den dortigen Industriearbeitern, von denen ein Drittel Inder und Afrikaner aus damaligen britischen Kolonien waren. Dabei lernte Bell viel von den Methodisten, deren Verbindung von persönlichem Glaubensbekenntnis und sozialem Engagement er als Vorbild für seine Kirche ansah., Im Herbst 1910 ging Bell zunächst für knapp vier Jahre als Studentenpfarrer und akademischer Tutor am Christ Church College zurück nach Oxford. Auch hier war er sozial engagiert. Er gehörte zu den Gründern einer erfolgreichen Konsumgenossenschaft für Studenten und Universitätsangehörige und setzte sich für Siedlungsprojekte (\\"settlements\\") und Arbeiterbildung durch die \\"W.E.A.\\" (Workers Educational Association) ein., 1914 wurde er Privatsekretär des Erzbischofs von Canterbury im Lambeth Palace und übernahm ein Sonderreferat für internationale und interkonfessionelle Beziehungen. In diesem Amt erreichte er 1915, dass lutherisch getaufte Inder die Arbeit der Leipziger und der Goßner-Mission in Chota Nagpur (Ostindien) fortsetzen durften, nachdem deren deutsche Missionare interniert worden waren. Bis zum Kriegsende engagierte er sich auch für den Johanniterorden, eine überkonfessionelle Aktion zur Rettung von Kriegswaisen und – zusammen mit dem schwedischen lutherischen Erzbischof Nathan Söderblom, einem seiner engsten lebenslangen Freunde – für den Austausch von Kriegsgefangenen. In dieser Arbeit sah er die innerevangelischen Gegensätze immer mehr als belanglos an., Nach dem Krieg wurde Bell ein hervorragender Initiator und Förderer der noch jungen ökumenischen Bewegung. 1919 auf dem ersten Nachkriegstreffen des Weltbunds für Freundschaftsarbeit der Kirchen in den Niederlanden regte er erfolgreich an, eine Kommission für religiöse und nationale Minderheiten zu gründen. Auf der Stockholmer Weltkirchenkonferenz im Jahre 1925 half er beim Zustandekommen des »Ökumenischen Rates für praktisches Christentum (Life and Work)«. Zusammen mit Adolf Deißmann veranstaltete er deutsch-britische Theologentagungen., Von 1925 bis 1929 war Bell Dompropst (\\"Dean\\") von Canterbury Cathedral. In dieser Zeit rief er ein Kunstfestival im und um den Dom (Canterbury Festival) ins Leben. Zu dessen Gastautoren gehörten damals u. a. John Masefield, Gustav Holst (The Coming of Christ), Dorothy L. Sayers und T. S. Eliot, dessen Drama „Mord im Dom“ (1935) Bell in Auftrag gab., 1929 wurde Bell zum Bischof von Chichester ernannt. In diesem Amt organisierte er Patenschaften zwischen seinem Bistum und von der Weltwirtschaftskrise betroffenen Arbeitern. Er nahm dazu an Treffen der \\"National Union of Public Employees\\" (britische Gewerkschaft für Staatsangestellte) teil, wo er zu seiner Freude als „Bruder Bell“ angeredet wurde. 1931 erhielt er in Chichester auch Besuch von Mahatma Gandhi., 1932 wurde er für zwei Jahre zum Präsidenten von „Life and Work“ beim Ökumenischen Rat in Genf berufen. Bei dessen Berliner Tagung Anfang Februar 1933 wurde er Zeuge der sogenannten Machtergreifung des Nationalsozialismus., Verbündeter der Bekennenden Kirche., Nun nahm Bell regen Anteil am deutschen Kirchenkampf. Im April 1933 erklärte er öffentlich die Sorge der Ökumene über die beginnende Judenverfolgung in Deutschland und trug im September eine Resolution mit, die scharf gegen den Arierparagraphen und seine Übernahme durch Teile der Deutschen Evangelischen Kirche (DEK) protestierte. Schon bei einer Tagung des Weltbundes in Sofia im Herbst 1931 hatte er Dietrich Bonhoeffer kennengelernt. Als dieser im Herbst 1933 für zwei Jahre als Auslandspfarrer nach London ging, entwickelte sich zwischen beiden ein enges Vertrauensverhältnis. Bonhoeffer wurde für Bell zum wichtigsten Informanten über die Vorgänge in Deutschland; Bell seinerseits informierte die britische Öffentlichkeit darüber, unter anderem durch regelmäßige Leserbriefe an die Londoner Times., Am 1. Juni 1934 proklamierte die Barmer Theologische Erklärung als Gründungsmanifest der Bekennenden Kirche (BK) die Unvereinbarkeit von christlichem Glauben und Nationalsozialismus und verwarf die Theologie der NS-nahen Deutschen Christen als „falsche Lehre“ (Häresie). Am 6. Juni berichtete Bell darüber den versammelten Bischöfen der \\"Church of England\\" und erläuterte das für diese schwer nachvollziehbare Bekennen und Verwerfen, also den aktuellen Vollzug einer Scheidung zwischen rechtmäßiger und illegitimer Berufung auf Jesus Christus. Dies war die erste Reaktion in der Ökumene auf die Barmer Erklärung., 1934 sorgte Bell als Präsident von \\"Life and Work\\" dafür, dass Bonhoeffer neben Karl Koch, Präses der westfälischen Landeskirche, als Vertreter der BK zur ökumenischen Weltkonferenz im dänischen Fanö eingeladen wurde. Als gewählter Jugendsekretär war Bonhoeffer ohnehin für die angegliederte Weltjugendkonferenz zuständig. Bei einer Morgenandacht sprach er die Weltchristenheit als „Ökumenisches Konzil“ an und rief sie zum Aufstehen gegen den drohenden Krieg auf. Auf Anregung Bells verabschiedete die Weltkonferenz gegen den Protest der anwesenden Vertreter der DEK eine Solidaritätserklärung für die BK und ihren Kampf. Dabei wurden nochmals die Gewaltmaßnahmen der Nationalsozialisten publik gemacht, darunter die Konzentrationslager., 1936 übernahm Bell den Vorsitz des \\"International Christian Committee for German Refugees\\" (Internationales Christliches Komitee für deutsche Flüchtlinge). Darin setzte er sich besonders für Judenchristen ein, die damals weder von jüdischen noch christlichen Organisationen unterstützt wurden. Um ihnen zur Auswanderung zu verhelfen, entsandte er seine Schwägerin Laura Livingstone nach Berlin und Hamburg und ließ die Exilierten zeitweise in seinem Privathaus wohnen. Im selben Jahr druckte er in seinem Bistumsblatt ein Gebet für Juden und „nichtarische“ Christen ab:, 1937 wurde er als \\"Lord Spiritual\\" Mitglied des Oberhauses. Gleich in seiner ersten großen Rede am 27. Juli 1938 forderte er die britische Regierung zu verstärkter Hilfe für jüdische Flüchtlinge aus Deutschland auf. Er nutzte diesen Einfluss auch, um gezielt Verfolgte des NS-Regimes zu schützen. So konnte er z. B. dem bekanntesten Vertreter der Bekennenden Kirche Martin Niemöller das Leben retten, indem er dessen Inhaftierung im KZ Sachsenhausen ab Februar 1938 und später im KZ Dachau in der englischen Öffentlichkeit bekannt machte und als Beispiel für die kirchenfeindliche Haltung des Hitlerstaates brandmarkte. Daraufhin nahm Adolf Hitler 1938 Abstand von Niemöllers geplanter Ermordung., Mit persönlichen Bürgschaften ermöglichte Bell im Winter 1938/39 90 Menschen, vor allem Pfarrersfamilien (u. a. auch Hans Ehrenberg, Christuskirche Bochum), die als „nichtarische“ Christen von den Nationalsozialisten verfolgt und von der offiziellen Kirche im Stich gelassen wurden, die Emigration nach England. Zu den von ihm besonders geförderten Flüchtlingen gehörte Bonhoeffers Zwillingsschwester Sabine und ihr Mann, der Jurist Gerhard Leibholz, der im Krieg zu einem wichtigen Gesprächspartner Bells über die Zukunft Deutschlands wurde, der Künstler Hans Feibusch, dem er Aufträge zu großformatigen Fresken in seiner Diözese und darüber hinaus verschaffte, sowie Herbert Friess (1909–1997), Pfarrer der Evangelisch-Lutherischen Landeskirche Sachsens, der als Widersacher der Nationalsozialisten und der Deutschen Christen 1939 amtsenthoben worden war., Auch während des Krieges engagierte sich Bell für \\"displaced persons\\" und andere Notleidende, die vom Kontinent nach England flüchteten. Zudem setzte er sich für dort internierte Deutsche und britische Kriegsdienstverweigerer ein., Gegner der Flächenbombardements und Helfer des deutschen Widerstands., Schon 1939 schrieb Bell, die Kirche dürfe nicht zum spirituellen Gehilfen eines Staates werden, sondern solle sich für friedliche internationale Beziehungen einsetzen und Stellung gegen Vertreibung, Versklavung und die Zerstörung der Moral beziehen. Sie dürfe nicht aufgeben, ständig wiederholte Vergeltungsschläge oder das Bombardieren der Zivilbevölkerung zu verurteilen. Er drängte die Kirchen dazu, eine gegenüber der Kriegführung ihrer eigenen Länder kritische Haltung einzunehmen., 1940 traf er sich mit einigen ökumenischen Freunden in den Niederlanden, um die Kirchen auf eine gemeinsame Initiative für den Frieden nach dem Sieg über das NS-Regime zu orientieren. Am 17. April 1941 schrieb Bell an die „Times“: \\"Es ist barbarisch, unbewaffnete Frauen und Kinder bewusst zum Angriffsziel zu machen.\\" Damit widersprach er direkt Winston Churchill, der damals ein Flächenbombardement (\\"area bombing\\") deutscher Städte plante., Im Mai 1942 reiste Bell per Flugzeug nach Schweden; die britische Regierung hatte ihn auf eine zweiwöchige \\"goodwill\\"-Tour geschickt, um die kirchlichen und Kulturbeziehungen zu dem neutralen Land zu intensivieren. Hier traf er am 26. Mai in Stockholm Hans Schönfeld und am 1. Juni in Sigtuna für Bell völlig überraschend Dietrich Bonhoeffer, der ihm als Geheimkurier Informationen des deutschen Widerstands übergab. Darunter waren die Klarnamen der Beteiligten in der Wehrmacht und Abwehr an dem geplanten Hitlerattentat und Putsch zum Sturz des NS-Regimes. Um diesen Plan zum Erfolg führen und anschließend um Waffenstillstand verhandeln zu können, baten die Verschwörer die britische Regierung um ein öffentliches Signal, die Deutschen nicht mit den Nationalsozialisten gleichzusetzen., Bell übergab diese Informationen dem britischen Außenminister Anthony Eden, erhielt jedoch am 17. Juli die ablehnende Antwort, weitergehende Kontakte seien \\"nicht im nationalen Interesse.\\" In einem weiteren Schreiben vom 25. Juli drückte Bell seine Enttäuschung darüber aus und hoffte, es sei der Regierung wenigstens möglich,, Doch diese Korrespondenz führte zu nichts. Die Alliierten beschlossen auf der Casablanca-Konferenz, den Krieg bis zur bedingungslosen Kapitulation Deutschlands zu führen, und begannen mit dem \\"area bombing\\"., Als erste Attentate auf Hitler scheiterten und einige der Verschwörer bereits inhaftiert waren, versuchte Bell erneut vergeblich eine Kurs: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Anglikanischer Bischof, Anglikanischer Studentenpfarrer, Bischof von Chichester, Brite, Geboren 1883, Gestorben 1958, Mann, Mitglied des House of Lords, Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus, Ökumenischer Rat der Kirchen."},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Autor, Frau, Geboren 1904, Gestorben 1942, Literatur (20.

Februar 1904 als \\"Elisabeth Grün\\" in Wien, Österreich-Ungarn; ermordet 1. Juni 1942 im Vernichtungslager Maly Trostinez) war eine österreichische Schriftstellerin und Schauspielerin. Ihr Romandebüt \\"Herz über Bord\\" (1933) wurde von der Kritik begeistert aufgenommen. Darin verarbeitet sie ihre Erfahrungen im Berliner Kabarett \\"Die Brücke\\". Grün verfasste zwei weitere Romane, bei denen es sich ebenfalls um Zeitromane der Neuen Sachlichkeit handelt. Sie veröffentlichte darüber hinaus Gedichte und kurze Geschichten in Zeitungen und Zeitschriften. Ihre autobiografisch geprägten Texte handeln von der Einsamkeit der weiblichen Hauptfiguren, der Liebe und dem Spannungsverhältnis zwischen den Geschlechtern und von der Schwierigkeit junger emanzipierter Frauen, einen Platz in der Gesellschaft zu finden. Grüns literarisches Schaffen fand durch die Entrechtung und Verfolgung der Juden in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus ein jähes Ende. Im Jahr 2007 stieß die Germanistin Anke Heimberg auf den Roman \\"Herz über Bord\\" und begann, Nachforschungen zu Leben und Werk der Schriftstellerin anzustellen, deren Texte sie in den folgenden Jahren im Berliner AvivA Verlag herausgab., Leben., Kindheit, Jugend, Ausbildung., Lili Grün war das jüngste Kind des aus Élesd stammenden ungarischen Kaufmannes Ármin Grün und seiner Frau Regina Grün, geb. Goldstein. Ihre drei Geschwister waren Frieda (1890), Karl (1894) und Grete (1896). Die Familie wohnte ab 1909 in der Arnsteingasse 33 in Reindorf, einem Teil des heutigen 15. Wiener Gemeindebezirks Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus. Der Vater war Schnurrbartbinden-Fabrikant und vertrieb Parfümerie- und Friseurbedarfsartikel in einem Ladengeschäft im Erdgeschoss des Wohnhauses., Anfang August 1915 starb Regina Grün mit 47 Jahren überraschend an einem Hirnschlag, was für die elfjährige Lili wohl „das Ende ihrer bis dahin sehr behüteten Kindheit“ bedeutete. Im Januar 1922 erlag der Vater mit 56 Jahren einem chronischen Nierenleiden. Damit wurde Grün noch vor ihrem 18. Geburtstag zur Vollwaise. Wer die Vormundschaft übernahm, ist unbekannt. Nach dem Abschluss der Volks- und Bürgerschule im Jahr 1918 absolvierte sie eine Ausbildung zur Kontoristin., Im Sommer 1921 gab Grün auf dem Wiener Meldezettel „Theaterelevin“ als Beruf an, was darauf hindeutet, dass sie privaten Schauspielunterricht nahm. Von 1920 bis 1924 stand sie in allen 60 Aufführungen von Henrik Ibsens Drama \\"Peer Gynt\\" in der Rolle des Troll auf der Bühne des Deutschen Volkstheaters. Seit den 1920er Jahren wirkte sie darüber hinaus an der neu gegründeten Bühne der Sozialistischen Arbeiterjugend mit. Eine erste Hauptrolle spielte sie vermutlich an einem Theater in der Provinz., Lili Grüns Bruder Karl hatte in Wien ein Studium in Jura und Philosophie begonnen, wurde eingezogen und im Krieg schwer verwundet. Danach konnte er sein Studium nicht beenden und schlug sich als Privatlehrer durch. Am 25. März 1923 wurde er wegen versuchter Geldfälschung verhaftet. Die Schwester Grete heiratete im Juli 1926 Hellmuth Bettauer, den Sohn des Schriftstellers Hugo Bettauer, der sich öffentlich für Sexualaufklärung, Straffreiheit für Homosexualität und Emanzipation der Frau einsetzte und 1925 an den Folgen eines Attentats starb. Hellmuth zog mit Grete zu Lili Grün in die Arnsteingasse und setzte das Engagement des Vaters fort. Grüns Kontakt mit Hugo Bettauer und ihre Jugend im Roten Wien prägten ihr späteres literarisches Schaffen., Berliner Jahre., Ende der 1920er Jahre herrschte in Wien eine hohe Arbeitslosigkeit unter Theaterschaffenden. Da unter diesen Voraussetzungen die Chancen, eine Anstellung als Schauspielerin zu finden, gering waren, verließ Grün ihre Heimatstadt und zog nach Berlin. Dort waren jedoch die Arbeitsmöglichkeiten nicht besser. Erich Kästner konstatierte im April 1929: „Man wird ohne Übertreibung annehmen dürfen, daß es in einer Stadt wie Berlin bedeutend mehr engagementslose Schauspieler gibt als solche mit Engagement“. Viele Künstler lebten unter prekären Bedingungen; die Situation der Schauspieler war „durch mangelhafte Ernährung, armselige Kleidung, äußerst bescheidene Wohnverhältnisse sowie durch Krankheit […] gekennzeichnet“ (Anke Heimberg)., Grün arbeitete als Verkäuferin und Küchenhilfe in einer Café-Konditorei und gründete im Frühjahr 1931 mit Gleichgesinnten das politisch-literarische Kabarett-Kollektiv \\"Die Brücke\\". Im Mai feierte man im Keller des Künstlerhauses des \\"Vereins Berliner Künstler\\" in der Bellevuestraße 3 mit einem eigenen Abendprogramm Premiere. Künstlerischer Leiter der \\"Brücke\\" war Julian Arendt. Zu den „gut zwanzig junge[n] ‚Kreative[n]‘“ gehörten ferner Ernst Busch, Hanns Eisler, Annemarie Hase, Erik Ode, Erwin Straus und Margarethe Voss., Seit 1929 veröffentlichte Grün eigene Lyrik und Kurzprosa in mehreren Zeitungen, etwa im \\"Tempo\\" und im \\"Uhu\\", aber auch im \\"Berliner Tageblatt\\", im \\"Prager Tagblatt\\" und im \\"Wiener Tag\\". Welche Texte sie in den Vorstellungen der \\"Brücke\\" vortrug, ist nicht bekannt. Gesichert ist, dass ihre Auftritte auf positive Resonanz stießen: „Lily Grün bringt reizende freche Gedichte“, notierte \\"Das 12 Uhr Blatt\\" vom 5. Mai 1931 und die \\"Vossische Zeitung\\" vom 7. Mai 1931 kennzeichnete Grüns Texte als „witzig-sentimentale Gedichte“. Der Berliner \\"Film-Kurier\\" schrieb über einen Auftritt: „… trägt Erotik, sehr persönlich und sehr belustigend.“, Nach wenigen Wochen musste das Kabarett schließen, weil die Zuschauerzahlen abnahmen. Die Räumlichkeiten waren ohnehin nur frei, weil sich das dort ansässige Kabarett \\"Die Katakombe\\" auf Sommertournee befand. „Kommunistisches Hetzkabarett“ nannte die \\"Deutsche Tageszeitung\\" das Programm der \\"Brücke\\" schon am 5. Mai 1931. Möglicherweise trug die im Vergleich zur \\"Katakombe\\" politisch radikalere Ausrichtung zum Publikumsrückgang bei. Trotz dieses Misserfolgs waren die Jahre in Berlin für Grün bedeutsam: Hier fand sie zum Schreiben. Andererseits erkrankte sie offenbar in Berlin infolge der von Armut und beruflichen Strapazen geprägten Lebensumstände an Tuberkulose., Wien, Prag, Paris., Der genaue Zeitpunkt der Rückkehr Grüns nach Wien ist nicht bekannt. Ein Beweggrund war die Absicht, „ihren Lungenspitzenkatarrh in einer Heilstätte loszuwerden.“ Für die Jahre 1932 bis 1940 ist als Wohnort die Gemeindebauwohnung in der Marktgasse 45 im 9. Wiener Gemeindebezirk angegeben. Im Mai 1932 wurde sie bei einem Talentwettbewerb des Kabaretts \\"Simpl\\", an dem 50 Nachwuchskünstler teilnahmen, von einer Jury unter der Leitung von Hans Nüchtern als Zweitbeste ausgezeichnet. Für die Kritik war Lili Grün „eine Art weiblicher Joachim Ringelnatz“., In Wien verarbeitete sie ihre Erlebnisse rund um \\"Die Brücke\\" in dem Roman \\"Herz über Bord\\". Er erschien im März 1933 beim Paul Zsolnay Verlag und wurde zum Beispiel im \\"Neuen Wiener Tagblatt\\" als „ein sehr beachtenswerter Beitrag zur Zeitgeschichte der jungen Generation“ gewürdigt. Im selben Jahr wurde Grün für den Julius-Reich-Dichter-Preis vorgeschlagen., Für eine Erzählung mit dem Titel \\"Anni hat Unrecht\\" fand Grün im Anschluss keine Möglichkeit der Publikation, konnte aber beim Zsolnay Verlag eine Vorschusszahlung auf ein Exposé zum Roman \\"Loni in der Kleinstadt\\" erreichen. Im Oktober 1933 verließ sie Wien wieder. Anke Heimberg erklärt den Wegzug mit der sich wandelnden politischen Situation in Österreich. Die Regierung in Wien sah zunehmend das faschistische Italien als Vorbild an. Mit ihrem Lebensgefährten Ernst Spitz reiste Grün über Prag (1933/1934) nach Paris (1934/1935)., In der französischen Hauptstadt verschlechterte sich ihre gesundheitliche und wirtschaftliche Situation. Die Vorschusszahlung war bald aufgebraucht; die Tantiemen von \\"Herz über Bord\\" reichten nicht aus. Im November 1934 verkaufte sie den geschützten Titel ihres Debütromans an den Berliner Allegro Theaterverlag, damit dieser eine Operette von Eduard Künneke „Herz über Bord“ nennen konnte. Das Geld konnte Grüns Notlage nicht lindern: Es erreichte sie erst im Juni 1935, als sie wieder in Wien lebte, wohin sie Anfang 1935 schwerkrank zurückgekehrt war und offenbar erneut die Wohnung in der Marktgasse 45 bezogen hatte., Der Zsolnay Verlag führte eine Spendenaktion durch, um ihr im Frühjahr 1935 einen mehrwöchigen Kuraufenthalt in Meran zu finanzieren. Der Roman \\"Loni in der Kleinstadt\\" erschien schließlich ab dem 7.August 1935 im \\"Wiener Tag\\" als Fortsetzungsroman und im Oktober als Buch in der \\"Bibliothek zeitgenössischer Werke\\", einer Züricher Niederlassung des Zsolnay Verlages. Der letzte Roman \\"Junge Bürokraft übernimmt auch andere Arbeit\\" wurde 1936/1937 in Fortsetzungen im \\"Wiener Tag\\" veröffentlicht. Eine Publikation in Buchform erfolgte erst im Jahr 2016 im AvivA Verlag., Verfolgung und Tod., Nach dem „Anschluss“ Österreichs an das Deutsche Reich im März 1938 und der damit verbundenen Verfolgung und Entrechtung der österreichischen Juden war es der Jüdin Lili Grün nicht mehr möglich, als Schriftstellerin tätig zu sein. Eine Emigration ins Ausland blieb ihr wegen ihres schlechten Gesundheitszustandes und fehlender Geldmittel verwehrt. Die „Verordnung zur Einführung des Gesetzes über Mietverhältnisse mit Juden in der Ostmark“ vom 10. Mai 1939 ermöglichte es Wohnungseigentümern, jüdischen Mietern jederzeit fristlos zu kündigen. Auch Grün wurde mehrmals zwangsumgesiedelt und lebte zuletzt in einer „Sammelwohnung“ in der Neutorgasse 9 im 1. Bezirk., Am 27. Mai 1942 wurde sie mit 980 anderen im Transport Nr. 23 aus Wien nach Minsk deportiert und noch am Tag ihrer Ankunft, dem 1. Juni 1942, im Vernichtungslager Maly Trostinez ermordet. Mit ihr fand die österreichische Lyrikerin und Erzählerin Alma Johanna Koenig den Tod. Die beiden Schriftstellerinnen wurden in einem Massengrab verscharrt. Vermutlich wurden fast alle Deportierten von einem etwa 80 Personen umfassenden Sonderkommando der Waffen-SS erschossen. In Maly Trostinez, dem damals größten Vernichtungslager auf dem Gebiet der besetzten Sowjetunion, kamen seit Anfang Juni 1942 auch drei „Gaswagen“ zum Einsatz., Literarisches: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Lili Grün, Schriftstellerin, Schauspielerin, Literatur (20.

Sie liegen vollständig innerhalb des Baruther Urstromtales. Das rund 7.600 Hektar umfassende siedlungsfreie Gebiet gehört zum Naturpark Hoher Fläming und ist seit dem 1. Juli 2005 mit einem Teil von rund 4.500 Hektar als Naturschutzgebiet ausgewiesen. Der Schutz dient der Erhaltung und Wiederherstellung eines in Brandenburg seltenen Durchströmungsmoores mit einem Netz naturnaher Bäche um den Fluss Plane. Neben der Förderung der biotopspezifischen Flora und Fauna liegt ein Schwerpunkt der Maßnahmen in der Weiterentwicklung eines der letzten deutschen Refugien für die Großtrappe. Historische Bedeutung kommt dem Landstrich insofern zu, als mitten durch die Wiesen bis 1815 die Grenze zwischen dem Kurfürstentum bzw. Königreich Sachsen und dem Königreich Preußen verlief., Nach dem Oberspreewald nehmen die nach der Stadt Bad Belzig benannten Wiesen die zweitgrößte Fläche unter den geographischen Niederungslandschaften im Baruther Urstromtal ein, gefolgt vom Fiener Bruch, das sich nach Nordwesten bis hinein nach Sachsen-Anhalt erstreckt, und den Flemmingwiesen östlich der Talenge von Luckenwalde., Geographischer Überblick und Geologie., Abgrenzung., Die Landschaftswiesen haben sowohl im Nordosten als auch im Südwesten eine markante, deutliche Grenze. Nordöstlich der Landschaftswiesen schließt sich die Hochfläche der Zauche an, die in ihrem südlichen Teil eine ausgedehnte trockene Sanderfläche trägt. Die 86 Meter hohen Rauhen Berge begrenzen den Sander nach Norden und sind Endmoränen der jüngsten, der Weichseleiszeit. Südwestlich der Landschaftswiesen ragen die über 100 Meter NN erreichenden Höhen des Flämings auf., Nach Nordwesten und Südosten ist die naturräumliche Grenze unscharf, da sich dort das Baruther Urstromtal jeweils fortsetzt. Die Talenge des Urstromtales bei der Stadt Brück wird meist als südöstliche Begrenzung angegeben. Etwas willkürlich kann man die Nordwestgrenze der Belziger Landschaftswiesen mit der Bundesstraße 102 zwischen dem Bad Belziger Ortsteil Ragösen und Golzow ziehen, während das deutlich kleinere gleichnamige Naturschutzgebiet seine nordwestliche Begrenzung bereits auf einer Linie zwischen dem Flämingdorf Lütte und dem Zaucheort Cammer findet., Die namensgebende Stadt Bad Belzig liegt mit ihrem Kern rund drei Kilometer südwestlich der Niederung und erstreckt sich mit ihrem Ortsteil Hagelberg bis zum gleichnamigen Hagelberg, der mit 200 Metern höchsten Stelle des Fläming und einer der höchsten Erhebungen der Norddeutschen Tiefebene. Das Tal im Oberlauf des Belziger/Fredersdorfer Baches verbindet die Bad Belziger Altstadt mit den Landschaftswiesen., Entstehung., Zählt der Hohe Fläming noch zur Altmoränenlandschaft der Saale-Eiszeit, gehören die Niederungen innerhalb des Urstromtals bereits zum Jungmoränenland der Weichsel-Eiszeit, deren Inlandeis in der Talung seine maximale Ausdehnung nach Süden erreichte., Die Abflussbahn der Schmelzwasser entstand vor rund 21.000 Jahren und hinterließ mit dem Baruther Urstromtal einen im Mittel rund drei bis fünf Kilometer breiten Talboden, der nach der Verlagerung des Urstromes nach Norden (zum Berliner Urstromtal) zwischenzeitlich trocken fiel. Wie alle Urstromtäler bestehen auch die Belziger Landschaftswiesen im Untergrund aus mächtigen Schmelzwassersanden. Das Schmelzwasser erodierte an einigen Stellen stark am Nordhang des Fläming und schnitt bis zu 60 Meter aufragende Geländestufen heraus., Vor rund 7.000 bis 9.000 Jahren kam es zu einer Anhebung des Grundwasserspiegels und das Gebiet der Belziger Landschaftswiesen vermoorte großflächig. Es bildete sich Torf. Ob die Bäche zu dieser Zeit in einem eigenen Flussbett flossen oder den Moorkörper, wie bei einem Durchströmungsmoor üblich, infiltrierten, ist nicht eindeutig geklärt. Sicher ist jedoch, dass sich mit der Vermoorung flächendeckend Bruch- und Feuchtwälder herausbildeten. Sie bestanden meist aus Erlen, Eschen, Eichen und Hainbuchen., Heutiges Landschaftsbild., Der tischebene, vermoorte Niederungsstandort mit einer Höhe zwischen 40 und 44 Meter über NN ist neben einer Vielzahl schnurgerader Meliorationsgräben von mehreren Bächen wie dem Hellbach (im Mittellauf: Temnitz), dem Baitzer Bach und dem Belziger/Fredersdorfer Bach durchzogen, die ihre Wasser dem Hauptfluss Plane und damit der Havel zuführen. An den artenreichen Bachufern und Grabenrändern dominieren im Sommer Seggen und Hochstauden., Von den einst vorhandenen Bruchwäldern blieben nur Restbestände erhalten. Das Gebiet wird, wie es der Name \\"Landschaftswiesen\\" schon andeutet, heute vor allem als Grünland genutzt. Das Bild des Grünlands prägen unterschiedliche Wiesenarten und Ackerbauflächen. Einige nasse Vertiefungen, die zum Teil bis in den Sommer hinein Wasser tragen, eingelagerte Talsandflächen und kleinflächige randliche Dünenkomplexe ergänzen den Standort. Überwiegend in den Randgebieten runden vereinzelte Weidengebüsche, Reste der Erlenbrüche und Kiefernforste das Bild der Belziger Landschaftswiesen ab. Landschaftliche Reize bietet das insgesamt eher monotone, eintönige Gebiet Freunden stiller, weiter Landschaften und den Liebhabern der Vogelkunde., Hydrografie und Klimadaten., Charakteristisch für die gegenwärtige hydrologische Situation der Landschaftswiesen sind neben dem umfangreichen Entwässerungssystem der 1970er Jahre die vielen Bäche, die im Hohen Fläming entspringen und die Wiesen mit hoher Geschwindigkeit durchfließen. Allein im Naturdenkmal Dippmannsdorfer Paradies sickern 32 Quellen aus dem Fläminghang. Das Gewässernetz weist eine Gesamtlänge von 169 Kilometern auf, davon entfällt auf die natürlichen Fließgewässer ein Anteil von 19 %, also von rund 30 Kilometern., Die Naturschutzverordnung sieht im Rahmen der hydrographischen Maßnahmen die naturnahe Entwicklung beziehungsweise Wiederherstellung der Bachläufe und eine Entfernung der noch vorhandenen Staueinrichtungen vor. Entscheidende Bedeutung für die Umsetzung der Schutz- und Entwicklungsmaßnahmen von Flora und Fauna kommt der gezielten Wasserregulierung mit einer möglichst hohen Wasserhaltung zu. So soll beispielsweise die von den Rindern verschmähte und wiesenüberwuchernde Ackerkratzdistel (\\"Cirsium arvense\\") zurückgedrängt werden. Die hydrologischen Maßnahmen erfolgen heute durch die Naturschutzstation Baitz in enger Abstimmung mit den Landwirten und dem Wasser- und Bodenverband., In der feuchten und oft nebelverhangenen Niederung herrscht, anders als im Fläming, ein kontinental getöntes Klima mit einer Jahresmitteltemperatur von 8,6 °C und einem mittleren Jahresmaximum von 33,3 °C. Der mittlere Jahresniederschlag beträgt 541 mm und ist damit deutlich geringer (um ca. 100 mm) als auf dem nur wenige Kilometer entfernten Fläming. Die Sonne scheint im Mittel rund 1.700 Stunden im Jahr., Die mächtigen wärmespeichernden Schmelzwassersande des Urstromtals und die ausgedehnten Sandflächen des Fläming sorgen mit den Aufwinden der erst flachen, dann hügeligen Landschaft für eine ausgezeichnete Thermik für den Segelflug, wie einige „große“ Flüge über 1.000 Kilometer vom nahegelegenen Segelflugplatz Lüsse widerspiegeln. Im Jahr 2008 fanden hier die Weltmeisterschaften im Segelflug statt., Ortschaften und Bahntrasse., Während sich innerhalb der Wiesen keine Siedlungen und auch keine Straßen finden, gibt es außer der Stadt Brück folgende Dörfer am Rand der Landschaftswiesen: die Bad Belziger Ortsteile Schwanebeck, Fredersdorf, Lütte, Dippmannsdorf und Ragösen sowie die nach Brück eingemeindeten Dörfer Baitz, Trebitz und Gömnigk. Nördlich der Landschaftswiesen finden sich die Planebruch-Ortsteile Freienthal, Damelang und Cammer. Am nordwestlichsten Zipfel liegt die Gemeinde Golzow. Viele dieser Dörfer und Städte verfügen über historische Feldsteinkirchen oder architektonisch interessante Kirchenbauten wie Schinkels Normalkirche in Lütte, Stülers ungewöhnliche Fachwerkkirche in Dippmannsdorf oder die oktogonale Golzower Kirche. Kulturell bedeutsam sind zudem Herrenhäuser wie in Fredersdorf und verschiedene Wassermühlen. Dem Dorf Schwanebeck brachten eine eisenhaltige und eine mit Schwefel versetzte Quelle bereits im Jahr 1715 den Titel Kurort ein., Am Südrand der Wiesen bietet der vorbeiführende Europaradweg R1 gute Einblicke in das Gelände. Insbesondere das autofreie Teilstück zwischen Baitz und Trebitz, das am Hang von \\"Fuchsberg\\" (64 Meter) und \\"Räuberbergen\\" (68 Meter) in erhöhter Lage verläuft, eröffnet einen weiten Überblick über die flache Landschaft. Am Westrand führt die stillgelegte Trasse der eingleisigen Brandenburgischen Städtebahn entlang, die zwischen 1904 und 1962 Treuenbrietzen über Bad Belzig und Rathenow mit Neustadt (Dosse) verband. Bis zum Jahr 2003 war noch die Teilstrecke zwischen Bad Belzig und Brandenburg an der Havel in Betrieb, deren Züge auch an Bahnhöfen der Dörfer Fredersdorf, Lütte und Dippmannsdorf hielten. Kurz vor Ragösen schwenkt die Bahntrasse nach Norden und verläuft parallel zur Bundesstraße 102 nach Golzow., Geschichte., Frühe Randbesiedlung und Klostermühle., Die Fläming- und Zaucheforste sowie die trockenen Bereiche rund um die Wiesen waren laut Norbert Eschholz \\"zu allen geschichtlichen Zeiten vom Menschen besiedelt\\". Bodenfunde belegen, dass der Raum \\"vom Ende der Bronzezeit bis in die Eisenzeit (7. – 6. Jahrhundert v.u.Z.) […] sogar recht dicht besiedelt\\" war. Wann es zu ersten Rodungen der heutigen Landschaftswiesen kam, ist unbekannt. Im Jahr 1251 erhielt das einflussreiche und vermögende Kloster Lehnin die Mühle Gömnigk (\\"molendinum Gomenik\\") am Planezufluss zu den Wiesen mit den zugehörigen Gewässern, die sich zwischen Rottstock und Trebitz \\"(Trebegotz)\\" bis zum südlichen Wiesenrand erstreckten, von Graf Baderich von Belzig zum Geschenk., Die Zisterzienser Mönche aus der märkischen Zauche weiteten damit ihren Einflussbereich bis ins konkurrierende Magdeburgische, also Sächsische aus und stützten damit gezielt den Landesausbau und die Siedlungspolitik der askanischen Markgrafen. Erst Hundert Jahre zuvor, 1157, hatte der Askanier Albrecht der Bär die Kerngebiete der Mark den nach den Semnonen hier siedelnden Slawen endgültig abgerungen und die Mark Brandenburg aus der Taufe gehoben.

Die am 13. August 1894 eröffnete Bahn firmierte ursprünglich als Elektrische Lokalbahn Gmunden, kurz ELBG, und wurde nach dem Anschluss Österreichs 1938 zu einer Straßenbahn umkonzessioniert. Ursprünglich betrug ihre Streckenlänge 2,543 Kilometer. 1975 wurde der Abschnitt zwischen dem Rathausplatz und dem Franz-Josef-Platz stillgelegt, ab diesem Zeitpunkt war sie nur noch 2,315 Kilometer lang. Mit dieser Streckenlänge galt sie als die kleinste Straßenbahn der Welt. Ferner ist die \\"Gmundner Elektrische\\" mit zehn Prozent maximaler Steigung eine der steilsten Adhäsionsbahnen der Welt. Sie ist eine touristische Attraktion und ein Wahrzeichen der Stadt, jährlich werden über 300.000 Fahrgäste befördert., Eigentümer war im ersten Betriebsjahr Stern &amp; Hafferl, bevor im Jänner 1895 die neu gegründete \\"Gmundner Elektrizitäts-Aktiengesellschaft\\", kurz \\"GEAG\\", diese Aufgabe übernahm. Aus ihr wurde 1938 die \\"Gmundner Elektrizitätsgesellschaft mbH\\", kurz \\"GEG\\". 2000 erfolgte die Umbenennung in \\"GEG Elektrobau GmbH\\", heute heißt das Unternehmen \\"GEG Elektro und Gebäudetechnik GmbH\\". Für die Betriebsführung war anfangs ebenfalls Stern &amp; Hafferl zuständig. Nachdem die GEAG den Betrieb 30 Jahre lang selbst führte, ist seit 1925 wiederum Stern &amp; Hafferl damit beauftragt. Am 1. September 2018 wurde die Straßenbahn betrieblich mit der benachbarten Traunseebahn zur „Traunseetram“ verknüpft., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte., Am 23. Oktober 1877 erhielt Gmunden durch die Salzkammergutbahn Anschluss an das Eisenbahnnetz. Zuvor hatte eine 1875 eingesetzte Kommission zu erreichen versucht, dass die Strecke nicht zu nah an die auf Ruhe bedachte Kurstadt heranführte, aber auch nicht zu weit entfernt verlief. Der Bahnhof Gmunden befand sich folglich in Altmünster, erst in späteren Jahren wurde das Areal Gmunden zugesprochen. Letztlich erwies sich die Entfernung vom Zentrum zum damaligen \\"Rudolfsbahnhof\\", benannt nach der Kronprinz Rudolf-Bahn Gesellschaft, aber doch als zu weit. Beschwerden von Bürgern und Besuchern waren die Folge. Deshalb beschloss die Stadt den Bau einer gemeindeübergreifenden Lokalbahn zwischen Rathausplatz und Bahnhof., Projektierung., Der Bau der Lokalbahn stand in einer Reihe von Modernisierungen unter Bürgermeister Alois Kaltenbruner, nicht zuletzt dadurch motiviert, mit der Kaiserresidenz Bad Ischl mithalten zu können. Zuvor war etwa eine Wasserversorgung aufgebaut worden. Da Bad Ischl bereits seit 1890 über elektrisches Licht verfügte, sollte nun auch in Gmunden ein Elektrizitätswerk errichtet werden. Jedoch wäre die Stromerzeugung für die Stadt alleine – ohne den Großabnehmer Lokalbahn – nicht rentabel gewesen. Deswegen wurde das Angebot der \\"Internationalen Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft\\" aus Wien vom Gemeinderat am 22. Oktober 1892 abgelehnt. Gleiches galt für die 1893 vorgebrachte Idee einer Wiener Akkumulatoren-Fabrik, ein kleines Kraftwerk für den Fremdenverkehr zu errichten. Erst durch den Bahnbau konnten beide Projekte wirtschaftlich betrieben werden. Grundsätzlich kam nur eine elektrische Bahn in Frage, weil die Bürgerschaft eine Dampfstraßenbahn wegen der Lärm- und Geruchsbelästigung ablehnte., Der Ingenieur Josef Stern hatte sich schon 1892 bei der Schafbergbahn für einen elektrischen Betrieb samt Kraftwerk interessiert. Mit seinem \\"Bauunternehmen Stern &amp; Hafferl OHG\\" konnte Gmunden eine Firma mit gewissen Kenntnissen im elektrischen Fach gewinnen. Auch war das Unternehmen bereit, die Finanzierung zu übernehmen. Hierzu konnte sich die Stadt selbst, infolge der zuvor angefallenen Kosten für die Wasserversorgung, nicht durchringen. Es wurde vereinbart, dass sich die Gemeinde später beteiligen könnte und wie üblich die Garantie für einen Betriebsgewinn abgab. Der Vertragsabschluss zwecks Garantie und Zurverfügungstellung öffentlichen Grundes mit der Stadt erfolgte im Jänner 1894. Der Grundkauf für die zentralen Anlagen war um 5120 Gulden erfolgt., Das \\"Linzer Volksblatt\\" berichtete Anfang Jänner 1894:, Bau., Der Bau durch das Unternehmen Egger &amp; Co. begann am 25. Februar 1894 und stand unter Aufsicht von Josef Stern. Beschäftigt waren neu eingestelltes Personal und von der Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn her bewährte Akkordanten. Die Installation der Masten und der Oberleitung begann im April und stand unter Aufsicht der Ingenieure Ernst Egger und Ferdinand Wessel. Die Arbeiten dauerten etwa vier Monate. Es entstanden eine Kraftstation zur Stromerzeugung, ein Beamtenhaus, ein Dienerhaus und eine Remise. Die beiden Personalhäuser wurden 2006 zugunsten eines neuen Kreisverkehrs abgerissen. Auf dem Gelände der Kraftstation befindet sich heute die Energie AG Oberösterreich. Einziges erhaltenes Gebäude ist die 1994 renovierte Remise., Die Rillenschienen (in der Straßenfahrbahn) stammten von der Phoenix AG für Bergbau und Hüttenbetrieb und wogen 33,6 Kilogramm je Meter. Auf freier Strecke fanden 21,8u202fkg/m schwere Vignolschienen auf Holzschwellen Verwendung. Sie stammten – wie die Weichen – von der Österreichisch-Alpinen Montangesellschaft., Der Fahrdraht bestand aus hartgezogenem Kupfer und wurde mittels 33 Masten aus Gusseisen und 57 Holzmasten mit schmiedeeisernen Auslegern abgespannt. Zusätzlich wurden acht Abspannmasten aufgestellt. Die Entfernung zwischen zwei Masten betrug etwa 35 Meter, die Fahrdrahthöhe etwa 5½ Meter über Schienenoberkante. Ursprünglich war zwischen der Kraftstation und der Ausweiche eine Speiseleitung verlegt worden, um den Spannungsabfall zu reduzieren., Außerdem waren die Schienen zwecks besserer Stromrückleitung an den Stößen mit Kupferverbindungen gebrückt. Dies diente der Vermeidung von abirrenden Rückströmen. Sie wären für metallische Einbauten im Erdreich, etwa Gas- oder Wasserrohre, schädlich. Bei Volllast, also bei zwei gleichzeitig bergauf fahrenden Wagen, betrug der Leitungsverlust zehn Prozent., Inbetriebnahme., Die Bahn wurde meterspurig errichtet, denn bei einer normalspurigen Strecke hätte das Militär ein Mitspracherecht gehabt. Die auf \\"Stern &amp; Hafferl in Wien\\" ausgestellte Konzessionsurkunde vom 13. Juni 1894 wurde im Reichsgesetzblatt Nummer 152 veröffentlicht., Die \\"Linzer Tages-Post\\" berichtete damals:, Am frühen Nachmittag des 13. August 1894 erfolgte die offizielle Eröffnung. Während der Probefahrt am Morgen des Tages waren Reit- wie Zugpferde entlang der Strecke postiert worden, um die Tiere visuell wie akustisch an die Bahn zu gewöhnen. Nach der Lokalbahn Mödling–Hinterbrühl und der Straßenbahn Baden war sie die dritte elektrische Bahn Österreichs., Vorerst hatte von insgesamt neun Stationen nur die Haltestelle Stadtpark ein Wartehäuschen. Der Streckenabschnitt ab Kuferzeile war zum Zeitpunkt der Bahneröffnung nicht gepflastert. Neben Personen wurden auch Gepäckstücke zum ehemaligen Hotel Post und zum Hotel Schwan transportiert. Die Fahrzeit betrug etwa 15 Minuten. Abends verkehrten aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen Pferdeomnibusse im Schienenersatzverkehr., Im ersten Betriebsjahr transportierte die Bahn 116.018 Personen und 3452 Kolli Gepäck. Die Höchstleistung in den Sommermonaten Juni bis August lag bei 12.000 bis 21.000 Personen monatlich. Die geringste Leistung erbrachte die Bahn in den Wintermonaten November bis März mit nur 4000 bis 5600 Personen monatlich. Schon damals waren am Hotel Bellevue ein Abzweig nach Altmünster und eine Verlängerung zum Klosterplatz geplant. Die beiden Gründer von Stern &amp; Hafferl, Josef Stern († 1924) und Franz Hafferl († 1925), verstarben allerdings, bevor sie diese Vorhaben ausführen konnten. Weitere nie realisierte Projekte waren eine Verlängerung nach Traundorf einschließlich einer eigenen Strecke für den Güterverkehr und eine Stichstrecke nach Kranabeth, die ebenfalls für den Gütertransport vorgesehen war., Kraftstation., Im Maschinenhaus der Kraftstation wurden zwei liegende Einzylinder-Dampfmaschinen mit je 40 Pferdestärken Leistung eingebaut. Der Dampf wurde in zwei Kesseln des Systems Babcock &amp; Wilcox von je 43Quadratmetern Heizfläche mit einem Arbeitsdruck von acht Atmosphären erzeugt. Kessel und Maschinen stammten von der \\"Ersten Brünner Maschinenfabrik\\". Über Flachriemen trieben die Dampfmaschinen Dynamoscheiben mit 30 Kilowatt Leistung an. Zum Ausgleich des Spannungsabfalls in der Oberleitung waren die Dynamos bei Volllast mit Übercompoundierung versehen. Im Leerlauf gaben sie bei 665 Umdrehungen in der Minute eine Spannung von 500 Volt, bei Volllast und gleicher Drehzahl aber 550 Volt ab. Zum Ausgleich auftretender Spitzenbelastungen wurde 1897 ein großer Akkumulator aufgestellt. Eine moderne Schalt- und Regeleinrichtung sowie eine – 1894 noch als Attraktion geltende – elektrische Beleuchtung in allen Gebäuden vervollständigten die Kraftstation. Der Schlot stand etwas abseits des Maschinenhauses, die Rauchgase des Kessels wurden ihm unterirdisch zugeführt., Schon anlässlich der Einführung der elektrischen Beleuchtung im Jahr 1895 wurde ein wesentlich leistungsfähigerer Hauptmaschinensatz zusammen mit einem kleinen aufgestellt. Die Gleichrichteranlage wurde 1948 auf ELIN-Glaskolben für je 210 Ampere umgebaut. 1969 wurde die Kraftstation mit Glaskolben-Umrichtern ausgerüstet., Oberleitungssystem., Wie die meisten elektrischen Bahnen jener Zeit, war auch die Anlage in Gmunden für den Betrieb mit Rollenstromabnehmern und Luftweichen ausgelegt. Aufgrund der Nachteile dieser Betriebsform wurden sie im Laufe der Zeit durch Lyra-Stromabnehmer ersetzt. Später erfolgte die Umrüstung auf Scherenstromabnehmer., Der Fahrdraht der Lokalbahn bestand anfangs aus hartgezogenem Kupfer mit einem Querschnitt von 5,35 Millimetern und war an den Aufhängungen mittels Hartgummi- und Porzellan-Isolatoren doppelt getrennt. Auf einer seitlichen Konsole an der Mastspitze wurde die zweipolige Leitung für das Streckentelefon geführt. Später wurden die gusseisernen Masten in der Innenstadt entfernt, da die Bürger sie als optisch störend empfanden. Alternativ brachte man an den Gebäuden Oberleitungsrosetten an, die Aufhängung des Fahrdrahts erfolgte fortan mittels Querdrähten., Erster Weltkrieg., Der Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs führ: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Bahnstrecke, Oberösterreich, Gmunden, Spurweite 1000 mm, Stern & Hafferl Verkehrsgesellschaft, Straßenbahnsystem, Verkehr Oberösterreich, Verkehr Salzkammergut, Gmundner Elektrische, Elektrische Lokalbahn Gmunden"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Badesee in Österreich, Flusssystem Traun (Donau), Geographie (Grundlsee, Gemeinde), Gewässer im Bezirk Liezen, Gewässer in den Alpen, See im Salzkammergut, See in Europa, See in der Steiermark, Totes Gebirge], Der Grundlsee ist ein Bergsee am Südfuß des Toten Gebirges im steirischen Teil des Salzkammergutes. Er liegt auf Am Nordwestufer befindet sich das Siedlungszentrum der Gemeinde Grundlsee. Der Abfluss des Grundlsees ist die Grundlseer Traun, die über die Traun in die Donau entwässert. Mit einer Fläche von 4,22km² ist er der größte See der Steiermark. Der Grundlsee im Besitz der Österreichischen Bundesforste ist wegen seiner schönen Lage ein bedeutendes Tourismusziel und ein beliebter Badesee sowie ein Tauch- und Segelrevier. Jedes dritte Jahr findet am Grundlsee das Narzissenfest, Österreichs größtes Blumenfest, statt. Der See wird von einem Berufsfischer bewirtschaftet. Die Hauptfischart ist der Seesaibling (\\"Salvelinus alpinus\\"), der als Ausseer Seesaibling vermarktet wird., Geographie., Der Grundlsee liegt vollständig im Gemeindegebiet von Grundlsee. Das Siedlungszentrum von Grundlsee befindet sich am Nordwestufer. Der See ist hufeisenförmig von Bergen des Toten Gebirges umgeben. Im Nordwesten beginnt mit der Trisselwand () ein Karstplateau, das sich über den schroff aufragenden Backenstein () bis zum Reichenstein () und den Siniweler () im Nordosten erstreckt. Am Ostufer befindet sich der Ortsteil Gößl mit der Gößler Wand. Im Süden erhebt sich der Ressen (). Im Westen beginnt das Hügelland des Ausseer Beckens., Der von Westsüdwest nach Ostnordost langgestreckte See hat eine Länge von 5,8km und eine maximale Breite von 917m. Die Oberfläche beträgt etwa 4,14km², die durchschnittliche Tiefe ist 35m. Die Seewanne zeigt besonders am Nord- und Südufer steil abfallende Hänge. Nur am Ost- und Westufer existieren flachere Bereiche mit allmählich zunehmenden Tiefen. Die tiefste Stelle des Sees befindet sich etwa in Seemitte, die größte Tiefe beträgt 62m. Das Wasservolumen beträgt 145 Millionen Kubikmeter., Der See ist über die Grundlseer Straße L703 erreichbar, die am Nordufer bis zur Ortschaft Gößl im Osten verläuft., Hydrologie., Das hydrologische Einzugsgebiet des Grundlsees hat eine Gesamtfläche von 125km² und liegt zur Gänze im Toten Gebirge. Die Speisung des Sees erfolgt überwiegend durch den Toplitzbach, der den Toplitzsee entwässert, und den Stimitzbach. Toplitzbach und Stimitzbach münden unweit voneinander entfernt in den östlichen Bereich des Grundlsees. Die Ortschaft Gößl liegt auf dem Schwemmkegel des Toplitzbachs. Der Ortsteil Gaiswinkel wurde auf Schwemmkegel-Ablagerungen des Mühlbaches errichtet. Dieser baute wie auch der Zimitzbach beim Ortsteil Schachen ein kleines, nunmehr besiedeltes Delta in den See vor. Die Grundlseer Traun verlässt im Westen bei der Seeklause den See, wo eine Brücke über den Ausfluss führt. Der Abfluss beträgt 5,94m³/s. Die theoretische Wassererneuerungszeit beträgt 0,9 Jahre., Geologie., Tektonik., Der Grundlsee liegt am Südwestrand der Totengebirgsdecke (Tirolikum) und ist somit ein Teil der Nördlichen Kalkalpen. Diese Deckeneinheit besteht überwiegend aus mesozoischen Kalken und Dolomiten der Trias und des Jura. Die Seewanne des Grundlsees befindet sich entlang einer von Westsüdwest nach Ostnordost verlaufenden geologischen Störung. Diese als Toplitzsee-Störung bezeichnete Linie zieht über den Toplitz- und den Kammersee ins Tote Gebirge hinein. Rund um den See befinden sich Reste von End- und Seitenmoränen. Nördlich des Sees dominieren Tressenstein- und Plassenkalk, während im Süden Hallstätterkalk überwiegt. Den östlichen Bereich und somit auch das Haupteinzugsgebiet bildet der Dachsteinkalk. Am Südufer bei Wienern kommt auch Haselgebirge vor, wo die Firma Saint-Gobain Rigips Austria den Abbau dieser größten Gipslagerstätte der Ostalpen betreibt., Ehemalige Vergletscherung und Entstehung., Der eiszeitliche Grundlsee-Lokalgletscher, der vom Hochplateau des Toten Gebirges ins Ausseer Becken floss, folgte ebenfalls der störungsbedingten Schwächezone und erweiterte hierbei das Tal und schürfte das Zungenbecken des Grundlsees aus. An seinem westlichen Ende hinterließ der mächtige Gletscher einen mehrere Zehnermeter hohen Endmoränenwall, der den See abdämmt. Parallel zum Eisfreiwerden des übertieften Beckens bildete sich am Rand des Eiskörpers ein erster See aus. Auf diese Phase mit dem Eiskörper im Seebecken deutet die hohe Kante der Schuttbildung um das Becken des Grundlsees hin. Die Seefläche war ursprünglich größer und erstreckte sich in der späten Würm-Kaltzeit über den Toplitz- bis zum Kammersee. Nach dem endgültigen Verschwinden des Eises stellte sich der Schwemmkegel auf das heutige Seeniveau ein. In der Nacheiszeit veränderte das Seebecken infolge Verlandung ständig seine Form und wird in einigen zehntausend Jahren wieder verschwunden sein., Klima., Die Wetterwarte der Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik im 3km entfernten Bad Aussee stellt exakte Daten für den Grundlsee zur Verfügung. Die Klimadaten zeigen eine für die nördlichen Kalkalpen typische Temperatur- und Niederschlagsverteilung: kühle und niederschlagsreiche Sommer, mit einem Maximum von 15,6°C bzw. 208mm im Juli, und niederschlagsarme Winter, mit einem Temperaturminimum von −2,7°C im Jänner. Der Niederschlag weist von Dezember bis Jänner ein Nebenmaximum auf. Der Jahresniederschlag betrug 1566mm mit einer Jahresdurchschnittstemperatur von 7,7°C. Bedingt durch den oftmaligen Wolkenstau am Rand des Toten Gebirges fällt im Bereich des Grundlsees überdurchschnittlich viel Niederschlag. Ein Vergleich mit dem Jahresniederschlag von 1222mm in Bad Mitterndorf () an der Südseite des Toten Gebirges zeigt bei ähnlicher Seehöhe und einer Entfernung von nur 10km deutlich die Barrierewirkung des Toten Gebirges. Die Zeitdauer der winterlichen Schneebedeckung liegt bei etwa 126 Tagen., Limnologie., Zirkulation., Der Grundlsee ist ein dimiktischer See. Im Frühjahr nach der Eisschmelze durchmischt sich der Wasserkörper und bringt sauerstoffreiches Wasser in die Tiefe. Im Sommerhalbjahr bildet sich eine Sprungschicht und nur die Oberflächenschicht erwärmt sich, im Herbst kommt es erneut zur Durchmischung, der die Eisbildung folgt. Im Grundlsee liegen ausgeprägte Schichtungsverhältnisse vor. Das Epilimnion weist nur eine sehr geringe Mächtigkeit von etwa fünf Metern auf. Das gleichförmig temperierte Hypolimnion beginnt bei 30 Metern. Bereits kurz nach der Frühjahrszirkulation beginnen die Wassertemperaturen an der Oberfläche zu steigen und erreichten bei Messungen im August in den Jahren 2000 bis 2006 ein Oberflächenmittel von 17,5°C. Die bisher höchste Wassertemperatur von 22°C wurde während des Sommers 2003 festgestellt. Unterhalb von 30 Metern Tiefe liegen die Temperaturen bei mittleren 4,2°C. Bis zur sommerlichen Stagnationsphase erwärmt sich das Hypolimnion durchschnittlich nur um 0,1°C. Der See ist durchschnittlich an 64 Tagen im Jahr von einer Eisschicht bedeckt., Trophie., Der See weist eine niedrige Konzentration an Nährstoffen auf und ist somit oligotroph. Bei Messungen in den Jahren 2000 bis 2006 ergab sich für den Grundlsee ein mittlerer Phosphorgehalt von 5,7µg/l. Durch die Einleitung ungeklärter Abwässer konnte in den 1960er Jahren ein Eutrophierungstrend festgestellt werden und die Sauerstoffsättigung über Grund nahm bereits ab. Daraufhin wurden Sanierungsmaßnahmen durchgeführt, die 1980 mit der Errichtung einer regionalen Verbandskläranlage mit einer dritten Reinigungsstufe im Gemeindegebiet von Bad Aussee beendet wurden. Die Sauerstoffsituation verbesserte sich rasch und der oligotrophe Zustand des Sees konnte langfristig erhalten werden. Durch die geringe Phytoplanktonkonzentration und das geringe Algenwachstum beträgt die mittlere sommerliche Sichttiefe 8,5Meter., Plankton., Chlorophylluntersuchungen zufolge ist das Algenwachstum im Grundlsee als sehr gering einzuschätzen. Cryptophyceae und Kieselalgen, vor allem Arten der Gattung \\"Cyclotella\\", bilden den Hauptbestandteil des Phytoplanktons. \\"Cyclotella styriaca\\" stellt eine Besonderheit dar, da diese Art bisher nur im Altausseer See und im Grundlsee nachgewiesen wurde. Das Zooplankton ist mit deutlich mehr Biomasse vertreten. Von den Rotatorien wurden \\"Kellicottia longispina\\", \\"Keratella cochlearis\\" und \\"Keratella hiemalis\\" häufig festgestellt. Das Crustaceenplankton des Grundlsees setzt sich größtenteils aus den Arten \\"Eudiaptomus gracilis\\", \\"Cyclops abyssorum\\", \\"Daphnia hyalina\\" und \\"Eubosmina longispina\\" zusammen., Flora und Vegetation., Die Wasserpflanzenflora ist im See durch die abwechselnd steinigen und sandig‐schlammigen, reich strukturierten Uferbereiche besonders vielfältig. Beim Wasserwehrhaus Gößl wachsen etwa großflächig dichte Rasen des Gras-Laichkrauts (\\"Potamogeton gramineus\\") und an mehreren Stellen das Schimmernde Laichkraut (\\"Potamogeton x nitens\\"). Weitere Vertreter der Gefäßpflanzen sind Kanadische Wasserpest (\\"Elodea canadensis\\"), Ähriges Tausendblatt (\\"Myriophyllum spicatum\\"), Berchtolds Zwerg-Laichkraut (\\"Potamogeton berchtoldii\\"), Krauses Laichkraut (\\"Potamogeton crispus\\"), Spiegelndes Laichkraut (\\"Potamogeton lucens\\"), Schwimmendes Laichkraut (\\"Potamogeton natans\\") und Kamm-Laichkraut (\\"Potamogeton pectinatus\\"), Durchwachsenes Laichkraut (\\"Potamogeton perfoliatus\\") und Haarblättriger Wasserhahnenfuß (\\"Ranunculus trichophyllus\\"). Von den Armleuchteralgen sind folgende Arten vertreten: \\"Chara contraria\\", \\"Chara globularis\\", \\"Chara strigosa\\" und \\"Chara virgata\\"., Fauna., Ursprünglich waren im Grundlsee nur folgende acht Fischarten heimisch: Aalrutte (\\"Lota lota\\"), Aitel (\\"Squalius cephalus\\"), Elritze (\\"Phoxinus phoxinus\\"), Schmerle (\\"Barbatula barbatula\\"), Seeforelle (\\"Salmo trutta\\"), Seelaube (\\"Alburnus chalcoides\\") und Seesaibling (\\"Salvelinus alpinus\\"). Durch künstlichen Besatz oder Einschleppung kommen überdies noch folgende Fischarten vor: Aal (\\"Anguilla anguilla\\"), Flussbarsch (\\"Perca fluviatilis\\"), Hecht (\\"Esox lucius\\"), Koppe (\\"Cottus gobio\\") und Reinanke (\\"Coregonus\\" sp.)., Die auffälligste Vogelart am Grundlsee und an den anderen Salzkammergutseen ist der Höckerschwan (\\"Cygnus olor\\"), dessen erste Ansiedlung am Traunsee im Jahre 1875 erfolgte. Am Grundlsee ist er seit den 1950er Jahren nachgewiesen.

Jahrhundert), Literatur (Deutsch)], Walter Bendix Schoenflies Benjamin (* 15. Juli 1892 in Berlin; † 26. September 1940 in Portbou, Spanien) war ein deutscher Philosoph, Kulturkritiker und Übersetzer., Als undogmatisch positionierter Denker wird er durch die enge Freundschaft zu Theodor W. Adorno zum assoziierten Wirkungskreis der Frankfurter Schule gerechnet. Ebenso prägend für sein Denken und Schreiben erwies sich die Freundschaft und Zusammenarbeit mit Bertolt Brecht. Er gilt als wichtigster Vordenker der Kulturwissenschaften. Seine Schriften zu einer sozial verstandenen Ästhetik werden in den verschiedensten Disziplinen rezipiert, ihre Ausstrahlung reicht über die akademischen Domänen hinaus in die Bereiche von Literatur, Künsten, Medien(-theorie) und Publizistik., Er übersetzte Werke von Honoré de Balzac, Charles Baudelaire und Marcel Proust., Als gebürtiger Berliner lebte er nach Studium und gescheiterter Habilitation, die ihm die angestrebte Universitätskarriere verwehrte, als freier Schriftsteller wieder in seiner Geburtsstadt, unterbrochen von ausgedehnten Auslandsaufenthalten. 1933 entzog er sich als säkularisierter Jude der NS-Herrschaft und ging ins Pariser Exil. Nach der Besetzung Frankreichs durch die deutschen Truppen nahm er sich auf einer missglückten Flucht in der spanischen Grenzstadt Portbou das Leben., Leben., Walter Benjamin wurde als Sohn des Antiquitäten- und Kunsthändlers Emil Benjamin (1856–1926) und dessen Frau Pauline (1869–1930) (geborene Schoenflies) in Berlin-Tiergarten, Magdeburger Platz, geboren. Susan Sontag, die in ihm den großen Melancholiker sieht, zitiert ihn mit den Worten: „dass ich unterm Saturn zur Welt kam – dem Gestirn der langsamsten Umdrehung, dem Planeten der Umwege und der Verspätungen.“ Er wuchs in einer vollständig assimilierten jüdischen Familie des Berliner Großbürgertums auf. Walter Benjamin war der Älteste von drei Geschwistern, Dora (1901–1946) und Georg Benjamin (1895–1942), und damit Schwager von Hilde Benjamin, Georgs Frau, zudem war er Cousin von Gertrud Kolmar und Clara Stern, der Ehefrau des bekannten deutschen Psychologen William Stern, und damit ein Onkel 2. Grades von Günther Anders (→ Familien Schoenflies und Hirschfeld), dem Sohn von Clara und William Stern. Seine Kindheit, deren Erinnerungen in \\"Berliner Kindheit um neunzehnhundert\\" festgehalten sind, verbrachte Benjamin überwiegend in Berlin. Das Wohnhaus der Familie, Delbrückstraße 23 in Berlin-Grunewald, ist heute nicht mehr erhalten., Schulzeit., Von 1902 bis 1912 besuchte er den gymnasialen Zweig der Kaiser-Friedrich-Schule in Charlottenburg, das damals noch nicht zu Berlin gehörte. Dazwischen lag ein zweijähriger Aufenthalt (1905–1907) an der Hermann-Lietz-Schule Haubinda, einem reformpädagogischen Internat in Thüringen. Dort lernte er neben Martin Luserke den Lehrer Gustav Wyneken kennen, der ihn tief beeindruckte und zu einem Engagement in der Jugendbewegung veranlasste. In der Folge arbeitete er neben Siegfried Bernfeld, Georg Gretor (Pseudonym Georges Barbizon), Otto Gründler, Erich Krems, den Brüdern Hans und Peter Kollwitz sowie Wyneken an der ebenso legendären wie berüchtigten Jugendzeitschrift \\"Der Anfang\\" mit. Diese wurde in Bayern an allen Schulen verboten. Wynekens These, dass eine neue Jugend einem revolutionären kulturellen Wandel den Weg bereiten müsse, wurde zum Hauptthema aller Veröffentlichungen des Studenten Benjamin. 1912 legte er am Kaiser-Friedrich-Gymnasium in Charlottenburg das Abitur ab., Studium und Jugendbewegung., Benjamins Studium war, auch kriegsbedingt, von Diskontinuität gekennzeichnet. Er studierte in Freiburg und Berlin (1912–1915), München (1915–1917) und Bern (1917–1919). Bis zum Kriegsausbruch widmete er einen Großteil seiner Zeit der Organisierung von Studentengruppen auf der Grundlage von Wynekens Schriften, die eine unabhängige Jugendkultur im Hochschulbereich propagierten., Er begann das Studium der Philosophie, Germanistik und Kunstgeschichte an der Albert-Ludwigs-Universität im Sommersemester 1912 in Freiburg im Breisgau. Philosophie hörte er bei dem Neukantianer Heinrich Rickert. In Freiburg schloss er Freundschaft mit den expressionistischen Dichtern Philipp Keller und Christoph Friedrich Heinle. Im Wintersemester 1912/13 setzten Benjamin und Heinle ihr Studium in Berlin fort. Aber im Sommersemester 1913 kehrte Benjamin nach Freiburg zurück, zu seinem Dichterfreund Philipp Keller. Nach Wynekens Wunsch sollte er dort die Abteilung für Schulreform unter seine Kontrolle bringen, die im Wintersemester 1911/12 nach einem Aufruf Wynekens im Rahmen der Freideutschen Bewegung gegründet worden war. Sie hatte sich unterdessen in einen literarischen Zirkel von sieben bis neun Studenten unter der „despotischen“ Leitung von Philipp Keller entwickelt. Benjamins persönliche Beziehung zu Keller kühlte ab, wenngleich er dessen expressionistische Schriften unverändert wertschätzte. Im Wintersemester 1913/14 studierte er wieder in Berlin und ließ sich zum Präsidenten der Berliner Freien Studentenschaft wählen. Nach Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs löste der Suizid Heinles am 8. August 1914 tiefe Bestürzung bei Benjamin aus. Er widmete dem verstorbenen Freund 30 Sonette und bemühte sich vergeblich, für dessen hinterlassenes Werk einen Verleger zu finden., Benjamin gehörte zusammen mit Hans Blüher, Ernst Joël, Fritz Klatt, Erich Krems, den Brüdern Hans und Walter Koch, Hans Kollwitz, Alfred Kurella und Alexander Rüstow dem so genannten Westender Kreis an, der den linken Flügel der bürgerlichen Jugendbewegung zusammenführte. Klatt war wahrscheinlich der geistige und publizistische Motor dieses Bundes., Bruch mit Wyneken, Freundschaft mit Scholem., Der Kriegsausbruch beendete jegliche Mitarbeit in der Jugendbewegung und führte zu einem endgültigen Bruch mit dem kriegsbegeisterten Wyneken. Im November hatte Wyneken in München in seinem Vortrag, \\"Der Krieg und die Jugend\\", die männliche Jugend aufgerufen, sich freiwillig zur Verteidigung des Vaterlandes zu melden. In seinem letzten Berliner Seminar, im Sommer 1915, lernte Benjamin den sechs Jahre jüngeren Mathematik- und Philosophiestudenten Gershom Scholem kennen, der ebenfalls aus einer assimilierten jüdischen Familie, jedoch des kleinbürgerlichen Alt-Berlins, stammte. Der Pazifist, Sozialist und engagierte Zionist Scholem, der sich bereits früh gegen die Abwendung seiner Familie vom Judentum als „radikalen Selbstbetrug“ wandte, wurde einer seiner engsten Freunde und beständigsten Briefpartner. Scholem gegenüber äußerte Benjamin, dass er, wie Scholem, auf dem Standpunkt des radikalen Kriegsgegners Karl Liebknecht stehe. Intensive Diskussionen mit Scholem über Judentum und jüdische Mystik gaben den Anstoß für den 1916 geschriebenen (als Manuskript überlieferten) Text \\"Über Sprache überhaupt und über die Sprache des Menschen\\", der, wie Benjamin Scholem wissen ließ, „in immanenter Beziehung auf das Judentum und mit Beziehung auf die ersten Kapitel der Genesis“ stehe. Seit jenem Zeitpunkt „wurde die Theorie der Sprache zu einem bleibenden Thema für Benjamin“; in ihr sah er den „Kanon der Wahrnehmung“. Mit dieser Freundschaft begannen auch bald, wie Hannah Arendt schrieb, „diese kuriosen endlosen Erwägungen einer Auswanderung nach Palästina, die sich durch nahezu zwanzig Jahre“ hinzogen und bei denen es fraglich war, ob es ihm damit nach der Trennung von seiner aus einem zionistischen Milieu stammenden Frau wirklich ernst war. Dazu gehörten auch die zeitweiligen Lektionen, denen er sich unterzog, um Hebräisch zu erlernen. Wie Scholem in seinen Erinnerungen schreibt, wurde ihm im Laufe des Jahres 1930 klar, dass Benjamin seine „hebräischen Pläne endgültig ad acta gelegt“ hatte., Heirat und Studienabschluss., 1917 heiratete Benjamin Dora Sophie Kellner, geschiedene Pollak (1890–1964), eine aus Wien stammende Studentin der Philosophie und Chemie, Tochter des Anglisten Leon Kellner (1859–1928) und dessen Ehefrau, der Schriftstellerin und Übersetzerin Anna Kellner, geborene Weiß (1862–1941). Die Ehe hielt 13 Jahre und brachte den gemeinsamen Sohn Stefan Rafael (1918–1972) hervor. Noch im Jahr der Eheschließung (auch, um einer drohenden Einberufung zum Militär zu entgehen) wechselte Benjamin in die Schweiz, wo er sich nach Sommeraufenthalten in St. Moritz und Zürich in Bern niederließ. Dort pflegte er freundschaftlichen Umgang mit Ernst Bloch, der sich wie andere Intellektuelle (Hermann Hesse, Hugo Ball) ebenfalls dem kriegführenden Deutschland entzogen hatte. In den nächsten zwei Jahren widmete er sich intensiv seiner Dissertation mit dem Titel \\"Der Begriff der Kunstkritik in der deutschen Romantik\\". Als Doktorvater fungierte der Philosoph Richard Herbertz. Am 27. Juni 1919 verteidigte Benjamin seine Doktorthese und bestand mit der Bestnote \\"summa cum laude\\". Nach den Plänen seines Vaters sollte er nach Abschluss des Studiums einen bürgerlichen Beruf ergreifen. Benjamin wollte hingegen sein Leben als Privatgelehrter fortsetzen und erwartete die weitere finanzielle Unterstützung seines Vaters, solange dies eben nötig sei. Im März 1920 sah er sich gezwungen, mit der Familie nach Berlin in die elterliche Villa zurückzukehren, weil der Vater die akademischen Ambitionen seines Sohnes nur unter der Bedingung weiter unterstützen wollte, dass die junge Familie mit im Elternhaus wohnen würde. Möglicherweise waren es auch, worauf Bernd Witte verweist, die durch die Inflation beeinträchtigten Vermögensverhältnisse des Vaters, die eine Unterstützung außerhalb des Elternhauses nicht mehr zuließen. Nach ständigen Auseinandersetzungen kam es zu einem vollständigen Zerwürfnis mit den Eltern, die dazu führten, dass er mit Frau und Kind im Mai 1920 eine Wohnung im Haus des befreundeten Schriftstellers Erich Gutkind am Stadtrand in Berlin-Grünau bezog. Im Dezember gab er stillschweigend klein bei und kehrte mit Familie ins elterliche Domizil zurück., Freier Schriftsteller in Berlin., Wieder zurück in Berlin, arbeitete Benjamin als freier Schriftsteller und Publizist unter zunehmend prekärer werdenden privaten Lebensumständen. Die langen Perioden der Abwesenheit in Paris, auf Capri und auf den Balearen haben ihn, wie Adorno schrieb, „der Stadt nicht abspenstig gemacht“. Bis zu seinem Exil blieb Berlin sein Hauptwohnsitz. Seine Suche nach einem Weg, ein ausreichendes Einkommen für sich und seine Familie zu verdienen und gleichzeitig genügend Zeit für sein Schreiben zu haben, war von beruflichen Misserfolgen und persönlichen Schwierigkeiten überschattet. Zwar sicherte der Verdienst seiner Frau, zunächst als Übersetzerin, dann als Journalistin und Redakteurin für den Rundfunk und für verschiedene Ullstein-Blätter, jahrelang den Familienunterh: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Die ab 1898 elektrisch betriebene Straßenbahn verfügt heute über ein Streckennetz von insgesamt 67,2Kilometern Länge. Die Tram wird unternehmerisch von den \\"Graz Linien\\" (früher \\"Graz AG Verkehrsbetriebe\\", GVB) geführt, einem Geschäftsbereich der Holding Graz (vormals \\"Grazer Stadtwerke Aktiengesellschaft\\"), die sich im Besitz der Stadt Graz befindet. Zusammen mit dem ebenfalls von den Graz Linien betriebenen innerstädtischen Busnetz ist die Straßenbahn Graz in den Steirischen Verkehrsverbund eingegliedert., Auf dem aus sieben Linien (Stand 2023) bestehenden Straßenbahnnetz werden jährlich rund 52Millionen Fahrgäste befördert. Alle Linien führen vom zentralen Jakominiplatz sternförmig zu elf Vorstadtzielen, wobei es mehrere Schnittpunkte zum regionalen und überregionalen Verkehr der ÖBB sowie zur touristisch bedeutenden Grazer Schloßbergbahn gibt., Geschichte., Anfänge (1865–1878)., Die Einwohnerzahl der Stadt Graz stieg während des 19. Jahrhunderts rasant an. Hierzu trugen zwischen 1844 und 1846 die Eröffnung der Österreichischen Südbahn als Nord-Süd-Verbindung und die Errichtung des Südbahnhofs (heute Hauptbahnhof) bei. 1859wurde die Graz-Köflacher Eisenbahn an die Südbahn angebunden. Die Stadt hatte zu dieser Zeit nahezu 100.000Einwohner., Die Aussicht auf ein lukratives Geschäft durch die Beförderung von Eisenbahnfahrgästen vom damals noch außerhalb der Stadt gelegenen Südbahnhof in das Zentrum unterhalb des Schlossberges bewog Anfang des Jahres 1865 die \\"Schaeck-Jaquet &amp; Comp.\\", sich um eine Konzession zur Errichtung einer Pferdestraßenbahn zu bemühen. Die Grazer Stadtverwaltung lehnte die Bewerbung des zugleich in Wien an einem ähnlichen Pferdebahn-Projekt tätigen Unternehmens aus nicht bekannten Gründen ab., 1868 bewarben sich vier Konsortien gleichzeitig um das Projekt. Das Konsortium um den Direktor der \\"Graz-Köflacher Eisenbahn- und Bergbaugesellschaft\\" erhielt im November desselben Jahres die Konzession zur Errichtung einer Pferdestraßenbahn. Das Unternehmen war jedoch in den folgenden sechs Jahren nicht in der Lage, dieses Vorhaben umzusetzen, sodass die Konzession 1874 wieder erlosch., Da bereits seit dem Jahr zuvor eine weitere wichtige Bahnfernverbindung, die Steirische Ostbahn, den Grazer Südbahnhof anfuhr und die Zahl der in das Stadtzentrum zu befördernden Personen ständig stieg, schloss vier Jahre später die Grazer Stadtverwaltung einen Vertrag zum Bau einer Pferdetramway mit Bernhard Kollmann, dem Direktor der Tramway Prag. Am 15.April 1878 erhielt das eigens gegründete Unternehmen \\"Grazer Tramway\\" (GT) eine Konzession zum „Bau und Betrieb einer normalspurigen Pferdestraßenbahn vom Südbahnhof zum Geidorfplatz“., Pferdebahn (1878–1895)., Nachdem am 6. Mai 1878 eine Begehung der geplanten Trasse durch eine Kommission stattgefunden hatte, konnten die Bauarbeiten unverzüglich beginnen. Am 7.Juni folgte die polizeitechnische Überprüfung der Strecke und 31Tage später wurde die zweigleisige, 2,2km lange Tramway vom Südbahnhof zum Jakominiplatz feierlich eröffnet. Am ersten Betriebstag beförderte die Grazer Tramway 1765Fahrgäste. Das Tramway-Unternehmen beschäftigte zu diesem Zeitpunkt insgesamt 44Personen., Die in der Konzession festgelegte Verlängerung zum Geidorfplatz konnte am 28. Juni 1879 eröffnet werden. Ein Jahr später wurde der Bau einer Stichstrecke zum Jakominigürtel, nahe der heutigen Messehalle, die am 12.Juli 1880 in Betrieb genommen wurde, abgeschlossen. Die GT verfügte für den Betrieb ihres nunmehr 6,1km langen Streckennetzes über einen Wagenbestand von fünf offenen (Nummer 1–5) und 24 geschlossenen (Nummer 10–33) Pferdewagen. Die Fahrzeuge und Pferde wurden in einem Gebäude in der Nähe des Südbahnhofs untergebracht., Da der Gründer der GT am 26. Jänner 1885 starb und sich seine Erben und die Stadtgemeinde nicht über einen Verkauf an die Stadtverwaltung einigen konnten, ging das Unternehmen an ein deutsches Konsortium, das eine neue Betreibergesellschaft, die \\"Grazer Tramway Gesellschaft\\" (GTG), gründete. Die GTG musste sich zum weiteren Netzausbau verpflichten und übernahm am 6.August 1887 den Betrieb. Die GTG erwarb kurz nach der Übernahme des Betriebes vier weitere Sommerwagen, die als Nummer 6–9 in den Bestand aufgenommen wurden. Ein Jahr später gingen neben der ersten Kehrschleife auch weitere zweigleisig ausgeführte Streckenabschnitte in Betrieb., Der Stadtbaumeister Andrea Franz erhielt 1894 eine Konzession zum Bau einer Dampfstraßenbahn nach Mariatrost. Am 31. Oktober 1895 wurde mit der Strecke Jakominiplatz–Schillerplatz die letzte Pferdebahn in Betrieb genommen. Die GTG verfügte zu diesem Zeitpunkt über ein 11Kilometer langes Streckennetz sowie 40 geschlossene und neun offene, grün lackierte Pferdewagen, die je nach Streckenprofil von einem oder zwei Pferden gezogen wurden. Jede der fünf Linien war mit einem eigenen, farbigen Symbol gekennzeichnet., Elektrifizierung und neue Kennzeichnung (1897–1911)., 1897 begann Andrea Franz abweichend von der 1894 erteilten Konzession für eine dampfbetriebene Kleinbahn mit der Errichtung einer elektrischen, meterspurigen Straßenbahn. Nach den Testfahrten mit den Triebfahrzeugen am 15. und 16.Dezember 1897 konnten am 25. und 26.Jänner 1898 die notwendigen polizeitechnischen Überprüfungsfahrten absolviert werden; am 29.Jänner 1898 wurde die \\"Elektrische Kleinbahn Graz–Mariatrost\\" feierlich eröffnet., Die 5,247 km lange Bahn führte von der Ecke Zinzendorfgasse/Glacisstraße im Grazer Stadtzentrum nach Mariatrost. Als Betriebsspannung wurden 500Volt Gleichspannung gewählt. Beim Endpunkt der Bahn gab es eine Remise samt Drehscheibe, Schiebebühne und Werkstätte sowie ein Kraftwerk. An der Endhaltestelle in der Glacisstraße bestand eine Umstiegsmöglichkeit zur GTG. Die Kleinbahn verfügte über einen Fuhrpark von acht zweiachsigen Triebwagen und acht Beiwagen der Grazer Waggonfabrik. Wegen der roten Farbgebung des Fahrzeugparks wurde die elektrische Bahn von der Grazer Bürgerschaft als \\"Die Rote\\" bezeichnet. Andrea Franz verkaufte die Bahn Ende des Jahres 1898 an das Bankhaus \\"Dutschka &amp; Comp.\\" aus Wien., Die GTG begann im Juli 1898 mit den Elektrifizierungsarbeiten auf dem gesamten Streckennetz. Die Arbeiten wurden von Siemens &amp; Halske ausgeführt; als Betriebsspannung wählte die GTG 550Volt Gleichspannung. Während der Elektrifizierungsarbeiten wurde auch der Oberbau verstärkt. Neben Oberleitungsmasten wurden in Bereichen beidseitiger Häuserbebauung Mauerrosetten an den Hauswänden zum Abspannen der Oberleitung angebracht. Auf den Linien Jakominiplatz–Staatsbahnhof (später Ostbahnhof, seit 12.Dezember 2010 Graz Ostbahnhof-Messe) und Schillerplatz–Annenstraße waren die Arbeiten bereits am 15.Juni 1899 abgeschlossen. Ab dem 24.Juni wurden alle Linien elektrisch betrieben. Einen Tag vorher verkehrte der letzte Pferdetramwagen in Graz., Die Versorgung des Oberleitungsnetzes mit Gleichstrom sicherte ein neu erbautes Dampfkraftwerk in der Steyrergasse. Dort entstanden auch eine weitere Remise und ein Betriebsgebäude. Die GTG beschaffte 40neue Triebwagen für den elektrischen Betrieb. Um den Ankauf neuer Beiwagen zu vermeiden, wurden von den 49vorhandenen Pferdetramwagen 23an den elektrischen Betrieb angepasst., Gegen Ende des Jahres 1899 beschäftigte die \\"Grazer Tramway Gesellschaft\\" insgesamt 191 Personen. Die GTG knüpfte durch einen massiven Netzausbau zwischen 1899 und 1906 einige Vororte an das Straßenbahnnetz an. In diesem Zeitraum wuchs das Netz um 21Kilometer. Durch den Ausbau kam es auch zu einem starken Anstieg der Nutzungsfrequenz, der die Anschaffung neuer Fahrzeuge mit sich brachte. Für die neuen Fahrzeuge wurde eine weitere Remise in der Alten Poststraße errichtet. 1902verfügte die GTG über 70Triebwagen, 40Beiwagen und sieben Salzwagen für den Winterbetrieb. Neuer Eigentümer der Kleinbahn nach Mariatrost wurde am 1. Juli 1900 die \\"Aktiengesellschaft Elektrische Kleinbahn Graz-Mariatrost\\"., Am 12. Mai 1903 erwarb nach Beschluss der Generalversammlung der \\"Grazer Tramway Gesellschaft\\" die GTG einen großen Teil der Aktien der \\"Elektrischen Kleinbahn.\\" 1906beschaffte die GTG sechs neue Triebwagen, die als Nummer 71–76 in den Bestand aufgenommen wurden. Zwei Jahre später kam es erneut zur Anschaffung von Neubaufahrzeugen. Das waren acht Beiwagen (70B–77B) und neun Triebwagen (80–88). Da in den beiden vorhandenen Remisen keine Abstellplätze für die neu erworbenen Fahrzeuge mehr frei waren, entschloss sich die GTG zum Bau einer weiteren Remise in der Nähe des nun zum Hauptbahnhof erklärten Südbahnhofs., 1911 ersetzte die Grazer Tramway Gesellschaft die farbigen Liniensymbole durch Nummern (siehe Tabelle). Alle Fahrzeuge erhielten beleuchtete Signalscheiben zur Linienkennzeichnung., Erster Weltkrieg (1914–1918)., Durch den Einzug von privaten Automobilen und Kutschpferden zu Kriegszwecken und durch die Notwendigkeit, Waren des täglichen Bedarfs beschaffen zu müssen, stiegen die Fahrgastzahlen während des Ersten Weltkriegs sprunghaft an. Gleichzeitig wurde das bisher vorwiegend männliche Personal knapp. Sowohl die \\"Grazer Tramway Gesellschaft\\" als auch die \\"Elektrische Kleinbahn Graz-Mariatrost\\" stellten 1914 verstärkt Frauen ein, die vor allem als Schaffnerinnen eingesetzt wurden. Die Elektrische Kleinbahn beschaffte 1914 zwei neue Beiwagen, die fortan als 7B und 8B bezeichnet wurden. Sie waren baugleich zu den Wagen 5B und 6B. Im selben Jahr beschaffte auch die GTG neue Fahrzeuge. Dabei handelte es sich um zwölf Beiwagen, die als 101B–112B in den Bestand aufgenommen wurden. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt verfügte die GTG über 149Fahrzeuge, während die Elektrische Kleinbahn nur acht Triebwagen und acht Beiwagen besaß., Da die Stadt Graz wegen Pferdemangel nicht ausreichend von Pferdefuhrwerken mit Kohle versorgt werden konnte, erklärte sich die GTG 1915 zum Kohletransport per Straßenbahn bereit. Es wurden 16Kohleloren (K1–K16) beschafft und eigene Kohlegleise verlegt. Ab dem Jahr 1916 errichtete die GTG an den Endstellen vermehrt Kehrschleifen, um: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Straßenbahnsystem, Österreich, Verkehr, Graz, normalspurige Pferdebahn, elektrisch betriebene Straßenbahn, Streckennetz, Graz Linien, Holding Graz, Tram, Steirischer Verkehrsverbund"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, DDR-Opposition, Gegründet 1989, Grüne Partei, Naturschutz in der DDR, Partei (DDR)], Die Grüne Partei in der DDR (Kurzbezeichnung Grüne Partei, ab September 1990 Die Grünen) wurde am 24. November 1989 konstituiert und auf ihrem ersten Parteitag am 9. Februar 1990 formell gegründet. Einen Tag nach der ersten gesamtdeutschen Bundestagswahl, am 3. Dezember 1990, fusionierte die Partei (mit Ausnahme des sächsischen Landesverbandes) mit den westdeutschen Grünen., Die Partei ging wesentlich auf das 1988 gegründete Grün-Ökologische Netzwerk Arche zurück. Im April 1989 kündigte die Arche an, zur nächsten Volkskammerwahl mit einer von der Einheitsliste der Nationalen Front unabhängigen Grünen Liste antreten zu wollen. Dies war der erste Versuch in der Geschichte der DDR, den parlamentarischen Alleinvertretungsanspruch der SED-geführten Nationalen Front herauszufordern. Die Vorbereitungen zur Gründung der Partei verzögerten sich jedoch aufgrund von Widerständen innerhalb der Umweltbewegung, so dass während der politischen Umbrüche im Herbst 1989 andere Parteien vor der Grünen Partei gegründet wurden., Die Grüne Partei war von Februar bis April 1990 mit einem Minister ohne Geschäftsbereich im Kabinett Modrow sowie nach der Wahl am 18. März 1990 mit acht Sitzen in der Volkskammer vertreten. Als Teil der Listenvereinigung Grüne/Bündnis 90 stellten die Grünen im ersten gesamtdeutschen Bundestag zwei der acht Abgeordneten. Da die westdeutschen Grünen an der Fünf-Prozent-Hürde scheiterten und sich wegen der im Vorfeld noch ausgebliebenen Fusion nicht auf das Wahlergebnis der ostdeutschen Liste stützen konnten, wie es bei einer bundesweiten Partei der Fall gewesen wäre, waren die beiden ostdeutschen Abgeordneten die einzigen Bundestagsabgeordneten der am folgenden Tag entstandenen gesamtdeutschen Grünen. Die Bundestagsgruppe von Grünen und Bündnis 90 war ein Vorreiter der Fusion zu einer gemeinsamen Partei 1993., Von der Umweltbewegung zur Partei., Vorgeschichte., Der Ursprung der Partei liegt in der Umweltbewegung der DDR. In den 1980er Jahren entstanden als Folge der Umweltverschmutzung überall im Land Umweltgruppen. So gab es bis 1988 etwa 80 Umweltgruppen unter dem Dach der Kirche. Anfangs war die Beschäftigung mit Umweltthemen noch eng mit der Friedens- und Menschenrechtsbewegung verschränkt, erst Mitte der 1980er Jahre differenzierten sich zunehmend themenspezifische Gruppierungen heraus. Wichtige Themen waren unter anderem die Zerstörung der Umwelt durch den Tagebau, die Luftverschmutzung durch den massiven Einsatz der Braunkohle, der Uranbergbau der Wismut AG, die Umweltzerstörungen durch die chemische Industrie um Bitterfeld, die „Tonnenideologie“ der DDR-Wirtschaftspolitik und, besonders nach der Nuklearkatastrophe von Tschernobyl 1986, die Nutzung der Atomenergie., Erste Pläne zur Gründung einer Grünen Partei gab es 1984. Bei einem Treffen von DDR-Umweltschützern mit Petra Kelly und Gert Bastian wurde erwogen, eine solche Partei als Sektion der westdeutschen Grünen zu gründen. Diese Überlegungen wurden jedoch fallengelassen, da es dazu keine legale Möglichkeit gab und eine Umsetzung die Mitglieder deshalb zwangsläufig kriminalisiert hätte, zudem waren die Pläne auch innerhalb der westdeutschen Grünen Partei nicht durchsetzbar. Einzelpersonen hatten immer wieder vage Pläne einer (grünen) Parteigründung, so Vera Wollenberger um 1984 oder Hans-Jochen Tschiche seit 1987., 1986 gründete sich die Initiative Frieden und Menschenrechte (IFM), die sich für die Herstellung von Rechtsstaatlichkeit und für eine Demokratisierung der DDR einsetzte. Im selben Jahr wurde in den Kellerräumen der Berliner Zionskirchengemeinde die Umwelt-Bibliothek (UB) gegründet, die sich schnell zur wichtigsten Institution des Informationsaustausches der Umwelt-, aber auch der Friedens- und Menschenrechtsbewegung entwickelte. Bis dahin war das Kirchliche Forschungsheim in der Lutherstadt Wittenberg die einzige Einrichtung, die die lokalen Umweltgruppen koordinierte. Die Umwelt-Bibliothek gab die Samisdat-Zeitschrift „Umweltblätter“ (später „telegraph“) heraus, die bis zur Wende das bedeutendste Organ der DDR-Opposition war. Für eine effiziente DDR-weite Vernetzung der Ökogruppen fehlten der Umwelt-Bibliothek die Organisationsstrukturen, letztlich aber auch der Wille, solche überhaupt aufzubauen, da die unabhängigen Umweltgruppen stark auf Autonomie und Basisdemokratie setzten. So verlief eine Debatte über den Aufbau eines ökologischen Netzwerks auf dem dritten Berliner Ökologieseminar 1987 kontrovers und eine Gründung wurde mehrheitlich abgelehnt., Deshalb ergriffen einzelne Vertreter verschiedener Umweltgruppen im Januar 1988 die Initiative und gründeten gegen das Diskussionsergebnis des Ökologieseminars das Grün-Ökologische Netzwerk Arche, dessen Strukturen und relativ hoher Organisationsgrad einer Partei bereits nahe kamen. Das föderale, auf dem demokratischen Vertretungsprinzip fußende Netzwerk war besonders innerhalb der basisdemokratisch-anarchistisch orientierten Berliner Umwelt-Bibliothek heftig umstritten. Im Kern basierte die Kritik auf einem durch die fast vollständige Durchinstitutionalisierung der realsozialistischen Gesellschaft hervorgerufenen tiefgreifendem Misstrauen der oppositionellen Gruppen in der DDR gegenüber Parteien und allen zentralistischen Organisationen. Die Differenzen führten dazu, dass die Arche-Mitglieder von der Mehrheit um Wolfgang Rüddenklau aus der Umwelt-Bibliothek ausgeschlossen wurden, darunter Carlo Jordan, der sowohl bei der Gründung der UB, als auch der Arche eine zentrale Rolle spielte. Statt die Gründungserklärung der Arche abzudrucken, veröffentlichten die Umweltblätter einen Unvereinbarkeitsbeschluss. Deshalb gab die Arche mit der „Arche Nova“ ein für damalige Verhältnisse professionell gestaltetes, bis zu achtzig Seiten umfassendes und in einer Auflage von mehreren tausend Exemplaren erscheinendes eigenes Samisdat heraus., Die Spaltung der kirchlichen Umweltszene lag ganz im Interesse der Staatssicherheit, die zu diesem Zweck mit Falk Zimmermann, dem späteren Parteisprecher Henry Schramm, dem späteren Finanzgeschäftsführer der Grünen Partei Mario Hamel und anderen inoffizielle Mitarbeiter in die Arche eingeschleust hatte., Seit 1988 liefen, bestärkt durch intensive Kontakte zum osteuropäischen Netzwerk von Umweltgruppen „Greenway“, Vorbereitungen der Gruppe, eine parteiähnliche Vereinigung zu gründen. Anlässlich der Kommunalwahlen vom 7. Mai 1989 versuchte die Arche wie auch andere oppositionelle Gruppen, Kandidaten auf der Liste der Nationalen Front zu platzieren, was aber misslang. Deshalb wurde auf einem Sprechertreffen Ende April 1989 in Halle beschlossen, für die nächste Volkskammerwahl 1991 eigene Kandidaten in einer „Grünen Liste“ aufzustellen. Diese sollte nicht nur Umweltschützern, sondern auch Kandidaten der Friedens- und Menschenrechtsbewegung offenstehen. Der Plan wurde bereits im Vorfeld der Kommunalwahlen, am 26. April 1989, auf einer Veranstaltung in Berlin öffentlich erklärt. Diese „Erklärung zur Kommunalwahl“ erschien am Tag vor der Wahl auch in der taz und im West-Berliner Radio 100. Der Historiker und Journalist Hans Michael Kloth sieht in diesem zielgerichteten Versuch, mit der Grünen Liste eine zur Einheitsliste der Nationalen Front konkurrierende Wahlliste an einer Wahl teilnehmen zu lassen, die erste offene Herausforderung des parlamentarischen Alleinvertretungsanspruchs der SED in der Geschichte der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik. Nach der Aufdeckung des Wahlbetrugs bei den Kommunalwahlen vom 7. Mai trat am 3. Juni 1989 ein Arche-Vertreter auf dem ersten Berliner Umwelttag in der Treptower Bekenntniskirche mit konkreten Forderungen nach sofortigen Neuwahlen unter Zulassung der Grünen Liste an die Öffentlichkeit., Parteigründung., Die politischen Umbrüche im Herbst 1989 änderten die Voraussetzungen für die Konstituierung einer Partei grundlegend. Seit August 1989 wurden auch in anderen oppositionellen Gruppen Parteien oder parteiähnliche Vereinigungen vorbereitet. Am 9. September wurde das Neue Forum als Sammlungsbewegung, am 12. September die Bürgerbewegung Demokratie Jetzt und am 7. Oktober mit der Sozialdemokratischen Partei in der DDR (SDP) die erste unabhängige Partei in der DDR gegründet. Im Dezember folgte der ebenfalls als politische Partei konzipierte Demokratische Aufbruch (DA). Diese Dynamik erhöhte den Druck, den Prozess einer grünen Parteigründung zu beschleunigen, insbesondere, weil das grüne Themenfeld von anderen Gruppen besetzt zu werden drohte. Das Neue Forum stellte Wirtschaft und Ökologie noch vor der politischen Teilhabe an erste Stelle eines Problemkatalogs und der Demokratische Aufbruch versuchte, eine grüne Partei zu verhindern, um die Umweltaktivisten an sich binden zu können., Zunächst versuchte die Arche, die geplante Wahlliste als „Grüne Liste im Neuen Forum“ anzusiedeln. Wegen der unklaren Organisationsstruktur des Neuen Forums erschien diese Option jedoch als unsicher, zumal insbesondere Bärbel Bohley und Reinhard Schult keinen „Parteiklüngel“ im Neuen Forum haben wollten. Auch Gespräche mit staatlichen Organisationen, namentlich der „Interessengemeinschaft Stadtökologie“ der Gesellschaft für Natur und Umwelt im Kulturbund, verliefen ergebnislos und es kam teilweise zu heftigen Auseinandersetzungen. Viele Einzelmitglieder der sich seit etwa 1986 zunehmend emanzipierenden Stadtökologiegruppen fanden jedoch in den folgenden Monaten den Weg in die neu entstehende Partei, darunter Klaus-Dieter Feige, Bundestagsabgeordneter ab 1990, Ernst Dörfler und Bernd Reichelt, beide Mitglieder der Volkskammerfraktion 1990, Marianne Dörfler, Mitglied des ersten Sprecherrats, sowie Olaf Möller, Landtagsabgeordneter in Thüringen ab 1990., In einem Gründungsaufruf vom 5. November 1989 nannte eine „Initiativgruppe zur Gründung einer Grünen Partei in der DDR“ als ihre Hauptziele den Umweltschutz, den ökologischen Umbau der DDR sowie Friedenssicherung und Gleichberechtigung von Mann und Frau. Vorgelegt wurde der Aufruf von 15 zumeist der Arche angehörenden und aus Berlin stammenden Mitgliedern der Initiativgruppe auf dem 6.Berliner Ökologieseminar in der Bekenntniskirche. Bereits im Vorfeld des Treffens hatten unter anderem Hans-Peter Gensichen und Olaf Möller in der gesamten DDR Rundbriefe verschickt, in denen sie sich strikt gegen die geplante Parteigründung aussprachen. Sie argumentierten, dass Umweltthemen in allen Parteien vertreten sein sollten. Vor allem aber fühlten sich viele der Teilnehmer des Seminars überrumpelt, so dass es zu einem heftigen Eklat und zum Zerwürfnis der beiden Strömungen kam.

Der elektrische Betrieb wurde 1905 aufgenommen. Die Stubaitalbahn nutzt das Netz der Straßenbahn von ihrem ehemaligen Endbahnhof bis zum Hauptbahnhof. Betreiber der Straßenbahn Innsbruck ist die \\"Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe und Stubaitalbahn GmbH\\"., Geschichte., Die Innsbrucker Lokalbahnen – Wegbereiter der städtischen Straßenbahn (1891–1904)., Die \\"Localbahn Innsbruck–Hall in Tirol\\" (1891–1899)., Mit der Südbahn von Kufstein zum Brenner erreichte 1858 die erste Eisenbahn Innsbruck. Sie verband schon damals die Städte Innsbruck und Hall in Tirol, jedoch nur wenige Male täglich. Deshalb tauchten schon bald Projekte auf, die beiden Städte anderweitig mit einer Lokalbahn zu verbinden. Doch bis es soweit sein sollte, vergingen noch knapp 40Jahre., Anders als bei vielen anderen Straßenbahnbetrieben zog die Stadt Innsbruck die Errichtung einer Dampfstraßenbahn dem Bau einer Pferdebahn vor. Am 18.September 1889 erhielten Louis Hirsch, August Riedinger, Anton Prantl und Hermann Ritter von Schwind eine Konzession zum Bau und Betrieb einer \\"„mit Dampf oder anderer Motorkraft zu betreibenden Localbahn“\\" von Innsbruck nach Hall in Tirol, die den unteren Stadtplatz in Hall mit dem Südbahnhof (dem heutigen Hauptbahnhof) in Innsbruck verbinden sollte. Darüber hinaus war noch eine Stichstrecke zum Bergisel geplant. Die Remisenanlagen hätten im Stadtteil Saggen gebaut werden sollen, doch aufgrund des schnellen Wachstums der Stadt war dort der benötigte Platz nicht mehr vorhanden. Darum wurde der Plan, die Strecke zum Südbahnhof zu führen, aufgegeben. Stattdessen wurde der Bergisel als Endbahnhof gewählt, da dort noch genügend Platz für Remisen zur Verfügung stand. Die eingleisig ausgeführte, 12,1km lange Strecke konnte trotz Widerstand seitens der Stadtbevölkerung nach zwei Jahren Bauzeit am 1.Juni 1891 eröffnet werden. Die Bahn führte vom Bergiselbahnhof durch das Dorf Wilten bis in die Innsbrucker Innenstadt, den Inn entlang und durch den Saggen weiter zur Kettenbrücke, wo sie auf einer eigenen Brücke den Inn querte. Von dort folgte die Trasse der Haller Straße bis Hall., Die Betriebsführung oblag der 1893 gegründeten \\"Actien-Gesellschaft Localbahn Innsbruck–HallinTirol\\" (L.B.I.H.i.T.). Für den Betrieb wurden vier Dampflokomotiven, neun Personenwagen und zwei Güterwagen beschafft. Innerhalb von zwei Jahren wurde der Fuhrpark mit zwei bauartgleichen Lokomotiven und 19 bauartgleichen Wagen ergänzt. Die Fahrzeuge erhielten die Betriebsnummern 1–6 (Lokomotiven) und 1–23 (Personenwagen, davon fünf offene Sommerwagen). Anfangs verkehrten die Züge im Stundentakt. Im Jahr 1900 wurde der Halbstundentakt eingeführt, weshalb zwei weitere Lokomotiven (Betriebsnummern 7–8) und sechs Personenwaggons (Betriebsnummern 24–29) angeschafft werden mussten. Neben den Remisen am Bergiselbahnhof gab es noch einen zweiständigen Lokschuppen in Hall, in dem der täglich letzte Zug nach Hall übernachtete., Die \\"Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn\\" (1900–1903)., Da um die Jahrhundertwende im Innsbrucker Mittelgebirge der Sommertourismus aufzublühen begann, sollte dieses mit einer Bahn an die Stadt angebunden werden. Besonders die Orte Lans, Sistrans, Igls, Vill und Aldrans zogen die Fremden an. Daher wurde auch hier schon früh eine Bahn geplant. Am 15.Jänner 1900 erhielt die Stadt Innsbruck schließlich eine Konzession zum Bau einer dampfbetriebenen Lokalbahn auf das Plateau des Mittelgebirges. Die eingleisig ausgeführte, 8,4km lange Bahn konnte bereits am 27.Juni desselben Jahres eröffnet werden. Diese Lokalbahn, die \\"Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn\\" (I.M.B.), nahm ihren Ausgang ebenfalls beim Bergisel und verband Innsbruck mit den Orten Aldrans, Lans, Sistrans und Igls. Aufgrund von Steigungen bis zu 46Promille mussten leistungsstarke Dampflokomotiven beschafft werden: Es wurden drei Dreikuppler-Dampflokomotiven (1–3) und zwölf Personenwagen (101–112) erworben. Die Beiwagen waren baugleich mit den geschlossenen Wagen der Lokalbahn nach Hall, während die Lokomotiven größer und stärker waren. Die Betriebsführung oblag der \\"L.B.I.H.i.T.\\", Die \\"Stubaitalbahn\\" (1904)., In der kleinen Ortschaft Fulpmes, am Eingang des Stubaitals gelegen, gab es einige Kleineisen verarbeitende Betriebe. Darum musste eine bessere Verkehrsanbindung an das Stubaital hergestellt werden. Da 1903 das Sillkraftwerk bei Innsbruck eröffnet wurde, stand genügend Leistung für eine elektrisch betriebene Bahnstrecke zur Verfügung. Auch gab es bereits erste Planungen einer Straßenbahn in Innsbruck. Also wurde die Errichtung einer Lokalbahn beschlossen, die vom Südbahnhof zum Bergisel und in weiterer Folge die Brennerstraße entlang durch die Dörfer Natters, Mutters, Kreith und Telfes nach Fulpmes führen sollte. Damit wäre der Südbahnhof an das Straßenbahnnetz angeschlossen und der Grundstein für die städtische Straßenbahn gelegt worden, andererseits wäre Fulpmes verkehrstechnisch erschlossen worden. Da die AEG Union die Technologie der Wechselstrommotoren erproben wollte und sich dafür an dem Bau der Bahn finanziell beteiligen wollte, fiel die Wahl des Stromsystems auf Einphasen-Wechselstrom bei 42,5Hertz. Die Lokalbahnzüge sollten auf der Überlandstrecke zwischen dem Stubaitalbahnhof am Fuße des Bergisels bis nach Fulpmes mit 2500Volt verkehren und auf der Strecke vom Südbahnhof bis zum Stubaitalbahnhof gleich wie die Straßenbahn mit 600Volt fahren. Es wurde die \\"Aktiengesellschaft Stubaital Bahn (A.G.St.B)\\" gegründet. 1903wurde mit dem Bau des Überlandabschnittes begonnen und am 31.Juli 1904 konnte sie eröffnet werden. Der Betrieb oblag der \\"L.B.I.H.i.T.\\" Allerdings erwies sich das Stromsystem als unausgereift, weswegen es zu zahlreichen Störungen im Betrieb kam. Deswegen wurde für die Stadt eine Betriebsspannung von 500Volt Gleichspannung gewählt, was die Attraktivität der Stubaitalbahn etwas senkte, da nun der Anschluss an den Südbahnhof fehlte. Zwar gab es in den folgenden Jahren immer wieder Pläne, die Bahn auf einer eigenen Trasse zum Südbahnhof zu führen, doch scheiterten diese dann an der schlechten finanziellen Lage des Unternehmens., Ausbau der Lokalbahn und Errichtung der Stadtbahn (1905–1914)., Die \\"Stadtbahn\\" und die \\"Saggenlinie\\" (1905–1908)., Am 15. Juli 1905 eröffnete die L.B.I.H.i.T. schließlich die erste Straßenbahnlinie in Innsbruck, welche mit 500Volt Gleichspannung betrieben wurde. Die als „Stadtbahn“ bezeichnete Linie war eingleisig ausgeführt und 2,3Kilometer lang. Sie führte vom Südbahnhof beginnend bis zum Staatsbahnhof (dem heutigen Westbahnhof). Eine Stichstrecke führte vom Staatsbahnhof aus über eine Eisenbrücke über die Arlbergbahn zum Bergiselbahnhof. Die Betriebszeiten waren am Anfang noch auf den Zeitraum zwischen 7 und 20Uhr beschränkt., Noch vor Eröffnung der Stadtbahn wurde bereits an einer Erweiterung gearbeitet. Der im Aufbau begriffene Stadtteil Saggen sollte an die Stadtbahn angeschlossen werden. Hierfür wurde die 1,7Kilometer lange „Saggenlinie“ geplant, die am 18.November 1905 eröffnet wurde. Die Strecke zweigte in der Museumstraße von der Stadtbahn ab, folgte dem Südbahn-Viadukt entlang bis zur Bundesbahndirektion und führte von dort weiter zur Adolf-Pichler-Straße (heutige Conradstraße). Ab der Eröffnung der Saggenlinie wurde der Südbahnhof nicht mehr direkt angefahren. Die Triebwagen fuhren vom Staatsbahnhof direkt in den Saggen., Ein Triebwagen, der zwischen Museumstraße und Südbahnhof pendelte, bildete dann den Anschluss an diesen. Für den Betrieb der Linien wurden für die Stadtbahn sieben und zur Eröffnung der Saggenlinie drei weitere zweiachsige Elektrotriebwagen bei der Grazer Waggonfabrik angeschafft, die mit den Betriebsnummern 36–42 beziehungsweise 43–45 in den Bestand aufgenommen wurden. Da die Fahrgastzahlen rapide anstiegen, wurden einige Beiwagen der \\"L.B.I.H.i.T.\\" zur Verstärkung der Stadtbahn herangezogen. So konnte ein Zug mit bis zu drei Beiwagen verstärkt werden. Da die Localbahn ihre Beiwagen selbst dringend benötigte, mussten bereits 1906 vier Beiwagen beschafft werden, die mit den Betriebsnummern 61–64 in den Bestand aufgenommen wurden. Außerdem wurden zwei der wenig benötigten Sommerbeiwagen der Localbahn für den elektrischen Betrieb auf der Stadtbahn adaptiert und bekamen somit eine elektrische Beleuchtung, eine Solenoidbremse, elektrische Heizungen und Steckgitter bei den Plattformen., Im September 1906 wurde die Hungerburgbahn eröffnet; die Saggenlinie hätte bis zur Talstation der Bahn verlängert werden sollen, dieser Plan scheiterte allerdings zunächst, da die Straße dorthin noch nicht fertiggestellt war. Außerdem wollte der Stadtsenat nicht zwei Gleise in derselben Straße haben, da bereits die Lokalbahn dort durchfuhr. In Hinblick auf einen weiteren Ausbau der Straßenbahn nach Amras bemühte sich die Localbahngesellschaft um eine Konzession für eine Strecke von der Andreas-Hofer-Straße durch die Maximilianstraße zum Südbahnhof. 1908wurde hier eine neue Linie eröffnet und mit der Linie, die zwischen Museumstraße und Südbahnhof pendelte, zusammengelegt. Bereits 1907 wurden zwei weitere Triebwagen (Betriebsnummern 46+47) bestellt, die baugleich mit denen der Stadtbahn waren, um diese Linie bedienen zu können., Die Elektrifizierung der Localbahn nach Hall (1909–1911)., 1909 war es schließlich so weit, die Elektrifizierungsarbeiten auf der Localbahn nach Hall begannen. Gleichzeitig wurde die Streckenführung der Bahn im Saggen geändert, so dass die Localbahn nicht mehr durch die Falkstraße fuhr, sondern durch die Kaiserjägerstraße zum Rennweg. Dies ermöglichte auch die Verlängerung der Saggenlinie bis zur Talstation der Hungerburgbahn. Auch wurde ein weiteres Gleis von der Andreas-Hofer-Straße aus, durch die Franz-Fischer-Straße zum Wiltener Platzl gelegt, um die Bahnschranken in der Leopoldstraße umgehen zu können. Zusätzlich wurde eine neue Linie eröffnet, die zwischen: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"- Spurweite 1000 mm - Straßenbahn Innsbruck - Straßenbahnsystem Österreich - Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe - Stubaitalbahn - Lokalbahnen Innsbruck - Eisenbahn Innsbruck - Dampfstraßenbahn - Konzession Lokalbahn - Bergiselbahnhof - Stadtbahn Innsbruck"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Aromatischer Kohlenwasserstoff, Aspirationstoxischer Stoff, Augenreizender Stoff, Beschränkter Stoff nach REACH-Anhang XVII, Beschränkter Stoff nach REACH-Anhang XVII, Eintrag 29, Beschränkter Stoff nach REACH-Anhang XVII, Eintrag 40, Beschränkter Stoff nach REACH-Anhang XVII, Eintrag 72, Erbgutverändernder Stoff, Erdölprodukt, Feuergefährlicher Stoff], Benzol (nach IUPAC Benzen) ist eine chemische Verbindung aus der Stoffgruppe der Kohlenwasserstoffe. Es handelt sich um eine aromatische Verbindung mit der Summenformel C6H6, wobei die sechs Kohlenstoffatome einen planaren Ring (Benzolring) mit sechs delokalisierten Elektronen bilden. Benzol ist die Stammverbindung der aromatischen Kohlenwasserstoffe. Die farblose Flüssigkeit riecht charakteristisch süßlich-aromatisch, ist leicht entzündlich und brennt mit einer stark rußenden Flamme. Es ist unpolar und mischt sich mit vielen organischen Lösungsmitteln, aber kaum mit Wasser. Die wissenschaftliche Diskussion um die Struktur des Benzols spielte eine zentrale Rolle bei der Entwicklung der Theorie der organischen Chemie., Industriell fällt Benzol bei der Koksproduktion für die Stahlindustrie an. Seit den 1950er Jahren erfolgt die Benzolproduktion überwiegend auf Erdölbasis in Raffinerie- und petrochemischen Prozessen wie dem Steamcracken und dem katalytischen Reforming als Nebenprodukt der Benzin-, Ethylen- und Xylolherstellung. Daneben gibt es gezielte industrielle Herstellungswege für Benzol wie die Dealkylierung und Transalkylierung von Toluol., Benzol ist ein wichtiges Zwischenprodukt für die petrochemische Industrie, der globale Bedarf lag 2019 bei etwa 50Millionen Tonnen. Durch Additions-, Substitutions- und Oxidationsreaktionen wird es zu zahlreichen Folgeprodukten umgesetzt., Seine Derivate wie Ethylbenzol, Cumol, Cyclohexan, \\"ortho\\"- und \\"para\\"-Xylol, Chlorbenzol, Benzolsulfonsäure, Nitrobenzol und Oxidationsprodukte wie Maleinsäureanhydrid werden zu vielfältigen Zwischenprodukten für Farbstoffe, Arzneistoffe, Sprengstoffe, Reinigungsmittel, Insektizide und Kunststoffe für verschiedene Industrien weiterverarbeitet. Weiterhin ist es in Motorenbenzin enthalten, wobei der Gehalt in den meisten Ländern begrenzt ist., Benzol ist ein giftiger Stoff, der sowohl akute als auch chronische Gesundheitsschäden verursachen kann. Für den Menschen ist es krebserregend., Geschichte., Frühe Arbeiten und Namensgebung., In der zweiten Hälfte des 17.Jahrhunderts bemerkte Johann Rudolph Glauber, der Entdecker des Glaubersalzes (Natriumsulfat), dass bei der Destillation von Steinkohlenteer eine farblose Flüssigkeit entstand, die er ein „feines und liebliches Oleum“ nannte und bei dem es sich wahrscheinlich um Benzol handelte. Eine genauere Bestimmung gelang dem britischen Physiker Michael Faraday im Mai 1825, als er eine ihm von der Portable Oil Company of London zugesandte Ölprobe analysierte. Durch wiederholte fraktionierte Destillation und fraktionierte Kristallisation stellte er nahezu reines Benzol her, das er „Bicarburet of Hydrogen“ nannte. Faraday wählte diesen Namen, der ein Verhältnis von 2:1 von Kohlenstoff zu Wasserstoff bedeutet, auf der Grundlage der Elementaranalyse von Benzol. Das Ergebnis der Elementaranalyse und die darauf kalkulierten Verhältnisse beruhen jedoch auf einer falschen Annahme der Atomgewichte von Kohlenstoff und Wasserstoff. Er ermittelte den Siedepunkt mit 80°C und den Schmelzpunkt mit 5,5°C., Die erste Synthese von Benzol geht auf den deutschen Chemiker Eilhard Mitscherlich zurück, der es 1833 durch die Reaktion von Benzoesäure und Kalk herstellte. Mitscherlich nannte die Verbindung „Benzin“ nach dem Benzoinharz, aus dem er die Benzoesäure extrahiert hatte. Außerdem setzte er Benzol zu Nitrobenzol, Azobenzol und Benzolsulfonsäure um und erstellte die richtige Summenformel C6H6. Justus von Liebig benannte die Substanz in „Benzol“ um, weil die Endung -\\"in\\" den Alkaloiden vorbehalten war., Der französische Chemiker Auguste Laurent schlug den Namen „phène“, von altgriechisch \\"φαίνω\\" / \\"phaínô\\", „ich erleuchte“ vor, da die Verbindung aus Leuchtgas entstand. Dieser Name ist Bestandteil des Begriffs des Phenols und der Phenylgruppe, der in der organischen Chemie die Atomgruppe –C6H5 bezeichnet. Daneben gab es die Bezeichnungen „Phenylwasserstoff“, „Benzine“ und im Französischen „Benzene“ und „Phéne“. Gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts setzte sich die Verwendung des Namens Benzol im Deutschen durch. Im Angelsächsischen und Französischen wurde jedoch weiterhin der von Mitscherlich geprägte Name in angepasster Form verwendet (französisch: \\"benzène\\", englisch: \\"benzene\\"). Da in der systematischen chemischen Nomenklatur die Endung \\"-ol\\" für Alkohole verwendet wird, legte die IUPAC als offizielle deutsche Nomenklatur den Namen \\"Benzen\\" fest, der jedoch kaum verwendet wird., Im Jahr 1845 gewann der englische Chemiker Charles Mansfield unter der Leitung von August Wilhelm von Hofmann erstmals Benzol aus Steinkohlenteer. Von Hofmann prägte 1855 auch den Begriff „aromatisch“, um die chemischen Eigenschaften dieser Substanzklasse zu beschreiben und nicht deren Geruchsmerkmale. Mansfield begann 1849 mit der industriellen Produktion von Benzol, basierend auf der Destillation von Steinkohlenteer. Bis dahin war Steinkohlenteer ein unerwünschtes Nebenprodukt, das in großen Mengen bei der Herstellung von Koks und Stadtgas anfiel. Steinkohlenteer wurde zum Ausgangsstoff für eine breite Palette von Kohlenwasserstoffen wie Toluol, Naphthalin und Anthracen. Diese wiederum bildeten ab Mitte der 1880er Jahre die Basis für die Entwicklung der Teerfarbenindustrie., Struktur des Benzols., Um die korrekte Strukturformel des Benzols schwelte ein langer Gelehrtenstreit. Frühe Ideen wie die von Albert Ladenburg vorgeschlagene Prisman-Struktur und das von James Dewar neben anderen Strukturen beschriebene Dewar-Benzol erwiesen sich als Fehlschlüsse. Der österreichische Chemiker Johann Josef Loschmidt, damals noch Schullehrer, formulierte erst im Jahre 1861 einige Strukturformeln des Benzols, die der deutsche Chemiker und Professor für Chemie August Kekulé 1865 – möglicherweise als Anregung für seine Kekulé-Strukturformel – übernahm und damit den Benzolring als Basis der Konstitution der aromatischen Verbindungen erkannte. Einer Legende nach kam Kekulé dieser Einfall im Traum. Er träumte von einer Schlange, die sich selbst in den Schwanz biss. Kekulé (ab 1895 Kekule von Stradonitz) beschreibt dies in seiner Rede zum 25-jährigen Jubiläum des Benzolrings 1890. Die sechs Affen, die sich abwechselnd entweder mit beiden oder mit einer Hand an den Füßen fassten und so die Ringstruktur bildeten, beruhen auf einem 1886 bei einem Bierabend der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft gemachten Scherz., Kekulés Struktur trug als erste dem experimentellen Befund Rechnung, dass im Benzol alle Kohlenstoffatome gleichwertig sind. Sie erklärte nicht alle Besonderheiten des Benzols, wie beispielsweise seine ungewöhnlich niedrige Reaktivität im Vergleich zu Olefinen. Das Ausbleiben einer Additionsreaktion mit Bromwasser, wie sie nach der Kekulé-Strukturformel zu erwarten wäre, blieb rätselhaft. Im Jahre 1872 formulierte Kekulé seine „Oszillationshypothese“ eines dauernden Platzwechsels von Einfach- und Doppelbindungen., Armit und Robinson führten 1925 die vereinfachte Schreibweise mit einem Kreis in der Formel ein, welcher zum Ausdruck bringen soll, dass alle Bindungen absolut gleichwertig sind und keine lokalisierbaren Doppelbindungen existieren. Die britische Kristallographin Kathleen Lonsdale wies 1929 durch Röntgenbeugung die Symmetrie des Rings nach. Weitere Arbeiten von Lonsdale und K.S. Krishnan über die Untersuchung der magnetischen Suszeptibilität von Benzolderivaten und deren Interpretation durch Lonsdale und Pauling zeigten, dass die Elektronen delokalisiert sind. Eine hypothetische Form mit drei fixierten Doppelbindungen und drei Einfachbindungen würde als \\"1,3,5-Cyclohexatrien\\" bezeichnet., Schätzungen zufolge gibt es über 200 verschiedene mögliche Strukturen von (CH)6-Verbindungen, die als Valenzisomere des Benzols bezeichnet werden. Davon wurden einige, wie auch das Benzvalen oder das Dicyclopropenyl in den 1960er und 1970er synthetisiert., Industrielle Produktion., Als erste technische Anwendung patentierte der schottische Chemiker Charles Macintosh 1823 eine Methode zur Herstellung wasserdichter Kleidung, bei der er im benzolreichen Destillat des Steinkohlenteers Naturkautschuk auflöste und damit Baumwollstoff wasserdicht imprägnierte. Daraus ließ er \\"Mackintosh\\" genannte Regenmäntel fertigen., Das industrielle Interesse an Benzol begann mit Michael Faradays Synthese des Nitrobenzols aus Benzol und Salpetersäure, ein Ausgangsstoff für aus Anilin gewonnene Teerfarben. Im Jahr 1849 begann die industrielle Herstellung des Benzols und anderer Aromaten auf der Basis von Steinkohlenteer, einem Nebenprodukt der Koksgewinnung aus Steinkohle. Dessen Verfügbarkeit hing vom Koksbedarf der Stahlindustrie ab. Montanunternehmen gründeten bereits 1898 die Westdeutsche Benzol-Verkaufsvereinigung, die den Vertrieb von Benzol zum Geschäftszweck hatte. Durch den Zusammenschluss mit anderen Kohle- und Stahlunternehmen entstand 1918 der Benzol-Verband. Dieser formulierte 1924 ein Gemisch mit einem Mischungsverhältnis „von sechs Teilen Benzin und vier Teilen Benzol“ als Motorenbenzin und nannte es \\"BV-Aral\\". Der Name Aral war ein Kunstwort, das sich aus den Anfangsbuchstaben der Komponenten Aromaten und Aliphaten zusammensetzte. Die Vereinigten Stahlwerke unter der Leitung von Albert Vögler traten 1927 dem Benzol-Verband bei. Hierdurch und durch den Zugriff auf die Patente des Kaiser-Wilhelm-Instituts für Kohlenforschung und damit auf die Patente für das Fischer-Tropsch-Verfahren wurde der Benzol-Verband zur größten Kraftstoffvertriebsorganisation in Deutschland ohne ausländische Beteiligung., Mit dem Beginn des Ersten Weltkriegs erhöhte sich der Bedarf an Aromaten. Besonders Toluol war für die Herstellung des Sprengstoffs TNT von kriegswirtschaftlicher Bedeutung, und die Kapazitäten aus der Koksherstellung deckten nicht mehr die Nachfrage. Daher wurden Verfahren zur Herstellung von Benzol und anderen Aromaten auf der Basis von Erdöl entwickelt. Im Jahr 1904 wurde Alexander Nikiforoff ein Patent für die Herstellung von Benzol aus Petroleum durch Pyrolyse erteilt. Er setzte dazu einen Naphthasiedeschnitt unter hohen Temperaturen und Drücken in ein Gemisch aus Benzol und seinen Derivaten wie Toluol, Xylol und Cumol um. Weiterhin fielen polycyclische aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe wie Naphthalin und Anthracen dabei an. Aromaten wurden in England durch Pyrolyse von Schwerbenzin nach dem Hall-Verfahren gewonnen., Ein Meilenstein der Aromatenchemie war die Herstellung von Phenol aus Benzol, das während des Ersten Weltkriegs als Ausgangsstoff für Pikrinsä: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Sie wurde 1888 von der privaten Lokalbahn Aktien-Gesellschaft (LAG) eröffnet und verkehrte zunächst als dampfbetriebene Nebenbahn von Ravensburg bis Weingarten. 1910 wurde sie elektrifiziert und 1911 bis nach Baienfurt verlängert., 1938 wurde die im Volksmund auch \\"Zügle\\", \\"Mühle\\", \\"Bähnle\\" oder \\"Bodensee-Blitz\\" genannte Bahn verstaatlicht und fortan gemäß der im selben Jahr in Kraft getretenen Verordnung über den Bau und Betrieb der Straßenbahnen (BOStrab) auch offiziell als Straßenbahn klassifiziert. Die Strecke war nach 1938 der einzige Straßenbahnbetrieb im Besitz der Deutschen Reichsbahn, nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg der einzige Straßenbahnbetrieb im Besitz der Deutschen Bundesbahn., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte., 1849: Altdorf wird übergangen., Bereits am 8. November 1847 wurde die oberschwäbische Oberamtsstadt und heutige Kreisstadt Ravensburg von Friedrichshafen her an die Südbahn angeschlossen. Am 26. Mai 1849 verlängerte man diese schließlich bis Biberach an der Riß, am 29. Juni 1850 war Ulm erreicht. Dort erfolgte der Lückenschluss mit der bereits bestehenden Filstalbahn von Stuttgart. Entgegen den ursprünglichen Erwartungen der Bevölkerung und der Gewerbetreibenden erhielt Altdorf –das spätere Weingarten– im Zuge der Verlängerung nach Norden keinen Anschluss an diese wichtige Hauptstrecke der Königlich Württembergischen Staats-Eisenbahnen. Zum einen wollte das, nicht im Besitz von Kohlevorkommen befindliche, Königreich seine Lokomotiven auf dem denkbar kürzesten Weg zum Bodensee führen, kurzfristig drohte sogar die Umfahrung von Biberach. Zum anderen erwies sich insbesondere der damalige Altdorfer Schultheiß Adolf Prielmayer als vehementer Gegner einer direkten Anbindung. Folglich führte die Südbahn in zweieinhalb Kilometern Entfernung westlich am Ort vorbei, doch auch die alten Marktorte Waldsee und Tettnang sowie Baindt und Baienfurt wurden seinerzeit nicht angeschlossen., Erschwerend hinzu kam, dass auch an der Stelle, die Altdorf am nächsten lag, keine Bahnstation eingerichtet wurde. Der heutige stadtnahe Haltepunkt \\"Weingarten/Berg\\" wurde erst 1998 durch die Bodensee-Oberschwaben-Bahn eröffnet. Dies hatte zur Folge, dass die von Altdorf aus nächsten Bahnhöfe an der Südbahn seinerzeit etwa vier Kilometer (Ravensburg) beziehungsweise etwa drei Kilometer (Niederbiegen) entfernt lagen. Zwar war Altdorf 1849 mit 3267 Einwohnern nur etwa halb so groß wie das benachbarte Ravensburg, jedoch war der Ort durch die Benediktinerabtei Weingarten und die Basilika St.Martin seit jeher als Wallfahrtsort überregional bekannt., 1865–1888: Weingarten im Verkehrsschatten., 1865 nahm Altdorf den Namen der Benediktinerabtei an und wurde in Weingarten umbenannt. Parallel dazu erhielt der Ort das Stadtrecht verliehen. Gleichzeitig entwickelte sich Weingarten im Zuge der Industrialisierung in jener Zeit auch zu einem wichtigen Industriestandort. Insbesondere die ebenfalls 1865 gegründete Maschinenfabrik WeingartenAG –die heutige SchulerAG– sowie die im Jahr darauf eingerichtete Spinnerei spielten hierbei eine gewichtige Rolle. Durch die rasante Entwicklung stieg auch die Einwohnerzahl stark an, so lebten am 1. Dezember 1880 schon 5232 Menschen in der Stadt. Immer ungünstiger wirkte sich deshalb die fehlende Eisenbahnanbindung aus, die Stadt lag –im Gegensatz zu Ravensburg– auch weiterhin im Verkehrsschatten. Darüber hinaus gab es auch damals schon ein entsprechendes lokales Verkehrsbedürfnis zwischen Altdorf und Ravensburg. Schließlich besaß Weingarten ab 1868 eine 800 Mann starke Garnison, aber im Unterschied zu Ravensburg nur wenige industrielle Arbeitsplätze., Um die mangelhafte Situation zu verbessern, bemühte sich Weingarten deshalb nachträglich darum, durch den Bau einer als Nebenbahn ausgeführten Stichstrecke doch noch einen Anschluss an die Württembergische Staatsbahn zu erhalten. Treibende Kraft war hierbei der Weingartener Gewerbeverein mit seinem rührigen Schriftführer, dem evangelischen Lehrer Christoph Klein. Er konnte 1879 den Zürcher Eisenbahningenieur Theodor Lutz für das Projekt gewinnen. Bemerkenswerterweise wurde hierbei bereits die Strecke über den Frauentorplatz in Ravensburg geplant. Doch ergab eine kritische Untersuchung des Weingartener Stadtrates, dass Klein für seine in die Straße eingelassene Normalspurbahn technisch viel zu enge Radien und wirtschaftlich eine viel zu hohe Umschlagsmenge und damit Rendite kalkuliert hatte. So blieb es bei den Planungen., Nachdem das Königreich Württemberg das Interesse an der Bahn verlor, forcierte man alternativ den Bau einer Privatbahn. Privat betriebene Strecken waren damals noch ein recht neues Phänomen, zu jener Zeit gab es in Württemberg erst drei nicht-staatliche Bahnen. Dies waren die Kirchheimer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft seit 1864, die Ermsthalbahn-Gesellschaft seit 1873 und die Filderbahn-Gesellschaft seit 1884. Die Bahn nach Weingarten sollte schließlich die vierte Privatbahn Württembergs werden., Umplanung zur schmalspurigen Dampfstraßenbahn., Im Frühjahr 1886 stellten auch die auf dem Eisenbahnsektor tätigen Augsburger Ingenieure Theodor Lechner und Viktor Krüzner von der \\"Lokalbahnbau- und Betriebsunternehmung Lechner &amp; Krüzner\\" ein entsprechendes Verkehrsbedürfnis zwischen den beiden aufstrebenden Städten Ravensburg und Weingarten fest, dem die Errichtung einer Dampfstraßenbahn Rechnung tragen könnte. Im Oktober 1886 richtete das Unternehmen daher ein Gesuch für eine Projektierungskonzession zum Bau der Bahn an die Regierung des Königreiches Württemberg., 1887 legten die beiden Ingenieure schließlich den Stadtverwaltungen von Ravensburg und Weingarten ein Konzept für eine meterspurige Schmalspurbahn vor. Sie sollte vom Ravensburger Bahnhofsvorplatz aus über die Schussenstraße zum Frauentorplatz, danach geradewegs in der Staatsstraße Ulm–Friedrichshafen bis zur Scherzachbrücke in Weingarten führen. Dort wollten Lechner und Krüzner den scharfen Knick um das damalige Forst- und heutige Jugendhaus herum nicht mitmachen und planten das Gleis von der Haltestelle Stadtösch (später Lamm) geradewegs durch den Obstgarten des Sonnenwirts zur Endstation an der Kreuzung Waldseer Straße/Schloßstraße, heute Abt-Hyller-Straße beziehungsweise Charlottenplatz. Im Gegensatz zu den wenige Jahre zuvor gescheiterten Normalspurplanungen konnte sich diese Bahn problemlos den gegebenen Siedlungsachsen anpassen. Die Führung im öffentlichen Straßenraum erlaubte zudem, im Vergleich zu einer meist unabhängig trassierten klassischen Eisenbahn, niedrigere Bau- und Betriebskosten., Das Konzept von Lechner und Krüzner überzeugte die bürgerlichen Gremien der beiden beteiligten Städte sowohl in Bezug auf die Technik als auch die Rendite, wenngleich in Weingarten mehr als in Ravensburg, dort stand man der Bahn stets weniger aufgeschlossen gegenüber. Auch die Staatsregierung in Stuttgart stimmte zu, nachdem sie erkannte, dass die neue Bahn keine ernsthafte Gefahr für die Auslastung ihrer Strecke zwischen Ravensburg und Aulendorf darstellte. Dies war nicht selbstverständlich, weil im Königreich der Staat das Bahnmonopol besaß. Wenn er eine private Eisenbahn zuließ, dann nur unter der Bedingung, die Strecke nach einer bestimmten Anzahl von Betriebsjahren zurückkaufen zu können, und zwar zum aufsummierten Anlagewert., Die Bedingungen um Ravensburg und Weingarten waren so akzeptabel, dass Lechner und Krüzner den potenten Münchner Eisenbahn-Industriellen Georg Krauß für das Projekt gewinnen konnten. Er war Inhaber der Lokomotivfabrik Krauss &amp; Comp., die auf Lokalbahn-Lokomotiven spezialisiert war, und erkannte in der projektierten Strecke eine Chance seinen Absatz zu steigern. So gründeten Lechner, Krüzner und Krauß am 9. Februar 1887 die private Lokalbahn Aktien-Gesellschaft (LAG). Diese erhielt die Baugenehmigung für die neue Bahn und war zugleich Bauherr. Die Bauarbeiten begannen im August 1887, nach einer anderen Quelle erst am 3. September gleichen Jahres. Die Betriebskonzession erteilte der Württembergische Staat am 15. November 1887, die Konzessionierung von Privatbahnen unterlag damals noch dem jeweiligen Landesrecht., Frühzeit., Eröffnung., Die neue Bahn nach Weingarten sollte eigentlich schon am 22. Dezember 1887 feierlich eingeweiht werden, doch war das Gleis noch nicht fertiggestellt. Als dieses dann zum 29. Dezember 1887 als nächstem ausersehenen Termin geschehen war, konnte es vom zuständigen Beamten aus Stuttgart nicht besichtigt werden, weil ein Schneesturm es zentimetertief versinken lassen hat. So konnte der Personenverkehr schließlich erst am 6. Januar 1888 aufgenommen werden, wobei kein Eröffnungsfest mehr angesetzt wurde. Der Betrieb fand von morgens 6:50 Uhr bis abends 22:10 Uhr statt. Berücksichtigt wurde eine Mittagspause für das Personal, so dass insgesamt elf Kurse angeboten wurden. Die Fahrt über die Gesamtstrecke dauerte 20 Minuten und kostete in der III. Klasse auf Holzsitzen 20 Pfennig für Erwachsene und zehn Pfennig für Kinder bis zu zehn Jahren. Kinder unter drei Jahren durften kostenlos mitfahren, sofern sie keinen eigenen Sitzplatz beanspruchten. Die Fahrkarten galten jeweils einen Tag, für die Hin- und Rückfahrt musste der doppelte Preis entrichtet werden. Die Benutzung der mit Polstersitzen ausgestatteten II. Klasse wiederum war um die Hälfte teurer und blieb vor allem den Offizieren der Weingartener Garnison und ihren Angehörigen vorbehalten. Fahrkarten waren nur in Weingarten am Schalter erhältlich, an den übrigen Stationen verkaufte sie der Zugführer. Darüber hinaus fungierten aber sowohl in Ravensburg als auch in Weingarten einige Kaufleute und Wirtschaften als zusätzliche Verkaufsstellen., Die Aufnahme des öffentlichen Güterverkehrs folgte, über ein halbes Jahr nach Inbetriebnahme, am 15. August 1888. Die Frachten beförderte die LAG vornehmlich in den vorhandenen Halbgepäckwagen, die wenigen Güterwagen kamen nur selten zum Einsatz. Der Oberbau bestand aus Vignolschienen mit einem Metergewicht von 24,77 Kilogramm.

Ähnlich der sogenannten \\"Fernerkundung\\", ist der Schwerpunkt der Messmethodik die elektromagnetische Strahlung weit entfernter Objekte im gesamten Bereich des Spektrums, von Radiowellen über Infrarot, sichtbares Licht und Ultraviolettstrahlung bis hin zu Röntgen- und Gammastrahlung. Die Einfallsrichtung und physikalische Eigenschaften der Strahlung erlauben Rückschlüsse auf Eigenschaften der aussendenden oder Licht absorbierenden Himmelsobjekte., So liefern genaue Messungen der Richtung Informationen über Position und Entfernung, Bewegung und Struktur der betreffenden Himmelsobjekte, während Untersuchungen des Spektrums auf die chemische Zusammensetzung, Sterntemperatur, Magnetfelder und Entfernungsänderungen zum Beobachter hinweisen. Durch Fotometer kann die Leuchtkraft von Sternen bestimmt werden, aus deren zeitlicher Veränderung ihr Gleichgewichts-Status. Zusätzlich zur elektromagnetischen Strahlung liefern die auf der Erde nachweisbaren kosmischen Teilchen weitere Informationen. Für die Zukunft verspricht der Nachweis von Gravitationswellen neuartige Beobachtungen an Himmelsobjekten wie Neutronensternen oder Schwarzen Löchern., Ein zentrales Anliegen der beobachtenden Astronomie ist die Entwicklung geeigneter Instrumente und Detektoren. Die elektromagnetische Strahlung wird mit Hilfe von Teleskopen aufgefangen und fotografisch oder elektronisch aufgezeichnet. Fotometrie und digitale Astrofotografie ermöglichen die Messung der Helligkeit, Spektroskope durch Auswertung von Planeten-, Nebel- und Sternspektren wichtige Parameter der Astrophysik. Speziell an die Eigenschaften von Röntgen- oder Radiostrahlung angepasste Teleskopkonstruktionen erlauben die Untersuchung dieser Abschnitte des elektromagnetischen Spektrums. Der Nachweis und die nähere Untersuchung von Teilchen und von Gravitationswellen erfordern spezielle Detektoren., Grundlagen., Die Astronomie ist gegenüber anderen Naturwissenschaften insofern benachteiligt, als dass sie ihre Untersuchungsgegenstände nicht unter kontrollierten Bedingungen im Labor untersuchen kann. Auch eine direkte Untersuchung kommt nur für die uns nächsten Himmelsobjekte infrage, insbesondere den Mond und diejenigen Planeten und Planetenmonde, die bereits von irdischen Raumsonden besucht wurden oder deren Bruchstücke gelegentlich zur Erde fallen (z.B. Mars-Meteoriten). Die Astronomie ist daher weitgehend auf Beobachtungen angewiesen, insbesondere auf die Auswertung der elektromagnetischen Strahlung, die uns von fernen Himmelskörpern erreicht. Andrerseits bietet sie der Physik die Möglichkeit zur Erforschung von extrem energiereichen Vorgängen, die auf Erden nie möglich wäre., In Anbetracht ihrer besonderen Situation haben die Astronomen Techniken entwickelt, mit denen sich allein aus der Beobachtung systematische Rückschlüsse auf die Eigenschaften und die Entwicklung astronomischer Objekte ziehen lassen. Typischerweise steht für jede Art von Beobachtungsobjekt eine Vielzahl sichtbarer Beispiele zur Verfügung. Anstatt beispielsweise die Entwicklung eines einzelnen Sterns über Jahrmilliarden zu verfolgen, können die Astronomen unterschiedliche Sterne in verschiedenen Entwicklungsstadien beobachten, um den Entwicklungsweg der Sterne zu erforschen. Unter Zuhilfenahme des kosmologischen Prinzips kann aus Untersuchungen an näher gelegenen Beispielobjekten auf das Verhalten entfernter Objekte geschlossen werden., Es gibt verschiedene Möglichkeiten, Teilgebiete der Astronomie zu definieren. Die Bezeichnung „beobachtende Astronomie“ dient als Sammelbegriff für die diversen Techniken astronomischer Beobachtung. Für ihr Gegenstück, die Formulierung und Erforschung von physikalischen Modellen, durch die sich die Eigenschaften von Himmelsobjekten auf die bekannten physikalischen Gesetze zurückführen lassen, gibt es keine allgemein übliche Bezeichnung. Am ehesten kommt diese Rolle noch der theoretischen Astrophysik zu, in der diese Art von Modellbildung einen weiten Raum einnimmt, die sich allerdings zum Teil auch mit der theoretischen Grundlage astrophysikalischer Beobachtungstechniken befasst und sich damit mit der beobachtenden Astronomie überschneidet., Werden Teilbereiche der Astronomie über die Beobachtungsobjekte definiert, so gibt es jeweils Überschneidungen mit der beobachtenden Astronomie – zur Sonnenforschung beispielsweise gehören selbstverständlich die entsprechenden spezialisierten Beobachtungsmethoden; gleiches gilt für die Planetologie, die Stellarastronomie, die Astroteilchenphysik und die weiteren thematischen Teilbereiche. Eine weitere Verbreitung als der Oberbegriff haben die Bezeichnungen für diejenigen Teilbereiche der beobachtenden Astronomie, die nach den Bereichen des elektromagnetischen Spektrums benannt sind, in denen die Beobachtungen stattfinden: Radioastronomie, Infrarotastronomie, optische Astronomie, Ultraviolettastronomie, Röntgenastronomie und Gammaastronomie., Geschichte., Vor Erfindung des Teleskops., Der Beginn der beobachtenden Astronomie ist nicht eindeutig feststellbar. Manche Höhlenmalereien vor 20.000 Jahren könnten eine Art Sternbilder zeigen. Die alten Ägypter verwendeten seit etwa 3000 v. Chr. einen Kalender, der auf Beobachtungen des Sterns Sirius beruhte. Astronomische Aufzeichnungen sind von vielen Hochkulturen bekannt, beispielsweise den Maya und den Assyrern., Sternhelligkeiten und einfache Instrumente zur Positionsbestimmung von Himmelsobjekten finden sich bereits bei Hipparch und Ptolemaios im ersten Jahrtausend vor unserer Zeitrechnung; in verfeinerter Form wurden sie im ersten nachchristlichen Jahrtausend in der arabischen Astronomie angewandt. Auf den gleichen Prinzipien beruhten die im 16. Jahrhundert von Tycho Brahe verwendeten Beobachtungsgeräte. Mechanische Rechner, wie das Astrolabium, das seinen Weg ebenfalls von den Griechen über die arabische Astronomie in die mittelalterliche Astronomie fand, ermöglichten die Zeitbestimmung und die Voraussage von astronomischen Ereignissen, wie den Sonnenaufgang., 17. bis 19. Jahrhundert., Beginnend mit dem ersten dokumentierten astronomischen Einsatz eines Teleskops durch Galilei im Jahre 1609, folgt die Geschichte der beobachtenden Astronomie weitgehend der Entwicklungsgeschichte immer leistungsfähigerer Teleskope. Meilensteine waren dabei beispielsweise die Entwicklung des Spiegelteleskops durch Gregory, Cassegrain und Newton und die Konstruktion immer größerer Spiegelteleskope durch Herschel im 18. Jahrhundert oder Parsons im 19. Jahrhundert, bis hin zu Hales 100-Zoll-Teleskop (1917) am Mount-Wilson-Observatorium., Parallel zur technischen Entwicklung der Optik und Montage der Teleskope, ergaben sich weitere wichtige Fortschritte: Ab dem frühen 19. Jahrhundert hielt die Spektroskopie Einzug in die beobachtende Astronomie. Bereits im Jahre 1800 verwendete Herschel ein Prisma und ein Thermometer, um die Wärmewirkung der Sonnenstrahlen nachzuweisen – den Beginn der Infrarotastronomie. Einige Jahre später entdeckten Wollaston und Fraunhofer die Spektrallinien im Sonnenspektrum. Im Jahre 1852 veröffentlichte Stokes erste Beobachtungen des ultravioletten Sonnenlichts. Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts schlossen Bunsen und Kirchhoff aus diesen Linien auf die chemische Zusammensetzung der Sonne. Von diesem Zeitpunkt an, begann die Entwicklung immer genauerer astronomischer Spektrografen. Ab Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts gab der Einsatz fotografischer Methoden dem Fachgebiet eine neue Richtung und ermöglichte Beobachtungen von bis dahin unmöglicher Genauigkeit und Empfindlichkeit., 20. bis 21. Jahrhundert., Kennzeichnend für das 20. Jahrhundert war die Einführung elektronischer Mess- und Nachweisinstrumente und die Ausweitung der systematischen Beobachtungen auf weitere Wellenlängenbereiche des elektromagnetischen Spektrums. Mit den Beobachtungen von Jansky und Reber begann in den 1930er Jahren die Radioastronomie, die nach Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs, dank ausgemusterter militärischer Funk- und Radaranlagen, einen Boom erlebte. In den 1940er Jahren wurden erstmals Photomultiplier zur Helligkeitsbestimmung eingesetzt, gefolgt von ersten Versuchen der elektronischen Bilderfassung, und schließlich von den auch heute noch eingesetzten CCD-Detektoren., Zur Beobachtung in Wellenlängenbereichen, die von der Erdatmosphäre herausgefiltert werden, begann der Vorstoß in den Weltraum: erstmals 1946 für Ultraviolettbeobachtungen, mit einer von den Amerikanern von den Nazi-Deutschen erbeuteten V2-Rakete, und 1949 auf dieselbe Weise mit ersten Röntgenbeobachtungen außerhalb der Atmosphäre. Ab 1970 kreiste mit Uhuru der erste Röntgensatellit um die Erde, gefolgt im Jahre 1983 von IRAS, dem ersten Infrarot-Observatorium. Mit der sowjetischen Lunik 1 erkundete 1959 erstmals eine Raumsonde einen anderen Himmelskörper, den Mond; Landungen und erste Bilder der Mondrückseite folgten im gleichen Jahr. 1962 erreichte mit Mariner 2 die erste Sonde einen anderen Planeten, die Venus; in den darauf folgenden Jahrzehnten erreichten weitere Sonden alle großen Planeten des Sonnensystems., Die Astroteilchenphysik begann 1912 mit den Ballonfahrten von Victor Franz Hess, bei denen dieser erste Anzeichen für ionisierende Strahlen aus dem Kosmos fand. Allerdings wurde erst im Laufe der nachfolgenden Jahrzehnte klar, dass es sich dabei um schnelle Elementarteilchen handelt. Mit der Entwicklung immer besserer Teilchendetektoren wurden immer genauere Messungen der kosmischen Strahlung möglich. Ab 1983 begann der Bau großer Neutrinodetektoren, mit denen Sonnenneutrinos und mit den Neutrinos der Supernova 1987A auch erstmals von außerhalb unseres Sonnensystems stammende Neutrinos nachgewiesen wurden., Moderne Entwicklungen der beobachtenden Astronomie zielen auf erhöhte Präzision, eine noch bessere Ausnutzung und Verknüpfung der verschiedenen Bereiche des elektromagnetischen Spektrums, sowie auf die Sammlung immer größerer Mengen an grundlegenden Daten zu Sternen der Milchstraße und Galaxien im Universum. Hierzu gehören neue Satellitenobservatorien, wie das Weltraumteleskop Hubble, die Entwicklung von Techniken wie aktiver und adaptiver Optik und aber beispielsweise auch die Konstruktion hochempfindlicher Gravitationswellendetektoren, die einen völlig neuen Beobachtungsmodus erschließen sollen. Großprojekte wie LOFAR stellen große Ansprüche an die Computerinfrastruktur, sowohl beim Transport als auch bei der Verarbeitung und Speicherung der gesammelten Datenmengen., Beobachtungen., Himmelsbeobachtungen wurden sicher schon in der Steinzeit vorgenommen, denn auf manchen Höhlenmalereien finden sich Andeutungen von Sternbildern.

Die Art kommt auf Neuguinea, den vorgelagerten Inseln sowie auf der Kap-York-Halbinsel im Norden Australiens vor., Beschreibung., Der Grüne Baumpython zeichnet sich durch einen verhältnismäßig schlanken Körper aus, auf den relativ langen Schwanz entfallen etwa 14 % der Gesamtlänge. Der Kopf ist groß und deutlich vom Hals abgesetzt. Er ist auf der Oberseite posterior stark aufgewölbt, die Schnauze ist groß und eckig. Der Körper ist im Querschnitt dreieckig mit deutlich sichtbarer Wirbelsäule. Die Art erreicht eine Gesamtlänge von 150 bis 180 Zentimeter, große Weibchen erreichen eine Länge bis 200 Zentimeter. Die Größe variiert je nach Herkunftsgebiet. Das Gewicht hängt stark vom Ernährungszustand des Tieres ab. Männchen können etwa 1100 bis 1400 Gramm schwer werden, Weibchen bis 1600 Gramm, besonders große Exemplare bis 2200 Gramm. Die Weibchen sind, wie bei den meisten Schlangen, etwas größer und schwerer als die Männchen., Beschuppung., Das Rostrale ist groß, deutlich abgesetzt und oft so tief eingekerbt, dass die Schnauze vorn oft wie gespalten wirkt. Die Nasalia sind gewölbt und haben große, nach hinten und oben gerichtete Nasenlöcher. Die beiden Internasalia sind rund und durch mehrere kleinere Schuppen voneinander getrennt. Die Kopfoberseite zeigt sonst keine größeren Schuppen, zwischen den Augen können sich 20 kleine Schuppen befinden., In der Seitenansicht befinden sich zwischen dem Nasale und dem Auge 60 oder mehr kleine, unregelmäßig geformte Zügelschilde (Lorealia). Es gibt keine deutlich ausgebildeten Präocularia oder Postocularia; um das Auge liegen 11–19 kleine Schuppen und zwei Supralabialia grenzen von unten an das Auge. Die Anzahl der Supralabialia kann zwischen 12 und 16 liegen, die ersten zwei zeigen tiefe, schräge Labialgruben, die dritte zeigt eine flache Mulde. Die hinteren 6–7 der insgesamt 14–18 Infralabialia zeigen tiefe Labialgruben., Die Anzahl der Bauchschuppen (Ventralschilde) variiert zwischen 219 und 254, die Zahl der Subcaudalia zwischen 68 und 129 und die Anzahl der dorsalen Schuppenreihen in der Körpermitte zwischen 55 und 57. Neben dem Analschild können zwei in ihrer Ausprägung variable Aftersporne auftreten., Färbung., Die Grundfarbe adulter Tiere ist oberseits ein satter Grünton, der in vielen Schattierungen vorkommen kann, sehr selten treten auch rein blaue Exemplare auf. Auf diesem Grund sind etwa eine Schuppe breite, weiße Flecken verteilt, die häufig besonders konzentriert auf dem kielartigen Rücken auftreten und dort manchmal ein fast durchgehendes Band bilden. Gelegentlich sind diese Flecke zu größeren, flächigeren Flecken vereint. Die Färbung des Bauchs und der Lippen schwankt von beige-weiß bis hin zu gelb. Die Schwanzspitze ist bräunlich oder schwarz. Die Pupillen sind senkrecht geschlitzt und die Iris silberfarben., Ungewöhnlich ist die Umfärbung der Jungtiere (ontogenetischer Farbwechsel), wie sie auch bei einigen anderen Schlangenarten vorkommt. Als Jungtier in einem leuchtenden Gelb oder Rot bis Rot-Braun gefärbt, nehmen die Tiere erst im Alter von sechs bis zehn Monaten ihre endgültige Färbung an. Die Schwanzspitze ist hellgelb und wird zum Anlocken von Beutetieren benutzt. Dieses Verhalten nimmt mit zunehmendem Alter ab, konnte aber auch bei adulten Tieren beobachtet werden. Der komplette Farbwechsel kann aber auch innerhalb weniger Wochen vollzogen werden oder bei manchen Tieren auch 2 bis 3 Jahre dauern. Warum die Jungtiere so eine leuchtende Farbe haben, ist nicht gänzlich geklärt. Man vermutet, dass auf diese Weise eine optimale Tarnung im Licht- und Schattenspiel des Regenwaldes möglich ist oder dass verschiedene natürliche Feinde das Jungtier für eine giftige Pflanze halten., Verbreitung und Lebensraum., Das Verbreitungsgebiet des Grünen Baumpythons erstreckt sich auf die tropischen Regenwälder auf Papua-Neuguinea, dessen vorgelagerte Inseln sowie auf die Kap-York-Halbinsel in Australien. Es wurden Vorkommen bis 2.000 Meter über dem Meeresspiegel nachgewiesen. Als westlichster Fundort wird die Insel Gag verzeichnet, als östlichster Punkt wurde die Insel Normanby gemeldet, eine Neuguinea vorgelagerte Insel. Die Entfernung zwischen diesen beiden Punkten beträgt circa 3.000 Kilometer Luftlinie., In den Regenwaldgebieten ist keine Veränderung des Klimas in Zusammenhang mit der Jahreszeit zu verzeichnen. Die Niederschlagsmenge ist deutlich höher als die Verdunstungsrate und schwankt im Verbreitungsgebiet des Grünen Baumpythons standortbedingt zwischen 2.100 und 3.400mm pro Jahr. Entsprechend ist auch die relative Luftfeuchtigkeit sehr hoch und beträgt tagsüber 70 bis 85 Prozent und steigt nachts auf Werte von 95 bis 100 Prozent an. Die Temperatur schwankt tagsüber zwischen 27 und 32 Grad Celsius und sinkt nachts auf 22 bis 25 Grad ab., Verhalten., Der Grüne Baumpython verbringt den Großteil seines Lebens in Bäumen oder Sträuchern. Im Nordosten Australiens halten sich Jungtiere in Höhen bis maximal 10 m auf, während adulte Exemplare meist Bäume über die gesamte Höhe nutzen und oft in Höhen über 25 m festgestellt werden. In den Ruhephasen nehmen die Tiere eine charakteristische Stellung ein. Dabei hängt der Körper in mehreren engen Schlingen über einem Ast, wobei der Kopf in der Mitte aufliegt., Jagdweise und Ernährung., Die Art ist ein Lauerjäger. Die wesentliche Jagdstrategie ist das bewegungslose Warten an einer geeigneten Stelle, bis Beute in Reichweite kommt. Der Grüne Baumpython ist dabei sehr standorttreu, an einer geeigneten Stelle halten sich die Tiere bis zu 14 Tage lang auf. Bei der Lauerjagd formt der Python mit dem vorderen Körperdrittel in einer Ebene eine annähernde „8“, so dass er mit dem Kopf sehr schnell eine bestimmte Distanz überbrücken und zubeißen kann. Für Jungtiere beträgt diese Distanz etwa 10 cm, bei größeren Tieren etwa 40 cm., Detaillierte Untersuchungen zur Jagdaktivität und Ernährung wurden bisher nur im Nordosten Australiens durchgeführt. Die tageszeitliche Jagdaktivität war hier sowohl vom Geschlecht als auch von der Körpergröße abhängig. Jungtiere jagten überwiegend am Tag. Mit zunehmender Größe wurde die Jagdaktivität von beiden Geschlechtern immer stärker auf die Nacht verlegt. Männchen mit einer Kopf-Rumpf-Länge über 100 cm jagten fast ausschließlich nachts, Weibchen dieser Größe jagten noch zu 10–20 % am Tag. Das kleinräumige Jagdhabitat war alters- und tageszeitabhängig unterschiedlich. Jungtiere wurden niemals in Lauerposition am Boden angetroffen, immature und erwachsene Exemplare tagsüber in weniger als 1 % der Fälle. Nachts erfolgten bei immaturen Schlangen 15 % aller Nachweise in Lauerstellung auf dem Boden, bei adulten Tieren stieg dieser Anteil auf 29 %., Die Nahrung besteht vor allem aus kleinen Säugetieren und Echsen, daneben werden auch Vögel und Insekten gefressen. Über Zufallsbeobachtungen hinausgehende Daten zur Ernährung liegen bisher wiederum nur aus Nordostaustralien vor, dort wurde das Beutespektrum anhand von acht Kotproben und vier direkten Beobachtungen ermittelt. Hauptbeutetier immaturer und adulter Tiere war die zu den Mosaikschwanzratten gehörende \\"Melomys capensis\\", die in fünf der acht Kotproben nachgewiesen wurde, weitere Beutetiere waren ein unbestimmter Skink, zwei unbestimmte Vögel sowie zwei Schmetterlinge. Für Jungschlangen wurden einmal der Skink \\"Carlia longipes\\", ein unbestimmter Skink und ein Käfer als Beute nachgewiesen., Fortpflanzung., Wie alle Pythons ist auch der Grüne Baumpython eierlegend (ovipar). Er ist eine nichtsaisonale Schlange. Das bedeutet, dass die Paarung, die Eiablage und der Schlupf der Jungtiere zu jeder Zeit des Jahres erfolgen können. Die meisten Paarungen finden von September bis Ende Oktober statt. Wenn die Schlangen ihre Geschlechtsreife im Alter von zweieinhalb bis drei Jahren erreicht haben, begeben sie sich auf die Suche nach einem Geschlechtspartner. Trifft das Weibchen mehrere Männchen zur Paarung an, sind auch Mehrfachpaarungen mit wechselnden Geschlechtspartnern möglich. Weibchen stellen einige Zeit nach der erfolgreichen Paarung die Nahrungsaufnahme ein und beginnen mit der Suche nach einem geeigneten Eiablageplatz. Bevorzugt werden höher gelegene Höhlen in Bäumen aufgesucht, wobei aber jede versteckte Stelle, die genügend Schutz vor Feinden und ausreichende Feuchtigkeit bietet, als Brutplatz angenommen wird. Das Weibchen legt gegen Februar bis März, nach 70 bis 90 Tagen Trächtigkeit seine 5 bis 35 Eier im Versteck ab. Die Größe des Geleges hängt mit der Größe und dem Alter des Weibchens zusammen. Wie die meisten Pythonarten betreibt auch der Grüne Baumpython Brutpflege. Das Weibchen legt 45 bis 65 Tage lang seine Körperschlingen um das Gelege und hält mit kräftigen Muskelkontraktionen die Temperatur auf 29,5 Grad Celsius. Steigt die Temperatur darüber, lockert es die Schlingen und lässt Luft an die Eier. Die Weibchen fasten von der Paarung bis zum Schlupf der Jungtiere für einen Zeitraum von vier bis fünf Monaten. Die Männchen nehmen dagegen bereits nach der Paarung wieder Nahrung auf. In freier Natur lebende Tiere haben vermutlich nur alle zwei Jahre Nachwuchs. Bei einigen Weibchen kann es mit Beginn der Trächtigkeit zu einer Umfärbung ins Blaue oder Türkise kommen. Nach dem Schlupf der Jungtiere färben sie sich dann zurück in den ursprünglichen Zustand. Selten bleibt auch eine leicht blaue Färbung erhalten., In Gefangenschaft gehaltene Exemplare werden etwa 15 bis 20 Jahre alt. Die durchschnittliche Lebenszeit frei lebender Tiere ist unbekannt., Haltung., Aufgrund ihrer baumlebenden Lebensweise sollte \\"Morelia viridis\\" ein hohes Terrarium geboten werden. Zur Berechnung des Mindestmaßes sollte die Größe des Terrariums 0,75 × 0,5 × 1,0 (Länge × Tiefe × Höhe in Metern) mit der Länge des Tieres multipliziert werden, wobei die maximale Höhe auf 2 Meter begrenzt wird. Über die Richtigkeit dieses Mindestmaßes wird in Fachkreisen häufig diskutiert, weil auch in wesentlich kleineren Terrarien schon erfolgreich Baumpythons gehalten und nachgezogen wurden. Außerdem bringen zu große oder hohe Terrarien oft Nachteile mit sich. So wird z.B. die Beheizung des Terrariums erschwert, was zum Ausbleiben eines optimalen Temper: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Grüner Baumpython, Morelia viridis, Rautenpythons, Pythons, Schlange, baumbewohnend, Neuguinea, Australien, Färbung, Jagdweise"},{"prompt":"Там у нас на вокзале ничего такого нет.

Nach einem langwierigen kommunalpolitischen Entscheidungsprozess verband die französische Stadt Straßburg die Wiedereinführung der Tram 1994 mit einer urbanen Neugestaltung. Die in Nantes (seit 1985), Grenoble (seit 1987) und Straßburg gesammelten Erfahrungen trugen zum Neubau von Straßenbahnen auch in anderen französischen Städten wie Montpellier (2000) oder Nizza (2007) bei. Mittlerweile verkehren in der größten Stadt des Elsass sechs Straßenbahnlinien auf einem Streckennetz von 48,1 Kilometern Länge. Betreiber ist die \\"Compagnie des transports strasbourgeois\\" (CTS)., Bereits 1894 bis 1960 verkehrte in Straßburg eine elektrische Straßenbahn, die aus der 1878 eröffneten Pferdebahn entstanden war. Neben einem umfangreichen städtischen Netz bestanden mehrere Überlandstrecken. Der Niedergang dieses Straßenbahnbetriebes begann in den 1930er Jahren und endete 1960 mit der Stilllegung der letzten Strecken., Pferdebahn und Straßenbahn von 1878 bis 1960., Die Gesellschaft., Am 5. April 1877, als das Elsaß zu Deutschland gehörte, gründete sich die „Straßburger Pferde-Eisenbahngesellschaft“., Am 25. April 1888 änderte sie ihren Namen in „Straßburger Straßenbahngesellschaft“., Ab dem 14. Mai 1897 war der Elektrokonzern AEG Hauptaktionär der Straßenbahn, 1912 erwarb die Stadt Straßburg 51 % des Aktienkapitals, um die Interessen der Bevölkerung besser wahrnehmen zu können., Die heute noch bestehende \\"Compagnie des Transports Strasbourgeois\\" (CTS) entstand aus dieser Straßenbahngesellschaft., Stadtnetz., Französische Zeit bis 1870., Seit 1848 waren im öffentlichen Nahverkehr von Straßburg Pferdeomnibusse und Pferdedroschken eingesetzt worden. Die ersten beiden normalspurigen Strecken der Pferde-Eisenbahngesellschaft wurden 1878 kurz nacheinander eröffnet. Die erste führte bis zur Kehler Rheinbrücke, die zweite nach Hönheim. In der Innenstadt kamen Pferde zum Einsatz, in den Außenbezirken wurden die Züge mit kleinen Dampflokomotiven bespannt. Die Schweizerische Lokomotiv- und Maschinenfabrik (SLM) in Winterthur lieferte die ersten Anlagen der Pferdebahn., Deutsche Zeit 1871 bis 1918., Ab 1871 bis 1918 gehörten Straßburg und das Elsaß zu Deutschland., Bis 1885 wurden weitere Strecken in die Stadtviertel Königshofen, Robertsau und Neuhof sowie nach Wolfisheim eröffnet. Im gleichen Zeitraum entstanden mehrere Strecken im Stadtzentrum, so zum 1883 eröffneten „Centralbahnhof“., 1886 kam beim Bau der Strecke nach Grafenstaden erstmals die Meterspur zur Anwendung. Diese Strecke bildete den Abschluss der ersten Ausbauetappe., Den Auftrag zur Elektrifizierung der Pferdebahn erhielt am 14. Dezember 1894 die AEG. Vorgesehen war der elektrische Betrieb dreier Streckenabschnitte unter Beibehaltung der Normalspur. Im Mai 1897 sagte die AEG als neuer Hauptaktionär der Straßenbahngesellschaft die Umspurung und Elektrifizierung des gesamten Stadtnetzes zu. Dies kam einem Neubau des Netzes gleich. Hiervon betroffen war auch die Strecke zur Kehler Brücke: Am 14. März 1896 nahm die normalspurige Dampfstraßenbahn den Betrieb auf. Nachdem die Schiffsbrücke durch eine feste Rheinbrücke ersetzt wurde, konnte 1898 die Verbindung über den Rhein auf Meterspur bis nach Kehl verlängert und auf elektrischen Betrieb umgestellt werden., Noch vor 1900 waren Umspurung und Elektrifizierung im Stadtnetz abgeschlossen. In den Jahren 1900 und 1901 gingen Strecken in das Stadtviertel Kronenburg sowie zu den Vororten Lingolsheim und Breuschwickersheim in Betrieb. Im Stadtzentrum entstand nach der Jahrhundertwende eine als „Rundbahn“ bezeichnete Ringstrecke. Noch bis 1913 wurde das Straßenbahnnetz ergänzt, dann unterbrach der Erste Weltkrieg die Entwicklung., Französische Zeit ab 1919., Ende 1918 nach Kriegsende kam Straßburg mit dem Elsass zu Frankreich. Die Straßenbahngesellschaft wurde in „Compagnie des Tramways Strasbourgeois“ (CTS) umbenannt. Sie konnte 1919 zwei kürzere Neubaustrecken eröffnen., 1923 erhielt Wacken im Norden der Stadt einen Anschluss an die Straßenbahn., Die letzte größere Neubaustrecke war die 1927 eröffnete Strecke zur Route de Brumath in Schiltigheim., 1930 gingen im Stadtteil Cronenbourg ein neues Hauptdepot sowie eine Zentralwerkstätte in Betrieb. Das Stadtnetz erreichte nach kleineren Ergänzungen 1937 mit 82,7 Kilometern seine größte Ausdehnung. Die erste Autobuslinie verkehrte 1928 nach Wingertheim. Am 27. Mai 1939 kam der O-Bus als städtisches Verkehrsmittel hinzu., Überlandnetz., Deutsche Zeit bis 1918., Parallel zum Stadtnetz baute die Straßburger Straßenbahngesellschaft von 1886 bis 1909 ein Netz von meterspurigen Überlandbahnen mit einer Gesamtlänge von 194 Kilometern auf., Das Überlandnetz entstand aus der 1886 gleich in Meterspur angelegten Straßenbahn nach Grafenstaden. Am 6. November 1886 wurde diese Strecke ins 54 Kilometer südlich von Straßburg gelegene Markolsheim verlängert. Dort bestand eine Übergangsmöglichkeit zu der ebenfalls 1886 eröffneten Meterspurbahn ins 27 Kilometer entfernte Colmar. Diese von den Reichseisenbahnen in Elsaß-Lothringen betriebene Strecke bot damit eine Verbindung zur Colmarer Straßenbahn. Von 1907 bis 1914 bestand über Colmar eine durchgängige schmalspurige Verbindung bis zur Straßenbahn in Mülhausen, knapp hundert Kilometer südlich von Straßburg., Gleichzeitig mit der Markolsheimer Strecke ging 1886 eine 2,5 Kilometer lange Zweigstrecke von der Zwischenstation Boofzheim nach Rheinau in Betrieb. 1893 wurde auf der gegenüberliegenden Rheinseite durch die Eisenbahn-Bau- und Betriebsgesellschaft Vering &amp; Waechter die Lokalbahn Rhein–Ettenheimmünster eröffnet. Die geplante Verbindung beider Strecken scheiterte an dem nicht zustande gekommenen Bau einer Rheinbrücke; endgültig aufgegeben wurde das Projekt nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg, als der Rhein zur deutsch-französischen Grenze wurde., Eine zweite Zweigstrecke erschloss ab April 1883 Erstein, das von der Markolsheimer Strecke nur tangiert wurde. Die 5,5 Kilometer lange Strecke endete am Ersteiner Reichsbahnhof. Von besonderer Bedeutung war der Anschluss der Ersteiner Zuckerfabrik. Als am 21. November 1907 die Deutsche Eisenbahn-Betriebsgesellschaft eine Kleinbahn von Erstein über Oberehnheim nach Ottrott eröffnete, übernahm diese Gesellschaft vorübergehend den Betrieb der Ersteiner Querbahn. Die 19 Kilometer lange Strecke nach Ottrott blieb unrentabel, da sie nur wenige Dörfer erschloss. Auf Befehl der Obersten Heeresleitung (OHL) wurde die Bahn kurz nach Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges zur Gewinnung von Oberbaumaterial abgebaut., Im Nordwesten Straßburgs bestand ab dem 1. Oktober 1887 eine 15 Kilometer lange Verbindung nach Truchtersheim. Am 1. April 1908 wurde eine 21 Kilometer lange Strecke nach Westhofen eröffnet, die in Dingsheim von der Truchtersheimer Bahn abzweigte. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Überlandbahnen mied die Westhofener Bahn die geschlossenen Ortslagen. Bedeutung erlangte sie im Ausflugsverkehr, insbesondere zur Weinlese im Anbaugebiet um Westhofen und Marlenheim., Ab 1892 erschlossen Überlandstraßenbahnen auch das rechtsrheinisch um Kehl gelegene Hanauerland. Am 11. Januar 1892 wurde die Strecke von Kehl über Schwarzach nach Bühl eröffnet. Am 1. April 1898 folgte die Strecke von Kehl über Altenheim nach Ottenheim, wo Anschluss an die Lahrer Straßenbahn bestand. Ab 15.Juli 1898 wurde diese Strecke durch eine Verbindung von Altenheim nach Offenburg ergänzt. Im Mai 1901 vereinbarte die Straßburger Straßenbahngesellschaft mit der Lahrer Straßenbahn eine Betriebsgemeinschaft. Fortan gab es durchgehende Zugläufe, die ab Ottenheim über Lahr bis nach Seelbach im Schwarzwald verkehrten. Im Norden des Netzes wurde am 2. Mai 1909 von Schwarzach aus Rastatt, 60 Kilometer von Straßburg entfernt, erreicht., Innerhalb des Straßburger Stadtgebiets fuhren die Überlandzüge von zwei unterschiedlichen Bahnhöfen ab: Die Züge Richtung Markolsheim begannen im Lokalbahnhof unweit des Hospitaltors, und die Endstation der Züge Richtung Truchtersheim und Westhofen befand sich an der Markthalle in der Hausberger Straße. Richtung Hanauerland wurde im Kehler Nebenbahnhof abgefahren. Alle Überlandstrecken waren nach der Umspurung des Stadtnetzes ab 1898 miteinander verbunden. Diese Möglichkeit wurde im Güterverkehr und für innerbetriebliche Zwecke wie Fahrten zur Hauptwerkstatt in der Gutleutstraße genutzt. Das Überlandnetz wurde überwiegend mit Dampflokomotiven betrieben; für die beiden kurzen Zweigstrecken nach Erstein und Rheinau kamen Pferde zum Einsatz., Neben dem Personenverkehr bestand ein reger Güterverkehr. Besondere Bedeutung erlangte auf allen Strecken der Transport von Zuckerrüben zur Ersteiner Zuckerfabrik während der Rübenkampagne im Herbst. Für den Transport normalspuriger Güterwagen im Schmalspurnetz standen Rollwagen zur Verfügung. Übergangsmöglichkeiten zum normalspurigen Eisenbahnnetz gab es unter anderem in Neudorf im Süden Straßburgs, in Kehl, Bühl, Rastatt und Erstein sowie in Marlenheim an der Westhofener Bahn. Seltener war die Verladung schmalspuriger Güterwagen auf normalspurige Transportwagen. Sie fand Anwendung bei Transporten in den Kehler Hafen sowie beim Austausch von Wagen zwischen den verschiedenen Überlandstrecken. Bis 1960 wurden offene Güterwagen eingesetzt, um Müll aus der Stadt Straßburg zu einem Gelände südlich von Graffenstaden zu transportieren., Französische Zeit ab 1919., Nachdem Straßburg Ende 1918 französisch geworden war, wurde die Verbindung über die Rheinbrücke nach Kehl unterbrochen. Das Netz zerfiel in zwei fast gleich große Teile: 98,7Kilometer verblieben im Besitz der CTS, während 95,5Kilometer 1922 an die Republik Baden gingen, nachdem 1920 schon der CTS die Konzession für diese Strecken entzogen und die Betriebsführung an die Deutsche Reichsbahn gegeben worden war. 1923 übernahmen die Mittelbadischen Eisenbahnen (MEG) die rechtsrheinischen Strecken. Bis 1970 betrieb die MEG den Personenverkehr auf Teilabschnitten. Heute existiert noch eine Strecke bei Bühl, die auf Normalspur umgestellt dem Güterverkehr dient. Dabei handelt es sich um die Verbindung Bühl–Schwarzach–Stollhofen, wo sie sich nach Söllingen und Greffern verzweigte. Sie wurde im Sommer 1972 auf Regelspur umgebaut und – teilweise neu trassiert – für den Güterverkehr wieder in Betrieb genommen. Dieses kleine Netz von 15 km Länge stellt bis heute den SWEG-Betrieb Schwarzach dar. Grundlage dafür war die Bedienung des NATO-Flughafens Söllingen, a: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Schienenverkehr, Elsass, Spurweite, 1435 mm, Straßenbahnsystem, Frankreich, Verkehr, Straßburg, Tramway de Strasbourg, Renaissance der Straßenbahn"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Geschichte (Marokko), Geschichte (Westsahara), Marokkanisch-spanische Beziehungen, Marsch (Veranstaltung), Politische Veranstaltung 1975], Als Grüner Marsch () wird ein 1975 vom Staat Marokko im Rahmen des Westsaharakonflikts organisierter Marsch von 350.000 größtenteils unbewaffneten Menschen bezeichnet. Der Marschweg führte vom südlichen Marokko in die zu Spanien gehörende Kolonie Spanisch-Sahara, die heutige Westsahara, und sollte Spanien zur Übergabe der Kolonie an Marokko bewegen. Die Bezeichnung \\"Grün\\" rührt von der Farbe des Islam her., Ausgangslage., Vorgeschichte., Westsahara und Mauretanien sind koloniale Abgrenzungen eines traditionell \\"trab el-beidan\\" („Land der Weißen“, also der Bidhan) genannten Wüsten- und Savannengebietes, das sich vom Wadi Draa im Süden Marokkos bis zum Senegalfluss erstreckt. Die verschiedenen Stämme der Sahrauis in der Westsahara sind mit ihrer Sprache und Kultur Untergruppen der Bidhans. Ihr Lebensraum an der Atlantikküste gehörte seit dem letzten Drittel des 19. Jahrhunderts zum spanischen Einflussbereich. 1884 gründete eine private Gesellschaft als erste Siedlung an der Küste den Handelsposten Villa Cisneros (heute Ad-Dakhla). Im Juni 1900 legten Spanien und Frankreich die Grenzen für die Kolonie Río de Oro im Süden der heutigen Westsahara fest. Die Grenzen des nördlichen Teils, Saguia el Hamra, wurden in weiteren Verhandlungen mit Frankreich zwischen 1902 und 1912 mehrfach verschoben. Die Kolonie Spanisch-Sahara entstand 1924 aus der Vereinigung beider Gebiete., Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts waren die spanischen Händler und Militärs nur an wenigen Orten an der Küste präsent und drangen kaum ins Land vor. Die Sahrauis wehrten sich im Landesinnern gegen das koloniale Regime mit Überfällen \\"(Ghazzis)\\" auf Handelskarawanen. Eine effektive Kontrolle des gesamten Gebiets strengten die Spanier erst ab 1930 an, bei ihren „Befriedungsaktionen“ waren sie auf die Unterstützung französischer Truppen angewiesen. 1934 richteten die Spanier ihre erste Militärbasis in Smara, im nördlichen Zentrum des Landes ein., Im Februar 1956 wurde Spanien von den Vereinten Nationen (UN) aufgefordert, eine Meldung über die rechtliche Situation seiner Kolonien abzugeben. Mit einem Verwaltungstrick änderte daraufhin das Regime Francos den Status seiner Kolonien in Nordwestafrika und machte sie zu spanischen Provinzen. Die erste Resolution gegen diese Überseeprovinzen, deren kolonialer Charakter deutlich erkennbar war, verabschiedete die UN im Dezember 1965. Nur Portugal stimmte damals auf der Seite Spaniens ab., Bis in die 1950er Jahre blieb der antikoloniale Widerstand gering. 1956 hatte sich im abgelegenen Süden Marokkos eine Befreiungsarmee gegen die Regierung des marokkanischen Königs Mohammed V. etabliert. Dieser schlossen sich vermehrt Sahrauis an und verübten zahlreiche Anschläge auf Ziele in der Westsahara. In einer gemeinsamen \\"Operation Ouragan\\" im Februar 1958 – es waren 9000 spanische Soldaten und 60 Flugzeuge, auf französischer Seite 5000 Soldaten und 70 Flugzeuge im Einsatz – wurde die sahrauische Guerilla geschlagen. 1959 stellten sie ihre Anschläge ein. Anfang der 1960er Jahre konzentrierten sich die Beteiligten auf eine friedliche Lösung., Auf Antrag Marokkos und Mauretaniens war die Westsahara-Frage 1963 Verhandlungsgegenstand des Entkolonialisierungsausschusses der UN-Vollversammlung. Mit der Resolution 2072 vom 16. Dezember 1965 wurde die spanische Regierung unter General Franco aufgefordert, die Westsahara zu entkolonisieren und der Bevölkerung das Recht auf Selbstbestimmung zu gewähren., Marokko erhob jedoch eigene Ansprüche auf das Gebiet. Bereits 1957 hatte die marokkanische Regierung eine \\"Abteilung für Angelegenheiten der Sahara\\" gebildet. 1963 folgte die Bildung eines \\"Ministeriums für die Angelegenheiten Mauretaniens und der spanischen Sahara\\"., Spanien baute jedoch, entgegen dem weltweiten Trend zur Entkolonialisierung, die Verwaltung der Kolonie noch aus und bemühte sich um die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung. So begann 1962 die Ausbeutung des Phosphatvorkommens von Bou Craa., Auf den größer werdenden internationalen Druck hin erklärte sich Spanien 1967 grundsätzlich bereit, in der Westsahara ein Referendum zur Frage des zukünftigen Status des Gebiets durchzuführen. Die tatsächliche Durchführung wurde jedoch verzögert. 1973 gründete sich die westsaharische Befreiungsbewegung POLISARIO, die einen bewaffneten Kampf gegen die spanische Kolonialmacht aufnahm. Im selben Jahr bot die Regierung Franco der Stammesversammlung ein Autonomiestatut an. Ziel der spanischen Politik war es, einen möglichst großen Einfluss auf die Westsahara zu behalten und einen Anschluss an Marokko zu verhindern., 1974 nahm Marokkos König Hassan II. von der bisherigen Forderung nach einem Referendum Abstand und forderte den Anschluss des Gebiets, ohne jegliche Volksabstimmung, an sein Land. Am 21. August 1974 teilte Spanien gegenüber der UNO mit, dass es beabsichtige, das Referendum in der ersten Hälfte des Jahres 1975 durchzuführen. Neben unternommenen diplomatischen Bemühungen verlegte Marokko daraufhin Truppen in das Grenzgebiet zur Westsahara. Spanien verstärkte gleichfalls seine militärische Präsenz, sowohl in der Kolonie als auch auf den nahe gelegenen Kanarischen Inseln., Vermutlich bereits während eines arabischen Gipfels in Rabat im Oktober 1974 trafen Marokko und Mauretanien ein Geheimabkommen, wonach die Westsahara zwischen den beiden Staaten aufgeteilt werden sollte. Von politischen Beobachtern wird vermutet, dass auch eine Entscheidung, das Gebiet notfalls mit Gewalt einzunehmen, ebenfalls in diesem Zeitraum gefallen war., Auf die Initiative Marokkos und Mauretaniens verabschiedeten die Vereinten Nationen dann die Resolution 3292, in welcher der Internationale Gerichtshof um die Erstellung eines Gutachtens gebeten wurde. Spanien wurde aufgefordert, das Referendum zu verschieben., Das Gutachten kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Bevölkerung der Westsahara selbst über den Status entscheiden sollte und das Gebiet nicht bereits zum Staatsgebiet Marokkos oder Mauretaniens gehört., Innenpolitische Situationen., Innenpolitisch standen die marokkanische Regierung und Hassan II. auch wegen der Westsahara-Frage unter erheblichem Druck. Die Opposition warf Hassan II. eine zu zögerliche Vorgehensweise vor und bemängelte fehlende Initiative und Kampfbereitschaft. Der Grüne Marsch ermöglichte daher der marokkanischen Regierung, hier auch innenpolitisch die Initiative zu ergreifen, die politischen Kräfte hinter einer nationalen Idee zu sammeln und die Opposition zu schwächen., In Spanien war der Diktator General Franco schwer erkrankt. Das Ende seiner Regierungszeit deutete sich an, so dass die innenpolitische Situation in Spanien von Instabilität geprägt war. Dem designierten Nachfolger Juan Carlos waren gerade die Befugnisse als Staatsoberhaupt übertragen worden. Franco starb am 20. November 1975, nur wenige Tage nach dem Marsch., Der Marsch., Vorbereitung., Ankündigung und Planung., Mit einer Erklärung König Hassans II. vom 16. Oktober 1975 versuchte Marokko, das Gutachten des Internationalen Gerichtshofes in seinem Sinne zu interpretieren. Das Gutachten hatte für die Vergangenheit \\"rechtliche Bande\\" zwischen Marokko und der Westsahara festgestellt. Hassan II. leitete daraus eine Abhängigkeit des Gebiets ab und vertrat den Standpunkt, dass nach Islamischem Recht Marokko einen Anspruch auf die Westsahara habe. In dieser Erklärung kündigte Hassan II. die Durchführung eines Friedensmarsches \\"(Massirah)\\" von 350.000 unbewaffneten Menschen von Marokko in die Westsahara an. Der Marsch sollte am 24. Oktober 1975 beginnen., Der Plan für den Marsch stammte von Hassan II. selbst. Bereits seit ungefähr zwei Monaten hatte die marokkanische Regierung, unter strengster Geheimhaltung, Vorbereitungen für den Marsch getroffen. Der König gab bekannt, dass geplant sei, 350.000 unbewaffnete Menschen bei Tarfaya im Süden Marokkos, in der Nähe der Grenze zur Spanischen Sahara, zu versammeln. Mit ihm als König an der Spitze solle der Zug über die Grenze nach El Aaiún, der Hauptstadt der Westsahara, ziehen und so die Anerkennung des marokkanischen Anspruchs erreichen. Der Marsch sollte danach innerhalb von 15 Tagen die ungefähr 160 Kilometer lange Strecke von der Grenze bis nach El Aaiun und zurück überwinden. Sämtliche Provinzen Marokkos wurden aufgerufen, sich mit einem bereits genau berechneten Kontingent am Marsch zu beteiligen., Reaktion der internationalen Staatengemeinschaft., Die internationale Staatengemeinschaft war angesichts der ungewöhnlichen Ankündigung überrascht. Die Staaten der Arabischen Liga beurteilten die Situation unterschiedlich. Elf der zwanzig Mitgliedsstaaten begrüßten das Vorhaben, so Ägypten und Saudi-Arabien, und boten zum Teil Unterstützung an. Sieben Mitglieder, unter ihnen Syrien und der Irak, positionierten sich nicht eindeutig. Auf deutliche Ablehnung stieß das Vorhaben bei Algerien und den sozialistischen Ländern. Hier äußerten sich vor allem die Sowjetunion und die DDR ablehnend. Die USA und Frankreich verhielten sich neutral., Mauretanien begrüßte die Ankündigung. Der Aufforderung Marokkos, eine ähnliche Aktion von mauretanischem Gebiet aus einzuleiten, kam man jedoch nicht nach., Spanien zeigte sich durch die Ankündigung beunruhigt und wandte sich an den UN-Sicherheitsrat. Dieser verabschiedete nach zweitägigen Beratungen am 22. Oktober die Resolution 377, die jedoch keine konkreten Maßnahmen enthielt und lediglich den UN-Generalsekretär zu Gesprächen mit den Beteiligten und zu einem Bericht gegenüber dem Sicherheitsrat aufforderte. Der bereits schwer erkrankte, aber zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch die spanischen Amtsgeschäfte führende General Franco entsandte José Solis Ruiz nach Rabat, um dort Verhandlungen mit Hassan II. zu führen. Im Ergebnis wurde vereinbart, den Marschbeginn zu vertagen. Marokko verpflichtete sich, einen Sonderbotschafter nach Madrid zur Fortsetzung der Verhandlungen zu entsenden., Während eine erste Gruppe von 20.000 Menschen aus der marokkanischen Provinz Ksar-Es-Souk nach Tarfaya aufgebrochen war, begann Spanien, die betroffenen Gebiete von der Zivilbevölkerung mit der \\"Operación golondrina\\" zu evakuieren., Verhandlungen., Wie mit Spanien vereinbart, teilte Marokko am 24. Oktober mit, dass der Marsch erst am 28. Oktober stattfinden würde. Am selben Tag traf der marokkanische Außenminister Ahmed Laraki zu weiteren Gesprächen in Madrid ein. Seine spanischen Verhandlungspartner waren der Regierungschef Carlos Arias Navarro und der Außenminister Pedro Cortina Mauri. Der Inhalt der Gespräche war geheim. Die Verhandlungen wurden am 26. Oktober zunächst unterbrochen., Laraki reiste zu Informationsgesprächen zu Hassan II. und dem mauretanischen Präsidenten Moktar Ould Daddah, bevor die Gespräche am 28. Oktober weiter geführt wurden. An diesen Gesprächen nahmen nun auch eine Delegation a: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Geschichte, Marokko, Westsahara, Marokkanisch-spanische Beziehungen, Grüner Marsch, Politische Veranstaltung, Veranstaltung, Islam, Kolonie, Autonomie"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Spurweite 1435 mm, Straßenbahn Timișoara, Straßenbahnsystem (Rumänien)], Die Straßenbahn Timișoara ist nach der Straßenbahn Bukarest der zweitgrößte Straßenbahnbetrieb in Rumänien. Die gesamte Netzlänge beträgt 33,1Kilometer, es werden insgesamt 69Haltestellen bedient. Aktuell verkehren in Timișoara die sieben Linien 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 und 9, die zusammen sieben der insgesamt zehn Stadtbezirke abdecken. Lediglich Freidorf, Ghiroda Nouă und Plopi haben keinen Straßenbahnanschluss. Allerdings besaß zumindest Freidorf bis 2009 eine Schienenverbindung, wird aber seither im dauerhaften Schienenersatzverkehr bedient. Ebenfalls durch die Autobusse ersetzt wird seit dem 2. September 2017 die Linie5., Das Netz ist normalspurig und geht auf die 1869 eröffnete Pferdebahn zurück, die 1899 elektrifiziert und erweitert wurde. Ferner war die Straßenbahn Timișoara der erste Straßenbahnbetrieb auf dem Gebiet des heutigen Rumänien, später die zweite elektrisch betriebene Straßenbahn in Rumänien., Betreiberin der Straßenbahn ist die Aktiengesellschaft Societatea de Transport Public Timișoara, kurz S.T.P.T. Das städtische Schienennetz bildet traditionell das Rückgrat des lokalen öffentlichen Personennahverkehrs, ergänzt wird es seit 1942 durch den Trolleybus Timișoara sowie von 1894–1899, 1926–1929, 1934–1948 beziehungsweise seit 1954 durchgehend durch diverse Autobuslinien. Jährlich befördern die drei städtischen Verkehrsmittel zusammen 90Millionen Passagiere, davon entfallen 52Millionen auf die Straßenbahn., Besonderheiten des Betriebs sind beziehungsweise waren die verschiedenen Ringlinien seit 1936, der Güterverkehr mit Staatsbahnwagen auf Straßenbahngleisen von 1899 bis 1904 und von 1916 bis 1993, der Einsatz von Zwillingstriebwagen von 1931 bis 1988, die Verwendung von Zweirichtungswagen mit einseitigen Türen von 1966 bis 1980 sowie die Signalisierung mittels roter Liniennummern zwischen 1978 und 1997, außerdem die früher praktizierte Trassierung zweigleisiger Strecken nach Fahrtrichtung getrennt am Straßenrand oder links und rechts eines breiten Mittelstreifens., Ferner stellten die Werkstätten der Straßenbahn Timișoara von 1914 an auch selbst Straßenbahnwagen für den eigenen Bedarf her. So ist beispielsweise der früher in Rumänien weit verbreitete Typ Timiș 2 eine Eigenentwicklung der Straßenbahn Timișoara. Dessen Fertigung – unter anderem für zahlreiche andere rumänische Straßenbahnbetriebe – übertrug die Verkehrsgesellschaft jedoch 1977 dem Maschinenbau-Unternehmen \\"Electrometal Timișoara\\", womit die Eigenproduktion endete., Netzentwicklung und Liniengeschichte., Die Pferdebahnzeit (1869–1899)., Die von der 1867 gegründeten und ursprünglich \\"Temesvári Közúti Vaspálya Társaság\\" (TKVT) genannten privaten Aktiengesellschaft, die deutsche Entsprechung lautete \\"Temesvárer Straßen-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft\\", ins Leben gerufene Straßenbahn in Timișoara war bei ihrer Eröffnung am 8. Juli 1869 unter den ersten Pferdestraßenbahnen weltweit. Sie verkehrte zunächst nur zwischen der Piața Sfântul Gheorghe in der Inneren Stadt und der Fabrikstadt, ab dem 25. Oktober gleichen Jahres dann auf einer zweiten Linie auch zwischen der Inneren Stadt und dem linken Bega-Ufer in der Josefstadt. Vollendet wurde sie am 29. September 1871 mit der Verlängerung der etwas jüngeren Linie zum heutigen Nordbahnhof. Betriebliche Besonderheiten waren das Zwei-Klassen-System und der Güterverkehr für die heutige \\"Timișoreana\\"-Brauerei., Umstellung auf elektrischen Betrieb (1899)., Zum Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts stieg das Verkehrsbedürfnis im damaligen Temesvár stark an und konnte mit der Pferdebahn nur noch bedingt befriedigt werden. So hatte sich die Einwohnerzahl der Stadt während der Betriebszeit der Pferdebahn nahezu verdoppelt. Lebten 1869 noch 32.725 Einwohner in Temesvár, so waren es 1900 bereits 59.229 Einwohner. Damit gehörte die Banater Hauptstadt zu den größten Kommunen der österreichisch-ungarischen Doppelmonarchie. Ferner galt eine pferdebetriebene Straßenbahn gegen Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts als nicht mehr zeitgemäß. In Budapest, der Hauptstadt Transleithaniens, fuhren beispielsweise bereits seit 1887 elektrische Straßenbahnen, in Wien, der Hauptstadt Cisleithaniens, seit 1897. Aber auch vier ungarische Provinzstädte verfügten bereits vor Temesvár über eine \\"Elektrische\\" – dies waren Pozsony (seit 1895) sowie Miskolc, Szabadka und Szombathely (jeweils seit 1897). In der österreichischen Reichshälfte fuhr man damals – außer in der Hauptstadt – sogar schon in über zehn Städten mit Strom., Auch die Erweiterung des Netzes gewann zunehmend an Dringlichkeit. Insbesondere die Bewohner der damals noch Mayerhöfe genannten Elisabethstadt – welche die Pferdebahn nur am westlichen Rand tangierte – forderten seit längerem einen eigenen Straßenbahnanschluss. Der Stadtbezirk war 1890 nach Temesvár eingemeindet worden. Ebenso dringlich war die verbesserte Anbindung des peripher gelegenen Fabrikstädter Bahnhofs, seit 1876 Temesvárs zweiter Bahnhof. Die heute Gara de Est genannte Station lag in damals noch unbebautem Gelände nördlich des Fabrikstädter Zentrums – von der zentral gelegenen Piața Traian aus über einen Kilometer entfernt – und war seit 1895 durch eine Pferdeomnibuslinie angebunden., Die Ausbaupläne forcierte vor allem auch die Stadtverwaltung unter Führung des damaligen Bürgermeisters Karl Telbisz. Die Kommune nahm bereits Ende 1895 diesbezügliche Verhandlungen mit der Temesvári Közúti Vaspálya Társaság auf, die schon am 15. November 1895 ein entsprechendes Konzept vorstellte. Infolgedessen beschloss das Unternehmen in der Gesellschafterversammlung vom 20. Juli 1897 die Elektrifizierung und firmierte ab dem 21. Juli 1897 unter der neuen Bezeichnung \\"Temesvári Villamos Városi Vasút Részvénytársaság\\", kurz \\"TVVV\\". Die offizielle deutsche Entsprechung, die Protokollierung des Unternehmens war zweisprachig, lautete \\"Temesvárer Elektrische Stadtbahn Actiengesellschaft\\". Für die Elektrische erteilten die Behörden – ebenfalls 1897 – auch eine neue Konzession, diese war bis zum 31. Dezember 1959 befristet.&lt;ref name=\\"Jahrbuch 1902/03\\"&gt;Rudolf Hanel (Hrsg.): \\"Jahrbuch der Eisenbahnen und Transport-Unternehmungen Österreich-Ungarns 1902/03.\\" Wien 1902, S.332.&lt;/ref&gt;, Im Juli 1898 begannen schließlich die Bauarbeiten für das neue Liniennetz. Die Finanzierung besorgte die \\"Ungarische Eisenbahn-Verkehrs-Actiengesellschaft\\" aus Budapest, ungarisch \\"Magyar Vasúti Forgalmi Részvénytársaság\\". Mit der Erstellung der elektrischen Anlage waren die Vereinigte Elektrizitäts AG vorm. B. Egger &amp; Co. (VEAG) aus Wien und die Electricitäts-Gesellschaft Felix Singer &amp; Co. aus Berlin gemeinsam betraut. Das vergleichsweise kleine Unternehmen Singer rüstete damals auch die Straßenbahnen in Bamberg (1897), Liegnitz (1898), Thorn (1899) und Stralsund (1900) elektrisch aus. Zur Anwendung kamen jeweils Stangenstromabnehmer mit Kontaktrolle des Systems \\"Dickinson\\", die eine seitliche Abweichung von bis zu dreieinhalb Metern erlaubten. Beim Bau der Oberleitung fanden an exponierten Stellen wie vor dem Gara de Nord und auf der Piața Libertății verzierte Stahlrohrmaste von Mannesmann Verwendung, ansonsten gewöhnliche Holzmaste beziehungsweise in engeren Straßen Querdrähte und Oberleitungsrosetten. Der Fahrdraht hatte einen Durchmesser von acht Millimetern und war in einer Höhe von 5,5 Metern über der Schienenoberkante montiert. Die Holzmaste bewährten sich jedoch nicht, weil sie zu schnell verrotteten. Sie mussten deshalb bis 1904 vollständig durch Stahlgittermaste ersetzt werden., Am 30. Juni 1899 fand die erste Probefahrt statt, bevor am Donnerstag, den 27.Juli 1899 schließlich der reguläre elektrische Betrieb begann. Damit endete – abgesehen von einem nächtlichen Kurs zum Gara de Nord und zurück – der Pferdebahnverkehr in Temesvár. Auch die Pferdeomnibusse stellten damals endgültig ihren Dienst ein. Gleichzeitig wuchs das Schienennetz von zuletzt 6,636 beziehungsweise 6,672 auf 10,315Kilometer. Statt der beiden Pferdebahn-Radiallinien und der ergänzenden Pferdeomnibuslinie – die alle drei keine Nummern trugen – verkehrten fortan fünf elektrisch betriebene Linien, darunter zwei Durchmesserlinien und drei Radiallinien:, Die Endstelle \\"Dunagőzhajózási ügynökség\\" der Linie II war nach der damaligen Agentur der Ersten Donau-Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft benannt, die sich kurz nach der Einmündung der Strada Mangalia – die damals noch \\"Csillag utcza\\" hieß – in das Splaiul Tudor Vladimirescu befand. Allerdings konnte die circa 250 Meter lange Strecke zwischen der Király hid und der Agentur, wie auch der Abschnitt Piața Traian – Parcul Uzinei, erst einige Tage nach Eröffnung der Elektrischen in Betrieb gehen, weil die Bauarbeiten auf diesen beiden Abschnitten am Tag der Umstellung noch im Gang waren., Die Linienkennzeichnung mittels römischer Zahlen diente lediglich dem internen Gebrauch. Beschildert wurden die Wagen seitlich mittels am Wagendach angebrachten Wechselsteckschildern mit dem Linienverlauf in ungarischer Sprache und frontal mit einem farbigen Liniensignal mit der jeweiligen Linienkennfarbe. Als \\"Tagessignal\\" existierte hierbei eine kreisrunde weiße Blechscheibe mit einem farbigen Diagonalbalken, die rechts oben am Wagendach angebracht war. Als \\"Nachtsignal\\" für den Betrieb bei Dunkelheit diente hingegen der mittig unterhalb der Windschutzscheibe montierte Frontscheinwerfer, auf den ein durchscheinender farbiger Diagonalbalken aufgesetzt war. Die Kennzeichnung mittels Linienfarben war seinerzeit auch noch in vielen anderen Städten üblich. Sie sollte zum einen Analphabeten und zum anderen Angehörigen nationaler Minderheiten die Unterscheidung der verschiedenen Routen erleichtern, damals gehörte nur ein Drittel der Einwohner Temesvárs der ungarischen Titularnation an., Der Großteil des elektrisch betriebenen Netzes waren dabei komplett neu errichtete Trassen. Dazu zählte auch die neue Streckenführung in der Inneren Stadt, die quer über die zentrale Piața Libertății führte. Auf der Piața Sfântul Gheorghe, dem bisherigen Betriebsmittelpunkt der Pferdebahn, befand sich eine Haltestelle mit Ausweiche sowie ein Stumpfgleis.

Dabei werden die Makromoleküle der Kohle durch Wasserstoff bei hohen Drücken und Temperaturen zu kleineren Molekülen abgebaut. Die Rohstoffbasis bestand anfangs aus Braunkohle, die durch Kohlevergasung sowohl den zur Hydrierung notwendigen Wasserstoff lieferte als auch die Kohlenstoffbasis für die Produkte bildete. Später erweiterten Steinkohle, Teere und Teeröle die Rohstoffpalette., Als Produkte entstehen gasförmige und flüssige Kohlenwasserstoffe, die als Kraft- und Schmierstoffe dienen. In der Zeit zwischen 1910 und 1925 entwickelte der deutsche Chemiker Friedrich Bergius die Grundlagen des Prozesses. Die kommerzielle Verfahrens- und Katalysatorentwicklung erfolgte ab 1925 durch die BASF unter der Projektleitung von Matthias Pier., Die I.G. Farben baute 1927 in Leuna die erste Hydrieranlage nach dem Bergius-Pier-Verfahren, ab Mitte der 1930er Jahre ordnete das Deutsche Reich im Rahmen der Autarkiebestrebungen den Auf- und Ausbau von weiteren Hydrierwerken an. Ab Mitte der 1930er Jahre waren die Anlagen im Deutschen Reich im Rahmen der Autarkiebestrebungen von besonderer Bedeutung. Während des Zweiten Weltkrieges deckte das Bergius-Pier-Verfahren einen Großteil des Kraftstoffbedarfs der deutschen Wehrmacht., In der Nachkriegszeit verdrängten preiswerte Produkte auf Basis von Erdöl die kohlestämmigen Erzeugnisse, der Betrieb der Hydrierwerke wurde eingestellt. Engpässe in der Erdölversorgung während der Ölkrise in den 1970er Jahren verstärkten das Interesse an dem Verfahren wieder. Eine großtechnische Umsetzung erfolgte jedoch in der westlichen Welt nicht. Im Gegensatz dazu begann das an Kohlevorräten reiche China 2003 den Bau eines Hydrierwerks in der Inneren Mongolei, das Kraftstoffe für den chinesischen Markt produziert., Die Nobelstiftung vergab für die Entwicklung des Verfahrens 1931 den Nobelpreis für Chemie an Friedrich Bergius zusammen mit Carl Bosch „für ihre Verdienste um die Entdeckung und Entwicklung der chemischen Hochdruckverfahren“., Geschichte., Im Jahr 1869 führte der französische Chemiker Marcelin Berthelot erste Versuche zur Gewinnung von flüssigen Kohlenwasserstoffen aus Kohle durch. Dazu ließ er einen Iodwasserstoffüberschuss bei Temperaturen von 270°C auf Kohle einwirken. Iodwasserstoff zerfällt bei dieser Temperatur in die Elemente und lieferte den Wasserstoff für die Kohlehydrierung. Die Reaktion führte zur Bildung flüssiger Kohlenwasserstoffe, erlangte jedoch keine technische Bedeutung. Berthelots Versuche initiierten dem ungeachtet weitere Forschungen auf dem Gebiet der Kohlehydrierung. Um 1900 etablierte Paul Sabatier die katalytische Hydrierung als neues chemisches Verfahren, für das er 1912 mit dem Nobelpreis in Chemie ausgezeichnet wurde. Die Erkenntnis, dass Metalle wie Nickel oder Eisen die Hydrierung organischer Stoffe katalysieren, sowie die Arbeiten von Wladimir Nikolajewitsch Ipatjew über Hochdruckhydrierungen, bildeten eine wichtige Grundlage für Bergius Arbeiten., In Deutschland gründete die Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft unter anderem zu diesem Zweck das Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Kohlenforschung., Mit diesen Worten beschrieb der Nobelpreisträger Emil Fischer 1912 anlässlich der Gründung dieses Instituts seinen Wunsch, ein „fundamentales Problem der Heizstoffindustrie“ zu lösen, besonders in Bezug auf Deutschland und dessen Mangel an flüssigen fossilen Brennstoffen. Den von Fischer gewünschten Reduktionsprozess, der in die chemische Technik überführt werden konnte, entwickelte schließlich Friedrich Bergius., Anfänge in Hannover und Essen., Als Privatdozent für Reine und Angewandte Physikalische Chemie an der Königlich-technischen Hochschule Hannover, wo er über den Inkohlungsprozess habilitiert hatte, führte Bergius schon 1910 Hydrierversuche an synthetischer Kohle durch. Bereits erste Tests führten zu reproduzierbaren Ergebnissen, die bei Temperaturen von 400 bis 450°C und einem Wasserstoffdruck von 150bar in 80%iger Ausbeute gasförmige und flüssige Kohlenwasserstoffe lieferten. Bergius erhielt 1913 ein Patent für seine Erfindung., Die Überführung des Verfahrens vom Labor in eine Großanlage erwies sich als schwierig und erforderte erhebliche finanzielle Mittel. Durch Kontakte zu Karl Goldschmidt trat Bergius in die Leitung der Chemischen Fabrik Goldschmidt in Essen ein, welche die Verfahrensentwicklung zunächst finanzierte. In der Zeit nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg fehlten jedoch die finanziellen Mittel für die Entwicklung eines geeigneten Katalysators, was in der Folge zur Beendigung der Zusammenarbeit führte., Gründung der I.G. Farben., Der steigende Motorisierungsgrad sowie die beginnende Umstellung der Schifffahrt und des Schienenverkehrs auf flüssige Kraftstoffe ließen die Gewinnung von Kraft- und Schmierstoffen durch die Kohlehydrierung als eine gewinnträchtige Einnahmequelle erscheinen. Die Anhörungen vor dem Federal Oil Conservation Board zeigten im Jahr 1926, dass man sich schon damals um die Erschöpfung der Erdölreserven Sorge machte. Die im Gegensatz dazu reichen Braun- und Steinkohlevorkommen dagegen schienen auf Jahrhunderte die Versorgung mit Kraftstoffen sichern zu können., Durch die technischen und kommerziellen Erfolge der Hochdruckchemie beim Haber-Bosch-Verfahren, der Methanolherstellung und der Isobutylölsynthese ermutigt, lenkte Carl Bosch daher die Forschungsaktivitäten der BASF auf die Hochdruckhydrierung der Braunkohle. Im Juli 1925 erwarb die BASF einen Teil der deutschen Bergius-Patente und ein Jahr später den größten Teil der internationalen Rechte von der Royal Dutch Shell. Die Verfahrensentwicklung übertrug die BASF dem Nernst-Schüler Matthias Pier, der schon das Hochdruckverfahren für die Herstellung von Methanol entwickelt hatte. Er führte in den Ammoniak- und Methanolapparaturen Versuche zur katalytischen Hydrierung von Braunkohlenteer mit schwefelhaltigen Katalysatoren wie Eisen- und Molybdänsulfid durch. Carl Krauch, der spätere Leiter des Reichsamts für Wirtschaftsausbau, förderte Piers Arbeiten., Die Hydrierung von Kohle in einer Suspension stellte gegenüber den reinen Gasphasenreaktionen eine Herausforderung dar und erforderte erhebliche Investitionen in die Verfahrensentwicklung. Eine hohe Konzentration von typischen Katalysatorgiften erforderte eine hohe Stabilität und Selektivität des Katalysators, um die Reaktionen bei einem sehr inhomogenen Rohstoff zu den gewünschten Produkten zu führen. Dazu kamen technische Schwierigkeiten wie der Angriff von Wasserstoff und Schwefelwasserstoff auf das Reaktormaterial sowie Probleme bei der Trennung von Restkohle, Asche und Katalysator von den verflüssigten Produkten., Carl Bosch erkannte, dass die Beschaffung des benötigten Kapitals für die Überführung des Verfahrens in die chemische Technik eine breite finanzielle Basis benötigte, was 1925 letztlich zur Gründung der I.G. Farben führte. Wegen der Nähe zum Mitteldeutschen Braunkohlerevier und den da vorhandenen Erfahrungen in der Hochdrucktechnik wählte Bosch die Leunawerke 1927 als erste Produktionsstätte aus. Innerhalb von fünf Jahren überwand die BASF die technischen Schwierigkeiten und steigerte den Ausstoß von Kraftstoffen auf etwa 100.000Tonnen pro Jahr. Gegenüber den Produkten der indirekten Kohlehydrierung durch die Fischer-Tropsch-Synthese wies das nach dem Bergius-Pier-Verfahren produzierte synthetische Benzin eine höhere Oktanzahl auf., Die I.G.Farben investierte bis 1931 etwa 426Millionen Reichsmark in das Verfahren, mehr als das Doppelte des Umsatzes des BASF-Teils der I.G.Farben in diesem Jahr. Die Standard Oil of New Jersey erwarb in dieser Zeit die Lizenz zur weltweiten Vermarktung des Verfahrens. Die Firmen Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), Shell, Standard Oil und I.G.Farben gründeten 1931 die \\"International Hydrogenation Patents Company\\", um die Ressourcen und das Know-how für die Herstellung synthetischen Benzins zu bündeln und um die Veröffentlichung von Entdeckungen einzuschränken., Größer als die technischen waren die wirtschaftlichen Probleme. Die Herstellungskosten des Leuna-Benzins erwiesen sich teilweise höher als die für die Benzinherstellung auf der Basis von Erdöl. Zeitweise lag der Preis für Benzin aus Erdöl unter dem Preis der eingesetzten Kohle. Zudem erwies sich die pessimistische Prognose bezüglich der gewinnbaren Erdölvorkommen als falsch. Die einsetzende Weltwirtschaftskrise erhöhte die Nettoverluste der I.G.Farben, die auch nicht durch die Zahlungen von Lizenzgebühren der Standard Oil of New Jersey auszugleichen waren., Zeit des Nationalsozialismus., 1933 nahmen Vertreter der I.G.Farben Kontakte zur nationalsozialistischen Führung auf, um für eine politische Unterstützung des Verfahrens zu werben. Das Reichsfinanzministerium gewährte daraufhin Schutzzölle, um das synthetische Benzin konkurrenzfähig zu halten. Es kam im Dezember 1933 zur Unterzeichnung des vom wirtschaftspolitischen Sprecher der NSDAP Gottfried Feder und Carl Bosch ausgehandelten Feder-Bosch-Abkommens, wobei sich die I.G.Farben zur Lieferung von synthetischem Benzin zu einem garantierten Preis verpflichtete., Hitler befahl 1936 in der von ihm verfassten Denkschrift zum Vierjahresplan die Durchführung eines Vierjahresplans, unter anderem mit dem Ziel des maximalen Ausbaus von Anlagen zur Herstellung synthetischen Benzins. Eine wesentliche Rolle sollte hierbei die Braunkohle-Benzin AG (Brabag) mit ihren vier Hydrierwerken in Magdeburg, Böhlen, Schwarzheide und Zeitz einnehmen. Insgesamt entstanden im Deutschen Reich nach der Fischer-Tropsch-Synthese der Ruhrchemie neun Werke und zwölf nach dem Hochdruck-Hydrierungsverfahren der I.G.Farben., Die größten Anlagen mit einer Produktionskapazität von über 600.000t/a (Tonnen Treibstoffe pro Jahr) arbeiteten in Pölitz, Leuna und Brüx. Die zwölf Bergius-Pier-Hydrierwerke hatten zusammen eine geplante Kapazität von 3.866.000t/a und die neun Fischer-Tropsch-Anlagen von 647.000t/a. Die geplante Jahreskapazität wurde jedoch bei allen Werken erst 1943/44 erreicht., Die gemeinsam mit den Fischer-Tropsch-Anlagen einmalig im Zeitraum von 1943 bis Anfang Mai 1944 erreichte Höchstleistung von zusammen rund 4,5Millionen Tonnen ist jedoch nicht mit der Jahresproduktion synthetisch hergestellten Flugbenzins gleichzusetzen, was in der Nachkriegszeit verschiedene Autoren angaben. Den größten Produktanteil des I.G.-Verfahrens bildeten zwar ab Januar 1942 Flugtreibstoffe, jedoch gefolgt von Fahrbenzin und Dieselkraftstoff, Heizöl, Schmieröl und sonstigen Produkten (Sekundärprodukte).

Der Grünspecht und seine Schwesterart, der Grauspecht (), sind die einzigen Vertreter der Gattung \\"Picus\\" in Mitteleuropa., Beschreibung., Der Grünspecht wird bis zu 32Zentimeter lang und hat eine Flügelspannweite von bis zu 52Zentimetern. Die Oberseite ist dunkelgrün, die Unterseite ist blass hell- bis graugrün gefärbt. Der Kopf ist an den Seiten durch eine schwarze Gesichtsmaske gezeichnet, die vom Schnabel bis hinter die Augen reicht, was ihm die Bezeichnung \\"Fliegender Zorro\\" im Volksmund einbringt. Der Oberkopf und der Nacken sind rot, der Bürzel grüngelb. Die Ohrgegend, Kinn und Kehle sind dagegen weißlich. Die Flügel oder Schwingen der Tiere sind braunschwarz, gelblich oder bräunlichweiß gefleckt. Die Steuerfedern sind auf grüngrauem Grund schwärzlich gebändert. Die Unterschiede zwischen den Geschlechtern sind gering, beim Männchen ist der Wangenfleck rot mit einem schwarzen Rand, beim Weibchen ist dieser Wangenfleck einfarbig schwarz. Die Augen des Grünspechts sind bläulichweiß, Schnabel und Füße sind bleigrau. Männchen und Weibchen sind gleich groß und schwer. Fänglinge in der Camargue wogen im Mittel 177g (Männchen) oder 174g (Weibchen), die Spanne reichte von 138g bis 201g., Das Jugendgefieder unterscheidet sich stark von dem Gefieder der erwachsenen Tiere, es ist insgesamt deutlich matter. Kopfseiten, Hals und die Unterseite sind auf fast weißem Grund stark dunkel gefleckt bis gebändert. Die roten Anteile der Kopffärbung sind unscheinbar und meistens mit grauen Flecken durchsetzt. Die Flügel und die Gefiederoberseite weisen zudem eine deutliche weiße Fleckung auf., In Mitteleuropa kann der Grünspecht nur mit dem etwas kleineren, aber sonst sehr ähnlichen Grauspecht verwechselt werden. Im Gegensatz zum Grünspecht hat der Grauspecht jedoch einen grauen Kopf, ein dunkelrotes Auge und nur einen schmalen schwarzen Kinnstreif. Dem Grauspecht fehlt außerdem der rote Scheitel des Grünspechtes, nur beim Männchen ist der Vorderkopf rot, beim Weibchen fehlt eine rote Kopfzeichnung. Oft gibt schon der Beobachtungsort Hinweise zur Artbestimmung, der Grauspecht fehlt im Nordwesten Mitteleuropas und ist im Vergleich zum Grünspecht viel stärker an Gebirge und an Wald gebunden (siehe Verbreitung)., Mauser., Die Jugendmauser erfolgt kontinuierlich und beginnt bereits in der Bruthöhle. Im Verlauf von etwa vier Monaten ist sie abgeschlossen und entsprechend besitzen die Jungtiere im Spätherbst bereits das Federkleid der Adultvögel., Lautäußerungen und Trommelgeräusch., Grünspechte trommeln deutlich seltener als die meisten anderen heimischen Spechte. Sie produzieren dann nur leise und unregelmäßige Wirbel. Auffällig ist dagegen der markante Reviergesang, der von beiden Geschlechtern, intensiver jedoch vom Männchen, geäußert wird. Dieser klingt wie ein lautes Lachen (\\"„klü-klü-klü-klü-klü-klü-klü“\\"). Die aus bis zu 20 Silben bestehende, etwas nasal klingende Rufreihe bleibt auf einer Tonhöhe und wird gegen Ende schneller und etwas leiser. Häufig ist ein zweisilbiger, deutlicher Abschluss (\\"„klü-ück“\\"). Bei warmem Winterwetter sind diese Rufe in Mitteleuropa schon im Dezember und Januar zu hören, üblicherweise jedoch erst gegen Ende Februar. Die ähnliche Rufreihe des Grauspechtes klingt reiner und liegt in der Tonhöhe meist etwas höher. Die Strophe fällt in der Tonhöhe ab, wird gegen Ende hin langsamer und deutlich leiser und verstummt ohne Akzent. Grünspechte äußern beim Landen oft ein scharfes \\"„Kjäck“\\", zuweilen auch \\"„Kjück“\\", das bei Beunruhigung oder in Aggressionssituationen zu einem mehrsilbigen Ruf (\\"„Kjück-Kjück-Kjück-Kjück“\\") gereiht wird., Verbreitung und Lebensraum., Der Grünspecht bewohnt große Teile Europas und Vorderasiens, sein Vorkommen liegt also in der westlichen Paläarktis. Er kommt dabei vom südlichen Skandinavien und Großbritannien über den größten Teil des europäischen Festlandes bis in das Mittelmeergebiet und im Südosten bis zum Kaukasus, Turkmenistan und zum nördlichen Iran vor. Die boreale Nadelwaldzone im Norden und die Steppen und Halbwüsten im Süden des Verbreitungsgebietes werden nur randlich besiedelt., Er bevorzugt halboffene Landschaften mit ausgedehnten Althölzern, vor allem Waldränder, Feldgehölze, Streuobstwiesen, Parks, Haine und große Gärten mit Baumbestand. Innerhalb ausgedehnter Waldgebiete kommt er nur in stark aufgelichteten Bereichen, an Waldwiesen und größeren Lichtungen vor. Die Art zeigt dabei eine starke Präferenz für Laubwälder, in ausgedehnten Nadelholzforsten kann sie großflächig sehr selten sein oder fehlen., Der Grünspecht ist aufgrund seiner starken Spezialisierung auf bodenlebende Ameisen anfällig für strenge Winter mit hohen Schneelagen. Schwerpunkt der Verbreitung sind daher die Niederungen und die unteren Lagen der Mittelgebirge bis in eine Höhe von etwa 500m über NN. Im schneereichen und von Nadelwäldern dominierten Bayerischen Wald ist er sehr selten und fehlt oberhalb 900m ganz. Die Höhenverbreitung scheint zusätzlich durch das Vorkommen des vor allem in der collinen Stufe verbreiteten Grauspechtes beeinflusst zu werden, bei gleichzeitigem Vorkommen beider Arten kann der Grünspecht schon in Höhenlagen ab 150m über NN großflächig fehlen (etwa in Nordrhein-Westfalen), diese Höhenlagen sind dann vom Grauspecht besiedelt., Im Alpenraum ist diese Begrenzung der Verbreitung hinsichtlich der Meereshöhe so nicht vorhanden. In den Bayerischen Voralpen und Alpen besiedelt der Grünspecht alle Höhenlagen von 600 bis 1400m über NN recht gleichmäßig und wurde bis in 1700m Meereshöhe nachgewiesen, der Grauspecht besiedelte dieselben Höhenlagen in etwas geringerer Dichte. In der Schweiz liegt der Schwerpunkt der Verbreitung in Höhen bis 1000 m NN, die Art kommt dort jedoch regelmäßig bis in Höhen von 2000m über NN vor. Der Grauspecht ist dort auf Höhenlagen unter etwa 700m über NN beschränkt, besiedelt also dort nur die colline Stufe. Die höchsten Nachweise liegen dabei im Kanton Wallis in der Schweiz in 2150m Höhe, im Transkaukasus wurde der Grünspecht sogar in 2745m Höhe nachgewiesen., Lebensweise., Aktivität., Der Grünspecht ist tagaktiv, bei Dunkelheit bewegt er sich nur noch kletternd. Er hat eine regelmäßige Aktivitätsphase und kann in dieser über Wochen täglich die gleichen Routen abfliegen und an denselben Plätzen seine Nahrung suchen. Die Aktivitätsphase selbst dauert abhängig vom Tageslicht zwischen acht Stunden im Dezember und 15Stunden im Juli., Der Grünspecht bewegt sich häufig und geschickter als die anderen Spechte am Boden, wodurch er auch als „Erdspecht“ bekannt ist (nicht zu verwechseln mit \\"Geocolaptes olivaceus\\", dem südafrikanischen Erdspecht). Dabei hüpft er Strecken bis zu drei Metern in einzelnen Sprüngen von maximal 25Zentimetern ab, ohne zu fliegen. Im Gegensatz zum Bunt- und zum Blutspecht klettert der Grünspecht nicht ruckartig, sondern eher fließend, dabei allerdings nicht so schnell wie der Grauspecht., Bei relativ dicht stehenden Baumreihen fliegt er auch nicht von einem Baum zum nächsten, sondern überwindet die Distanzen in einem recht charakteristischen Segelflug. Dabei klettert er zunächst den einen Baumstamm empor, um anschließend von unterhalb der Baumkrone bis zum Fuß des nächsten Baumes zu gleiten. Er wiederholt dieses Schauspiel gern vielfach hintereinander., Er ist ein weitgehend standorttreuer Vogel, der nur kurze Wanderungen unternimmt. Im Winter schweift er teilweise weit umher und erscheint oft in Gärten, um dort nach Nahrung zu suchen. Es handelt sich entsprechend um einen Stand- und Strichvogel. Die Jungvögel verlassen die Reviere ihrer Eltern und suchen sich eigene Reviere in deren Nähe, auch bei diesen Wanderungen entfernen sie sich in der Regel nur bis zu 30Kilometer vom Geburtsort. Die weitesten bislang durch Beringung nachgewiesenen Wanderungen betrugen in einem Fall 82km, in einem weiteren 170km., Ernährung., Der Grünspecht sucht seine Nahrung fast ausschließlich auf dem Boden, er hackt viel weniger an Bäumen als die anderen Spechte., Von allen mitteleuropäischen Spechten ist der Grünspecht am meisten auf bodenbewohnende Ameisen spezialisiert. Diese fängt er in ihren Gängen mit seiner 10Zentimeter langen Zunge, die in ein verhorntes und mit Widerhaken bestücktes Ende ausläuft., In den frühen Morgenstunden, kurz nach Sonnenaufgang, suchen Grünspechte Wiesen- und Weideflächen mit lockerem Oberboden und Störstellen auf, um mit ihren langen Schnäbeln gezielt mehrere Zentimeter tiefe Löcher zu bohren. Dabei erbeuten die Vögel häufig die Rote Waldameise und andere \\"Formica\\"-Arten, im Sommer verschiedene \\"Lasius\\"-Arten (Wegameisen). Im Winter graben Grünspechte Tunnel in den Schnee, um zu Ameisenhügeln zu gelangen, die dann meist regelmäßig besucht werden. Vor allem im Winter sucht er Felswände auf, aber auch regelmäßig Dächer, Hauswände oder Leitungsmasten, und sucht dort in Spalten nach überwinternden Arthropoden, vor allem nach Fliegen, Mücken und Spinnen. Würmer und weitere Wirbellose sind dagegen nur selten Teil der Ernährung. Gelegentlich fressen Grünspechte auch Beeren, etwa Vogelbeeren und die Samenmäntel der Eibe, und anderes Obst wie Kirschen, Äpfel oder Trauben., Fortpflanzung und Entwicklung., Grünspechte erreichen ihre Geschlechtsreife noch im ersten Lebensjahr. Die Balz beginnt mit ersten Kontaktrufen der Männchen ab Dezember und nimmt dann über den Januar und Februar deutlich zu. Die eigentliche Paargründung und die Festlegung der Reviergrenzen erfolgt in Mitteleuropa Mitte März bis Anfang April. Die Vögel bilden dabei wahrscheinlich Saisonehen, mehrjährige Beziehungen von Paaren werden jedoch auch nicht ausgeschlossen. Die höchste Gesangsaktivität ist im April und im Mai zu verzeichnen., Als Nisthöhlen dienen im Regelfall verlassene Brut- und Überwinterungshöhlen anderer Spechte oder die eigenen: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Spechte, Vogel, Namensgeber, Asteroiden, Jahr, Deutschland, Österreich, Grünspecht, Grauspecht, Picus"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Berlin-Rahnsdorf, Schienenverkehr (Brandenburg), Spurweite 1435 mm, Straßenbahn Berlin, Straßenbahnsystem (Deutschland), Verkehr (Landkreis Oder-Spree), Verkehrsgeschichte (Brandenburg), Woltersdorf (bei Berlin)], Die Straßenbahn Woltersdorf ist eine normalspurige Überlandstraßenbahn. Sie verkehrt am östlichen Stadtrand von Berlin und verbindet den Bahnhof Berlin-Rahnsdorf mit der im Landkreis Oder-Spree gelegenen brandenburgischen Gemeinde Woltersdorf., Mit seiner seit der Eröffnung im Mai 1913 trotz diverser Ausbaupläne an beiden Enden unverändert gebliebenen Streckenlänge von nur 5,6Kilometern zählt das Unternehmen zu den kleinsten Straßenbahnbetrieben Deutschlands und macht Woltersdorf somit zur kleinsten deutschen Kommune mit eigener Straßenbahn. Darüber hinaus ist es einer der letzten Betriebe, die den in der DDR gefertigten Gothawagen einsetzen. Eigentümer und Betreiber ist seit 1991 die \\"Woltersdorfer Straßenbahn GmbH\\", abgekürzt \\"WS\\", die je zur Hälfte der Gemeinde Woltersdorf sowie dem Landkreis Oder-Spree gehört. Zum 1.Januar 2020 übernahm die Schöneicher-Rüdersdorfer Straßenbahn GmbH (SRS) die Betriebsführung für 22,5Jahre., Aufgrund des landschaftlich reizvollen Streckenverlaufs durch den Berliner Forst Köpenick und die Gemeinde Woltersdorf bis zum Rand der Rüdersdorfer Heide spielt die Straßenbahn auch im Ausflugsverkehr der Berliner eine wichtige Rolle. Hauptsächlich dient sie jedoch als Zubringer von Woltersdorf zum Bahnhof Berlin-Rahnsdorf der Berliner S-Bahn., Geschichte., Planung und Bau., Gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts setzte in Woltersdorf und den angrenzenden Landgemeinden und Gutsbezirken eine verstärkte Siedlungstätigkeit ein, vor allem durch den Zuzug von Berlinern. Als erste Verkehrsverbindung im Ort diente ab 1876 eine Dampfschiffverbindung von Kalkberge über Woltersdorf nach Erkner, die später an der Woltersdorfer Schleuse getrennt wurde. 1882richtete ein Kalkberger Fuhrunternehmer eine Pferdeomnibuslinie auf der gleichen Relation ein, die im Gegensatz zum Schiff ganzjährig betrieben werden konnte. Kurz darauf folgte eine zweite Linie zwischen Woltersdorf und dem Bahnhof Erkner, an der sich die Gemeinde finanziell beteiligte. 1896legte die Gemeinde zusätzlich einen Fußweg vom Dorfkern zum Bahnhof Neu-Rahnsdorf (heute im Ortsteil Berlin-Wilhelmshagen) an., Überlegungen für eine Schienenverbindung nach Woltersdorf um 1898/99 sahen eine Kleinbahn von Erkner über Woltersdorf und Kalkberge nach Herzfelde vor. Das Vorhaben mündete kurz darauf in Plänen für eine schmalspurige elektrische Straßenbahn von Erkner nach Kalkberge. Neben der Straßenbahn sollten die betroffenen Gemeinden auch an das Stromnetz angeschlossen werden, wofür in Erkner der Bau eines Kraftwerks vorgesehen war. Innerhalb von Woltersdorf sollte diese Strecke durch die heutige E.-u.-J.-Rosenberg-Straße und die Rüdersdorfer Straße verlaufen. Das Projekt scheiterte, da sich die Gemeinde Erkner für den Bau einer Gasanstalt entschied und es zu Streitigkeiten zwischen der Gemeinde Woltersdorf und der planenden \\"Elektrizitätsgesellschaft Wandruszka&amp;Co.\\" kam., Ebenfalls 1898 stellte die Gemeinde Woltersdorf einen Bebauungsplan für die Gebiete westlich des Dorfkerns auf. 1903gründete der Kaufmann Bruno Wilhelmi auf diesen Flächen die Villenkolonie Schönblick. Durch die Zunahme der Bevölkerungszahl entstand ein größeres Verkehrsbedürfnis in Richtung Berlin. Der Grundbesitzerverein von Schönblick regte daher 1905 den Bau einer Straßenbahn vom Bahnhof Rahnsdorf über Schönblick nach Woltersdorf an. Der Kaufmann Siebe legte der Gemeinde einen Vertragsentwurf vor, dem diese auch zustimmte. Nach anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten wurde am 24.Mai 1909 die \\"Elektrische Straßenbahn Rahnsdorf–Woltersdorf GmbH\\" gegründet. Am29.Juli 1909 beschloss die Gemeindeverwaltung, den Bahnbau zu unterstützen. Die Gesellschaft beantragte daraufhin am 2.April 1910 den Bau der Bahn bei der zuständigen Aufsichtsbehörde. Die Ausführung scheiterte, da Siebe kurz darauf in Konkurs geriet und kein passender Ersatz für ihn zu finden war. Die Gesellschaft löste sich daher am 7.August 1911 wieder auf., Da sich Woltersdorf mit 50.000Mark an dem Vorhaben beteiligen wollte, regte der Schönblicker Kaufmann Heinrich Polte im Juli 1911 erneut den Bahnbau an. Er warb dafür, dass die Gemeinde Bau und Betrieb der Straßenbahn selbst übernehmen sollte; das nötige Kapital sollte durch Zeichnung von Zinsgarantien zusammenkommen. Am27.September 1911 beschloss die Gemeindevertretung mit 9 gegen 5 Stimmen den Bau der Bahn. Über die Zeichnung von Verpflichtungsscheinen schuf die Gemeinde ein Baukapital von 250.000Mark für zehn Jahre. Der Rentier Gustav Janke hatte mit 60.000Mark den größten Anteil am Zustandekommen dieser Summe. Er beanspruchte daher die Zustellung der Jahresbilanzen, die Übersendung fortlaufender Berichte der Gemeinde sowie einen Sitz und eine Stimme in der Straßenbahn-Baukommission. Zudem musste sich die Gemeinde verpflichten, der Orenstein &amp; Koppel – Arthur Koppel AG den Vorzug zur Errichtung geben. Um die Finanzierung zu vereinfachen, sollten sich die benachbarten Kolonien Fichtenau und Grätzwalde sowie die Gemeinde Klein-Schönebeck (heute alle Ortsteile von Schöneiche bei Berlin) am Bahnbau beteiligen. Diese wiederum verlangten im Gegenzug, dass die Bahn über ihr Gebiet führen sollte., Es standen somit drei verschiedene Streckenführungen zur Debatte:, Der Gemeinde Kalkberge wurde ebenfalls eine finanzielle Mitbeteiligung angeboten. Sie entschied sich stattdessen für einen Anschluss an die Benzolbahn Friedrichshagen–Schöneiche., Polte setzte sich vehement für die kürzeste Streckenführung ein und verwies darauf, dass eine Führung der Bahn über fremdes Gebiet zusätzliche Kosten zur Nutzung der Straßen mit sich brächte. Nachdem sich Janke für diese Linie ausgesprochen hatte, folgten ihm die meisten Zeichner nach. Die Gemeinde beantragte daraufhin am 5.November 1911 die Zulassung der Straßenbahn bei der Kleinbahn-Aufsichtsbehörde. Nach dreimonatigen Verhandlungen sprach sich der preußische Minister für Öffentliche Arbeiten Paul von Breitenbach am 21.Februar 1912 für die Genehmigung aus. Der Regierungspräsident von Potsdam Rudolf von der Schulenburg erließ am 20.März 1912 die Genehmigungsurkunde für die \\"Elektrische Straßenbahn vom Bahnhof Rahnsdorf nach Woltersdorf Schleuse\\"; sie wurde am 29.März 1912 unter der Nummer700 im Amtsblatt der Königlichen Regierung zu Potsdam und der Stadt Berlin veröffentlicht. Wenige Tage später nahm der Verband Groß-Berlin, in dessen Zuständigkeitsbereich auch die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel außer den Staatsbahnen fielen, seine Arbeit auf., Wie mit Janke vereinbart, erteilte die Gemeindevertretung nach dem Vergleich mit anderen Anbietern Orenstein&amp;Koppel am 29.Juli 1912 die Erlaubnis zum Bahnbau. Probleme ergaben sich am östlichen Streckenende in der Haupt- und Schleusenstraße, wo die Topografie zwei Gefälleabschnitte mit 67Promille Neigung erforderte. Das Gleis musste in diesen Abschnitten die Straßenseite wechseln, um die Neigung zu verringern. Die Aufsichtsbehörde forderte zusätzlich den Einbau von Magnetschienenbremsen in den Fahrzeugen.&lt;ref name=\\"VB 3/83\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Am6.Dezember 1912 legte die Vertretung erstmals Fahrpreise und Haltestellen fest, am 10.April 1913 konkretisierte sie die Daten und veröffentlichte den Fahrplan. Zudem stellte sie 1000Mark für Reklame bereit. Weitere Beschlüsse bezüglich Wagenreklame, Haftpflichtversicherung der Wagen und des Programms der Eröffnungsfeier folgten am 2.Mai1913. Am17.Mai 1913 konnte die Straßenbahn vom Bahnhof Rahnsdorf nach Woltersdorf Schleuse mit vier Trieb- und sechs Beiwagen den regulären Betrieb aufnehmen., Anfänge bis 1945., Durch den Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges im Sommer 1914 traten die ersten Probleme im Betrieb auf. Die Verkehrszahlen gingen drastisch zurück, zudem wurde ein Großteil des Personals eingezogen. Wie in anderen Betrieben übernahmen Frauen, meist Angehörige der betroffenen Personen, die Arbeit als Schaffner. Da infolge des Fahrgastrückgangs nicht alle Wagen benötigt wurden, ordnete die preußische Militärverwaltung an, leihweise zwei Beiwagen an die Spandauer Straßenbahn zu übergeben. Sie waren dort ab Januar 1917 gegen eine monatliche Miete von je 100Mark im Einsatz und kamen bei Kriegsende nach Woltersdorf zurück., In der Folgezeit stiegen die Fahrgastzahlen stark an, aufgrund der gleichzeitig voranschreitenden Inflation gingen die Einnahmen dagegen zurück. Bereits im Mai 1916 gab es die erste Preiserhöhung für den Einzelfahrschein. Beginnend mit den 1920er Jahren kam es in immer kürzeren Abständen zu weiteren Fahrpreisanpassungen. Gleichzeitig war der Betrieb nicht in der Lage, anfallende Reparaturen durchzuführen und das Personal angemessen zu entlohnen. Zwischen dem 8.November 1923 und dem 31.März 1924 entließ man daher einen Teil des Personals und fuhr im Einmannbetrieb. Eine gänzliche Einstellung des Betriebs konnte dagegen verhindert werden., Nach 1923 verzeichnete die Straßenbahn wieder mehr Fahrgäste, was unter anderem darauf zurückzuführen war, dass die Gemeinde erwerbslosen Facharbeitern freie Fahrt zu ihren Facharbeitsnachweisen in Berlin bewilligte. Die Haltestellen Blumenstraße, Lerchenstraße und Lindenallee (heute Thälmannplatz) erhielten 1925 feste Wartehallen. Im gleichen Jahr wurde ein Gleisbogen vom Betriebshof in Richtung Rahnsdorf eingebaut. Neben dem Wegfall von Sägefahrten bestand damit die Möglichkeit, die Wagen zu drehen, um eine ungleichmäßige Abnutzung der Radsätze zu vermeiden. Im folgenden Winter beschaffte der Betrieb einen fünften Triebwagen. 1927wurden die offenen Plattformen der Beiwagen geschlossen. Am4.Juli 1926 musste die Bahn den Betrieb vorübergehend unterbrechen. Ein Unwetter hatte zu Überschwemmungen im Ort geführt und Straßen sowie Gleisanlagen unpassierbar gemacht. In den 1920er Jahren diente die Bahn darüber hinaus der Postsackbeförderung., Am 19.April 1929 erhielt der Betrieb die Genehmigung für die Vorarbeiten zur Verlängerung der Strecke über Erkner, Fangschleuse und Grünheide nach Alt Buchhorst. Wegen der fehlenden finanziellen Mittel sowie einem komplizierten Brückenbau über den Flakenkanal kam es nicht zur Umsetzung.

Jahrhundert), Literatur (Deutsch), Nachkriegsliteratur], Als Gruppe 47 werden die Teilnehmer an den deutschsprachigen Schriftstellertreffen bezeichnet, zu denen Hans Werner Richter von 1947 bis 1967 einlud. Die Treffen dienten der gegenseitigen Kritik der vorgelesenen Texte und der Förderung junger, noch unbekannter Autoren. Der in demokratischer Abstimmung ermittelte \\"Preis der Gruppe47\\" erwies sich für viele Ausgezeichnete als Beginn ihrer literarischen Karriere. Die Gruppe 47 besaß keine Organisationsform, keine feste Mitgliederliste und kein literarisches Programm, wurde aber stark durch Richters Einladungspraxis geprägt., In ihrer Anfangszeit bot die Gruppe47 jungen Schriftstellern eine Plattform zur Erneuerung der deutschen Literatur nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg. Später avancierte sie zu einer einflussreichen Institution im Kulturbetrieb der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, an deren Tagungen bedeutende zeitgenössische Autoren und Literaturkritiker teilnahmen. Der kulturelle und politische Einfluss der Gruppe 47 wurde Gegenstand zahlreicher Debatten. Auch nach dem Ende ihrer Tagungen 1967 blieben ehemalige Teilnehmer der Gruppe richtungsweisend für die Entwicklung der deutschsprachigen Literatur., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte: \\"Der Ruf\\"., Im Frühjahr 1945 entstand im Kriegsgefangenenlager \\"Fort Kearny\\" in Rhode Island als Teil des amerikanischen Reeducation-Programms für die deutschen Kriegsgefangenen die Zeitschrift \\"Der Ruf: Zeitung der deutschen Kriegsgefangenen.\\" Sie wurde von Curt Vinz herausgegeben, zu ihren Mitarbeitern gehörten Alfred Andersch und Hans Werner Richter. Nach ihrer Rückkehr nach Deutschland planten sie in Vinz’ Verlag eine Nachfolgezeitschrift unter dem Titel \\"Der Ruf – unabhängige Blätter der jungen Generation,\\" die erstmals am 15. August 1946 erschien. Die Zeitschrift druckte auch literarische Texte ab, aber die Herausgeber Andersch und Richter verstanden sie vor allem als politisches Organ, in dem sie für ein freies Deutschland als Brücke zwischen Ost und West und eine sozialistische Gesellschaftsform eintraten. Dabei übten sie auch Kritik an der amerikanischen Besatzungsmacht, was im April 1947 zum Verbot des \\"Rufs\\" durch die Information Control Division der amerikanischen Besatzungszone führte. Erst nach der Absetzung der beiden Herausgeber konnte die Zeitschrift unter Leitung von Erich Kuby und mit veränderter politischer Ausrichtung wieder erscheinen. Sie verlor indessen an Bedeutung und wurde schließlich eingestellt., Nach dem Ende der Tätigkeit beim \\"Ruf\\" plante Hans Werner Richter eine Nachfolgezeitschrift, die er \\"Der Skorpion\\" betiteln wollte. Als eine Art von Redaktionssitzung lud Richter Autoren aus dem Umfeld der geplanten Zeitung am 6. und 7. September 1947 zu einem Treffen am Bannwaldsee bei Füssen ins Haus Ilse Schneider-Lengyels ein. Dort sollten Manuskripte vorgelesen und gemeinsam diskutiert werden. Daneben stand der private und unterhaltende Charakter der Zusammenkunft im Vordergrund. Während die Zeitschrift \\"Der Skorpion\\" nie über ihre Nullnummer herauskam, entwickelte sich aus dem Treffen am Bannwaldsee die erste Tagung der Gruppe 47. Im Hinblick auf die Vorgeschichte behauptete Richter später: „Der Ursprung der Gruppe 47 ist politisch-publizistischer Natur. Nicht Literaten schufen sie, sondern politisch engagierte Publizisten mit literarischen Ambitionen.“, Historische Periodisierung., Nach Friedhelm Kröll lässt sich die Geschichte der Gruppe 47 in vier Perioden einteilen:, Entstehung und Organisation., Am Treffen beim Bannwaldsee nahmen 16 Personen teil. Zum Auftakt las Wolfdietrich Schnurre seine Kurzgeschichte \\"Das Begräbnis.\\" Danach ergab sich ungeplant die Form von offener, teilweise scharfer, spontan geäußerter Kritik der anderen Teilnehmer, die zum späteren Ritual der Gruppenkritik werden sollte. Auch die Form der Lesung, bei der sich der vortragende Autor stets auf den freien Stuhl neben Richter setzte, scherzhaft „elektrischer Stuhl“ getauft, blieb konstant. Zur wichtigen Maxime wurde, dass der Vortragende sich nicht verteidigen durfte, sowie dass die Kritik der konkreten Texte im Mittelpunkt stand. Grundsatzdiskussionen literarischer oder politischer Art, die die Gruppe hätten spalten können, unterband Richter konsequent. Trotz seiner eigenen Präferenz für die realistische Trümmerliteratur gab es kein literarisches Programm der Gruppe, keine gemeinsame Poetologie und nur wenige Grundsätze, etwa keine faschistischen oder militaristischen Texte zuzulassen., Der Name \\"Gruppe 47\\" entstand erst im Anschluss an das erste Treffen, als Hans Werner Richter plante, die Veranstaltung regelmäßig zu wiederholen. Der Schriftsteller und Kritiker Hans Georg Brenner schlug den Namen in Analogie zur spanischen \\"Generación del 98\\" vor. Richter, der jede Organisationsform der Treffen ablehnte, ob „Verein, Club, Verband, Akademie“ stimmte dem Vorschlag zu: „‚Gruppe 47‘, das ist ja völlig unverbindlich und besagt eigentlich gar nichts.“, Erst 1962, zum 15. Jahrestag der Entstehung, formulierte Richter rückblickend die „ideellen Ausgangspunkte“ der Gruppe 47:, Wen er zu den Treffen der Gruppe einlud, entschied Richter persönlich: „Es ist mein Freundeskreis. […] jetzt gebe ich einmal im Jahr ein Fest, […] das nennt man die Gruppe 47 […]. Und ich lade alle Leute ein, die mir passen, die mit mir befreundet sind.“ Damit ließ er Einflussnahme von außen auf die später kritisierte Einladungspraxis von vornherein gar nicht zu. Nach Heinz Ludwig Arnold, der mehrfach über die Gruppe 47 publizierte, war die Stärke Richters, der weder als Schriftsteller noch als Kritiker größere Bedeutung erlangt habe und bei seinen beiden eigenen Lesungen in der Kritik der Gruppe durchfiel, sein Organisationstalent. Der Erfolg der Gruppe 47 wurde für Richter zur Lebensaufgabe., Die ersten Jahre., Zwei Monate nach der Auftaktveranstaltung fand das zweite Treffen der Gruppe 47 in Herrlingen bei Ulm statt, bei dem sich die Teilnehmerzahl bereits verdoppelt hatte. Zu den erstmaligen Teilnehmern gehörte Richters Mitstreiter beim \\"Ruf\\" Alfred Andersch, dessen Essay \\"Deutsche Literatur in der Entscheidung\\" für die Gruppe eine programmatische Bedeutung erhielt. Ausgehend von der These, „echte Künstlerschaft“ sei stets „identisch mit der Gegnerschaft zum Nationalsozialismus“, konstatierte Andersch, dass „die junge Generation vor einer tabula rasa“ stehe, „vor der Notwendigkeit, in einem originalen Schöpfungsakt eine Erneuerung des deutschen geistigen Lebens zu vollbringen.“ Anderschs Zukunftsentwurf blieb für lange Zeit der einzige Essay, der in der Gruppe gelesen wurde., Die Treffen fanden in den Folgejahren zumeist halbjährlich im Frühjahr und Herbst an wechselnden Orten statt. Auf der siebten Tagung 1950 in Inzigkofen wurde erstmals der \\"Preis der Gruppe 47\\" ins Leben gerufen, der im Unterschied zu den etablierten Literaturpreisen als Förderpreis für noch unbekannte Autoren gedacht war. Franz Joseph Schneider, der seit dem Vorjahr der Gruppe angehörte, hatte eine Spende von 1000 DM beschafft. Nach Abschluss der Lesungen kürten die anwesenden Mitglieder der Gruppe den Preisträger in einer demokratischen Wahl. Als Erster wurde der Lyriker Günter Eich ausgezeichnet. Er war mit dem dritten Treffen in Jugenheim zur Gruppe gestoßen und galt in den Anfangsjahren als ihr profiliertester Autor. In den folgenden Jahren organisierte Richter Preisgelder unterschiedlicher Höhe bei Verlagen und Rundfunkanstalten, vergab sie aber nur unregelmäßig. Ob bei der jeweiligen Tagung ein Preis ausgelobt wurde, gab er den Teilnehmern erst zum Abschluss bekannt., Durch Empfehlungen Dritter, jedoch stets erst mittels persönlicher Einladung durch Hans Werner Richter kamen immer neue Autoren zu den Treffen der Gruppe 47. So debütierte im Jahr 1951 bei der Tagung in Bad Dürkheim auf Vorschlag Alfred Anderschs Heinrich Böll, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt zwar schon zwei Erzählungen und einen Roman veröffentlicht hatte, allerdings ohne dass diese auf breite Resonanz gestoßen waren. Böll erhielt gleich bei seiner ersten Lesung der Satire \\"Die schwarzen Schafe\\" den Preis der Gruppe47, ein damals noch umstrittener Wahlerfolg des erstmaligen Teilnehmers., Nur acht Monate und 16 Ausgaben überlebte 1952 die Literaturzeitschrift \\"Die Literatur,\\" ein Versuch, unter Richters Herausgeberschaft ein Sprachrohr der Gruppe 47 zu etablieren, das einige Texte aus dem Kreis der Teilnehmer erstveröffentlichte. Rolf Schroers urteilte nach der Einstellung: „\\"Die Literatur\\" war ein rohes, oft wüstes Blatt, unausgeglichen, marktschreierisch,“ und enthalte „blasses Zeug mehr als genug […], schlecht gezielte Angriffe, aber man nahm die Zeit wütend ernst.“, Realismus und Moderne., Mit steigender Bekanntheit der Gruppe wurden vermehrt Gäste aus dem In- und Ausland zu den Tagungen eingeladen. Das 10. Treffen fand im Mai 1952 in Niendorf statt, maßgeblich unterstützt von Ernst Schnabel, dem Intendanten des Hamburger Funkhauses des Nordwestdeutschen Rundfunk (NWDR). Dort trug Paul Celan neben anderen Gedichten seine noch unbekannte \\"Todesfuge\\" vor und wurde nach Bölls nachträglicher Einschätzung „auf die peinlichste Weise mißverstanden“. Walter Jens erinnerte sich an die Reaktionen: „Als Celan zum ersten Mal auftrat, da sagte man: ‚Das kann doch kaum jemand hören!‘, er las sehr pathetisch. Wir haben darüber gelacht, ‚Der liest ja wie Goebbels!‘, sagte einer. […] Die \\"Todesfuge\\" war ja ein Reinfall in der Gruppe! Das war eine völlig andere Welt, da kamen die Neorealisten nicht mit.“ Milo Dor fügte den Ausspruch Richters hinzu, Celan habe „in einem Singsang vorgelesen wie in einer Synagoge“. In einem Brief an seine Frau Gisèle kommentierte Celan, Richter sei ein „Initiator eines Realismus, der nicht einmal erste Wahl ist“, und schloss: „Jene also, die die Poesie nicht mögen –sie waren in der Mehrzahl– lehnten sich auf.“ Trotz solcher Stimmen machte Celan mit dem Auftritt auf sich aufmerksam. Noch auf der Tagung erhielt er das Angebot für einen ersten Gedichtband in einem deutschen Verlag, und bei der abschließenden Wahl zum Preis der Gruppe erreichte er immerhin den dritten Rang. An weiteren Treffen der Gruppe 47 nahm er aber trotz wiederholter Einladungen nicht mehr teil., Die Tagung in Niendorf führte nach Einschätzung Arnolds zu einem literarischen Paradigmenwechsel in der Gruppe: der schlichte Realismus der Trümmerliteratur, der in den Anfangsjahren bestimmend gewesen war, wich allmählich komplexeren Texten. Die literarische Moderne, die sich in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts entwickelt hatte, ehe sie während der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus verbannt und verbrannt worden war, lebte in der Gruppe 47 neu auf. Die Entwicklung war insbesondere mit den Namen Ilse Aichinger und Ingeborg Bach: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Aufgelöst 1967, Gegründet 1947, Literarische Gruppe, Literatur (20.

Im Periodensystem steht es in der Gruppe der Actinoide (7.Periode, f-Block) und zählt auch zu den Transuranen. Berkelium wurde nach der Stadt Berkeley in Kalifornien benannt, in der es entdeckt wurde. Bei Berkelium handelt es sich um ein radioaktives Metall mit einem silbrig-weißen Aussehen. Es wurde im Dezember 1949 erstmals aus dem leichteren Element Americium erzeugt. Es entsteht in geringen Mengen in Kernreaktoren. Seine Anwendung findet es vor allem zur Erzeugung höherer Transurane und Transactinoide., Geschichte., So wie Americium (Ordnungszahl 95) und Curium (96) in den Jahren 1944 und 1945 nahezu zeitgleich entdeckt wurden, erfolgte in ähnlicher Weise in den Jahren 1949 und 1950 die Entdeckung der Elemente Berkelium (97) und Californium (98)., Die Experimentatoren Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso und Stanley G. Thompson stellten am 19.Dezember 1949 die ersten Kerne im 60-Zoll-Zyklotron der Universität von Kalifornien in Berkeley her. Es war das fünfte Transuran, das entdeckt wurde. Die Entdeckung wurde zeitgleich mit der des Californiums veröffentlicht., Die Namenswahl folgte naheliegenderweise einem gemeinsamen Ursprung: Berkelium wurde nach dem Fundort, der Stadt \\"Berkeley\\" in Kalifornien, benannt. Die Namensgebung folgt somit wie bei vielen Actinoiden und den Lanthanoiden: Terbium, das im Periodensystem genau über Berkelium steht, wurde nach der schwedischen Stadt Ytterby benannt, in der es zuerst entdeckt wurde: \\"It is suggested that element 97 be given the name berkelium (symbol Bk) after the city of Berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue terbium (atomic number 65) whose name was derived from the town of Ytterby, Sweden, where the rare earth minerals were first found.\\" Für das Element 98 wählte man den Namen \\"Californium\\" zu Ehren der Universität und des Staates Kalifornien., Als schwerste Schritte in der Vorbereitung zur Herstellung des Elements erwiesen sich die Entwicklung entsprechender chemischer Separationsmethoden und die Herstellung ausreichender Mengen an Americium für das Target-Material., Die Probenvorbereitung erfolgte zunächst durch Auftragen von Americiumnitratlösung (mit dem Isotop 241Am) auf eine Platinfolie; die Lösung wurde eingedampft und der Rückstand dann zum Oxid (AmO2) geglüht., Nun wurde diese Probe im 60-Zoll-Zyklotron mit beschleunigten α-Teilchen mit einer Energie von 35MeV etwa 6Stunden beschossen. Dabei entsteht in einer sogenannten (α,2n)-Reaktion 243Bk sowie zwei freie Neutronen:, Nach dem Beschuss im Zyklotron wurde die Beschichtung mittels Salpetersäure gelöst und erhitzt, anschließend wieder mit einer konzentrierten wässrigen Ammoniak-Lösung als Hydroxid ausgefällt und abzentrifugiert; der Rückstand wurde wiederum in Salpetersäure gelöst., Um die weitgehende Abtrennung des Americiums zu erreichen, wurde diese Lösung mit einem Gemisch von Ammoniumperoxodisulfat und Ammoniumsulfat versetzt und erhitzt, um vor allem das gelöste Americium auf die Oxidationsstufe +6 zu bringen. Nicht oxidiertes restliches Americium wurde durch Zusatz von Flusssäure als Americium(III)-fluorid ausgefällt. Auf diese Weise werden auch begleitendes Curium als Curium(III)-fluorid und das erwartete Element 97 (Berkelium) als Berkelium(III)-fluorid ausgefällt. Dieser Rückstand wurde durch Behandlung mit Kalilauge zum Hydroxid umgewandelt, welches nach Abzentrifugieren nun in Perchlorsäure gelöst wurde., Die weitere Trennung erfolgte in Gegenwart eines Citronensäure/Ammoniumcitrat-Puffers im schwach sauren Medium (pH≈3,5) mit Ionenaustauschern bei erhöhter Temperatur., Die chromatographische Trennung konnte nur aufgrund vorheriger Vergleiche mit dem chemischen Verhalten der entsprechenden Lanthanoide gelingen. So tritt bei einer Trennung das Terbium vor Gadolinium und Europium aus einer Säule. Falls das chemische Verhalten des Berkeliums dem eines Eka-Terbiums ähnelt, sollte das fragliche Element 97 daher in dieser analogen Position zuerst erscheinen, entsprechend vor Curium und Americium., Der weitere Verlauf des Experiments brachte zunächst kein Ergebnis, da man nach einem α-Teilchen als Zerfallssignatur suchte. Erst die Suche nach charakteristischer Röntgenstrahlung und Konversionselektronen als Folge eines Elektroneneinfangs brachte den gewünschten Erfolg. Das Ergebnis der Kernreaktion wurde mit 243Bk angegeben, obwohl man anfänglich auch 244Bk für möglich hielt., Im Jahr 1958 isolierten Burris B. Cunningham und Stanley G. Thompson erstmals wägbare Mengen, die durch langjährige Neutronenbestrahlung von 239Pu in dem Testreaktor der National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho erzeugt wurden., Isotope., Von Berkelium existieren nur Radionuklide und keine stabilen Isotope. Insgesamt sind 12 Isotope und 5 Kernisomere des Elements bekannt. Die langlebigsten sind 247Bk (Halbwertszeit 1380Jahre), 248Bk (9Jahre) und 249Bk (330Tage). Die Halbwertszeiten der restlichen Isotope liegen im Bereich von Millisekunden bis Stunden oder Tagen., Nimmt man beispielhaft den Zerfall des langlebigsten Isotops 247Bk heraus, so entsteht durch α-Zerfall zunächst das langlebige 243Am, das seinerseits durch erneuten α-Zerfall in 239Np übergeht. Der weitere Zerfall führt dann über 239Pu zum 235U, dem Beginn der Uran-Actinium-Reihe (4 n + 3)., \\"→ Liste der Berkeliumisotope\\", Vorkommen., Berkeliumisotope kommen auf der Erde wegen ihrer im Vergleich zum Alter der Erde zu geringen Halbwertszeit nicht natürlich vor., Über die Erstentdeckung von Einsteinium und Fermium in den Überresten der ersten amerikanischen Wasserstoffbombe, Ivy Mike, am 1.November 1952 auf dem Eniwetok-Atoll hinaus wurden neben Plutonium und Americium auch Isotope von Curium, Berkelium und Californium gefunden, darunter das 249Bk, das durch den β-Zerfall in 249Cf übergeht. Aus Gründen der militärischen Geheimhaltung wurden die Ergebnisse erst später im Jahr 1956 publiziert., In Kernreaktoren entsteht vor allem das Berkeliumisotop 249Bk, es zerfällt bereits während der Zwischenlagerung (vor der Endlagerung) fast komplett zum Californiumisotop 249Cf mit 351 Jahren Halbwertszeit. Dieses zählt zum Transuranabfall und ist daher in der Endlagerung unerwünscht., Gewinnung und Darstellung., Berkelium wird durch Beschuss von leichteren Actinoiden mit Neutronen in einem Kernreaktor erzeugt. Die Hauptquelle ist der 85MW High-Flux-Isotope Reactor (HFIR) am Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, der auf die Herstellung von Transcuriumelementen (Z&gt; 96) eingerichtet ist., Gewinnung von Berkeliumisotopen., Berkelium entsteht in Kernreaktoren aus Uran (238U) oder Plutonium (239Pu) durch zahlreiche nacheinander folgende Neutroneneinfänge und β-Zerfälle – unter Ausschluss von Spaltungen oder α-Zerfällen., Ein wichtiger Schritt ist hierbei die (n,γ)- oder Neutroneneinfangsreaktion, bei welcher das gebildete angeregte Tochternuklid durch Aussendung eines γ-Quants in den Grundzustand übergeht. Die hierzu benötigten freien Neutronen entstehen durch Kernspaltung anderer Kerne im Reaktor. In diesem kernchemischen Prozess wird zunächst durch eine (n,γ)-Reaktion gefolgt von zwei β−-Zerfällen das 239Pu gebildet. In Brutreaktoren wird dieser Prozess zum Erbrüten neuen Spaltmaterials genutzt., Letzteres wird hierzu mit einer Neutronenquelle, die einen hohen Neutronenfluss besitzt, bestrahlt. Die hierbei möglichen Neutronenflüsse sind um ein Vielfaches höher als in einem Kernreaktor. Aus 239Pu wird durch vier aufeinander folgende (n,γ)-Reaktionen 243Pu gebildet, welches durch β-Zerfall mit einer Halbwertszeit von 4,96Stunden zu 243Am zerfällt. Das durch eine weitere (n,γ)-Reaktion gebildete 244Am zerfällt wiederum durch β-Zerfall mit einer Halbwertszeit von 10,1Stunden letztlich zu 244Cm. Aus 244Cm entstehen durch weitere (n,γ)-Reaktionen im Reaktor in jeweils kleiner werdenden Mengen die nächst schwereren Isotope., Die Entstehung von 250Cm auf diesem Wege ist jedoch sehr unwahrscheinlich, da 249Cm nur eine kurze Halbwertszeit besitzt und so weitere Neutroneneinfänge in der kurzen Zeit unwahrscheinlich sind., 249Bk ist das einzige Isotop des Berkeliums, das auf diese Weise gebildet werden kann. Es entsteht durch β-Zerfall aus 249Cm – das erste Curiumisotop, welches einen β-Zerfall eingeht (Halbwertszeit 64,15 min)., Durch Neutroneneinfang entsteht zwar aus 249Bk auch das 250Bk, dies zerfällt aber schon mit einer Halbwertszeit von 3,212 Stunden durch β-Zerfall zu 250Cf., Das langlebigste Isotop, das 247Bk, kann somit nicht in Kernreaktoren hergestellt werden, so dass man sich oftmals mit dem eher zugänglichen 249Bk begnügen muss. Berkelium steht heute weltweit lediglich in sehr geringen Mengen zur Verfügung, weshalb es einen sehr hohen Preis besitzt. Dieser beträgt etwa 185 US-Dollar pro Mikrogramm 249Bk., Das Isotop 248Bk wurde 1956 durch Beschuss mit 25-MeV α-Teilchen aus einem Gemisch von Curiumnukliden hergestellt. Seine Existenz mit dessen Halbwertszeit von 23±5Stunden wurde durch das β-Zerfallsprodukt 248Cf festgestellt., 247Bk wurde 1965 aus 244Cm durch Beschuss mit α-Teilchen hergestellt. Ein eventuell entstandenes Isotop 248Bk konnte nicht nachgewiesen werden., Das Berkeliumisotop 242Bk wurde 1979 durch Beschuss von 235U mit 11B, 238U mit 10B, sowie 232Th mit 14N bzw. 15N erzeugt. Es wandelt sich durch Elektroneneinfang mit einer Halbwertszeit von 7,0±1,3Minuten zum 242Cm um. Eine Suche nach einem zunächst vermuteten Isotop 241Bk blieb ohne Erfolg., Darstellung elementaren Berkeliums., Die ersten Proben von Berkeliummetall wurden 1969 durch Reduktion von BkF3 bei 1000°C mit Lithium in Reaktionsapparaturen aus Tantal hergestellt., Elementares Berkelium kann ferner auch aus BkF4 mit Lithium oder durch Reduktion von BkO2 mit Lanthan oder Thorium dargestellt werden., Eigenschaften., Im Periodensystem steht das Berkelium mit der Ordnungszahl 97 in der Reihe der Actinoide, sein Vorgänger ist das Curium, das nachfolgende Element ist das Californium.

Um der Monopolstellung der privaten Gesellschaft Große Berliner Straßenbahn (GBS) entgegenzutreten, fasste die Berliner Stadtverordnetenversammlung im Oktober 1900 den Beschluss, künftig Straßenbahnen auch auf eigene Rechnung zu betreiben. Die ersten Strecken gingen am 1.Juli 1908 in Betrieb und wurden anschließend zügig erweitert. Am 1.Dezember 1910 übernahmen die Städtischen Straßenbahnen den Betrieb auf der sogenannten \\"Flachbahn\\", die vorher von der Hochbahngesellschaft betrieben worden war. Die Netzerweiterung fand mit der Inbetriebnahme des Lindentunnels im Dezember 1916 ihren vorläufigen Abschluss. Nach der Bildung der Einheitsgemeinde Groß-Berlin wurden am 13.Dezember 1920 die Städtischen Straßenbahnen und die Berliner Elektrischen Straßenbahnen mit der Großen Berliner Straßenbahn zur Berliner Straßenbahn vereinigt. Die SSB wiesen zu diesem Zeitpunkt eine Streckenlänge von 31,2Kilometern auf und verzeichnete insgesamt 193Wagen (115Trieb- und 78Beiwagen) in ihrem Bestand., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte., Zu Beginn der 1890er Jahre bestanden in Berlin drei Pferdebahnunternehmen: die Berliner Pferde-Eisenbahn (BPfE; ab 1894 als Berlin-Charlottenburger Straßenbahn, BCS), die Große Berliner Pferde-Eisenbahn (GBPfE) und die Neue Berliner Pferdebahn (NBPf). Von diesen Gesellschaften war die GBPfE mit Abstand die größte, 1890 erbrachte sie rund 60Prozent der Verkehrsleistungen in Berlin (Stadt- und Ringbahn sowie Pferdeomnibus mit eingeschlossen). 1894baute sie ihre Position durch die Verwaltungsübernahme der NBPf aus. Im Folgejahr eröffneten Siemens &amp; Halske mit den Elektrischen Straßenbahnen in Berlin (ab 1899 als Berliner Elektrische Straßenbahnen AG, BESTAG) die erste elektrische Straßenbahnlinie in den damaligen Grenzen Berlins. Die GBPfE, die zunächst die hohen Kosten einer Netzelektrifizierung scheute, zog 1896 nach und eröffnete anlässlich der Berliner Gewerbeausstellung im Treptower Park ihre ersten elektrischen Linien. Nachdem das Unternehmen erkannte, dass die Vorteile gegenüber dem Pferdebahnbetrieb überwogen, schlossen am 2.Juli 1897 und 19.Januar 1898 die GBPfE und die NBPf auf der einen und die Stadt Berlin auf der anderen Seite einen neuen Zustimmungsvertrag ab. Kernpunkt dieses als „Umwandlungsvertrag“ bezeichneten Papiers war die Elektrifizierung des Pferdebahnnetzes. Die Stadt verbot das Aufhängen von Oberleitungen an repräsentativen Stellen, die Wagen sollten die entsprechenden Abschnitte mittels Akkumulatoren überbrücken. Der Gesellschaft wurde der Betrieb von Straßenbahnen bis zum 31.Dezember 1919 gestattet.&lt;ref name=\\"VB 5/83\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Die Generalversammlung der GBPfE änderte anlässlich der bevorstehenden Elektrifizierung am 25.Januar 1898 ihren Namen in Große Berliner Straßenbahn A.-G. (GBS) um., In einer früheren Fassung des Umwandlungsvertrags waren mehrere Neubaustrecken im Netz der GBS als Bauverpflichtung enthalten. Die Sozialdemokraten in der Berliner Stadtverordnetenversammlung äußerten dazu Bedenken, da sie eine Stärkung der GBS befürchteten. Die Stadt schrieb diese Strecken daher separat aus, woraufhin Angebote von der GBS sowie der Continentalen Gesellschaft für elektrische Unternehmungen eingingen. Von den Verhandlungen mit letzterer erhoffte sich die Stadt eine dauerhafte Konkurrenz zweier Verkehrsunternehmen und eine günstige Verkehrsentwicklung. Die Continentale Gesellschaft weigerte sich jedoch, eine dauerhafte Garantie für die Unabhängigkeit von der GBS zu geben. Stattdessen erfuhren die Stadtverordneten, dass das Unternehmen mit den hinter der GBS stehenden Firmen bereits Fusionsverhandlungen führte., Die städtische Verkehrs-Deputation zog daraufhin auf Anraten der Verhandlungskommission den Bau und Betrieb eigener Strecken in Erwägung. Zusätzlich erhoffte man, so ausreichend Erfahrungen auf dem Straßenbahnsektor zu sammeln, da nach Ablauf des Zustimmungsvertrags 1919 die Option auf den Erwerb der GBS bestand. Der gefasste Entschluss wurde kurze Zeit darauf durch zwei wesentliche Maßnahmen bekräftigt:, Am 18. Oktober 1900 fasste die Stadtverordnetenversammlung auf Antrag des Magistrats mit 113:9 Stimmen den Beschluss zum Aufbau eines städtischen Straßenbahnnetzes., Netzplanung und Eröffnung., Die von der Verkehrs-Deputation gefassten Beschlüsse sahen zunächst die Einrichtung von drei Strecken vor:, Auf Anregung des Polizeipräsidenten wurden vier weitere Strecken in die Planungen aufgenommen:, Die Deputation legte diese Pläne für ein erweitertes Netz dem Polizeipräsidenten zur Erteilung der staatlichen Genehmigung vor. Dieser äußerte in Absprache mit der Königlichen Eisenbahndirektion Berlin Bedenken gegenüber den innerstädtischen Linien, da die betroffenen Straßenzüge keinen weiteren Verkehr aufnehmen könnten. Lediglich den nördlichen Strecken vom Stettiner Bahnhof beziehungsweise Weddingplatz zur Warschauer Brücke wurde eine Realisierungsmöglichkeit bescheinigt. Die Kreuzung der Straße Unter den Linden hatte der deutsche Kaiser und preußische König WilhelmII. zuvor im April 1901 abgelehnt.&lt;ref name=\\"VB 7/80\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\\"SM 10/12\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Da die verbliebenen Strecken einen zu geringen Nutzen erwarten ließen, erweiterte die Stadt die Netzplanungen nochmals um drei weitere Linien:, Das Projekt legte man nach Billigung durch den Magistrat erneut dem Polizeipräsidenten vor. Dieser untersagte eine Benutzung der Augustabrücke über den Landwehrkanal, so dass die Linie Großgörschenstraße – Dönhoffplatz zurückgestellt werden musste. Zudem verweigerte man der Stadt die Anlage von Gleisen in der Petersburger Straße. Eine Mitbenutzung der Gleise der GBS scheiterte, da diese überhöhte finanzielle Forderungen stellte. Der Endpunkt dieser Linie lag daher vorerst an der Elbinger Straße. Weitere Änderungen gab es in der Friedrichstadt, wo die GBS erfolgreich gegen den Gleisbau in der Friedrichstraße intervenierte, und der Endpunkt der vom Kreuzberg kommenden Linie zur Behrenstraße verlegt wurde., Auf Grundlage des überarbeiteten Entwurfs wurde der Stadt am 24.Oktober 1906 die Baugenehmigung durch königliche Kabinettsorder erteilt. Bezüglich der innerstädtischen Endhaltestellen in der Krausenstraße (Dönhoffplatz) und Behrenstraße war die Stadt verpflichtet, diese zu verlegen, sofern es die Aufsichtsbehörde – die Königliche Eisenbahndirektion Berlin – für notwendig erachtete. Da in diesem Bereich zwangsläufig die Gleisanlagen der GBS und ihrer Tochtergesellschaften mitgenutzt werden mussten, hier aber noch keine Einigung bestand, konzentrierte sich die Stadt zunächst auf den Bau der Nordstrecken vom Weddingplatz beziehungsweise Stettiner Bahnhof zur Landsberger Allee, Ecke Elbinger Straße. Die Genehmigung erteilte der Polizeipräsident am 10.Januar 1907, die Stadt genehmigte einen Monat darauf die benötigten Finanzmittel. Währenddessen reiften die Planungen für eine Erweiterung dieser Linien. Für die Verlängerung nach Süden vereinbarte man mit der Neuen Berliner Straßenbahnen Nordost A.-G. die Nutzung ihrer Gleise in der Landsberger Allee. Im weiteren Verlauf sollte die Strecke durch die Ebertystraße und somit parallel zur Petersburger Straße zum Zentralviehhof geführt werden. Die Genehmigung ging am 31.Oktober 1907 ein, die erforderlichen Mittel bewilligte die Stadt am 12.Dezember 1907. Im November desselben Jahres begannen die Bauarbeiten an der Strecke., Die Arbeiten gingen schnell vonstatten, sodass die behördliche Abnahme ein halbes Jahr später am 19.Juni 1908 erfolgen konnte. Am 1.Juli fand die feierliche Eröffnung des städtischen Straßenbahnbetriebs unter Anwesenheit von Oberbürgermeister Martin Kirschner und Stadtbaurat Friedrich Krause statt. Der erste planmäßige Zug rückte kurz nach Mittag aus dem Betriebshof in der Kniprodestraße aus. Die Linienkennzeichnung erfolgte mittels farbiger Signaltafeln an den Stirnseiten der Fahrzeuge, grün für die Linie Stettiner Bahnhof – Landsberger Allee und rot/weiß für die Linie Weddingplatz – Landsberger Allee. Wenige Wochen später gingen die Verlängerungen vom Weddingplatz zum Rudolf-Virchow-Krankenhaus sowie von der Landsberger Allee zum Zentralviehhof in Betrieb. Die Streckenlänge betrug somit im ersten Jahr 10,4Kilometer. Die Baukosten beliefen sich einschließlich der Erweiterungen auf 3.106.465,75Mark., Ausbau nach Süden., Seit 1905 führte die Stadt Verhandlungen mit der Hochbahngesellschaft zur Übernahme der von ihr betriebenen Flachbahn. Diese Straßenbahnlinie verkehrte im Anschluss an die Hochbahn zwischen Warschauer Brücke und Zentralviehhof und spielte somit eine zentrale Rolle beim Ausbau des städtischen Straßenbahnnetzes in Richtung Süden. Am 28.Oktober 1909 bewilligte die Stadtverordnetenversammlung Mittel in Höhe von 700.000Mark zum Erwerb der Strecke. Die Übernahme und gleichzeitige Verlängerung der städtischen Linien erfolgte am 1.Januar 1910. Gleichzeitig nahm die Hochbahngesellschaft eine neue Straßenbahnstrecke zwischen Warschauer Brücke und Lichtenberg in Betrieb. Diese war ihr zuvor vertraglich zugesichert worden.&lt;ref name=\\"BVB 10/01\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, Am 1.Januar 1911 eröffnete die Stadt die Verlängerung von der Warschauer Brücke zur Wiener Straße nahe dem Görlitzer Bahnhof. Es folgten Verhandlungen mit der damals noch selbstständigen Stadt Neukölln über eine Erweiterung der Bahn bis zum Hermannplatz, die am 20.Dezember 1912 in Betrieb gehen konnte. Die Streckenlänge betrug nun 15,3Kilometer., Stadt und GBS einigten sich am 18. August 1911 auf einen neuen Zustimmungsvertrag und legten ihre Streitigkeiten somit weitgehend bei. Nun konnte die Stadt mit dem Bau der südlichen Streckenabschnitte beginnen. Für die Linie von der Großgörschenstraße bot sich indes mit dem Bau der Köthener Brücke eine neue Querung über den Landwehrkanal an. Als gemeinsamer Endpunkt der Südstrecken war anstelle des Dönhoffplatzes nun die Behrenstraße vorgesehen. Die Arbeiten an der Strecke Hermannplatz – Behrenstraße, die von der grünen Linie befahren werden sollte, begannen am 1.Oktober 1912.

Die Art kommt in Amerika vor, wobei der Verbreitungsschwerpunkt der Süden Nordamerikas und Mittelamerika darstellen, während das Vorkommen der Spinne nach Süden hin in Venezuela endet. Dort bewohnt sie ihrer Xerothermophilie entsprechend überwiegend trockenwarme Habitate (Lebensräume). Der Trivialname der Grünen Luchsspinne beruht auf der auffälligen Grünfärbung, die sie allerdings mit anderen Vertretern der Gattung \\"Peucetia\\" teilt. Mit einer maximalen Körperlänge von 21,6 Millimetern im Normalzustand als Weibchen ist die Art die größte in Nordamerika vorkommende Luchsspinne., Die wie alle Luchsspinnen tagaktive Grüne Luchsspinne legt ebenfalls nach Eigenart der Familie kein Spinnennetz für den Beutefang an, sondern erlegt Beutetiere entweder als aktiver Hetz- oder als Lauerjäger. Das Beutespektrum setzt sich aus anderen Gliederfüßern zusammen, wobei die Größe der Beutetiere die des Jägers deutlich übertreffen können. Die Art ist außerdem für eine als besonders geltende Methode der Abwehr gegenüber Prädatoren (Fressfeinden) bekannt. Sie ist zwecks der Verteidigung neben einem Abwehrbiss auch dazu in der Lage, Gift aus ihren Cheliceren (Kieferklauen) über mehrere Zentimeter zu versprühen. Bisher wurde dieses Verhalten jedoch nur von Weibchen beobachtet, die einen Eikokon oder Jungtiere bewachen. Der Paarung der Grünen Luchsspinne geht, wie es bei Wolfspinnenartigen (Lycosoidea) die Regel ist, ein ausgeprägtes Balzverhalten voraus. Das Weibchen betreibt eine für Spinnen ausgeprägte Brutpflege, verteidigt seine Eikokons und betreut für kurze Zeit auch seine daraus geschlüpften Nachkommen. Letztere verbleiben noch für wenige Tage beim Muttertier, ehe sie sich mittels des sogenannten Spinnenflugs ausbreiten. Die Jungtiere wachsen dann – wie für Spinnen üblich – über mehrere Fresshäute (Häutungsstadien) heran., Bisse der Grünen Luchsspinne beim Menschen sind belegt. Der Biss gilt zwar als schmerzhaft, ruft in der Regel jedoch keine medizinischen Komplikationen hervor. Die Art verhält sich für gewöhnlich gegenüber dem Menschen nicht aggressiv, wobei begattete Weibchen oder solche, die einen Eikokon oder Nachkommen bewachen, eine Ausnahme bilden. Auch das Verteidigen mittels des Verspritzens von Gift gegen Menschen ist belegt, ist jedoch auch nicht weiter gefährlich, ausgenommen, es gelangt in das Auge, wo es reizend wirkt und die Sehfähigkeit für wenige Tage einschränken kann. In der Grünen Luchsspinne wird teilweise ein Nützling im Rahmen der biologischen Schädlingsbekämpfung gesehen, da das Beutespektrum der Art auch landwirtschaftliche Schädlinge umfasst. Dieser Nutzen ist jedoch umstritten, da sich die Spinne als opportunistischer Jäger nicht auf Schädlinge spezialisiert, sondern auch andere Nützlinge erlegt., Merkmale., Die Körperlänge des Weibchens der Grünen Luchsspinne kann unbefruchtet zwischen 11,8 und 21,6 Millimeter betragen, während sie beim Männchen zwischen 8,3 und 14,5 Millimetern liegt. Im Durchschnitt ist das Weibchen mit 16,2 Millimetern somit größer als das Männchen mit 11,9 Millimetern. Nach einer Befruchtung kann die Körperlänge des Weibchens auf gut 26 Millimeter infolge der im Opisthosoma (Hinterleib) heranreifenden Eier ansteigen. Die Beinspannweite beläuft sich beim Weibchen maximal auf 70 und beim Männchen auf 65 Millimeter. Damit handelt es sich bei der Art um den größten in Nordamerika vorkommenden Vertreter der Luchsspinnen (Oxyopidae). Der grundsätzliche Körperbau der Grünen Luchsspinne gleicht dem anderer Arten der Gattung \\"Peucetia\\". Namensgebend für die Spinne ist ihre hellgrüne Grundfärbung. Prosoma (Vorderkörper) und Opisthosoma weisen eine Farbmusterung in Form von zwei dorsal (am Rücken) verlaufenden Längsreihen roter Punkte auf. Wie bei anderen Arten der Gattung kann auch bei dieser der gesamte Körper mit roten Punkten bedeckt sein. Jungtiere sind anfangs hellorange gefärbt., Der Carapax (Rückenschild des Prosomas) der Grünen Luchsspinne weist ein hell durchscheinend grünes Erscheinungsbild auf. Die höchste Erhebung dieses Körperteils sind – wie bei Luchsspinnen üblich – die acht hexagonal angelegten Augen. Dort ist er nach oben spitz zulaufend und breitet sich nach hinten weiter aus. Die Augenregion hat schwarze Bänderungen, die sich median (mittig) im Bereich des für Luchsspinnen typischen Augenhexagons hin erstrecken. Die Augenpartie ist mit weißen und dicht anliegenden Setae (chitinisierten Haaren) bedeckt. Die Augen selber erscheinen vermutlich bei vielen Exemplaren der Art rot. Mit anderen Luchsspinnen teilt die Grüne Luchsspinne die gute Sehfähigkeit, die in etwa mit der von Wolf- (Lycosidae) oder Raubspinnen (Pisauridae) vergleichbar ist. Die Gesichtsregion und das gesamte Prosoma der Spinne sind in einem hellen, durchscheinenden Grün gehalten. Mit Ausnahme der Augenregion sind dort außerdem keinerlei Setae vorhanden. Oft verlaufen von den anterior (vorne) medianen Augen bis zum unteren und ebenfalls häufig cremefarbenen Rand des Clypeus (Abschnitt zwischen den anterioren Augen und dem Carapax) dann blassere genauso cremefarbene Streifen., Die Cheliceren (Kieferklauen) sind marginal (randseitig) für gewöhnlich etwas heller gefärbt, während bei ihnen jeweils die Condyle (Ausstülpung an der Basis einer Chelicere) schwarz gefärbt ist. Innerhalb der Populationen im Osten der Vereinigten Staaten verfügen die Individuen über jeweils ein Borstenpaar, das ein Drittel des Abstands vom unteren Rand des Clypeus zu den anterior medianen Augen beträgt. Diese haben jeweils einen deutlichen schwarzen Fleck an der Basis. Ein ähnliches Borstenpaar mit schwarzen Flecken tritt innerhalb dieser Bestände in einem Drittel der Entfernung von der Basis zu den distalen (von der Körpermitte entfernt liegenden) Enden der Cheliceren auf. Bei den Populationen im Westen des Landes sind die Borsten ebenfalls vorhanden, jedoch nicht die schwarzen Flecken an der Basis der Cheliceren., Das Labium (sklerotisierte, bzw. verhärtete Platte zwischen den Maxillae und vor dem Sternum), die Maxillae (umgewandelte Coxen, bzw. Hüftglieder der Pedipalpen) und das Sternum (Brustschild des Prosomas) besitzen eine grüne Färbung., Die Beinformel lautet bei der Grünen Luchsspinne 1-2-4-3. Die langen und dünnen Beine der Grünen Luchspinne sind von gelber bis blassgrüner Grundfärbung und mit mehreren langen sowie schwarzen Borsten und ebenso schwarzen Punkten besonders im Bereich der Femora (Schenkel) versehen. Dort sind die großen Flecken auch zahlreicher vorhanden. Die Femora sind blassgrün gefärbt, wobei die distaleren Segmente heller grünlich-gelb erscheinen. Bei den Populationen der Art aus dem Osten der Vereinigten Staaten sowie aus Kalifornien befinden sich schwarze Flecken im Basisbereich der Stacheln an den Tibien (Schienen). Bei den Beständen der Spinne in den übrigen Teilen im Südwesten des Landes fehlen normalerweise diese schwarzen Flecken. Die Beine sind bei Arten der Gattung \\"Peucetia\\" mitsamt der Grünen Luchsspinne nicht selten hellrot gebändert., Das posterior (hinten) spitz zulaufende Opisthosoma der Grünen Luchsspinne erscheint im Vergleich zum Rest des Körpers etwas heller. Dorsal ist es bei der Spinne hellgrün gefärbt, die Flecken erscheinen dann kontrastierend und kreideweiß. Meistens ist auf dem Opisthosoma dorsal eine durchscheinende, grüne, kreuzförmige und manchmal weiß umrandete Zeichnung über der Herzregion vorhanden. Auch befindet sich hier oft eine doppelte Reihung von jeweils vier weißen Winkelflecken, die bei der Herzregion ansetzt und sich in posteriorer Lage fortsetzt. Diese Winkelflecken können als weiße Flecken in Erscheinung treten oder auch balkenförmig ausgebildet sein und sind gelegentlich auf nur zwei Paare in der Nähe der Herzregion reduziert. Vor allem bei Exemplaren aus dem Südwesten der Vereinigten Staaten ist der mediane Grünanteil auf der Dorsalfläche des Opisthosomas nicht selten mit einer weißen Umrandung versehen. Dieser Bereich kann aber auch, unabhängig von der geographischen Lage, blassgrün umrandet sein. Lateral (seitlich) weist das Opisthosoma eine blassgrüne Grundfärbung sowie ebenfalls insbesondere bei den Beständen im Südwesten der Vereinigten Staaten einen weißen Längsstreifen entlang des ventralen (am Bauch liegenden) Eckpunkts des Opisthosomas auf. Auf der Ventralseite dieses Körperabschnitts verläuft median ein grüner Längsstreifen, der zusätzlich mit vielen weißen Pigmenten versehen ist und von ebenso weißen Streifen umrahmt sein kann. Genauso können die weißen Pigmente auch selber zu dann kreideweißen Streifen verwachsen sein, die dann jeweils auf beiden Seiten den grünen Längsstreifen flankieren. In seitliche Richtung geht die Farbgebung der Ventralfläche von dem Opisthosoma entlang des ventralen weißen Längsstreifens in ein Blassgrün über., Sexualdimorphismus., Die Grüne Luchsspinne weist wie viele Spinnen einen ausgeprägten Sexualdimorphismus auf, der hier im Vergleich zu anderen Spinnen jedoch deutlich schwächer ausgebildet ist. Dieser Dimorphismus macht sich neben der jeweiligen Farbgebung besonders in Dimension und der Form von Männchen und Weibchen bemerkbar. So ist der Körper beim Männchen deutlich schmaler., Sowohl Prosoma als auch Opisthosoma des Männchens der Grünen Luchsspinne erscheinen ähnlich wie beim Weibchen in einem transparenten Grün, das hier jedoch deutlicher erscheint. Wie beim Weibchen sind ebenfalls beim Männchen schwarze Bänder im Bereich der Augen vorhanden, die sich bis zur Mitte des Augenhexagons erstrecken. Auch ist beim männlichen Tier die Augenpartie mit dicht anliegenden weißen Setae bedeckt., Die Beine, das Labium, die Maxillae und Sternum hingegen erscheinen bei beiden Geschlechtern gleich. Die Beine sind allerdings je nach Geschlecht unterschiedlich lang. So erreicht das erste Beinpaar beim Weibchen eine gesamte Länge von 22,9 bis 38,7 und durchschnittlich 30,96 ± 65 Millimetern. Beim Männchen kann dieses Beinpaar eine Länge von 27,1 bis 42,9 und im Durchschnitt 33,67 ± 67 Millimetern erreichen., Genitalmorphologische Merkmale., Bei den Pedipalpen (umgewandelte Extremitäten im Kopfbereich) vom Männchen der Grünen Luchsspinne befindet sich je eine: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Luchsspinnen, Grüne Luchsspinne, Peucetia viridans, Amerika, Xerothermophilie, Spinne, Beutefang, Hetzjäger, Lauerjäger, Abwehrbiss, Balzverhalten."},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Aufgelöst 1919, Ehemaliges Verkehrsunternehmen (Berlin), Gegründet 1865, Straßenbahn Berlin, Straßenbahnbetrieb (Deutschland)], Die Berlin-Charlottenburger Straßenbahn (BCS) war ein privates Straßenbahnunternehmen im Großraum Berlin. Sie wurde 1865 als Berliner Pferde-Eisenbahn (BPfE) gegründet und 1894 anlässlich der bevorstehenden Elektrifizierung umbenannt. Die von ihr am 22.Juni 1865 eröffnete Linie zwischen dem Brandenburger Tor in Berlin und der bis 1920 selbstständigen Stadt Charlottenburg war die erste Straßenbahnlinie Deutschlands. Bis 1914 weitete die Gesellschaft ihr Netz vor allem innerhalb Charlottenburgs aus. Die Linien führten darüber hinaus bis in die Berliner Innenstadt, nach Spandau, Weißensee und Neukölln. Im Jahr 1900 erwarb die konkurrierende Große Berliner Straßenbahn drei Viertel der Anteile an der BCS und übernahm ab 1907 deren Verwaltung. Die vollständige Übernahme fand 1919 statt. Während der zentrale Abschnitt der ersten Strecke der Gesellschaft durch den Großen Tiergarten in den 1930er-Jahren dem Ausbau der Ost-West-Achse zum Opfer fiel, wurde der westliche Ast bis zur Stilllegung des West-Berliner Straßenbahnnetzes am 2.Oktober 1967 befahren. Ein ebenfalls 1865 eröffnetes Teilstück in der Dorotheenstraße ist als der älteste noch vorhandene Streckenabschnitt im Netz der Berliner Straßenbahn in Betrieb., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte und Eröffnung., Am 26.November 1832 ging mit der New York and Harlem Railroad die weltweit erste Straßenbahn in Betrieb. In Europa verbreitete sich das neue Verkehrsmittel ab 1854 zuerst in Paris. Den öffentlichen Nahverkehr in Berlin bewerkstelligten zu dieser Zeit eine Vielzahl an Fuhrunternehmern mit Droschken und Pferdeomnibussen. Das Berliner Polizeipräsidium wünschte daher eine „Centralisation des sämtlichen öffentlichen Fuhrwesens“, indem es die erforderlichen Konzessionen an einen einzelnen Unternehmer vergab. 1858 trat der französische Staatsrat Carteret mit dem Präsidium in Verbindung. Er schlug ein flächendeckendes Netz aus Pferdeomnibussen und -bahnen vor. Das Vorhaben scheiterte, da Carteret die erforderlichen Mittel nicht aufbringen konnte. Die ihm erteilten Konzessionen erloschen zum 1.Dezember 1859.&lt;ref name=\\"BVB 11/76\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, 1863 traten der württembergische Ingenieur von Binger und der dänische Ingenieur Møller auf den Plan.&lt;ref name=\\"BVA 5/55\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Møller hatte 1862 die königliche Bewilligung für die Einrichtung einer Pferdebahnlinie in Kopenhagen erhalten, musste sein Vorhaben aber wieder fallen lassen. Zeitgleich stand er mit dem Hamburger Senat und dem Berliner Polizeipräsidium für zwei ähnliche Projekte in Verbindung. Der preußische Handelsminister von Itzenplitz stand Møllers Plänen einer Bahn von Berlin nach Charlottenburg nicht abgeneigt gegenüber. Auf Anraten der Behörden musste dieser jedoch die geplante Streckenführung durch das Brandenburger Tor und den Boulevard Unter den Linden aufgeben und stattdessen eine Streckenführung durch die Sommerstraße und Dorotheenstraße wählen. Hierfür war ein zusätzlicher Durchbruch durch die Berliner Zollmauer vonnöten. Der Endpunkt sollte sich Am Kupfergraben befinden. Am 23.März 1864 erteilte der Minister Møller die Konzession. Die Konzessionsdauer war auf Wunsch Møllers von fünf auf zehn Jahre ausgedehnt worden. Neben der Linie Kupfergraben– Charlottenburg war Møller die Einrichtung einer Zweiglinie vom Brandenburger Tor über das Kroll’sche Etablissement und die Ausflugsgaststätte In den Zelten zum Kleinen Stern und einer weiteren Linie vom Dönhoffplatz durch die Leipziger Straße und Potsdamer Straße nach Schöneberg gestattet worden., Zur Finanzierung der Bahn wurde die Übertragung der Konzession auf eine Gesellschaft zugelassen. Am 11.Mai 1864 gründete sich die \\"Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien in Firma Berliner Pferdeeisenbahn-Gesellschaft E.Besckow\\", die sämtliche Rechte und Pflichten übernahm. Die Gebrüder Ernst und Wilhelm Besckow waren Fuhrunternehmer aus Berlin. Das Grundkapital sollte für beide Linien 510.000Taler (1.530.000Mark) betragen. Die Gesellschaft brachte jedoch nur das für die Charlottenburger Linie erforderliche Kapital von 280.000Talern (840.000Mark) zusammen, sodass der Bau der Schöneberger Linie zunächst unterblieb. Møller soll die Konzession dieser Linie zunächst behalten und sie 1872 an die Große Internationale Pferde-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft übertragen haben., Neben der vom Polizeipräsidenten ausgestellten Konzessionsurkunde musste die Gesellschaft die straßenbaupolizeiliche Genehmigung zur Anlage von Pferdebahnen beantragen und die Zustimmung des Straßeneigentümers zur Benutzung einholen. Bis zum 31.Dezember 1875 oblag die erste Maßnahme ebenfalls dem Berliner Polizeipräsidium, für die Zustimmung war bis zum gleichen Zeitpunkt die Königliche Ministerial-Bau-Commission zuständig. Durch Kabinettsorder vom 28.Dezember 1875 unterstand die Straßenbaupolizei mit Jahresbeginn 1876 den Städten, ebenso gingen die meisten Straßen in das Eigentum der Städte über. Unberührt hiervon blieben diverse Landstraßen und die Straße Unter den Linden.&lt;ref name=\\"VB 4/85\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, Der Bau der Strecke begann im Januar 1865. Knapp einen Monat vor der Inbetriebnahme gab der Berliner Polizeipräsident eine Verordnung über den Betrieb der Pferdeeisenbahn heraus. Die 42Paragraphen umfassende Vorschrift regelte unter anderem die Beschriftung der Wagen, Dienstkleidung und die Beförderungsbedingungen. Die Kutscher waren dazu angehalten, nicht schneller als im Trab zu fahren, vor Straßenkreuzungen war Schritt vorgeschrieben. Frauen war darüber hinaus das Betreten des Oberdecks untersagt, diese Regelung wurde erst im Vorfeld der Berliner Gewerbeausstellung 1896 aufgehoben. Gegenüber den Torwagen („Kremser“), die häufig nur bei voller Besetzung abfuhren, war den Kutschern das Auffordern von Passanten zur Mitfahrt untersagt. War die Weiterfahrt durch Hindernisse, die nicht augenblicklich beseitigt werden konnten, unterbrochen, sollten die Wagen aus den Schienen herausgehoben und die Stelle umfahren werden. Bei Fahrten in Kolonne sollten mindestens 60Schritte, bei stehenden Wagen mindestens zehn Schritte Abstand gehalten werden, damit die Zugpferde die Wagen nicht anknabberten., Am 22.Juni 1865 ging der erste Abschnitt zwischen Brandenburger Tor und dem Straßenbahnhof in Charlottenburg in Betrieb. Zwei Monate darauf folgte am 28.August die Verlängerung der Bahn vom Brandenburger Tor zum Kupfergraben. Die Strecke war zunächst eingleisig mit acht Ausweichen angelegt. Der Streckenverlauf führte von der Dorotheenstraße über Sommerstraße, Charlottenburger Chaussee, Berliner Straße und Spandauer Berg zur Ecke Sophie-Charlotte-Straße. Ausweichmöglichkeiten gab es an den Endstellen sowie an der Kreuzung Dorotheenstraße Ecke Neue Wilhelmstraße, in der Sommerstraße, am Großen Stern, an der Grenze zu Charlottenburg, am Knie, am Wilhelmplatz und am Luisenplatz., Die 1865 ebenfalls genehmigte Zweigstrecke Zu den Zelten konnte 1866 oder 1872 eröffnet werden. Sie blieb wegen mangelnder Rentabilität nur bis 1874 oder 1875 in Betrieb., Ausbau des Streckennetzes., Trotz des anfangs hohen Fahrpreises von zweieinhalb Silbergroschen (25[Reichs-]Pfennig; 1901 kostete die gleiche Fahrt 10Pfennig) erwies sich die Bahn als Erfolg. Im ersten vollen Betriebsjahr 1866 transportierte sie rund 960.000Fahrgäste; wobei eine außerordentliche Belastung im Ausflugsverkehr in die damals noch als Sommerfrische geltende Stadt Charlottenburg zu beobachten war. Während im Januar 1866 46.560Fahrgäste die Pferdebahn nutzten, waren es im August desselben Jahres 165.230. Der Schriftsteller Hans Wachenhusen schilderte eine solche Ausflugsfahrt während der ersten Betriebsjahre. Am Kupfergraben waren an solchen Tagen mehrere Hundert Menschen an der Haltestelle zu beobachten, ein Zustieg entlang der Strecke war nahezu unmöglich. Zeitungen berichteten, dass die für 45–50Personen zugelassenen Wagen teilweise bis zu 93Fahrgäste aufnehmen mussten. Da dadurch wiederum der Fahrplan nur bedingt einzuhalten war, ergab sich kaum eine Zeitersparnis gegenüber den Fußgängern auf gleicher Strecke. Die Satireschrift Kladderadatsch nahm diese Umstände zum Anlass ein „Reglement zur Benutzung der Berliner Pferdebahn“ herauszugeben, in dem beispielsweise für Fußgänger, die Pferdebahnwagen überholten, eine Übereilungsstrafe von fünf Silbergroschen vorgesehen war., Im Jahr 1871 ließ die Terrain-Gesellschaft Westend H.Quistorp&amp;Co. auf eigene Kosten eine eingleisige Strecke vom Pferdebahnhof in die Villenkolonie Westend anlegen. Die Betriebsführung übertrug sie der BPfE. Die Strecke war 1,4Kilometer lang und wies auf einer Länge von 620Metern eine Steigung von 33,3Promille auf. Die Bedienung erfolgte mit einer Pendellinie ab dem Pferdebahnhof, da die auf der Hauptlinie eingesetzten zweispännigen Decksitzwagen außerstande waren, die Steigung zu bewältigen. Im gleichen Jahr gründete sich die Große Berliner Pferde-Eisenbahn-Aktien-Gesellschaft (GBPfE), die beginnend ab 1873 mehrere Strecken von Berlin in die Vororte eröffnete., Nach Ablauf der ersten Konzession firmierte das Unternehmen ab 1875 unter dem Namen \\"Berliner Pferde-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, Kommandit-Gesellschaft auf Aktien J.Lestmann&amp;Co.\\" Im gleichen Jahr ging eine Zweigstrecke vom Großen Stern über Fasanerieallee und Corneliusbrücke zum Haupteingang des Zoologischen Gartens in Betrieb. Die Hauptstrecke erhielt durchgehend ein zweites Streckengleis. Es folgten weitere Strecken von Westend zum Spandauer Bock (1879), vom Knie über die Hardenbergstraße zum Zoologischen Garten (1880), über die Rankestraße zum Joachimsthalschen Gymnasium (1881), vom Kurfürstendamm zum Lützowplatz (1885), vom Wilhelmplatz über die Wilmersdorfer Straße zum Stadtbahnhof (1887) sowie vom Knie über Marchstraße, Gotzkowskybrücke und Alt-Moabit nach Moabit, Paulstraße (1890). Mit der Stadt Berlin schloss das Unternehmen am 7.Mai 1881 einen neuen Zustimmungsvertrag bis zum 31.Dezember 1909 ab, der unter anderem die Genehmigung zur Anlage neuer Linien enthielt., Häufiger Traktionswechsel., Der Betrieb als Pferdebahn zeigte schnell die Grenzen dieser Traktionsart auf. Um die Leistungsfähigkeit zu erhöhen, experimentierte die BPfE mehrfach mit unterschiedlichen Antriebsmöglichkeiten. Ab dem 20.April 1878 setzte die BPfE auf der Strecke Brandenburger Tor– Pferdebahnhof zwei Kastendampflokomotiven von: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Aufgelöst, Verkehrsunternehmen, Berlin, Gegründet, 1865, Straßenbahn, Berlin-Charlottenburger, Großraum, Deutschland, Geschichte, Vorgeschichte"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Herzogtum, Herzogtum (Historisches Territorium in Deutschland), Historisches Territorium (Bayern), Straubing-Holland, Weltliches Reichsfürstentum], Das wittelsbachische Teilherzogtum Straubing-Holland (auch \\"Niederbayern-Straubing-Holland, Niederbayern-Straubing, Bayern-Straubing-Holland\\" oder Bayern-Straubing) umfasste Teile des heutigen Niederbayern und der östlichen Oberpfalz („Straubinger Ländchen“) sowie die niederländischen Grafschaften Hennegau, Holland, Zeeland und Friesland. Es bestand von 1353 bis 1425/29 und wurde von Straubing und Den Haag aus regiert. Das Herzogtum entstand in der Folge der wittelsbachischen Erbteilungen nach dem Tod des römisch-deutschen Kaisers Ludwigs des Bayern und zerfiel, als die Straubinger Linie im Mannesstamm ausstarb. Unter der Herrschaft der Herzöge von Straubing-Holland, die durch Ehebündnisse mit allen bedeutenden Nachbarn verbunden waren, wurde die Grundlage der niederländischen See- und Handelsmacht gelegt., Zeitgeschichtlicher Hintergrund., Mit Ludwig dem Bayern, dem Stammvater des Hauses Straubing-Holland, hatte 1314 erstmals ein Wittelsbacher den Thron des Heiligen Römischen Reiches bestiegen. Seine Position war aber aufgrund der gleichzeitigen Wahl des Habsburgers Friedrichs des Schönen alles andere als sicher. Umso wichtiger war daher eine energische Hausmachtpolitik Ludwigs. Er sicherte sich die Mark Brandenburg und Tirol und erwarb durch seine Ehe mit der Tochter Wilhelms III. von Avesnes Ansprüche auf Hennegau, Holland und Seeland. Durch diese Ehe wurde er Schwager des jungen Königs von England, Eduard III., der sich massiv im Reich engagierte. Eduard beanspruchte als Enkel König Philipps IV. die französische Krone und wollte Partner für seinen Krieg gegen Frankreich gewinnen., Die letzten Regierungsjahre Kaiser Ludwigs waren von einer Schaukelpolitik zwischen Eduard und dessen französischem Kontrahenten Philipp VI. geprägt. Es gelang ihm zwar, sich aus dem 1337 ausbrechenden Hundertjährigen Krieg zwischen England und Frankreich weitgehend herauszuhalten, die Reichsfürsten waren aber dennoch unzufrieden und wählten 1346 den Luxemburger Karl IV. zum König. Ludwigs überraschender Tod im Oktober des darauffolgenden Jahres entschied die Machtfrage zugunsten des Hauses Luxemburg, die für die nächsten neunzig Jahre mit einer wittelsbachischen Unterbrechung den römisch-deutschen König stellen sollten. Das Jahr 1347 erlangte aber noch in ganz anderer Hinsicht Bedeutung: Der Schwarze Tod erreichte Europa und führte zu einem massiven Bevölkerungsrückgang., Geschichte., Entstehung., 1345 war Wilhelm von Avesnes, der letzte Graf von Hennegau, Holland, Seeland und Friesland, im Kampf gegen aufständische Friesen gefallen. Kaiser Ludwig der Bayer sicherte daraufhin seiner Dynastie die freiwerdenden Territorien. Er belehnte kurzerhand seine zweite Ehefrau Margarethe, die älteste Schwester Wilhelms, mit den Grafschaften. Die Erbansprüche der anderen Schwestern und die Tatsache, dass das Frauenerbrecht nur im Hennegau, aber nicht in Holland und Seeland üblich war, überging der Wittelsbacher. Der englische König Eduard III., der mit Margarethes Schwester Philippa von Hennegau verheiratet war, verzichtete auf die Grafschaften, da er Ludwigs Unterstützung für seinen Krieg mit Frankreich nicht verlieren wollte., Erwartungsgemäß kam es zu Schwierigkeiten. Margarethe musste ihren erst fünfzehnjährigen Sohn Wilhelm I. als Stellvertreter einsetzen, um die aufgebrachten Stände zu beruhigen. 1346 erließ Ludwig der Bayer eine Erbschaftsregelung, in der er festlegte, dass Wilhelm beim Tod seiner Mutter die Herrschaft in den neu erworbenen Territorien übernehmen sollte. Im Fall seines Ablebens würden die Länder an Albrecht I. fallen, seinen dritten Sohn mit Margarethe. Ludwig der Römer als ältester Sohn Margarethes verzichtete auf das niederländische Erbe. Kaiser Ludwig der Bayer starb bereits ein Jahr später auf der Jagd in der Nähe des Klosters Fürstenfeld. Seine sechs Söhne wurden seine Nachfolger., Regierung Wilhelms I. und Albrechts I.., Ludwigs Söhne teilten 1349 im Landsberger Vertrag das Erbe ihres Vaters unter sich auf. Stephan II., Wilhelm I. und Albrecht I. erhielten Niederbayern, Wilhelm und Albrecht außerdem die niederländischen Besitzungen. Die beiden jüngeren Brüder Wilhelm und Albrecht verlangten von Stephan bald eine genauere Abgrenzung ihres niederbayerischen Erbes. Diese erfolgte am 3. Juni 1353 im Regensburger Vertrag. Stephan II. erhielt den Süden Niederbayerns mit der Hauptstadt Landshut, während Wilhelm und Albrecht das so genannte Straubinger Ländchen zugewiesen bekamen., Dieses Gebiet erstreckte sich als ein breites Band zu beiden Seiten der Donau von Kelheim im Westen bis Schärding im Osten, und von Furth im Wald im Norden bis Dingolfing im Süden. Es zeichnete sich durch eine im Vergleich zu anderen Territorien jener Zeit erstaunliche Geschlossenheit aus. Das Straubinger Ländchen war zwar finanziell weniger ertragreich als das reichere Landshuter Gebiet, aber etwa genauso groß wie dieses. Die Grafschaften Hennegau, Holland und Seeland waren nicht Gegenstand dieses Vertrages, weil sie ja schon 1346 von Ludwig dem Bayern ausdrücklich an Wilhelm und Albrecht vererbt worden waren. Dies war die Geburtsstunde des Herzogtums Niederbayern-Straubing-Holland., Zwischen den beiden Brüdern Wilhelm und Albrecht kam es zu keiner weiteren Landesteilung. Sie vereinbarten lediglich eine faktische Trennung ihrer Interessenbereiche. Während sich Wilhelm ganz auf die niederländischen Territorien konzentrieren wollte, in denen er schon seit einigen Jahren als Statthalter seiner Mutter regierte, übernahm Albrecht Niederbayern-Straubing. Nach dem Ende der ersten Phase des Haken-und-Kabeljau-Krieges beherrschte Wilhelm seit 1354 Holland, Seeland und Friesland, seine Mutter den Hennegau. Mit dem Tod Margarethes 1356 fiel auch Hennegau an Wilhelm. 1357 gab Albrecht während eines Konfliktes mit Böhmen die Stadt Schärding den Habsburgern als Pfand, gewann sie aber später im Frieden von Schärding wieder zurück., Alleinregierung Albrechts I.., Der junge Herrscher Albrecht hatte gerade begonnen, eine neue, standesgemäße Herzogsburg errichten zu lassen, als er Ende 1357 in die Niederlande abberufen wurde. Sein Bruder hatte einen Schlaganfall erlitten, von dem er sich nicht wieder erholte. Er galt von da an als geisteskrank und regierungsunfähig., Die niederländischen Stände wandten sich nun hilfesuchend an Albrecht, den nächsten Erbberechtigten. Der scheint nicht gezögert zu haben, sein Straubinger Territorium zu verlassen und reiste Richtung Den Haag. Er wurde von einer Gruppe niederbayerischer Adeliger begleitet, die im Norden hohe Verwaltungsposten einnehmen sollten. Albrecht fand dort alles andere als geordnete Zustände vor. Ihm gelang es jedoch durch eine kluge, auf Ausgleich und Wirtschaftsförderung bedachte Politik, die Herrschaft der Wittelsbacher im Norden sowohl gegen aufständische Friesen zu sichern als auch die Parteikämpfe zwischen altadligen „Hoeken“ und städtischen „Kabeljauwen“ vorläufig zu beenden. Sein regierungsunfähiger Bruder Wilhelm fristete den Rest seines noch recht langen Lebens im hennegauischen Schloss Le Quesnoy, bevor er 1389 starb., Außenpolitisch bemühte sich Albrecht um Neutralität und möglichst vielseitige Bündnisse mit den Nachbarn seiner Territorien. Seinen jüngsten Sohn Johann III. ließ er im Alter von kaum fünfzehn Jahren auf den Bischofsstuhl von Lüttich wählen. Johann amtierte fast drei Jahrzehnte lang als Fürstelekt, ohne jemals die Bischofsweihe empfangen zu haben., Insbesondere Albrechts ehrgeizige Heiratspolitik fand weithin Beachtung. Die von ihm organisierte Doppelhochzeit von Cambrai im Jahr 1385, bei der sein ältester Sohn Wilhelm II. eine Tochter des mächtigen Burgunderherzogs Philipps des Kühnen heiratete und sich dessen Sohn Johann Ohnefurcht gleichzeitig mit Albrechts Tochter Margarete vermählte, war ein Großereignis von europäischem Rang. Die gut 20.000 geladenen Gäste, die sich in den Straßen von Cambrai drängten, feierten acht Tage lang. Sie konnten dabei auf so hochrangige Gratulanten wie den französischen König Karl VI. treffen., Albrechts zweiter Sohn Albrecht II. übernahm ab 1387 die Statthalterschaft in Niederbayern-Straubing. Er starb jedoch bereits nach 10-jähriger Regierungszeit im Jahr 1397, sodass die Statthalterschaft an Johann III. überging. Dieser hielt sich aber höchst selten in Straubing auf, weil er von turbulenten Ereignissen in den Niederlanden in Atem gehalten wurde. So wurde Niederbayern-Straubing wieder von Pflegern und Viztumen regiert, von denen einige zu beträchtlichem Einfluss gelangten. Als Albrecht I. 1404 nach 50-jähriger Herrschaftszeit starb, befand sich sein Herzogtum in einem sowohl innenpolitisch stabilen als auch wirtschaftlich prosperierenden Zustand., Regierung Wilhelms II. und Johanns III.., Die Nachfolge trat nun Albrechts ältester Sohn Wilhelm II. an, der von seinem Vater die Grafschaften Hennegau, Holland und Seeland erbte, die Verwaltung über Niederbayern-Straubing besorgte weiterhin Johann III., ohne dass es zu einer Erbteilung kam., Nach dem unerwarteten Tod Wilhelms II. im Jahr 1417 kam es zu erbitterten Machtkämpfen. Wilhelm hatte seine Tochter Jakobäa als Erbin der niederländischen Gebiete eingesetzt. Johann erkannte ihre Ansprüche jedoch nicht an und wollte die alleinige Macht im Herzogtum Straubing-Holland übernehmen. Reichsrecht, die Gebräuche in Holland und Seeland sowie die Hausverträge der Familie Wittelsbach waren dabei auf seiner Seite, und auch die städtisch-bürgerliche Partei der Kabeljauwen unterstützte ihn in der Hoffnung auf mehr politisches Mitspracherecht. Nachdem Johann gezeigt hatte, dass er seine Forderungen auch militärisch durchsetzen konnte, musste ihm die hartnäckig um ihr Erbe kämpfende Jakobäa stückweise die Macht über ihre Länder einräumen. Ihre wechselnden Ehebündnisse mit Frankreich, Brabant und England hatten der selbstbewussten Fürstin nicht die Hilfe eingebracht, die sie sich erhofft hatte., König Sigismund belehnte den ehemaligen Lütticher Elekten, der inzwischen sein Bistum aufgegeben und die Kaisernichte Elisabeth von Görlitz geheiratet hatte, gerne mit den niederländischen Territorien. Er befürchtete nicht zu Unrecht, dass sie unter Jakobäa allzu sehr unter die Vorherrschaft Frankreichs und Burgunds geraten würden. Johann sollte der letzte Herzog von Straubing-Holland sein. Er entfaltete in den wenigen Jahren, die ihm noch blieben, eine rege Tätigkeit. Johann förderte Künstler wie den Maler Jan van Eyck und ließ das Straubinger Schloss ausbauen.

Sie wurde zunächst als Pferdestraßenbahn, portugiesisch: \\"Carros americanos,\\" eröffnet und wird seit 1901 elektrisch betrieben. Die mit Gleisen der Spurweite von 900Millimetern ausgerüstete Straßenbahn ist wegen ihres teilweise historischen Fahrzeugparks und der reizvollen Streckenführung mit steilen Abschnitten und engen Kurven durch die schmalen Gassen der Lissabonner Altstadt vor allem bei Touristen beliebt. Nach der Stilllegung von zwölf Linien in den 1990er Jahren verkehren zurzeit noch sechs Linien mit zusammen 33,6Kilometern Länge. Das Streckennetz ist heute noch 25Kilometer lang., Das Verkehrsunternehmen \\"Companhia Carris de Ferro de Lisboa\\", kurz Carris, betreibt die Straßenbahn der portugiesischen Hauptstadt. Die Gesellschaft befindet sich seit der Nelkenrevolution von 1974 im Besitz der Stadt und betreibt auch einen Großteil des städtischen Omnibusnetzes, den Aufzug Elevador de Santa Justa sowie drei Standseilbahnen., Geschichte., Pferdebahn., Als Vorläufer der heutigen Straßenbahn ging am 17. November 1873 eine normalspurige Pferdebahn in Betrieb. Vorgespannt waren allerdings meist Maultiere. Die erste Strecke wurde zwischen dem 1865 eröffneten Bahnhof Lissabon Santa Apolónia und Santos eingerichtet. Aufgrund der Herkunft der Wagen wurde die Pferdebahn auf Portugiesisch als \\"Carro americano\\" bezeichnet. Nach dem 1872 eröffneten Betrieb in Porto war dies die zweite Straßenbahn des Landes. Betreiber war die 1872 in Rio de Janeiro gegründete \\"Companhia Carris de Ferro de Lisboa\\", für die sich schnell die noch heute verwendete Kurzform \\"Carris\\" einbürgerte., Rasch baute das Unternehmen sein Streckennetz aus. Die Strecke nach Santos wurde 1874 entlang des Tejoufers bis Belém verlängert, 1878 folgte der lange Abschnitt von Belém weiter bis in den Vorort Algés. Im gleichen Jahr wurde der Rossio in der Innenstadt erreicht. Es folgten 1879 die Strecken zum \\"Largo do Rato\\" und 1881 nach Anjos. Nach einer Pause von mehreren Jahren gingen ab Ende der 1880er Jahre weitere Strecken in die Vororte in Betrieb, 1888 als erstes die Strecke nach Poço do Bispo. 1890folgte die lange Strecke in den Norden der Stadt bis Lumiar und 1891 die beiden Strecken nach Benfica und Areeiro. Mit diesen Strecken erschloss die Pferdebahn bereits einen großen Teil der Stadt. Verschlossen blieben ihr allerdings die hügeligen Teile der Altstadt, vor allem Alfama und Lapa., Das erste Depot wurde zur Betriebseröffnung 1873 in Santo Amaro eingerichtet, wo sich auch heute noch das letzte verbliebene Straßenbahndepot befindet. 1882folgte ein zweites Depot in Arco do Cego. Neben den Fahrzeugen waren für den Betrieb zudem bis zu 1200 Maultiere erforderlich., Ein Experiment mit einer Dampfstraßenbahn zwischen Cais do Sodré und Belém in den Jahren 1889 bis 1892 hatte keinen dauerhaften Erfolg. Zuvor hatte die Carris bereits von 1887/1888 Versuche mit Akkumulatorwagen gemacht, die aber nicht zu dauerhaften Einführung dieses Systems führten., Standseilbahnen., Zwecks Erschließung der steileren Teile der Stadt begann zunächst der Bau dreier Standseilbahnen. Diese Linien, \\"Lavra,\\" \\"Glória\\" und \\"Bica\\", gingen in den Jahren 1884, 1885 und 1892 in Betrieb und verkehren bis heute. Erstmals in Lissabon kam bei ihnen die seltene Spurweite von 900Millimetern zur Anwendung. Die beiden älteren Bahnen wurden von der \\"Companhia dos Ascensores Mecânicos\\" betrieben, die Bica-Standseilbahn von der \\"Nova Companhia dos Ascensores Mecânicos de Lisboa\\", abgekürzt \\"NCAML\\". Beide Betreiber fusionierten 1897 unter dem Namen der jüngeren Gesellschaft., Kabelstraßenbahnen., Für längere Strecken war die Standseilbahn ungeeignet, hier bot die Kabelstraßenbahn eine Alternative. Bei ihr werden mehrere Fahrzeuge an ein kontinuierlich in einem Kanal unter der Oberfläche laufendes Stahlseil angeklammert. Die NCAML, die bereits die Bica-Standseilbahn betrieb, beantragte und erhielt die erforderlichen Konzessionen und richtete ab 1890 zunächst zwei Strecken nach Plänen des portugiesischen Ingenieurs Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard ein, der bereits die Lissabonner Standseilbahnen geplant hatte., Elevador da Estrela., Die erste, bereits am 14. August 1890 in Betrieb genommene Linie war 1,7 Kilometer lang und verlief von der Praça Luís de Camões zum \\"Largo da Estrela\\". Gebaut wurde die Strecke von der Maschinenfabrik Esslingen, entsprechend den bereits gebauten Standseilbahnen mit einer Spurweite von 900Millimetern. An der Endstelle Estrela richtete die Gesellschaft ein kleines Depot ein. Da auf der Estrela-Strecke Einrichtungsfahrzeuge eingesetzt wurden, gab es dort eine Drehscheibe und an der Praça Luís de Camões eine Wendeschleife., Elevador da Graça., Die zweite Kabelbahn, ebenfalls mit 900 Millimeter Spurweite, führte von der \\"Rua da Palma\\" auf einer 730Meter langen Strecke zum \\"Largo da Graça\\" und überwand dabei 75Meter Höhenunterschied. Sie wurde am 27.Februar 1893 eröffnet und ebenfalls von der Maschinenfabrik Esslingen erbaut. Das Depot wurde an der Endstelle Graça eingerichtet. Die Graça-Strecke wurde mit Zweirichtungsfahrzeugen bedient., Elevador de São Sebastião., Von 1899 an verkehrte eine dritte Kabelstraßenbahnlinie zwischen \\"São Sebastião\\" und \\"Rossio\\", die aber bereits 1903 durch die elektrische Straßenbahn ersetzt wurde. Über diese etwa 400Meter lange Strecke ist kaum mehr Konkretes bekannt., Elektrifizierung der Pferdebahn., Nachdem die Stadt Lissabon ein Jahr zuvor den entsprechenden Planungen zugestimmt hatte, beschloss das Unternehmen 1898 die Elektrifizierung der Pferdebahn. In einem Vertrag mit der Stadt wurden zudem zusätzliche Strecken in die hügeligen Teile Lissabons vereinbart, deren Erschließung zuvor nicht möglich war. Die Carris wurde mitsamt dem gesamten Netz zwecks Kapitalbeschaffung an die 1899 neu gegründete \\"Lisbon Electric Tramways Ltd.\\" aus Großbritannien, eine Tochtergesellschaft der \\"Wernher, Beit &amp; Co.\\", für 99 Jahre verpachtet. Zur Stromversorgung baute die Gesellschaft am Tejoufer im Stadtteil Santos ein eigenes Kraftwerk, das bis 1951 die gesamte Stromversorgung der Straßenbahn übernahm., Bereits im Vorfeld der Elektrifizierung begann die Carris ab 1894 mit der Umspurung aller Strecken auf die bis heute verwendete Spurweite von 900Millimetern, vor allem wegen der damit möglichen engeren Radien als Voraussetzung zur Erschließung der engen Altstadtstraßen. Diese Maßnahme konnte im Mai 1900 abgeschlossen werden. Zudem wurden die Gleise der Pferdebahn zuvor angesichts der schlecht gepflasterten Straßen häufig von Pferdeomnibussen mitgenutzt. Mit der Umspurung gelang es der Carris, diese Konkurrenz und den damit verbundenen erhöhten Verschleiß der Gleise zu verhindern., Am 31. August 1901 nahm die erste elektrische Straßenbahn ihren Betrieb auf der Strecke zwischen dem Bahnhof Lissabon Cais do Sodré und Algés auf. Die erste Strecke der Pferdebahn war damit auch die erste elektrisch betriebene Strecke. Damit erhielt Lissabon als zweite Stadt in Portugal eine elektrische Straßenbahn, nachdem die Straßenbahn Porto bereits 1895 als erste elektrische Straßenbahn des Landes ihren Betrieb aufgenommen hatte. Ein Jahr später waren alle Strecken elektrifiziert und am 10.August 1902 beendete das letzte Maultier seinen Dienst. Bis 1907 wurde das Netz rasch ausgebaut, seit 1906 erschloss die Bahn auch die steilen Straßen der Alfama., Elektrifizierung der Kabelbahn., 1912 übernahm die Carris auch die NCAML und damit alle Kabel- und Standseilbahnen. Die Kabelstraßenbahn zum \\"Largo da Graça\\" war bereits 1909 eingestellt worden, die letzte Kabelstraßenbahn verkehrte in Lissabon am 3.Juli 1913 zwischen der \\"Praça Luis de Camões\\" und dem \\"Largo de Estrela\\". In den Jahren von 1913 bis 1915 wurden beide Strecken auf regulären elektrischen Straßenbahnbetrieb umgestellt, wobei bei der Graça-Linie die Endstation nach \\"São Tomé\\" verlegt wurde. Noch bis 1928 blieb die NCAML allerdings nominell selbstständig und die auf der früheren Strecke der Estrela-Kabelstraßenbahn fahrende Linie 28 war formell nicht auf die Carris konzessioniert., Auch die drei Standseilbahnen wurden 1914 von Dampfmaschinen auf elektrischen Antrieb umgebaut. Seitdem werden sie durch die mit 600Volt Gleichstrom gespeisten Oberleitungen der Straßenbahn mitversorgt., Netzausbau zwischen 1915 und 1957., Nach 1915 folgten bis etwa 1930 noch einige Streckenverlängerungen in Vororte, so 1926 nach Alto de São João, 1927 nach Ajuda und 1930 nach Carnide. Außerdem gab es kleinere Netzergänzungen in der Innenstadt, darunter die 1925 fertiggestellte Verbindung von Graça zur Avenida Almirante Reis und 1928 der Lückenschluss der Linie 28 zwischen der \\"Praça Luís de Camões\\" und der \\"Rua Conceição\\" in der Baixa Pombalina, der mit einer Steigung von 13,5 % seitdem der steilste Abschnitt des Streckennetzes ist., 1936 errichtete die Carris nochmals zwei wichtige Netzerweiterungen, zum einen die Strecke zum Friedhof Prazeres, zum anderen schloss sie die Netzlücke der Ringlinie zwischen Campolide und \\"São Sebastião\\". Auch während des Zweiten Weltkriegs wurden kleinere Netzergänzungen vorgenommen, so 1941 die Strecke nach Bairro Arco do Cego. Mit Ausnahme der bereits zu Pferdebahnzeiten erbauten langen Außenstrecke nach Algés und Cruz Quebrada lagen alle Strecken innerhalb des Stadtgebiets. Überlandstraßenbahnstrecken außerhalb der geschlossenen Bebauung der Stadt und ihrer Vororte besaß das Lissabonner Straßenbahnnetz nie., Mit der Eröffnung des letzten, von den Linien 21 und 27 bedienten Abschnitts der in einem großen Halbkreis nördlich um die Innenstadt führenden Tangentialstrecke von \\"Alto de São João\\" nach \\"Madre de Deus\\" am 18.September 1957 erreichte das Netz der Lissabonner Straßenbahn seine größte Ausdehnung. Das Streckennetz wies zu diesem Zeitpunkt eine Länge von 76Kilometern auf. Insgesamt waren 145Kilometer Gleise im Netz verlegt, weitere 15Kilometer in den drei Depots. Es wurden insgesamt 27 Linien bedient, davon fünf Ringlinien mit jeweils unterschiedlicher Liniennummer je Fahrtrichtung (zusammen zehn Liniennummern), hinzu kamen einige Verstärkungslinien., In der Innenstadt bedienten die meisten Linien unterschiedliche Endpunkte, nachdem der ursprünglich als zentraler Knoten genutzte Rossio bereits in den 1920er Jahren überlastet war. Die Linien über die Avenida da Liberdade in die nordwestlichen Vororte hatten ihren Ausgangspunkt am Praça dos Restauradores. Von der Endstelle auf der Praça Martim Moniz verkehrten die Linien nach Norden in Richtung A: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Keywords: Spurweite 900 mm, Straßenbahnsystem, Verkehr Lissabon, Pferdebahn, Carris, Standseilbahnen, Kabelstraßenbahnen, Elektrifizierung, Netzausbau, Ringlinie."},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Raben und Krähen], Die Guamkrähe (\\"Corvus kubaryi\\") ist eine Singvogelart aus der Familie der Rabenvögel (Corvidae). Sie ist mit 38 bis 40 Zentimetern Körperlänge eine der kleineren Arten der Raben und Krähen (\\"Corvus\\"). Ihr Verbreitungsgebiet beschränkt sich auf die Marianeninseln Guam und Rota. Der Lebensraum der Guamkrähe besteht vorwiegend aus Wäldern auf Kalksteinböden, sie nutzt aber auch anthropogene Habitate. Sie ernährt sich omnivor von Gliederfüßern, Früchten, Knospen und kleinen Wirbeltieren. Guamkrähen bewegen sich in Familienverbänden von drei bis fünf Individuen, seltener in kleinen Schwärmen. Ihre Hauptbrutzeit fällt mit dem Ende der Trockenzeit von August bis Februar zusammen, es kann aber das ganze Jahr zu Bruten kommen. Das Nest wird im Gestrüpp oder in Baumkronen gebaut; das Gelege besteht aus meist zwei bis drei Eiern, die ausschließlich vom Weibchen bebrütet werden., Die gültige Erstbeschreibung der Guamkrähe durch Anton Reichenow stammt aus dem Jahr 1885. Ihre nächste Verwandte ist die Dickschnabelkrähe (\\"C. macrorhynchos\\"). Der Bestand der Guamkrähe geht seit der zweiten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts stark zurück. Als Ursache gilt neben der Einführung der Braunen Nachtbaumnatter (\\"Boiga irregularis\\") und anderer Neozoen auf den Marianen das Verschwinden von Primärwald auf den Inseln. Auf Guam lebt maximal noch eine einstellige Zahl von Vögeln, Rota beherbergt noch etwa 50 bis 250 Individuen. BirdLife International stuft die Bestandssituation der Art deshalb als \\"\\" („vom Aussterben bedroht“) ein. Als Schutzmaßnahmen für die Guamkrähe werden vor allem Umsiedlungen von Rota nach Guam diskutiert, Schutzvorrichtungen gegen Fressfeinde errichtet und die Wiederherstellung von Primärwald anvisiert., Merkmale., Körperbau und Farbgebung., Die Guamkrähe ist ein kleiner Vertreter der Raben und Krähen (\\"Corvus\\") mit rund 38–40cm Körperlänge. Sie besitzt relativ feines, lockeres Gefieder, was ihr ein leicht unordentliches Erscheinungsbild verleiht. Dieser Eindruck verstärkt sich in der Zeit der Mauser von Mai bis September, wenn Federn nach und nach ausfallen. Der Schnabel der Art ist relativ lang, gerade und vor allem an der Spitze sehr schmal. Die für Rabenvögel typischen Nasalborsten sind bei der Guamkrähe relativ kurz, bedecken aber die Nasenlöcher und die Schnabelbasis. Zwischen den beiden Geschlechtern besteht ein leichter Dimorphismus hinsichtlich der Größe, Männchen werden im Durchschnitt etwas größer als Weibchen. Das Gewicht männlicher Guamkrähen beträgt 231–270g. Ihre Flügellänge beträgt 229–244mm, die Länge des Schwanzes liegt zwischen 158 und 170mm. Der männliche Schnabel wird 51–57mm, der männliche Laufknochen 49–52mm lang. Die 205–260g schweren Weibchen fallen mit 222–242mm Flügellänge und 143–166mm Schwanzlänge nur leicht hinter männliche Guamkrähen zurück. Auch die Maße von Schnabel und Laufknochen sind mit 47–53mm beziehungsweise 46–54mm für gewöhnlich nur geringfügig unter den männlichen., Das Gefieder der Guamkrähe ist kohlschwarz, wobei Weibchen etwas bräunlicher sind als Männchen. Die Federbasen sind gräulich, im Nackenbereich werden sie fast weiß, was das Gefieder etwas schmutzig erscheinen lässt. Auf dem Kopf und dem Rücken zeichnet sich ein schwacher, irisierender grüner Schimmer ab, wohingegen der Schwanz bläulich schimmert. Die Bauchseite ist fast glanzlos schwarz mit einem fast unmerklichen Grünschimmer. Beine und Schnabel sind schwarz gefärbt. Die Iris der Guamkrähe ist dunkelbraun. Jungvögel unterscheiden sich nur unwesentlich von adulten. Ihr Gefieder ist insgesamt matter und ihre Schwanz- und Flügelfedern tendieren stärker ins Braune., Flugbild und Fortbewegung., Im Flug zeichnet sich die Guamkrähe durch relativ kurze, breite Flügel und ihren leicht gerundeten Schwanz aus. Bisweilen zeigt sie ein an Spechte erinnerndes Flugmuster, in dem sich Phasen raschen Flügelschlages durch Gleitflug mit angelegten Flügeln abwechseln; der Flugverlauf wird dadurch wellenförmig. Im schnellen Streckenflug nutzen Guamkrähen die für die Gattung \\"Corvus\\" typischen, kräftigen und gleichmäßigen Flügelschläge., Lautäußerungen., Die Lautäußerungen der Guamkrähe gelten als wenig erforscht. Altvögel kommunizieren mit einem hohen, krächzenden \\"kah\\" oder \\"hii\\". Beide Rufe werden häufig in ein- bis dreisilbigen Serien geäußert. Gelegentlich zieht sie die Guamkrähe stärker in die Länge und intoniert sie sehr nasal, eine Variante, die vor allem in der Kommunikation zwischen Brutpartnern genutzt wird. Möglicherweise erfüllen diese Monologe eine ähnliche Funktion wie der Subsong anderer Krähenarten. Eine schnelle Folge hintereinander ausgestoßener \\"kah\\"-Rufe dient als akustischer Alarm. Individuen, zwischen denen eine starke soziale Bindung besteht, lassen im Kontakt miteinander häufig komplexe Rufserien in unterschiedlicher Lautstärke vernehmen. Sie können äußerst leise, aber auch sehr laut ausfallen und bestehen aus vielen verschiedenen Silben. Die Rufe von Jungvögeln ähneln denen von adulten Individuen, sind aber kürzer. Ihr Bettelruf ist ein \\"aaa\\", das in der Tonhöhe ansteigt und bis zur Fütterung an Intensität zunimmt., Verbreitung., Guamkrähen sind Standvögel und kommen lediglich auf den Marianeninseln Guam und Rota vor. Es ist möglich, dass das Verbreitungsgebiet der Art früher einmal auch den Rest der Marianen oder andere Teile Mikronesiens umfasste. Die genetische Vielfalt war in der Population auf Rota geringer als in der auf Guam. Das deutet darauf hin, dass Rota von der südlichen Nachbarinsel aus besiedelt wurde. Da Rotas Vegetation und Fauna stark unter den Kämpfen im Pazifikkrieg litt, kann die geringe Diversität aber auch daher rühren, dass nur eine geringe Restpopulation den Krieg überlebte. Eine hohe Übereinstimmung in der DNA der beiden Inselpopulationen in einer Studie aus den 1990er Jahren lässt jedenfalls darauf schließen, dass die Besiedlung Rotas vor relativ kurzer Zeit (50–100Generationen, Stand 1999) erfolgt sein muss., Rota wird von der Guamkrähe fast zur Gänze besiedelt. Sie fehlt dort wahrscheinlich nur auf der Halbinsel Taipingot im Südwesten und den waldfreien Gebieten im äußeren Nordwesten, rund um den Flughafen und Sinapalo sowie am Südhang des Mount Manira. Auf Guam schrumpfte das Areal der Art im 20. Jahrhundert stark zusammen. Zunächst zog sie sich aus dem Süden der Insel, später dann auch aus ihrem Inneren zurück und in den frühen 1970ern war sie bereits nur noch auf dem Nordplateau Guams zu finden. In den folgenden Jahrzehnten setzte sich diese Entwicklung weiter fort, die Art wich weiter in den unzugänglichen, zerklüfteten Nordwesten zurück. Mittlerweile ist die Guamkrähe nur noch im äußersten Norden rund um die Andersen Air Force Base anzutreffen. Da der rein männliche Bestand dort nicht mehr fortpflanzungsfähig ist, ist die Population auf Guam de facto erloschen., Lebensraum., Das ursprüngliche Habitat der Guamkrähe ist die primäre Waldvegetation der Kalkformationen Guams und Rotas. Diese Wälder bestehen vor allem aus Feigen (\\"Ficus\\" spp.) und Ganiterbäumen (\\"Elaeocarpus\\" spp.). Für die Nahrungssuche nutzen die Tiere aber auch die seit der Erstbesiedlung der Marianen durch die Chamorro (etwa 4000 BP) entstandenen sekundären Kalksteinwälder und das durch Rodung entstandene Parkland der Inseln. Auch in den in der Neuzeit errichteten Kokos- und Schraubenbaumplantagen sind sie anzutreffen. Der Vorzug der Vögel gilt dem Primärwald, unter den Habitatformen Guams und Rotas meiden sie wahrscheinlich nur die offene Savanne. Während der Nahrungssuche bewegen sie sich vornehmlich im Kronen- und Unterholzbereich, seltener begeben sie sich auf den Erdboden hinab. Für die Brut ist die Art offenbar an den zurückgehenden Primärwald gebunden. Das Bruthabitat liegt in der Regel in einiger Distanz zu Straßen und ähnlichen Waldeinschnitten und weist die einheimischen Baumarten \\"Eugenia reinwardtiana\\", \\"Neisosperma oppositifolia\\", \\"Intsia bijuga\\" oder \\"Guettarda speciosa\\" auf., Lebensweise., Ernährung., Das Nahrungsspektrum der Guamkrähe ist vielseitig. Sie frisst sowohl tierische Nahrung als auch Pflanzenmaterial. Erstere besteht aus Gliederfüßern wie Springschrecken, Krabben, Schmetterlingsraupen oder holzbewohnenden Insekten sowie aus kleinen Wirbeltieren, vor allem Eidechsen, aber auch Ratten, Schlangen und Vogeleiern. Die pflanzliche Nahrung der Art setzt sich unter anderem aus den Früchten von \\"Cestrum diurnum\\" und \\"Premna obtusifolia\\", Feigen, den Kapselfrüchten des Lindenblättrigen Eibischs (\\"Talipariti tiliaceum\\") sowie den Steinfrüchten von Schraubenbäumen (\\"Pandanus\\" spp.) zusammen. Daneben frisst die Guamkrähe auch Samen und Knospen verschiedener Pflanzenarten, anders als früher angenommen aber offenbar keine Blätter oder Rinde., Das Verhalten von Guamkrähen, lose Rinde mit Schnabel und Füßen bearbeiten, ist darauf zurückzuführen, dass sie – ähnlich wie Spechte – Larven und andere Holzbewohner unter der Rinde hervorzuholen versuchen. Ähnliches gilt für Eier und Larven von Insekten, die sich in Blättern entwickeln. Wirbeltiere werden meist aus Spalten und Baumlöchern geholt. Das auf den karstigen Böden Guams und Rotas knappe Wasser beziehen die Vögel unter anderem aus Schraubenbaumblättern, in denen sich der Regen sammelt. Den Großteil der tierischen Nahrung nehmen Guamkrähen im niedrigen Kronenbereich (etwa in 5m Höhe) auf, wo sie Wirbellose von den Blättern auflesen. Den Erdboden meiden die Tiere im offenen Gelände, im Wald sind sie dort jedoch äußerst aktiv und wirbeln energisch Laub auf, um darunter nach Nahrung zu suchen. Die meisten Studien und Beobachtungen zur Ernährung der Guamkrähe fanden während der Brutsaison statt; das Nahrungsspektrum und die Ernährungsweise im Rest des Jahres ist nur unzureichend erforscht., Sozial- und Territorialverhalten., Guamkrähen gelten als moderat gesellige Vögel. Anders als einige andere Krähenarten brüten sie nicht kollektiv, sondern verteidigen ganzjährig das Territorium rund um das Nest. Auf Rota haben diese Territorien eine Größe von 12–37ha. Brutpartner pflegen sich gegenseitig das Gefieder, auch Gefiederpflege zwischen Eltern und Nestlingen wurde beobachtet.

Zugleich verleiht die kleinteilige vorwiegend aus Altbauten des 19.Jahrhunderts bestehende Bebauungsstruktur, die mit Vorgärten und zahlreichen Straßenbäumen versehen ist und eine hohe Baudenkmaldichte aufweist, dem Ortsteil einen ruhigen Charakter., Eine Besonderheit des Ortsteils liegt in der seinerzeitigen Planung durch die teilweise symmetrische Aufteilung der Straßen. Der Ortsteil ist einer der flächenmäßig kleinsten und mit Einwohnern pro Quadratkilometer der am dichtesten besiedelte unter den 97 Ortsteilen Berlins., Lage., Geographie., Friedenau liegt auf dem Teltow-Höhenzug südlich des Berlin-Warschauer Urstromtales mit einer mittleren Höhe von rund auf einer Fläche von 168Hektar. Die Nord-Süd-Ausdehnung beträgt rund 1,4Kilometer, in West-Ost-Richtung sind es in Höhe des Friedrich-Wilhelm-Platzes etwa 1,2Kilometer, entlang der nördlichen Ortsgrenze rund 1,6Kilometer., Die Grenze des Ortsteils verläuft im Norden parallel zur Ringbahn-Trasse, im Westen entlang der Laubacher Straße zu Wilmersdorf und im Südwesten entlang der Bornstraße zu Steglitz. Die Ostgrenze Friedenaus zum Ortsteil Schöneberg verläuft entlang der Haupt- und der Fregestraße., Friedenau stellt mit seiner Lage zwischen der Grenze zu Wilmersdorf und Schöneberg im Norden und der Steglitzer Schloßstraße – ab Walther-Schreiber-Platz – sowie dem Einzugsgebiet von Dahlem im Süden ein Bindeglied zwischen diesen– insgesamt bürgerlich geprägten– Ortsteilen dar., Mitunter werden Friedenau auch weiter östlich gelegene Gebiete zugeordnet, obwohl sie amtlich nicht auf Friedenauer Terrain liegen, sondern auf dem Gebiet des Ortsteils Schöneberg. Dazu zählen der S-Bahnhof Friedenau, die Ceciliengärten und die Umgebung der Rubensstraße bis zum Grazer Damm (das sogenannte „Malerviertel“ bzw. der „Dürerkiez“) und das Auguste-Viktoria-Krankenhaus. Die dort im ersten Drittel des 20.Jahrhunderts errichteten Wohnanlagen wurden als „Neu-Friedenau“ bezeichnet, obwohl sie im Ortsteil Schöneberg liegen., Stadtbild., Städtebauliches Merkmal des Ortsteils ist die nach dem Planer Johann Anton Wilhelm von Carstenn benannte „Carstenn-Figur“, eine regelmäßige städtebauliche Anordnung von Straßen und Plätzen. Die ursprüngliche Siedlungsstruktur ist noch gut zu erkennen: Vom zentralen Friedrich-Wilhelm-Platz, der als Anger konzipiert wurde, gehen Straßen strahlenförmig in alle Himmelsrichtungen auseinander, ein hufeisenförmiger Ring (Stubenrauch- und Handjerystraße) mit vier weiteren Plätzen (dem Perelsplatz, ehemals \\"Berliner Platz\\" und später \\"Maybachplatz\\", dem Renée-Sintenis-Platz, früher \\"Wilmersdorfer Platz\\", dem Schillerplatz, bis 1905 \\"Schmargendorfer Platz\\", sowie dem ehemaligen \\"Hamburger Platz\\", einem Teil des Friedhofs an der Stubenrauchstraße) legt sich um den zentralen Platz und wird im Norden durch die in West-Ost-Richtung verlaufende Achse der Mainauer, Senta- und Evastraße geschlossen. Die zentrale Nord-Süd-Achse bildet die Bundesallee, und jeweils diagonal verlaufen im Südosten die Rhein- und die Hauptstraße und nordwestlich der Südwestkorso., Einige Friedenauer Straßen wurden nach Flüssen in Elsaß-Lothringen umbenannt, was dem Grundgedanken der Namensgebung von Friedenau zur Erinnerung an den im Jahr seiner Gründung geschlossenen „Frankfurter Frieden“ Ausdruck verleihen sollte., Die Mehrzahl der Gebäude in Friedenau stammt vom Beginn des 20.Jahrhunderts. Dadurch hat der Ortsteil einen fast einheitlichen Baubestand. 185Objekte stehen unter Denkmalschutz und verleihen Friedenau ein besonderes Flair. Friedenau blieb im Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht von den Luftangriffen der Alliierten verschont, die an verschiedenen Stellen Lücken in das Stadtbild rissen. Diese sind aber mittlerweile fast vollständig durch Neubauten ausgefüllt und nur noch vereinzelt sind Baulücken zu finden. Die Neubauten sind im sonst sehr homogenen Stadtbild teilweise Fremdkörper, weil beim Wiederaufbau nach dem Krieg auf denkmalpflegerische Aspekte wenig Rücksicht genommen wurde., Straßen und Plätze in Friedenau., → \\"Ausführliche Informationen hierzu siehe unter: Liste der Straßen und Plätze in Berlin-Friedenau\\", Geschichte., Anders als zahlreiche andere Berliner Ortsteile geht Friedenau nicht auf einen historischen Dorfkern zurück, sondern wurde in wilhelminischer Zeit neu gegründet. Wenige Monate nach der Beendigung des Deutsch-Französischen Kriegs im Jahr 1871 trat infolge des Zuzugs von über 50.000 Menschen eine so empfindliche Wohnungsnot im alten Kerngebiet Berlins ein, dass die Bautätigkeit bald auf den weiteren Umkreis der Hauptstadt übergriff. Der am 9.Juli 1871 ins Leben gerufene \\"Landerwerb- und Bauverein auf Actien\\" gründete den Villenvorort und erwarb zwischen 1871 und 1875 insgesamt 550Morgen Land des Ritterguts Deutsch-Wilmersdorf mit der Absicht, preiswerte und zweckmäßige Wohnstätten zu schaffen. Der Name \\"Friedenau\\", der auf das Ende des Deutsch-Französischen Kriegs hinweist, stammt von Auguste Hähnel, der Frau des Baumeisters Hermann Hähnel. Das Gelände wurde nach einem festen Siedlungsplan parzelliert. An der ehemaligen \\"Ringstraße\\" (seit 1962 Dickhardtstraße) entstand das erste Gebäude des Ortes. Im Jahr 1874 wurde der Bebauungsplan vom damals zuständigen Landkreis Teltow amtlich anerkannt und Friedenau am 9.November 1874 zur selbstständigen Landgemeinde dieses Landkreises erhoben. 1875 hatte Friedenau 1104 Einwohner in 258 Haushalten. Im Jahr 1912 waren es bereits rund 43.000Menschen, die sich hier niedergelassen hatten., Planung und Umsetzung., Ursprünglich wurde Friedenau von dem Hamburger Kaufmann und Großgrundbesitzer Johann Anton Wilhelm von Carstenn als Villenvorort englischen Stils konzipiert. Er erwarb 1865 das Gebiet, und die Planer nutzten die Situation, um eine Landhauskolonie am Reißbrett zu entwerfen, was sich an dem symmetrisch gestalteten Straßennetz gut erkennen lässt., Die geografische Nähe zur Stammbahn sowie der parallel verlaufenden Wannseebahn und die Einbeziehung der damaligen \\"Berlin-Potsdamer Chaussee\\" (Teil der Reichsstraße1), die das Berliner Stadtschloss mit Potsdam verband, wurden für die Gründung der Landgemeinde Friedenau ausgewählt. Durch die \\"Kaiserallee\\" (seit 1950: Bundesallee) konnte eine weitere wichtige Verkehrsverbindung in den damals aufstrebenden „Neuen Westen“ rund um den Kurfürstendamm hergestellt werden., Der Bebauungsplan von Johannes Otzen aus der Zeit nach Gründung des \\"Landerwerb- und Bauvereins\\" sah um 1871/1872 vor, dass sich die Grundbesitzer dazu verpflichten mussten, keine Mietshäuser, sondern nur Stadtvillen zu errichten. Einige der aus der Gründungszeit stammenden Landhäuser und Villen sind noch in der Niedstraße, in der Albestraße und in der Handjerystraße erhalten. Es handelt sich um bescheidene, meist eingeschossige Häuser mit Kellern und ausgebauten Dachgeschossen sowie sehr kleinen Gärten. Seinerzeit stritten sich die Bauherren darum, ob die Häuser verputzt oder als Ziegelrohbau errichtet werden sollten. Der Volksmund sprach von den „Rohbauern“, die die Ziegelbauweise bevorzugten, im Gegensatz zu den „Putzbauern“, die– insbesondere im Bereich westlich der Kaisereiche– ihre Häuser verputzen ließen., Aufgrund des Wohnraummangels in Berlin wurde 1887 eine neue Bauordnung von der preußischen Regierung erlassen. Viele Villen wurden abgerissen und stattdessen Mietshäuser mit bis zu fünf Etagen errichtet. 1892 folgte eine weitere Bauordnung, die im alten Teil Friedenaus die Höhe der Gebäude auf vier Etagen einschließlich Erdgeschoss beschränkte. Der Bauunternehmer Georg Haberland hatte im nördlichen Teil Friedenaus großen Einfluss auf die Bauplanung für die damals noch freien Flächen. Als weitsichtiger Terrainentwickler plante er den Südwestkorso und das Wagnerviertel, dem der Sportpark Friedenau mit seiner Radrennbahn in den 1900er Jahren weichen musste., Die junge Landgemeinde wurde durch ein lebendiges Vereinsleben zusammengehalten. Die Mitglieder der \\"Friedenauer Liedertafel,\\" des \\"Haus- und Grundbesitzervereins,\\" der \\"Friedenauer Schützengilde,\\" des \\"Friedenauer Lehrervereins,\\" der \\"Vereinigung selbständiger Schneidermeister\\" und des \\"Kegelvereins Glatte Bahn\\" trafen sich regelmäßig. Im Jahr 1886 wurde ein Männer-Turnverein gegründet, der noch als \\"Friedenauer TSC 1886 e.u202fV.\\" existiert. Der damals sehr beliebte Radsport wurde auf der Zementbahn des Sportparks Friedenau betrieben, die für den im Jahr 1891 gegründeten \\"Friedenauer Radfahrer-Verein\\" gebaut worden war. Die Gewinner der Rennen erhielten das \\"Goldene Rad von Friedenau\\" in Form einer Medaille. Einer der ersten Stummfilme wurde 1904 mit dem Titel \\"Auf der Radrennbahn in Friedenau\\" gedreht, was für den Bekanntheitsgrad der Rennbahn sprach., Das 20. Jahrhundert., Nach der Jahrhundertwende wuchs die Bevölkerungszahl der Gemeinde an. Die Friedenauer Grundstücke wurden bis 1914 nahezu vollständig bebaut. Es wurden für die damalige Zeit gut ausgestattete Mietshäuser mit Vorgärten, Personenaufzügen und verhältnismäßig großen Wohnungen errichtet. Die von anderen Teilen Berlins bekannten Mietskasernen mit mehreren Hinterhöfen sind in Friedenau nicht zu finden., Typisch für die großzügigen Wohnungen aus dieser Zeit ist das sogenannte „Berliner Zimmer“, ein Eck-Durchgangszimmer mit einem relativ schmalen Fenster, das die Räume im Vorderhaus mit den Räumen der Seitenflügel verbindet. Weitere Merkmale dieser Wohnungen sind die Dienstmädchenxadkammer, ein eigener Dienstbotenaufgang vom Hof zur Küche und eine Zimmerrufanlage. Mit dieser Klingelanlage konnte das Dienstmädchen in jeden Raum gerufen werden; ein Signalklappenkasten war im vorderen Flur angebracht., Die Landgemeinde Friedenau erwarb 1909 ein Grundstück nahe dem Südwestkirchhof Stahnsdorf. Das benachbarte Wilmersdorf hatte angekündigt, künftig keine Bestattungen mehr für Friedenau zu übernehmen.

Sie bestehen aus den sechs Teilstreitkräften: US Army, US Air Force, US Navy, US Marine Corps, US Coast Guard und US Space Force. Insgesamt sind sie seit Jahrzehnten die bestausgestattete und personell die drittgrößte Militärmacht der Welt (Stand: 2022)., Die sechs Teilstreitkräfte bestehen aus ca. 1,4Millionen aktiven Soldaten und knapp 860.000 Reservisten, die im Kriegsfall um die paramilitärisch ausgerichtete Küstenwache (US Coast Guard) und Nationalgarde ergänzt werden. Zusätzlich verfügen sie über etwa 750.000 zivile Mitarbeiter (Stand: September 2019). Oberbefehlshaber ist der Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten, während die zwei Kammern im Kongress die demokratische Kontrolle ausüben. Die älteste Teilstreitkraft ist das Heer, welches 1775 gegründet wurde, die jüngste sind die 2019 gegründeten Weltraumstreitkräfte. Neben diesen Streitkräften haben einige Bundesstaaten auch eigene Militäreinheiten gegründet, die sogenannten Staatsgarden, die dem jeweiligen Gouverneur unterstellt sind., Nach weitläufiger Fremdeinschätzung, amerikanischer Eigendarstellung und politikwissenschaftlichem Konsens sind die Streitkräfte der USA die schlagkräftigsten der Welt. Diese Schlagkraft fußt auf dem mit Abstand und anhaltend größten Militärbudget der Welt, aus dem die umfangreichsten Anteile in Aufklärung, Informationsfluss, Vernetzung, Ausrüstung und Forschung fließen. Der Etat liegt im Haushaltsjahr 2022 bei 768,2 Milliarden US-Dollar für Kernaufgaben, die Wartung der Kernwaffen und weitere Ausgaben. Hinzu kommen 284,5 Milliarden US-Dollar für die Betreuung von Veteranen. Technische Innovationen und Personalentwicklungsmaßnahmen im Militär der Vereinigten Staaten sind für die Partner in der NATO, deren führendes Mitglied die Vereinigten Staaten sind, und andere Verbündete wegweisend., Organisatorisch durchliefen die Streitkräfte eine Wandlung von einem lokalisierten Milizwesen nach englischem Vorbild, das sich über wiederkehrende Instanzen der Wehrpflicht zu einer Berufsarmee zentralisierte, und weisen heute Merkmale all dieser drei Rekrutierungsmethoden auf. Die Stärke des Militärs der Vereinigten Staaten orientiert sich seit jeher an der Bedeutung, die sich die Vereinigten Staaten außenpolitisch beimessen, sodass Streitkräfte und Diplomatie eine parallele Entwicklung durchliefen. So war das Militär sowohl durch Dutzende Interventionen im Ausland als auch durch seine abschreckende Wirkung nach außen hin für den Aufstieg des Landes zur Supermacht und für den Erhalt dieses Status über den Kalten Krieg hinaus mitverantwortlich. Neben dem weltweiten Zerfall staatlicher Strukturen hat der militärische Vorsprung der Vereinigten Staaten das Auftreten asymmetrischer Kampfformen begünstigt, die die US-Streitkräfte vor strategische Herausforderungen stellen., Geschichte., Vor und während der Gründung der Vereinigten Staaten entstanden quasi-militärische Gruppierungen aus schlecht ausgebildeten Milizen unter dem Kommando der Bundesstaaten. Ein Beschluss des Kontinentalkongresses sah die Gründung einer Kontinentalarmee vor, in der diese zusammengefasst werden sollten. Diese Streitkraft gewann, mit erheblicher Unterstützung Frankreichs, den Unabhängigkeitskrieg unter dem Kommando von George Washington, wurde jedoch in Anlehnung an die Ideale der Revolution danach wieder aufgelöst., Mit der Zeit wurde die Notwendigkeit eines stehenden Heeres sowie einer Marine offensichtlich. Die Bestellung mehrerer Fregatten im Jahr 1794 war die faktische Geburtsstunde der US-Marine. Das Heer fasste ein weiteres Mal die desorganisierten und schlecht ausgebildeten Kontingente der \\"State militias\\" zusammen, um ihre Stärken zu bündeln und ihre Schwächen zu bereinigen., Zwischen der Gründung der Vereinigten Staaten und dem Bürgerkrieg siegten amerikanische Streitkräfte im Amerikanisch-Tripolitanischen Krieg an der nordafrikanischen Küste, konnten sich im Britisch-Amerikanischen Krieg nicht durchsetzen, ermöglichten aber die territoriale Ausdehnung der Vereinigten Staaten zum Südwesten hin. Zu Beginn des Bürgerkrieges wurden mehrere Einheiten Teil des konföderierten Militärs, darunter einige der fähigsten Generäle. Der Krieg kostete 600.000Menschen das Leben und dauerte vier Jahre, bis die Unionsarmee den endgültigen Sieg errang., In der Zeit zwischen dem Bürgerkrieg und den 1890er Jahren nahm die Bedeutung des Militärs ab, auch wenn im Zuge der stetigen West-Erweiterung der Vereinigten Staaten Einheiten der Army gegen Indianer kämpften. Zur Zeit des Jahrhundertwechsels kehrte sich dieser Trend jedoch wieder um, als die Machtfülle der Vereinigten Staaten zuzunehmen begann, was die endgültige juristische Trennung von polizeilichen und militärischen Kompetenzen erforderlich machte. Die Armee kämpfte 1898 im Spanisch-Amerikanischen Krieg und auf den Philippinen. Hinzuzurechnen sind ebenfalls Dutzende Interventionen nach der Monroe-Doktrin in Lateinamerika und die Entsendung der \\"Great White Fleet\\" durch den Präsidenten Theodore Roosevelt zur Demonstration des neuen nationalen Selbstbewusstseins. Mit dem \\"Militia Act\\" von 1903 wurde die Nationalgarde gegründet., Im April 1917 traten die Vereinigten Staaten als Reaktion auf den ausufernden uneingeschränkten U-Boot-Krieg des Deutschen Kaiserreiches als \\"assoziierte Macht\\" an der Seite der Entente in den Ersten Weltkrieg ein. Die USA unterstützten ihre Verbündeten durch gewaltige Mengen an Nachschub, entlasteten sie mit der Entsendung eines millionenstarken Expeditionsheeres nach Europa und leisteten so einen entscheidenden Beitrag zur Niederlage der Mittelmächte. Aufgrund des in der Zwischenkriegszeit vorherrschenden Isolationismus wurde das US-Militär, vor allem die Landstreitkräfte, stark reduziert, jedoch zum Teil bereits im Vorfeld des Zweiten Weltkrieges wieder ausgebaut., Aufgrund des japanischen Angriffs auf Pearl Harbor traten die Vereinigten Staaten im Dezember 1941 zunächst gegen Japan in den Krieg ein, wenig später erklärten die beiden Achsenmächte Deutschland und Italien den Vereinigten Staaten den Krieg. In der Auseinandersetzung mit dem nationalsozialistischen Deutschland nahmen die Streitkräfte an der Rückeroberung weiter Teile Nordafrikas, Italiens und Westeuropas teil und stellten wie im Ersten Weltkrieg eine Überlegenheit an Waffen, Truppen und Nachschub her, die den Alliierten das Niederringen des Deutschen Reiches ermöglichten. Nur so war zum Beispiel den Westalliierten die Eröffnung einer zweiten Front in der großangelegten, erfolgreich begangenen Landung in der Normandie möglich. Im Pazifik drängten sie fast ohne fremde Unterstützung die Truppen des japanischen Kaiserreiches in einem mühevollen so genannten „Island Hopping“ (deutsch: „Inselspringen“) zurück. Die japanische Kapitulation erzwangen die Vereinigten Staaten durch den Einsatz zweier Atombomben, in deren Besitz sie sich als erste Nation der Welt seit 1945 befanden (\\"Manhattan-Projekt\\"), um eine verlustreiche Invasion der japanischen Hauptinseln zu vermeiden., Bereits in der Endphase des Zweiten Weltkrieges bahnten sich die bevorstehenden Spannungen des Kalten Krieges an. Die staatskritische Tendenz der Gesellschaft der Vereinigten Staaten, die eine Verkleinerung des Militärs nach dem Ende großer Kriege selbstverständlich gemacht hatte, wich der Furcht vor der Ausbreitung des Kommunismus, sodass amerikanische Truppen in großer Zahl im Ausland stationiert wurden., Über 40 Jahre hinweg sollte der 1947 beschlossene National Security Act die tiefgreifendste Militärreform darstellen. Viele Behörden und Einheiten, die im gerade abgeschlossenen globalen Konflikt mit der Maßgabe ein möglichst zügiges Funktionieren gegründet worden waren, wurden schließlich zusammengefasst oder reformiert. Waren die Lufteinheiten im Zweiten Weltkrieg Bestandteil des Heeres, so stellte das Gesetz sie den anderen Streitkräften unter dem Dach der \\"United States Air Force\\" gleich. Wichtigste Neuerung war darüber hinaus die Schaffung eines zentralen Auslandsgeheimdienstes, dem im Laufe des Kalten Krieges ein ganzes Netzwerk an Geheimdiensten mit speziellen Kompetenzen zuarbeiten sollte. Ebenso beinhaltete das Gesetz die Schaffung streitkräfteübergreifender Generalstäbe und Ministerien., Mit dem Aufkommen des Kalten Krieges entzündete sich eine Debatte um die Strategie der Streitkräfte. Führende Offiziere der \\"Air Force\\" vertrauten auf Kernwaffen als konventionelle Offensivmittel und verlangten massive Ausgaben im Bereich der strategischen Bomber. Demgegenüber verwies die Marine auf die Erfolge der Dominanz zur See im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Die Stornierung eines bestellten Flugzeugträgers durch Verteidigungsminister Louis A. Johnson, der die Luftstreitkräfte bevorzugte, führte zum Aufstand der Admirale., Tatsächlich blieben beide Teilstreitkräfte während des Kalten Krieges überwiegend gleichberechtigt, obwohl die strategische Initiative in der Luft zu einem immer wichtigeren Moment der amerikanischen und westlichen Militärdoktrin wurde. Die \\"United States Air Forces in Europe\\" \\"(USAFE)\\" leisteten einen großen Beitrag zur Abschreckung der Sowjetunion und wurden aufgrund der geostrategischen Lage Europas zu einem zentralen Drehkreuz amerikanischer Militäroperationen in aller Welt. Auf dem Höhepunkt ihrer Stärke unterstanden 60.000Luftwaffenangehörige den \\"USAFE\\"., Obwohl es zu keiner direkten Konfrontation mit der Sowjetunion kam, kämpften amerikanische Soldaten in mehreren Stellvertreterkriegen zwischen den beiden Machtblöcken. Während der drei Jahre dauernde Koreakrieg, in dessen Folge ein bedeutender Anteil der US-Streitkräfte in Südkorea stationiert wurde, mangels eines erfolgreichen Abschlusses fast in kollektive Vergessenheit geriet, verursachte der letztendlich verlorene Vietnamkrieg weitreichende militärische und soziale Veränderungen. Den USA war es nicht gelungen, die Republik Südvietnam gegen die Angriffe des nördlichen Landesteiles, der kommunistisch geprägt war, zu verteidigen. Einschneidendstes Beispiel war die Aussetzung der Wehrpflicht im Jahr 1973. Für knapp zwei Jahrzehnte verhinderte das Trauma des Krieges in Südostasien größere Operationen des US-Militärs., In den 1980er Jahren kämpften amerikanische Truppen in den Operationen \\"Just Cause\\" in Panama und \\"Urgent Fury\\" auf Grenada. Im Libanon begründete der Tod von 239Marines und der darauffolgende Abzug ausländischer Truppen den Beginn des dortigen Bürgerkriegs.

Auf Streuobstwiesen stehen verstreute hochstämmige Obstbäume meist unterschiedlichen Alters und unterschiedlicher Arten und Sorten. Der moderne, intensive Obstanbau ist dagegen von niederstämmigen Obstsorten in Monokultur geprägt (Obstplantagen)., Begriffsentwicklung., Die übliche Bezeichnung war früher \\"Obstwiese\\", sie ist in manchen Regionen bis heute gebräuchlich. In den neuen Bundesländern sagte man bis zur Wende \\"Obstgarten\\" oder \\"Grasgarten.\\", Die Bezeichnungen \\"Streuobstbau\\" und \\"Streuobstwiese\\" haben sich aus dem Begriff \\"Obstbau in Streulage\\" entwickelt. Nach derzeitigen Erkenntnissen wurde der Begriff \\"Obstbäume und Weiden in Streulage\\" erstmals 1924 von Rinaldini für Rumänien/Siebenbürgen verwendet, dann allerdings erst wieder 1940 durch Knauer für den hochstämmigen Obstbau in Schleswig-Holstein sowie 1941 durch Spreng in der Schweiz., Der Begriff \\"Streuobstbau\\" wurde erstmals ab 1953 durch Zeller verwendet, dann in den 1950er-Jahren häufig und in negativer Abgrenzung zum dann auch in Deutschland zunehmend verbreiteten Halb- und Niederstamm-Obstbau. Erst aus dem Jahr 1975 stammt der Begriff der \\"Streuobstwiese\\". Geprägt hat ihn der Ornithologe Ullrich, der in einer Publikation auf die besondere Bedeutung der Streuobstwiesen im Albvorland für den Vogelschutz hinwies., Mit den nassen, säurereichen Streuwiesen und der Einstreu in die Ställe haben die Begriffe \\"Streuobstwiese\\" und \\"Streuobst\\" nichts zu tun. Vielmehr beziehen sie sich auf den weiten Abstand der \\"verstreut\\" stehenden Bäume., Definition., Streuobstwiesen sind die bekannteste Form des Streuobstbaus (auch Streuobstanbau genannt). Für diesen ist die Mehrfachnutzung kennzeichnend: Die Bäume dienen der Obsterzeugung („Obernutzung“); da die Bäume locker stehen, dienen die Flächen zugleich als Grünland („Unternutzung“), entweder als Mähwiese zur Heugewinnung oder direkt als Viehweide. Streuobstäcker sind eine in Deutschland noch in Franken, Südbaden, Sachsen-Anhalt, dem südlichen Brandenburg und im Lallinger Winkel verbreitete Sonderform, die bis weit ins 20.Jahrhundert in ganz Mitteleuropa verbreitet war. Darüber hinaus gehören auch Obstalleen und Einzelbäume zum Streuobstbau. Das im Streuobstbau angebaute Obst nennt man Streuobst., Der Streuobstanbau hatte im 19. und in der ersten Hälfte des 20.Jahrhunderts eine große kulturelle, soziale, landschaftsprägende und ökologische Bedeutung. Durch die Intensivierung der Landwirtschaft sowie durch das Bau- und Siedlungswesen wurden jedoch Streuobstwiesen in der zweiten Hälfte des 20.Jahrhunderts stark dezimiert. Heute gehören sie zu den am stärksten gefährdeten Biotopen Mitteleuropas (siehe auch Rote Liste der Biotoptypen). Die Imkerei spielt bei der Bestäubung eine wichtige Rolle., Größere, landschaftsprägende Streuobstwiesen finden sich heute noch in Österreich, in Süddeutschland, am Nordhang des Kyffhäusers und in der Schweiz. Die größten Bestände finden sich am Fuß der Schwäbischen Alb. Dort sind auch großflächige Streuobstbestände von BirdLife International als \\"Important Bird Areas\\" benannt sowie vom Land Baden-Württemberg laut EU-Vogelschutzrichtlinie als Vogelschutzgebiete bei der EU gemeldet. Die großen Streuobstflächen des niederösterreichischen Mostviertels liegen rund um die weitverstreuten Gehöfte. Sie sind das Kerngebiet zur Erzeugung von Apfel- und Birnenmost., Auf Initiative des Verbandes der Gartenbauvereine in Deutschland (VGiD) hat das Bundesministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz mit den Referenten der Bundesländer eine vom VGiD vorgeschlagene Definition des Begriffs \\"Streuobstanbau\\" abgestimmt. Auf dieser Grundlage wurde im Jahr 2008 folgende Definition verabschiedet:, Der Einsatz synthetischer Pestizide ist unüblich. Auf den bundesweiten Treffen der Streuobst-Aufpreisvermarkter wurde daher erstmals 1996 und wiederholt 2001, 2007 und 2014 das Kriterium des Verzichts auf Pestizide in die Definition von Streuobst aufgenommen. Brockhaus übernahm dies 2004 in die lexikalische Definition \\"Hochstamm-Obstbau ohne Einsatz synthetischer Behandlungsmittel\\"., Geschichte des Obstanbaus., Altertum und Mittelalter., Großfrüchtige Rosengewächse wie die Schlehe wurden in Mitteleuropa bereits in der Steinzeit genutzt, wobei nicht gesagt werden kann, ob es sich um Kulturpflanzen oder Kulturfolger handelt (siehe auch Pionierpflanzen). Ihre Verbreitungsgebiete lagen in der Nähe menschlicher Siedlungen. Für diese Zeit wurden auch die Kerne der Pflaumensorte Zibarte in den Siedlungen nachgewiesen., Vor allem die Römer brachten die nicht heimischen Apfelbäume, die Birnbäume, Zwetschgen und Süßkirschen, aber auch Walnuss und Edelkastanie nach Mitteleuropa. Hier konnten diese bereits im antiken Griechenland kultivierten Obstsorten nur in klimatisch begünstigten Gebieten gedeihen. Aus Kernen dieser Birn- und Apfelbäume gezogene Bäume hatten unterschiedliche Eigenschaften; einige konnten auch noch in den raueren Gebirgslagen angebaut werden. Im Gebiet der Mosel wird der Obstanbau etwa seit dem 2. Jahrhundert betrieben, im Lallinger Winkel seit dem 8. Jahrhundert. Als Alternative konnten die auf die Zibarte aufgepfropfte Pflaumen auch noch in den raueren Gebirgslagen gedeihen, wuchsen aber nur zu kleineren Bäumen heran., Die Züchtung robusterer und weniger anspruchsvoller Sorten wurde von den mittelalterlichen Klöstern betrieben, wie zum Beispiel im Kloster Niederaltaich. Selektiert wurden spätblühende und frostunempfindliche Sorten für raue Gebirgslagen, Dörrobst, lange lagerbare Früchte, Ertrag und Geschmack. In Württemberg auch in den Schloßgärtnereien. Die Anlage von Obstwiesen und Weinbergen wurde durch zahlreiche Edikte gefördert, in der Nähe der Klöster entstanden die ersten größeren Obstwiesen. Techniken und Sorten wurden aus Tirol, Oberösterreich und Böhmen übernommen. Streuobstäcker als Sonderform, bei der der Boden nicht als Grünland genutzt, sondern beackert wird, haben sich vor allem in Franken ausgebildet., 16. bis 18. Jahrhundert., Die in der Neuzeit voranschreitende Züchtung ermöglichte die Ausweitung des Obstanbaues in ganz Mitteleuropa, vor allem in Österreich, Tschechien, in Süddeutschland und in der Schweiz, auch auf ertragsschwachen und flachgründigen Böden der Hänge. Auf diese Weise wurde auch die Grünlandwirtschaft durch Bodenfestlegung nachhaltig durchführbar., Im 17., vor allem aber im 18. Jahrhundert, wurde der Obstanbau außerhalb der Gärten und der Dörfer politisch durch die absolutistischen Staaten stark gefördert und zum Teil erzwungen. Diese Epoche kann als die eigentliche Entstehungszeit des Streuobstanbaus betrachtet werden, der also keineswegs eine besonders alte Wirtschaftsform ist. Der Obstanbau spielte etwa ab dem 18. Jahrhundert eine größere Rolle für die Versorgung der Bevölkerung., Mit zunehmendem Ausbau des Straßennetzes wurden auch Alleen zwischen den Siedlungen angepflanzt, um die Transportmöglichkeiten zu nutzen. Auch Gemeinschaftsflächen wie Hofflächen mit Obstbäumen wurden angelegt und gemeinsam abgeerntet., Streuobstwiesen umgaben und verbanden landschaftlich prägend die Dörfer und Städte, wie eine Vielzahl von Quellen zeitgenössischer Autoren belegt. Sie wurden für die Versorgung der Bevölkerung unverzichtbar; das Wissen um ihre Pflege und um die Verarbeitung des Obstes war fester Bestandteil der Lehre der Landwirtschaft und der Hauswirtschaft., 19. und 20. Jahrhundert., Die Aufgabe des Weinbaus in weiten Gebieten um das Jahr 1800 führte vielerorts dazu, dass auf den ehemaligen Weinbergen Obstbäume gepflanzt wurden. Zur weiteren Ausweitung des Obstanbaus außerhalb der Siedlungen kam es ab der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts, als infolge der nun möglichen künstlichen Düngung Ackerbau auf nährstoffarmen Böden möglich wurde und im Gegenzug schwer zu bearbeitende Hänge mit Obstbäumen bepflanzt wurden., Die Wiesen- und Weidenutzung in den Obsthainen erhielt (statt der Ackernutzung) zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts einen großen Aufschwung, als das Molkereiwesen entstand und die Grünlandwirtschaft dadurch lohnender wurde. Ihren Höhepunkt hatte die Streuobstkultur etwa in den 20er und 30er Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts, zu einer Zeit, als schon die Obstplantagenwirtschaft begonnen hatte., Durch fortschreitende wissenschaftliche Entwicklung entstanden bis zum 20. Jahrhundert über 6000 Obstsorten, darunter mindestens 2700 Apfel-, 800 Birnen-, 400 Süßkirschensorten und 400 Pflaumenartige, die den Obstanbau selbst in Höhenlagen der Mittelgebirge ermöglichten. Spezielle Sorten für die Nutzung als Tafelobst, Saft, Most und Brand bis hin zum Backobst wurden regional verfeinert., Zur weiteren Entwicklung des Streuobstanbaus siehe unten: Rückgang im 20. Jahrhundert sowie Marketing und Pflege., Obstsorten der Streuobstwiesen., Die alten Sorten, die auch heute noch traditionell im Streuobstanbau verwendet werden, wurden zu einer Zeit entwickelt, als Pflanzenschutzmittel gar nicht oder nur sehr eingeschränkt zur Verfügung standen. Sie sind daher gegenüber Krankheiten und Schaderregern als besonders robust einzustufen. Die einzelnen Sorten entstanden dabei regionsspezifisch wie beispielsweise der Mostviertler Holzapfel oder der Erbachhofer, der norddeutsche Boikenapfel, der Rheinische Krummstiel und der Rheinische Bohnapfel. Die Verbreitung mancher Sorten ist gar auf wenige Dörfer beschränkt gewesen; es entstanden sogenannte \\"Lokalsorten\\". Während die heutigen Kultursorten, die im Intensivobstbau verwendet werden, auf weitgehend identische Elternsorten zurückgehen, stellen die typischen alten Obstsorten der Streuobstwiese, die über Jahrhunderte ortsspezifisch entwickelt wurden, damit ein großes genetisches Potential dar., Die Karcherbirne eignet sich auch für klimatisch ungünstige Lagen, die Blutbirne ist wegen ihres rot marmorierten Fruchtfleisches eine pomologische Besonderheit. Dattelzwetschgen eignen sich, wenn sie wurzelecht (unveredelt) gepflanzt werden, als Heckenpflanzung. Von den Kirschen eignet sich Dolleseppler besonders für Obstbrand (Kirschwasser) hervorragend., \\"Siehe auch: Liste von Apfelsorten\\", \\"Siehe auch:: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Kulturlandschaft, Obstbau, Wiese, Streuobstwiese, Obstgarten, Bitz, Bangert, Bongert, Bungert, Baumgarten, Begriffsentwicklung, Streuobstbau, Streuobstwiese, Monokultur, Obstplantagen, Obstwiese, Obstgarten, Grasgarten, Streulage, Obstbäume, Weiden, Streuwiesen, Einstreu, Verstreut, nass, säuerlich, Definition, Streuobstbau, Streuobstanbau, Mehrfachnutzung, Grünland, Mähwiese, Viehweide, Streuobstäcker, Sonderform, Obstalleen, Einzelbäume, Vogelschutz, Intensivierung, Landwirtschaft, Streuobstwiesen, dezimiert, gefährdet, Biotopen, Österreich, Süddeutschland, Kyffhäuser, Schweiz, Schwäbische Alb, BirdLife International, Worte: Obstbau, Streuobstwiese, Streuobst, Streuwiesen, OBstplantagen, Streuobstäcker, Vogelschutzgebiete, Streuobstflächen, Keine Pestizide, Historie, Obstanbau, Alleen, Grünlandwirtschaft, Klöster, Sorten, Obstanbau, Streuobstkultur, 20.Jahrhundert, Obstsorten, Kultursorten, Lokalsorten."},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Autor, Cantautore, Geboren 1940, Italiener, Mann, Musiker (Italien), Person als Namensgeber für einen Asteroiden, Träger des Verdienstordens der Italienischen Republik (Offizier)], Francesco Guccini (; * 14. Juni 1940 in Modena) ist ein italienischer Cantautore (Liederdichter), Schriftsteller und gelegentlicher Schauspieler., Er wuchs zwischen den Bergen Pàvanas und Modena auf und zog danach nach Bologna. Nach ersten musikalischen Versuchen ab den späten 1950er-Jahren zwischen Rock ’n’ Roll und Beat, auch als Songwriter für andere Interpreten, debütierte der Musiker solistisch 1967 mit dem Album \\"Folk beat n.1\\". Eine wichtige Inspirationsquelle war dabei Bob Dylan. Der Durchbruch gelang ihm 1972 mit dem vierten Album \\"Radici\\" und vor allem 1976 mit dem Album \\"Via Paolo Fabbri 43\\". In seiner über 50-jährigen Karriere veröffentlichte Guccini mehr als 20 Musikalben. Daneben betätigt er sich bis heute erfolgreich als Schriftsteller, Comicautor, Schauspieler und Komponist von Filmsoundtracks. Außerdem unterrichtete er 20 Jahre lang amerikanische Studenten in Italienisch., Guccini gilt als einer der wichtigsten und beliebtesten Cantautori Italiens und prägte die Gattung des „Autorenlieds“ wesentlich mit. Seine Texte sind lyrisch herausragend und thematisch vielfältig, meistens leicht fatalistisch und häufig als Dokumente des Zeitgeists zu verstehen. Auch wenn er oft als sehr politisch engagiert wahrgenommen wird, vermeidet er in seinen Texten weitestgehend offene politische Rhetorik zugunsten einer intimistischen Sprache. Im Zusammenspiel mit seiner schriftstellerischen Tätigkeit nimmt er die Rolle eines Geschichtenerzählers ein. Guccini wurde vielfach ausgezeichnet, sowohl mit Musik- als auch mit Literaturpreisen: Vom Club Tenco erhielt er nicht nur den Tenco-Preis, sondern auch fünf Targhe Tenco sowie den Premio Chiara für Liedtexte. Neben der Anerkennung durch die Kritiker ist Guccini auch bei einem breiten Publikum beliebt: Mehrfach erreichten seine Alben die Spitze der italienischen Charts und seine Konzerte waren überaus populär. Der Cantautore ist außerdem Träger zweier Ehrendoktorwürden und des Verdienstordens der Italienischen Republik in der Offiziersklasse., Leben und Werk., Kindheit (1940–1950)., Der Musiker wurde als Sohn von Ferruccio Guccini (1911–1990), Post-Mitarbeiter aus Pàvana, und Ester Prandi (1914–2009, aus Carpi) am 14. Juni 1940 in Modena geboren, vier Tage nach dem Eintritt Italiens in den Zweiten Weltkrieg. Sein Vater wurde eingezogen, woraufhin seine Mutter mit Francesco zu den Großeltern nach Pàvana in den nördlichen Apenninen umzog., Seine Kindheitserfahrungen in Pàvana verarbeitete Guccini mehrfach in seinen Werken: nicht zuletzt in seinem ersten Roman \\"Cròniche epafàniche,\\" aber auch in vielen Liedern, in denen er das Leben in den Bergen beschreibt. Später spielte eine starke Verbundenheit mit seiner Familie und den Orten seiner Kindheit, die besonders deutlich im Lied \\"Radici\\" beschrieben wird, eine große Rolle in seiner Dichtung und bildete ein wiederkehrendes Thema seiner Texte und Lieder, etwa in \\"Amerigo\\", das die Geschichte von Armut und Ausgrenzung eines ausgewanderten Großonkels erzählt. Nach dem Ende des Krieges 1945 lebte Francesco wieder mit seiner Mutter in Modena und auch sein Vater kam aus der Kriegsgefangenschaft zurück und konnte seine Arbeit wiederaufnehmen., Jugend (1950–1958)., In Modena (die Stadt beschrieb Guccini im Lied \\"Piccola città\\") verbrachte Guccini seine Jugend, eine Zeit, die er später in seinem Roman \\"Vacca d’un cane\\" verarbeitete. Zu dieser Zeit begann er auch mit dem Gitarrenspiel. Nach der Pflichtschule besuchte er das sozialwissenschaftliche Gymnasium “Carlo Sigonio”, das er 1958 abschloss. Die Nachkriegsrealität der Stadt nahm er als Gegensatz zum Leben in den Bergen relativ negativ wahr, was auch in spätere Texte einfloss. Für Guccinis kulturelle und musikalische Entwicklung war dieser Zeitraum allerdings sehr bedeutsam: Die Grundlage für seine Lieder über die Gesellschaft und das Alltägliche entstand, ebenso die Geschichten und Selbstzweifel, die sich etwa im Lied \\"Samantha\\" in der Beschreibung als „Puppenspieler mit Worten“ spiegeln. Weitere Verweise auf Modena finden sich in \\"Cencio\\" (\\"Quello che non\\", 1990), wo Guccini einen kleinwüchsigen Freund beschreibt., Erste Schritte im Musikbereich (1959–1966)., Guccini sammelte erste Arbeitserfahrungen als Lehrer und als Journalist. Die Anstellung als Privatlehrer in Pesaro 1959 endete vorzeitig mit Entlassung. Als Reporter für die Zeitung Gazzetta di Modena war er danach zwei Jahre lang erfolgreich tätig, er litt jedoch unter der schlechten Bezahlung und den überlangen Arbeitszeiten. Er beschäftigte sich bevorzugt mit Fällen aus dem Justizwesen; bemerkenswert ist jedoch ein Interview Guccinis mit Domenico Modugno, der gerade zwei Jahre in Folge das Festival di Sanremo gewonnen hatte, im April 1960, das für den angehenden Musiker den Anstoß gab, sich selbst als Cantautore zu versuchen. Sein erstes Lied unter diesem Eindruck war \\"L’antisociale\\". Gleichzeitig begann er ein Studium der Bildungswissenschaften, das er jedoch nie abschloss., Mit einer auf Tanzlokale spezialisierten Gruppe begann Guccini seine Erfahrungen als Sänger und Gitarrist. Zur Gruppe gehörten Pier Farri (Guccinis späterer Produzent) als Schlagzeuger und Victor Sogliani als Saxophonist sowie der Gitarrist Franco Fini Storchi. Die Gruppe war 1958 entstanden und firmierte zunächst als \\"Hurricanes\\", dann \\"Snakes\\" und schließlich \\"Gatti\\", nachdem sie sich mit der Gruppe \\"Marinos\\" von Alfio Cantarella zusammengeschlossen hatte. Mit den \\"Snakes\\" schrieb Guccini die ersten Lieder, \\"Bimba guarda come (il ciel sa di pianto)\\", \\"Roy Teddy Boy\\", \\"Ancora\\", \\"Viola come gli occhi di Angelica\\", an Peppino di Capri und die Everly Brothers angelehnter Rock ’n’ Roll, der das feste Repertoire der Gruppe bildete. Zwei Jahre lang konnte die Gruppe zahlreiche Engagements verbuchen und in ganz Oberitalien spielen, außerdem vereinzelt im Ausland: Bei Auftritten in der Schweiz begleitete Guccini als Gitarrist Nunzio Gallo, den Sieger des Sanremo-Festivals 1957 (dort zusammen mit Claudio Villa)., 1961 zog die Familie Guccini nach Bologna und Francesco begann ein sprachwissenschaftliches Studium an der Universität Bologna. Im Juli 1962 begann Guccini seinen Wehrdienst, den er in Lecce, Rom und Triest ablegte. An diese Zeit des „süßen Nichtstuns“ \\"(una pacchia)\\" erinnerte er sich später als grundsätzlich positive Erfahrung. Zuvor hatte er schon einige Lieder geschrieben, unter den erhaltenen waren \\"La ballata degli annegati\\" und \\"Venerdì santo\\". Während Guccinis Abwesenheit schloss sich seine Gruppe \\"I Gatti\\" mit \\"Giovani Leoni\\" von Maurizio Vandelli (dem späteren Gründer von Equipe 84) zusammen; Guccini stieß später nicht mehr dazu, um sich auf sein Studium zu konzentrieren, das er jedoch kurz vor dem Diplom wieder abbrach (2002 wurde ihm die Ehrendoktorwürde in Bildungswissenschaften verliehen). Ab 1965 (bis 1985) unterrichtete Guccini jeden September Italienisch an einer Außenstelle des amerikanischen Dickinson College in Bologna, was ihm auch den Beinamen „professore“ einbrachte., Entscheidend für seine musikalische Weiterentwicklung war seine Beschäftigung mit der zwischen 1958 und 1962 aktiven und für die italienische Musik überaus bedeutsamen Turiner Künstlergruppe \\"Cantacronache\\" um Fausto Amodei, Sergio Liberovici und Michele Straniero. Er wandte sich der Beatmusik zu und entdeckte auch den Folk Bob Dylans. Unter diesen Eindrücken schrieb er Lieder wie \\"Auschwitz\\" (voller Titel: \\"La canzone del bambino nel vento [Auschwitz]\\"), \\"È dall’amore che nasce l’uomo\\" (erfolgreich gemacht von Equipe 84, die bereits Guccinis \\"L’antisociale\\" im Januar 1966 aufgenommen hatten), und \\"Noi non ci saremo\\", das von den Nomadi interpretiert wurde. Guccini spielte selbst sowohl mit den Nomadi als auch mit Equipe 84., Die ersten Alben (1967–1971)., Im Jahr 1967 schlug das Plattenlabel CGD Guccini vor, für das Sanremo-Festival jenes Jahres das Lied \\"Una storia d’amore\\" einzureichen. Als Interpreten waren Caterina Caselli und Gigliola Cinquetti vorgesehen, das Lied schaffte es jedoch nicht in den Wettbewerb. Laut Roberto Vecchioni (damals selbst als Songwriter für CGD tätig) drängte das Label Guccini zur Zusammenarbeit mit den Liedtextern Daniele Pace und Mario Panzeri, erfolgreichen Hit-Autoren, was vom Cantautore als Zumutung empfunden wurde und dazu führte, dass er ähnliche Arrangements für die Zukunft ausschloss. Die beiden Sängerinnen nahmen das Lied dennoch auf: Gigliola Cinquetti im Album \\"La rosa nera\\" und Caterina Caselli in \\"Diamoci del tu\\"., Guccini veröffentlichte im März 1967 beim Label \\"La voce del padrone\\" (später EMI) sein erstes eigenes Album \\"Folk beat n. 1\\". Dieses verkaufte sich zwar sehr schlecht, wies aber bereits einige typische Elemente seines Stils auf, mit schlicht arrangierten und von schmerzhaften Themen wie Tod, Suizid, sozialer Unterschicht, Holocaust und Krieg geprägten Liedern (in einem Fall versuchte er sich an einem italienischen Talking Blues, was er später auch im Album \\"Opera buffa\\" wieder aufgriff). Auf dem Album befanden sich auch die bereits durch Nomadi und Equipe 84 bekannt gemachten Lieder \\"Noi non ci saremo\\", \\"L’antisociale\\" und \\"Auschwitz\\"; letzteres wurde 1967 von Equipe 84 noch einmal in englischer Sprache als B-Seite ihrer Single \\"29th September\\" im Vereinigten Königreich veröffentlicht sowie vom amerikanischen Musiker Rod MacDonald 1994 auf dem Album \\"Man on the Ledge\\"., Immer noch 1967 schrieb Guccini das Lied \\"In morte di S.F.\\", das bei der Verwertungsgesellschaft Siae unter dem Titel \\"Canzone per un’amica\\" hinterlegt und 1968 von den Nomadi veröffentlicht wurde. Außerdem schrieb er im Auftrag seiner Plattenfirma italienische Texte zu den englischsprachigen Folksongs \\"Hey Joe\\" (Jimi Hendrix) und \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" (Simon &amp; Garfunkel), die 1967 und 1968 von anderen Interpreten aufgenommen wurden, darunter Bobby Solo. Caterina Caselli lud Guccini am 1. Mai 1967 anlässlich der Veröffentlichung seines Albums in die Fernsehsendung \\"Diamoci del tu\\" ein, die sie zusammen mit Giorgio Gaber präsentierte: Bei diesem allerersten Fernsehauftritt sang Guccini \\"Auschwitz.\\" Für Caselli schrieb Guccini damals viele weitere Lieder, darunter \\"Le biciclette bianche\\", \\"Incubo nº 4\\" (aus dem Soundtrack der Musikkomödie \\"L’immensità [La ragazza del Paip’s]\\"), \\"Una storia d’amore\\" und \\"Cima Vallona\\" (worin er den Anschlag an der Porzescharte verarbeitete). Eines der später wohl bekanntesten Lieder aus Guccinis Feder stammte ebenfalls aus dem Jahr 1967, wieder von den Nomadi interpretiert: \\"Dio è morto\\" (mit leicht abwe: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Francesco Guccini, Cantautore, Geboren 1940, Italiener, Musiker, Schriftsteller, Schauspieler, Musikalben, Autorenlied, Verdienstorden, Asteroiden"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg, Ortsteil von Berlin], Prenzlauer Berg, umgangssprachlich auch Prenzlberg oder P’berg genannt, ist ein Ortsteil des Bezirks Pankow in Berlin, der weithin aus Gründerzeitvierteln besteht. Von seiner Gründung im Jahr 1920 bis zur Fusion mit den benachbarten Bezirken Weißensee und Pankow bei der Verwaltungsreform 2001 war er ein eigenständiger Bezirk (1952–1990: „Stadtbezirk“)., Geographie., Der Ortsteil Prenzlauer Berg ist ein Teil des Bezirks Pankow im Nordosten Berlins und grenzt im Westen und Südwesten an den Bezirk Mitte, im Süden an den Bezirk Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, im Osten an den Bezirk Lichtenberg und im Norden an die Ortsteile Weißensee und Pankow., Geologisch liegt der Ortsteil vollständig auf der Grundmoränenfläche des Barnim und grenzt nach Südwesten (zum Bezirk Mitte) an das Berliner Urstromtal, das sich in der Eiszeit gebildet hat., Der höchste Punkt des Ortsteils liegt heute mit 91Metern über dem Meeresspiegel im Nordosten im \\"Volkspark Prenzlauer Berg\\". Dieser Berg entstand nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg als einer der Trümmerberge durch das Aufschütten von Trümmern aus der Berliner Innenstadt und anschließender Begrünung., Namensgebung., Der Begriff \\"Prenzlauer Berg\\" bezieht sich auf das– vom alten Berlin aus gesehen– über die gesamte Breite ansteigende Plateau des Barnim. Da Berlin im Norden bis in das 19.Jahrhundert auf das ebene Berliner Urstromtal beschränkt blieb, wurde das Gebiet von den Berlinern schon immer als „Berg“– meist als \\"Windmühlenberg\\"– bezeichnet. Da der im Groß-Berlin-Gesetz 1920 festgelegte Bezirksname \\"Prenzlauer Tor\\" auf ein zu diesem Zeitpunkt schon seit 50Jahren nicht mehr existierendes Bauwerk hinwies, wurde im Folgejahr der Name der Erhöhung am Beginn der Prenzlauer Allee, einer zentralen Ausfallstraße, die direkt in die rund 90Kilometer nördlich gelegene uckermärkische Stadt Prenzlau führte, für den gesamten Bezirk übernommen. Erstmals dokumentiert ist der Name \\"Prenzlauer Berg\\" bereits in einem Schreiben vom Mai 1826., Der zwischen Prenzlauer Allee und Greifswalder Straße \\"(Neue Königstraße)\\" liegende Teil der Friedenstraße wurde 1913 als Prenzlauer Berg benannt. Dieser Abschnitt zwischen den Begräbnisplätzen der St.-Georgen-Kirchgemeinde und der St.-Marien-, Kloster- und St.-Nicolai-Kirchengemeinde führt über einen Berg (nahe dem \\"Prenzlauer Tor\\"): Prenzlauer Allee () – höchster Punkt () – Greifswalder Straße ()., In Daniela Dahns Buch \\"Prenzlauer Berg-Tour\\" aus dem Jahr 1987 wird Prenzlauer Berg stets mit Artikel verwendet. So lebt man „\\"im\\" Prenzlauer Berg“ und nicht „\\"in\\" Prenzlauer Berg“., Gliederung., Der Ortsteil ist durch die großen Ausfall- und Ringstraßen leicht nachvollziehbar in Nachbarschaften „Quartiere“ gegliedert, die lokal „Kieze“ genannt werden. Diese Unterteilungen haben keine behördliche Relevanz., Bebauung, Im Gebiet von Prenzlauer Berg stehen insgesamt 8169 Gebäude mit 5,5Millionenm² Wohnfläche (Stand: 31. Dezember 2000). Im Ortsteil befinden sich insgesamt 88.544 Wohnungen. Nur 195 Wohngebäude (2,4 %) beinhalten eine oder zwei Wohnungen, der Großteil sind Häuser mit 30 bis 40 Wohnungen, meist in urbaner Blockrandbebauung errichtet., Die Wohnungsgröße gehört mit durchschnittlich 3,2Räumen zu den niedrigsten in Berlin, gleiches gilt für die Fläche mit durchschnittlich 62,7Quadratmetern., Die Mietpreise liegen in allen Lagen über dem Berliner Durchschnitt, ebenso wie die Wohnkostenquote (Anteil des Haushaltsnettoeinkommens, das für die Warmmiete aufgewendet wird)., Stadtbild., Prenzlauer Berg ist geprägt durch Altbauten, die größtenteils aus der Zeit um die Wende zum 20.Jahrhundert (1889–1905) stammen. Über 80Prozent aller Wohnungen des Gebiets entstanden vor 1948, das älteste noch vorhandene Gebäude Kastanienallee77 ist von 1852/1853. Im Zweiten Weltkrieg wurden im Vergleich zu anderen Ortsteilen verhältnismäßig wenige Gebäude zerstört, das Gebiet wurde zu DDR-Zeiten allerdings vernachlässigt und die letzten Ruinen erst Anfang der 1970er Jahre abgetragen. Nach der politischen Wende wurde die marode Bausubstanz in großen Teilen saniert, Baulücken wurden bereits seit Mitte der 1980er Jahre geschlossen., Prenzlauer Berg bildet heute ein fast homogenes Altbaugebiet. Über 300 Gebäude stehen unter Denkmalschutz, wie das Stadtbad Oderberger Straße, die Brauerei in der Milastraße oder die Brauerei in der Knaackstraße. Der innenstadtnahe Teil ist von Restaurants und Bars geprägt. Besonders in der Kastanienallee, um den Kollwitz- und um den Helmholtzplatz konzentriert sich die berlintypische Gastronomie. Mittelpunkt des Nachtlebens ist das Gebiet um den U-Bahnhof Eberswalder Straße, an dem sich Schönhauser Allee, Danziger-/Eberswalder Straße und Kastanien-/Pappelallee schneiden. Diese Kreuzung wird „Ecke Schönhauser“ genannt. Diese ältere berlinische Bezeichnung wurde als Titel für den gleichnamigen DEFA-Kultfilm von 1957 verwendet und auch dadurch bekannt., Der Ortsteil bietet städtebaulich ein relativ einheitliches Bild, er ist überwiegend von fünfgeschossigen Wohngebäuden in geschlossener Blockbauweise geprägt. Die Blöcke sind in den meisten Fällen durch die großen Grundstückstiefen und zahlreichen Hinterhofnutzungen sehr groß, manche haben einen Umfang von mehr als einem Kilometer., Herausragende Gebäude sind die großen Kirchen des Ortsteils, von denen die Gethsemanekirche von August Orth an der Stargarder Straße (erbaut: 1891–1893) die bekannteste ist. Ihr 66Meter hoher Turm wird noch vom 79Meter hohen Turm der Segenskirche an der Schönhauser Allee und dem 68Meter hohen Turm der Immanuelkirche an der Prenzlauer Allee übertroffen. Auch repräsentative Schulbauten, überwiegend von Ludwig Hoffmann entworfen, heben sich von der Wohnbebauung ab., In der Rykestraße befindet sich die größte Synagoge Deutschlands. Die Bauarbeiten begannen Ende 1903, geweiht wurde das Gebäude am 4. September 1904. In der Reichspogromnacht wurde es nicht völlig zerstört, da es dicht von „arischen“ Gebäuden umgeben war. Hingegen wurde die Synagoge geschändet und im April 1940 enteignet. Am 30. August 1953 wurde sie erneut eingeweiht und nach der Wende denkmalgetreu nach der Erstfassung von 1904 saniert. Auf dem 1827 eröffneten Jüdischen Friedhof in der Schönhauser Allee gibt es über 22.500 Gräber und 750 Familiengrüfte, unter anderem die Gräber von David Friedländer, Max Liebermann, Leopold Ullstein, Ludwig Bamberger, Eduard Lasker und Giacomo Meyerbeer., Ein Wahrzeichen von Prenzlauer Berg ist der ehemalige Wasserturm („Dicker Hermann“) an der Ryke-/Ecke Knaackstraße aus dem Jahr 1877, der erste Wasserturm Berlins. Ein weiteres auffälliges Gebäude ist das 1987 eröffnete Zeiss-Großplanetarium an der Prenzlauer Allee., Im Westen des Ortsteils westlich an den Jahn-Sportpark (siehe: Sport) schließt sich der Mauerpark an. Diese öffentliche Grünfläche verblieb, da durch den Mauerbau zwischen Nordkreuz und Bernauer Straße das Gebiet des vormaligen Güterbahnhofs belegt war und so eine andere Nutzung für 40Jahre unterblieb., Seit 2017 gehört auch das in den Mauerpark einbezogene Gelände des früheren Bahnhofs Berlin Eberswalder Straße vollständig zum Ortsteil Prenzlauer Berg, sodass dieser nun auch bis 1990 zu West-Berlin gehörendes Gebiet umfasst., Bevölkerung., Der Ortsteil Prenzlauer Berg hat mit Einwohnern () die Dimension einer eigenen Großstadt auf einem relativ kleinen Gebiet von 11,0km². Die Bevölkerungsdichte gehört mit Einwohnern/km² zu den höchsten in Berlin., Geschichte., Anfänge., Prenzlauer Berg hat im Berliner Vergleich eine kurze Geschichte. Zwar rodeten Bauern die Wälder des Gebietes zum größten Teil schon im 13.Jahrhundert, doch über eine Nutzung als Landwirtschaftsfläche ging die Verwendung nicht hinaus. Beispielsweise war der Weinbau bis zum sehr kalten Winter 1740/1741 für die Region relativ bedeutend. Noch um 1800 befanden sich auf dem Gelände nur Äcker und wenige Windmühlen, die vor allem der König seit einigen Jahrzehnten vermehrt bauen ließ. Siedlungen entstanden aber nicht. Die einzige Bebauung des Geländes war das Königliche Vorwerk, auf Erlass des Königs vom 31.März 1708 entstanden. Erste Erweiterungen außerhalb der alten Zoll- und Akzisemauer waren Friedhöfe: 1802 legten die St.-Marien- und St.-Nicolai-Gemeinden den heutigen Alten Friedhof vor dem Prenzlauer Tor an. Die Stadtmauer erweiterte man zu dieser Zeit noch. Der 1814 vor dem Königstor angelegte Friedhof der Georgengemeinde blieb außerhalb der Mauern Berlins., In den Einflussbereich Berlins fiel das Gebiet erst nach dem 19.November 1808, als in Preußen eine neue Städteordnung erlassen wurde. Gemäß dieser Städteordnung blieb das Umland einer Stadt zwar eigenständig, aber das Stadtrecht und somit die gesamte Gesetzgebung und das Steuerrecht galten nun auch dort. Das so zu einer Stadt gehörende Gebiet wurde Weichbild genannt. In Berlin wurden die nördlich gelegenen Felder 1831/1832 in dieses Weichbild aufgenommen. Die erste Karte, die diese Grenzen zeigt, stammt von 1840. Das Gebiet änderte sich in der Folgezeit nicht., Die Stein- und Hardenbergischen Reformen (1807–1810) befreiten auch die Bauern nördlich Berlins von der Grundherrschaft. Ihnen wurde zwischen 1822 und 1826 ihr Gelände als freies Grundeigentum überschrieben, wenn sie entweder die Hälfte ihrer Fläche abgaben oder das 18-Fache eines Jahresertrages abführten. Gleichzeitig separierte man gemeinsam bewirtschaftete Flächen, sie wurden also unter den Bauern aufgeteilt und die Flächen neu verteilt. Die Bauern erhielten so zusammenhängende Flächen zur Bewirtschaftung. Hauptgewinner waren die drei Familien Griebenow, Büttner und Bötzow, die nun zusammen mehr als zwei Drittel der Fläche besaßen., Kleinbauern hingegen hatten keine Chance, wirtschaftlich zu überleben. Entweder wurden ihre Felder durch Abtreten der halben Fläche zu klein, um auf dem unfruchtbaren Boden noch wirtschaftlich Landwirtschaft betreiben zu können, oder sie mussten sich hoch verschulden. Diese Bauern spezialisierten sich in den folgenden Jahren vorrangig auf die Weiterverarbeitung agrarischer Erzeugnisse. Landwirtschaftliche Nutzflächen wurden in Bauland verwandelt.

Nach den Erstbeschreibern der heute am häufigsten angewendeten Operationstechnik wird sie im vollen Wortlaut auch als „beidseitige subtotale Strumaresektion nach Enderlen-Hotz“ bezeichnet. Gelegentlich gebräuchlich, aber sachlich falsch, ist auch die Bezeichnung Strumektomie, da unter einer Ektomie die Entfernung eines kompletten Organs verstanden wird. Die restlose Entfernung der gesamten Schilddrüse wird Thyreoidektomie genannt (Synonym: \\"Totalexstirpation der Schilddrüse\\"), die restlose Entfernung einer Schilddrüsenhälfte Hemithyreoidektomie., Indikation., Die Strumaresektion kommt bei diffuser und Knotenstruma, sowie beim Morbus Basedow zur Anwendung., Die diffuse Struma kann grundsätzlich zunächst konservativ behandelt werden. Hierbei werden Jodid, L-Thyroxin oder Kombinationspräparate aus beiden Substanzen eingesetzt, wodurch die TSH-Produktion der Hirnanhangsdrüse (Hypophyse) gedrosselt wird. Die Indikation zur Operation wird gestellt, wenn trotz der konservativen Therapie eine Größenzunahme der Struma eintritt, die zu subjektiven Beschwerden führt wie Engegefühl, Schluckstörungen oder gar Einengung (Stenose) der Luftröhre mit Behinderung der Atmung (Stridor). Auch das Auftreten von Knoten in einer bekannten diffusen Struma führt zur Operationsindikation. Die Entwicklung einer Überfunktion (Hyperthyreose) bei ursprünglich normaler Hormonproduktion (Euthyreose) ist ebenfalls eine Indikation zur Operation., Nähere Einzelheiten zur konservativen Behandlung im Hauptartikel Struma., Bei der Knotenstruma bestimmen Größe, Anzahl und Lage der Knoten, ob eine Strumaresektion ausreicht oder ob eine Thyreoidektomie indiziert ist. Dieser Fall tritt ein, wenn die knotigen Veränderungen so ausgedehnt sind, dass nicht ausschließlich gesundes Schilddrüsengewebe als Rest belassen werden kann., In vielen Fällen erfolgt auf der einen Seite eine komplette Resektion (Hemithyreoidektomie), auf der anderen eine subtotale Resektion. Diese Operation wird nach ihrem Erstbeschreiber \\"Dunhill-Operation\\" genannt., In Ausnahmefällen kann bei Vorliegen einer einzigen (solitären) Zyste oder eines Adenoms die Resektion unterbleiben und eine Ausschälung (Enukleation) des Knotens unter Mitnahme eines schmalen Saumes aus gesundem Schilddrüsengewebe vorgenommen werden., In bestimmten Fällen kommt als alternatives Therapieverfahren die Radiojodtherapie in Betracht. Wenn die Wahl zwischen Operation und Radiojodtherapie besteht, sprechen folgende Argumente für die Operation: Verdacht auf Bösartigkeit (Malignität), durch Jod verursachte Schilddrüsenüberfunktion (Hyperthyreose), Schwangerschaft und Stillzeit, floride Augenbeteiligung bei Morbus Basedow (endokrine Orbitopathie), Zeichen einer Kompression der Nachbarstrukturen (Luftröhre: Stridor, Speiseröhre: ausgeprägte Schluckstörung, Halsgefäße: obere Einflussstauung), größere kalte Gebiete der Schilddrüse oder Angst des Patienten vor Radioaktivität. Folgende Argumente sprechen dagegen für die Radiojodtherapie: Wenn die Schilddrüse bereits operiert worden war oder bereits eine (einseitige) Lähmung des Stimmbandnervens (Rekurrensparese) vorliegt, bei Patienten in höherem Lebensalter oder mit schweren Begleiterkrankungen, wenn die Schilddrüse relativ klein ist oder der Patient unter Operationsangst leidet. Jugendliches Alter gilt nicht mehr als Kontraindikation., Zur Behandlung der malignen Struma, einer durch Schilddrüsenkrebs hervorgerufenen Vergrößerung, ist die Strumaresektion nur bedingt geeignet, hier erfolgt regelmäßig die Thyreoidektomie. Wird ein Schilddrüsenrest von weniger als 5ml belassen und findet sich im entfernten Schilddrüsenteil ein vollständig im Gesunden entfernter maligner Knoten, dann kann die Rest-Thyreoidektomie unterbleiben und allein mit einer Radiojodtherapie fortgefahren werden., Voruntersuchungen., Die Untersuchungen, die zur Operationsindikation führen, werden in den Hauptartikeln Untersuchung der Schilddrüse und Struma beschrieben., Die allgemeinen operationsvorbereitenden Untersuchungen beinhalten die klinische körperliche Untersuchung mit Messung von Blutdruck und Puls, die Röntgenuntersuchung der Lunge und der Organe des Brustkorbs (Thorax) sowie die Anfertigung eines EKG. Eine Blutentnahme erfolgt zur Bestimmung des Blutbilds, der Elektrolyte, der Blutgerinnung, der Nierenfunktion und des CRP (zum Ausschluss einer Entzündung)., Die speziellen Untersuchungen vor einer Strumaresektion beinhalten die nochmalige Bestimmung der Schilddrüsenhormone sowie eine Untersuchung durch den Hals-, Nasen und Ohrenarzt zur Beurteilung der Beweglichkeit der Stimmbänder., Durchführung., Operationsprinzip., Zunächst wird der Isthmus, also die schmale Organbrücke zwischen den beiden Schilddrüsenlappen, stumpf unterfahren und nach blutstillender Umstechung durchtrennt. Es folgt die Darstellung und gezielte Unterbindung der oberen Polgefäße (Arteria thyroidea superior und ihre Begleitvenen). Die Schilddrüse wird dann weitgehend aus der Umgebung herausgelöst und die zugehörigen Blutgefäße (Arteria thyroidea inferior sowie die begleitenden Venen, insbesondere die große, nach seitlich abgehende Kocher’sche Vene) nach Unterbindung durchtrennt. Die bindegewebige Anheftung an die Luftröhre (Trachea) wird belassen, die Schilddrüse wird an dieser Stelle eröffnet und innerhalb ihrer Kapsel bis auf einen Rest, der je nach Befund eine Größe von 1 bis 5cm³ haben sollte, herausgeschält. Über dem Rest wird die bindegewebige Kapsel durch Naht verschlossen. In gleicher Weise wird dann auf der Gegenseite vorgegangen., Schmerzausschaltung., Die Intubationsnarkose ist heute der Standard für die Strumaresektion. Bis Anfang der 1970er Jahre wurde die Operation auch in Lokalanästhesie ausgeführt, da beim versehentlichen Eröffnen einer großen Vene eine Luftembolie der Lunge befürchtet wurde. Dieser konnte der wache Patient durch aktives Pressen entgegenwirken. Die Gefahr besteht bei einer modernen Überdruckbeatmung mit PEEP (positivem endexpiratorischem Druck) nicht mehr., Lagerung., Der Patient wird mit etwa 30° aufgerichtetem Oberkörper gelagert, der Kopf ruht nach hinten geneigt in einer Schale, so dass der Hals überstreckt und die Schilddrüse gut zugänglich ist. Gebräuchlich ist auch die flache Rückenlagerung mit etwas überstreckter Halswirbelsäule., Zugang., Standard ist der Kocher’sche Kragenschnitt, ein fünf bis sieben Zentimeter langer, leicht bogiger Querschnitt etwa zwei Querfinger oberhalb des Jugulums. Die Schnittführung wird vor der Operation am wachen Patienten markiert und aus kosmetischen Gründen wenn möglich in den Verlauf einer Hautfalte gelegt. Haut und Unterhautfettgewebe werden durchtrennt und nach oben und unten von der Muskulatur abgeschoben. Die vordere Halsmuskulatur (Musculus sternohyoideus) wird in der Mittellinie geteilt und nach beiden Seiten von der Schilddrüse abgeschoben, die nun frei zugänglich ist. Bei sehr großen Schilddrüsen ist gelegentlich die Querdurchtrennung der kurzen geraden Halsmuskulatur erforderlich. In extremen Ausnahmefällen gelingt die Auslösung einer stark nach retrosternal ausgedehnten Schilddrüse nur mittels partieller Sternotomie (Längsdurchtrennung des oberen Teils des Brustbeins)., Wundverschluss., Vor dem Wundverschluss werden zur Ableitung von Blut oder Wundsekret Redon-Drainagen eingebracht., Der Wundverschluss erfolgt dreischichtig: Muskulatur und Unterhautgewebe werden jeweils mit resorbierbarem Nahtmaterial, die Haut mit monofiler Kunststoffnaht verschlossen. Der Hautverschluss erfolgt oft in der kosmetisch günstigen intrakutanen Nahttechnik. Alternativ können auch Adaptationspflaster oder Gewebekleber zur Anwendung kommen., Schnellschnittuntersuchung., Bei der Strumaresektion aufgefundene, makroskopisch karzinomverdächtige Knoten sollen, wenn organisatorisch möglich, einer histopathologischen Schnellschnittuntersuchung zugeführt werden, um gegebenenfalls den Eingriff sofort zur Thyreoidektomie auszuweiten. Sollte dies strukturell (z.B. große Entfernung zur nächsten Pathologie) nicht sinnvoll oder möglich sein, ist der Patient vorab über eine möglicherweise notwendige Zweitoperation aufzuklären., Risiken., Unspezifische Operationsrisiken., Blutungen während (intraoperativ) oder nach der Operation (postoperativ), können aufgrund der guten Durchblutung der Schilddrüse ein bedrohliches Ausmaß annehmen; bei absehbaren Schwierigkeiten (Rezidivstruma) werden daher vorab Blutkonserven bereitgestellt., Wundinfektion und Wundeiterung treten aufgrund der guten Durchblutung sehr selten auf, sind gut zu erkennen und zu behandeln, hinterlassen aber meist sehr schlechte kosmetische Resultate., Postoperative Thrombosen und Lungenembolien sind durch die schnelle Mobilisierbarkeit der Patienten ebenfalls selten., Spezifische Operationsrisiken., Die Häufigkeit schwerer Komplikationen ist beim geübten Operateur gering und sollte ein Prozent (jeweils bezogen auf die Rekurrensparese und die Hypokalziämie) nicht überschreiten., Schädigung des Nervus recurrens, Eine vollständige Durchtrennung des Stimmbandnerven (Nervus laryngeus recurrens) führt zur permanenten Lähmung der Stimmmuskeln (Rekurrensparese) mit andauernder Heiserkeit. Eine Beschädigung durch Quetschung oder Überdehnung des Nerven u.ä. führt ebenfalls zum vorläufigen Funktionsausfall, ist aber meist reversibel, heilt also ohne spezielle Therapie aus. Eine beidseitige Rekurrensparese kann –durch den Verschluss der Stimmritze aufgrund der fehlenden Spannung der Stimmmuskeln– zur vollständigen Verlegung der Luftröhre mit akuter Erstickungsgefahr führen. Dies macht gegebenenfalls die Anlage eines permanenten Tracheostomas nötig. Die exakte Darstellung des N. laryngeus recurrens wird daher heute laut Leitlinie zwingend gefordert. Zur Vermeidung einer Rekurrensverletzung kommt daher meist das Neuromonitoring zur Anwendung, welches seit den 1990er Jahren insbesondere bei radikalen Strumektomien und Rezidiv-Eingriffen zu einer Erhöhung der Sicherheit geführt hat., Sehr selten, da operationstechnisch einfacher vermeidbar, ist die Verletzung des N. laryngeus superior., Schädigung der Nebenschilddrüsen, Die unbeabsichtigte: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Schilddrüsenvergrößerung, Strumaresektion, Chirurgie, Therapeutisches Verfahren, operative Behandlung, Schilddrüsenhälfte entfernen, Knotenstruma, Radiojodtherapie, maligne Struma, Voruntersuchungen"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Columbia (Raumfähre), NASA, Raumfahrtmission 1981], STS-1 (englisch Space Transportation System) ist die Missionsbezeichnung für den ersten Flug des US-amerikanischen Space Shuttle Columbia (OV-102) der NASA. Der Start erfolgte am 12.April 1981. Es war der erste Weltraumflug eines wiederverwendbaren Raumfahrzeugs., Missionsüberblick., Das Hauptziel des Fluges war die Überprüfung der gesamten Flugsysteme. Diesen Test bestand die Columbia hervorragend. Im Gegensatz zu vorhergehenden bemannten Raumfahrtprojekten wie zum Beispiel Mercury, Gemini und Apollo, bei denen mindestens ein unbemannter Testflug durchgeführt wurde, hat man beim Space Shuttle darauf verzichtet. Zwar wurden viele Systeme zuvor einzeln überprüft, aber es gab keinen Flug, bei dem das Zusammenspiel aller Systeme getestet wurde. So stellte dieser erste Space-Shuttle-Flug ein Novum in der bemannten Raumfahrt dar und bedeutete gleichzeitig ein erhöhtes Risiko., Es war der fünfte Raumflug für den Kommandanten Young, der als erster Raumfahrer diese Marke erreichte., Die einzige Nutzlast der Mission war ein Flugüberwachungssystem DFI (Development Flight Instrumentation), bestehend aus Sensoren und Messinstrumenten, um Daten über alle entscheidenden Flugabschnitte aufzuzeichnen., Nur bei STS-1 und STS-2 war der Außentank weiß lackiert. Um Gewicht einzusparen, verzichtete die NASA ab STS-3 darauf. Die rostbraune Färbung, die man ab 1982 sieht, stammt vom aufgespritzten Isolierschaum., Die NASA bezeichnet STS-1 noch heute als den „kühnsten Testflug der Geschichte“ („the boldest test flight in history“)., Vorbereitungen., Auslieferung eines halbfertigen Orbiters., Am 24. März 1979 traf die Columbia, vom Hersteller kommend, am Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ein. Der Transport erfolgte auf dem Rücken des Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, einer umgebauten Boeing 747. Rockwell International hatte den Orbiter in den zurückliegenden vier Jahren in seinen Werkshallen in Kalifornien gebaut. Am nächsten Tag wurde die Columbia in die OPF-Fertigungshalle (Orbiter Processing Facility) überführt, wo sie auf ihren Jungfernflug vorbereitet wurde., Wegen Problemen im Fertigungsprozess wurde die Fähre mit einem nur halbfertigen Hitzeschild ausgeliefert. Dieser bedeckt die gesamte Unterseite des Orbiters und schützt ihn während des Wiedereintritts vor den extremen Temperaturen. Rund 8.000 der insgesamt 31.000 Kacheln fehlten. Um parallel zu den Arbeiten am Schild die Columbia für den Jungfernflug vorzubereiten, wurde entschieden, die Hitzeschutzkacheln in Florida anzubringen. Für die Überführung wurden 5.000 Dummykacheln montiert, um ein Abreißen der echten Kacheln durch Luftwirbel zu verhindern. Vor dem Überführungsflug („Ferry Flight“) führte das Flugzeug-Orbiter-Gespann einen kurzen Testflug durch. Außerdem wurde die Belastungs- und Haftfähigkeit der Kachelattrappen an einer T-38-Maschine überprüft., Während des Überlandflugs fielen trotzdem einige Kunststoffdummys ab. Dadurch wurden echte Hitzeschutzkacheln beschädigt oder sogar ebenfalls abgerissen. Hinzu kam, dass der verwendete Kleber ein Abtrennen der Attrappen vom Orbiter schwieriger machte als erwartet. Insgesamt mussten, neben dem Lösen der Dummykacheln, fast 11.000 Kacheln in Florida nachgeklebt werden., Die Arbeiten an den Kacheln kamen nur schleppend voran, obwohl eigens mehrere hundert Rockwell-Mitarbeiter zum Kennedy Space Center abgestellt worden waren. Außerdem mussten noch wichtige Komponenten angeliefert und in die Raumfähre integriert werden. So war die Columbia der NASA ohne Haupttriebwerke und ohne OMS-Triebwerke übergeben worden. Diese wurden noch ausgiebigen Belastungs- und Kalibrierungstests unterzogen. Auch mussten noch über tausend Messwertgeber an der Fähre angebracht werden, die wichtige Parameter über deren Zustand während des Erstflugs übermitteln sollten. Insgesamt waren auf den Arbeitsplänen mehr als hundert größere Punkte offen, als die Columbia Florida erreichte., Diese Verzögerungen und Probleme mit den Zulieferbetrieben sowie die falsche Finanzplanung bei der NASA ließen das anvisierte Startdatum immer weiter nach hinten rutschen: zunächst wurde als Planungsdatum von STS-1 der März 1979 genannt, als die Raumfähre die Werkshallen verließ, war der Start für den 9.November 1979 vorgesehen., Generalprobe mit der Enterprise., Im April 1979 flog die NASA die Testfähre Enterprise aus Alabama zum Kennedy-Raumfahrtzentrum. Mit ihr sollten die theoretischen Konzepte mit der Realität konfrontiert werden. Der offiziell „Facility Verification Vehicle“ genannte Probelauf– für die NASA-Ingenieure war es der Pathfinder-Test– sollte helfen herauszufinden, ob die hauptsächlich aus dem Apollo-Programm stammende und für das Space Shuttle umgebaute Technik wirklich wie geplant funktionieren würde. Der weltraumuntaugliche Gleiter wurde im VAB-Montagegebäude (Vehicle Assembly Building) mit Prototypen von Außentank und Feststoffraketen verbunden., Am 1. Mai 1979 wurde erstmals ein Shuttle zur Startrampe gefahren. Dort fanden mit der Enterprise wichtige Tests statt, um die Tauglichkeit der Modifikationen unter Beweis zu stellen: Passten die Zugangsebenen des Startturms genau? Reichte der weiße Raum, über den die Astronauten die Raumfähre betreten, an die Einstiegsluke heran? Konnte die RSS-Arbeitsbühne (Rotating Service Structure) problemlos an den Orbiter herangeschwenkt werden? Auch die Treibstoffzufuhr wurde getestet, indem Flüssigwasserstoff und -sauerstoff aus den Vorratstanks über die Leitungen zur Startplattform gepumpt wurden. Nach der fast drei Monate währenden Generalprobe der Rampenanlagen wurde die Shuttle-Konfiguration im VAB wieder demontiert und die Enterprise zur Luftwaffenbasis Edwards nach Kalifornien geflogen., Anfang Juni 1979 gab NASA-Chef Robert Frosch vor dem US-Kongress bekannt, der Jungfernflug sei in das nächste Jahr verschoben worden– nannte jedoch kein Datum. Anlässlich einer Anhörung drei Wochen später wurde er gegenüber einem Senatsausschuss konkreter: Ende März 1980 sei der frühestmögliche Termin, ein Start Ende Juni aber wahrscheinlicher., Zweifel an den Hitzeschutzkacheln., John Yardley, der Leiter des Shuttle-Programms, erklärte im September 1979, die NASA hätte Zweifel an der Haftfähigkeit der an der Columbia angebrachten Hitzeschutzkacheln. Daraufhin wurden umfangreiche Belastungstests angeordnet. Man war während der Klebearbeiten in der OPF im Juni auf dieses Problem aufmerksam geworden. Anfang Oktober wurde mit der Überprüfung eines Drittels der Columbia-Kacheln begonnen. Um die empfindlichen Glasfaserplatten nicht zu beschädigen, bestand der Test im Wesentlichen aus einer Akustikanalyse. Mikrofone zeichneten den entstehenden Schall auf, wenn versucht wurde, die Kacheln vom Orbiter zu lösen. Zusätzlich wurden Düsenflugzeuge mit Kacheln bestückt und extreme Manöver geflogen. Die dabei aufgetretenen Belastungen lagen weit über den für einen Shuttle-Flug berechneten., Ein weiterer Rückschlag in der Vorbereitung auf den ersten Shuttle-Flug ereignete sich am 4. November 1979: Bei einem Probelauf von drei Testaggregaten der SSME-Haupttriebwerke (Space Shuttle Main Engine) brach die Treibstoffleitung in einem der Motoren. Als Folge wurden vorsorglich alle bereits installierten Triebwerke aus der Columbia ausgebaut und der Termin des Jungfernflugs in den Sommer 1980 gerückt. Die SSME-Testreihe konnte erst nach anderthalb Monaten wieder aufgenommen werden., Die erste Simulation., Mitte Dezember 1979 fand am KSC die erste groß angelegte Simulation statt. An dem sogenannten Orbiter Integration Test nahmen neben den Flug- und Ersatzbesatzungen ungezählte Techniker, Ingenieure und Kontrolleure am Startplatz sowie im Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas teil. Abwechselnd spielten die beiden Mannschaften, im Cockpit sitzend, mehrere Start-, Missions- und Landeszenarien durch. Erfolgreich wurde während fünf Simulationsläufen innerhalb von vier Wochen das Zusammenwirken verschiedener Untersysteme des Orbiters, Programmteile der Bordcomputer sowie von Orbiter und Kontrollzentrum demonstriert. Die Columbia befand sich zu dem Zeitpunkt in der OPF., Vor dem Wissenschaftsausschuss des US-Repräsentantenhauses musste NASA-Direktor Frosch Ende Januar 1980 einräumen, dass das Kachelproblem den Shuttle-Jungfernflug weiter verzögere. Als neuen Zeitraum nannte er den 30. November 1980 bis 31. März 1981., Weitere Arbeiten., War zu Beginn des Jahres 1980 von den Verantwortlichen noch davon ausgegangen worden, bis zum August den Hitzeschild fertiggestellt zu haben, gab die NASA im Mai überraschend weitere Arbeiten bekannt. Man habe entschieden, neben den bereits neu geklebten Kacheln auch alle anderen abzunehmen und wieder anzubringen, die die Belastungstests bestanden hatten. Deshalb sei der Erstflug der Columbia frühestens im März 1981 möglich., Erst zwei Wochen zuvor hatte die NASA erklärt, wegen der am KSC vorgenommenen Modifikationen die drei Haupttriebwerke nach Mississippi zu schicken, um sie dort neuerlichen Testläufen zu unterziehen. Danach wurden die Motoren zum KSC zurückgeschickt und im Juli wieder in die Columbia eingebaut. Auf den NASA-Testständen in Mississippi wurden die Zertifizierungsprobeläufe fortgesetzt und konnten Anfang Dezember 1980 abgeschlossen werden., Montage und Rollout., Ende November 1980 waren die Vorbereitungen abgeschlossen und die Columbia wurde von der Orbiter Processing Facility in das riesige VAB gebracht. Dort wurde sie mit dem weißen Außentank– er wurde im Juli 1980 geliefert– sowie den beiden Feststoffboostern verbunden und auf eine Startplattform gestellt., Das gesamte Gespann wurde am 29. Dezember 1980 vom VAB zur 5,6 Kilometer entfernten Startrampe 39A gerollt. Nach den Neujahrsfeiertagen begannen die Techniker der NASA mit den Vorarbeiten für den bevorstehenden Probelauf der drei Haupttriebwerke (SSMEs). Diese 20-sekündige Zündung der SSMEs war für den 13.Februar 1981 geplant, musste zunächst um drei Tage verschoben werden und fand schließlich am 20.Februar statt. Die Astronauten waren während des so genannten Flight Readiness Firings nicht an Bord., Eine Countdown-Übung am 19. März verlief ebenfalls erfolgreich, jedoch gab es im Anschluss daran einen tödlichen Unfall. Nach der Beendigung nahmen sechs Ingenieure einige Arbeiten in der hinteren Sektion des Orbiters vor. Zur Vermeidung von Feuer war diese ausschließlich mit reinem Stickstoff gefüllt, den alle Männer einatmeten. Obwohl sie umgehend ins Krankenhaus gebracht wurden, starb ein Techniker noch am selben Tag, ein anderer eineinhalb Wochen später., Missionsverlauf., Erster Startversuch, 10. April 1981., Zu Beginn des Jahres 1981 galt der 17. März als Starttermin des ersten von vier geplanten OFT-Erprobungsflügen (Orbital Flight Tests).

Some of the most popular ones include: 1. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: This system assigns a grade level to a text based on the average number of syllables per word and the average number of words per sentence. 2. Lexile Measure: The Lexile Framework measures both the difficulty of the text and the reading ability of the reader. It assigns a number to indicate the level of the text and matches it with a corresponding reader measure. 3. Gunning Fog Index: This index determines the level of difficulty of a text based on the average number of words per sentence and the percentage of words with three or more syllables. 4. Dale-Chall Readability Formula: This formula considers the familiarity of the words used in a text to estimate its reading level. It uses a list of common words to evaluate the readability. It's worth noting that different reading level systems may produce different results for the same text. It's always a good idea to use multiple systems to get a more accurate estimate of the reading level of a text."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},G={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function L(a,e,h,f,r,s){const m=p("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>r.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,r.searchQuery]]),r.searchQuery?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>r.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",F,[(n(!0),i(x,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(o,g)=>(n(),y(m,{key:g,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),i("div",G,' No results found for "'+c(r.searchQuery)+'".
