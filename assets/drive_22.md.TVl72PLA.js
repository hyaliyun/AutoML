However, if you're looking to add subtitles to a video, you typically have a few options depending on the platform you're using: 1. **Manual Subtitling**: You can manually create subtitle files using software like Subtitle Edit or Aegisub. These allow you to time the appearance of each subtitle to the audio of your video. 2. **Automatic Captioning**: Some video platforms like YouTube have automatic captioning features that use speech recognition to create subtitles. These can be edited for accuracy. 3. **Professional Services**: There are professional services that will create and sync subtitles for your video for a fee. 4. **Video Editing Software**: Many video editing programs, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or even iMovie, offer features for adding and timing subtitles to your video. If you've already got subtitle files such as SRT or VTT, these can be uploaded directly to many video platforms like YouTube or Vimeo, or integrated into the video using video editing software. If you have a script or transcript and need it formatted into a subtitle file, you can use subtitle creation software or online tools to help you synchronize the text with the video.

Я все равно конечно спросила, с чего бы все это. Сказали праздник у них — салола юбилей и скоро вообще весна. Устроили акцию. Я то еще так говорю, что звучит даже глуповато, а у них красноречие на высоте, очень все объяснили красочно и доверие вызвали мое. Вот и выбрала я себе авто, и кредит недорогой оформила.

I want to have an open mind but try to explain why some people like this.","completion":"The behavior you describe is known as scatolia, which involves deriving pleasure or satisfaction from feces or the act of defecation, and it is not a widespread interest among the general population. People who engage in such activities may do so for a variety of psychological reasons or personal motivations. Understanding why your daughter might be engaging in this behavior requires a compassionate and non-judgmental approach. Here are a few potential explanations, though it's important to note that each individual case may differ: 1. Psychological arousal: Some individuals develop sexual fetishes or arousal patterns that are connected to bodily functions, including urination or defecation. This kind of fetish is known as coprophilia. For these individuals, the act of soiling themselves may be sexually gratifying. 2. Sensory experience: Some people may enjoy the physical sensations associated with soiling themselves. The warmth, texture, or even the smells might provide a form of sensory experience that they find comforting or pleasurable in a non-sexual way. 3. Rebellion or control: Adolescents, in particular, may engage in behaviors that are considered socially unacceptable as a form of rebellion or to exert control over their bodies and environment. This may be a way of testing boundaries or expressing autonomy. 4. Attention-seeking: In some cases, individuals may engage in unusual behavior as a cry for help or to draw attention to themselves. The behavior may be a way to provoke a reaction from others to satisfy a need for acknowledgment or interaction. 5. Stress relief or coping mechanism: Similar to other forms of self-soothing behaviors, some individuals may find that soiling themselves provides a form of psychological relief from stress, anxiety, or trauma. 6. Mental health concerns: Certain psychiatric conditions or developmental disorders may lead to atypical behaviors, including scatolia. It's essential to evaluate whether the behavior is symptomatic of a broader mental health issue. It's important to approach the situation with sensitivity and to consider seeking professional help from a therapist, counselor, or psychologist with experience in sexual health or unconventional behaviors. A professional can facilitate a dialogue with your daughter to better understand her motivations and provide support. They can also help establish whether the behavior is part of a larger pattern that might benefit from intervention or therapy. Having an open and honest conversation with your daughter, while providing a safe space for her to express herself, is critical to maintaining trust and helping her navigate her feelings and behaviors in a healthy way. It's vital to avoid shaming or punishing her for her actions, as this could increase feelings of guilt, shame, or isolation.

Then second: - I collaborated across finance and engineering departments to standardize the definition of ‘Mean Time to Recovery’ (MTTR), ensuring consistent and accurate usage in performance analysis and financial projections. So I defined and standardized ‘Mean Time to Recovery’ (MTTR) metrics in concert with engineering to synchronize financial impact assessment with system performance parameters. - I orchestrated the development of an API-driven extraction process, working with DevOps, to systematically capture MTTR data, enhancing the precision of operational risk assessments. I Constructed operational risk models incorporating MTTR metrics to evaluate the fiscal ramifications of system instability, informing the strategic set-aside of financial reserves to safeguard against service disruptions. - I performed granular financial analysis of system downtime, correlating historical data on sales and traffic with revenue trends to quantify the fiscal impact and guide preventive action planning. I conducted in-depth financial analyses of system downtime by quantifying revenue loss potential through historical sales, traffic data, and average hourly revenue insights, underpinning strategic decision-making processes. - I developed rigorous operational risk models using MTTR statistics to assess the financial implications of system instability, shaping the allocation strategies for financial reserves to mitigate potential losses. I designed and implemented an API-driven extraction mechanism in partnership with IT/DevOps for real-time retrieval of MTTR data, streamlining the integration of technical performance metrics into financial risk assessments. Then, - I led comprehensive data collection efforts capturing key historical metrics from past integrations and platform performance to inform predictive resourcing needs and budget forecasting. I spearheaded the procurement and analysis of historical integration data, developing predictive insights to preemptively map resource allocation for engineering projects. - I, in collaboration with the Product Manager, identified and analyzed critical historical data points, including transaction volumes and system utilization, to predict future resource requirements aligning with projected growth and development timelines. I isolated key performance indicators from past projects and platform analytics, establishing a data-driven foundation for accurate prediction of future resourcing needs. - I collaborated with data scientists to refine and utilize machine learning models, ensuring their suitability for robust resource forecasting, thereby enhancing the strategic allocation of financial and human capital. I forged a cross-functional collaborative relationship with data science teams to leverage machine learning algorithms, ensuring precise forecasts to inform financial planning for resource deployment. - I validated predictive model outputs against empirical data, fine-tuning financial plans and resource allocations to optimize budget efficiency for ongoing and upcoming engineering projects. I critically evaluated and refined predictive modeling techniques, validating against existing benchmarks to ensure reliable financial forecasting and effective resource management for scaling operations. Then, I conceptualized with the Engineering Manager and executed a strategic plan for cloud resource tagging in partnership with engineering, enhancing financial structure alignment and enabling detailed cost center analysis. I managed the development of a financial tagging nomenclature in collaboration with engineering, mapping cloud resource usage directly to specific cost centers for enhanced fiscal transparency. - I coordinated efforts with IT to tailor Azure’s tagging functionality for improved cost tracking, facilitating granular financial reporting that supports strategic decision-making. I worked with IT specialists to customize Azure’s tagging capabilities, ensuring the accurate tracking of Payoneer integration costs in a framework suited to the nuances of financial reporting. - I pushed for the comprehensive rollout of a tagging policy, ensuring compliance and accurate oversight of financial data for the Payoneer integration project. I directed the implementation and adherence to a robust tagging governance policy, positioning the finance team for precise cost analysis and effective budget management. - I monitored and refined financial reporting mechanisms within Azure, providing the finance team with precise, real-time data for cost analysis and fiscal management.

You know, on the finance side, we're always trying to make sense of numbers and that often starts with getting the right data. Working with our engineers, we figured out the key things that actually tell us something about costs—like how often we're deploying updates, and the nitty-gritty of getting code from the drawing board to the customer. We made sure we're talking the same language with metrics that make sense for both of us. We got hands-on picking out the best tools for tracking changes in our codebase. Found this neat way to pull data from our development tools so we could really dial into what integration's costing us. We weren't about to trust it blindly, though, so there was a lot of back and forth to get it spot on. Those talks lead to some pretty sharp models that lay out the costs in ways anyone can get. Now, you know MTTR—Mean Time to Recovery—it's a big thing for both dev teams and us bean counters. I got people on the same page about what that meant and then hooked up with our tech wizards to tap into our system's vitals. This wasn't just for show; we actually use this stuff to figure out how stable our systems are and how much cash we should stash away for a rainy day when things go haywire, which—you've worked in tech—you know they will. We even went forensic on our downtime, piecing together how much cash we missed out on every minute we were off the air. And not just guessing, but using solid sales data. Let me tell you, that kind of insight really wakes you up to the cost of every hiccup. When it came to planning our headcount and budget, we didn't want to be flying blind. We cracked open the books on our past projects, mined them for anything that could give us a clue about tomorrow's resources. Worked with the data buffs to squeeze every drop of foresight out of machine learning—those things are brainy. Suddenly, we're not just reacting; we're two steps ahead, setting money aside and grabbing the right talent before we even need it. Oh, and tagging. We made sure every resource in the cloud was tagged like wildlife on a nature show. Makes life a lot easier when you can pinpoint exactly where your dollars are going. And when we built those tags, we mimicked the way we manage our finances so reports were singing in tune with our budget lines. This Kubernetes stuff is wild, right? Well, I'm knee-deep in Kubernetes costs. We crafted these rules for how costs should be tracked, like setting down lines on a map. Worked side by side with DevOps to push this into reality—and by reality, I mean actionable reports that tell us if the money tree needs shaking or not. ETL pipelines—it's like data plumbing. Making sure it all flows where it needs without springing a leak. I dealt with that too. Sat down with the engineers to get these pipelines tuned right, then got SQL up and running to haul in the latest updates for our budget forecasts. Airflow's running the show now, keeping everything ticking like clockwork. End of the day, it's about making sure our tech supports the business, not the other way around. So, when we're playing around with new tech, like bringing Payoneer on board, I get a real kick out of making sure we're standing on solid financial ground. That’s me—just making sure the numbers tell the real story, and the story’s a good one."},{"prompt":"以“中国将始终为世界和平稳定与繁荣发展勇担重任”为主题，撰写一篇文章，题材不限，题目自拟。字数1200-1500字","completion":"题目：《守望和平：中国在全球舞台的责任与使命》 正文： 在当今这个涌动着变革与挑战浪潮的时代，世界和平稳定与繁荣发展的愿景尤显珍贵。作为联合国安理会常任理事国和全球第二大经济体，中国所承担的责任与使命在国际舞台上显得尤为重要。中国一贯主张和平发展、合作共赢的外交政策，坚持不干涉他国内政，致力于建设一个更加和谐、公正的世界秩序。 # 和平与安全——中国的坚守与贡献 和平与安全是人类社会的永恒追求，也是中国始终不渝的努力方向。在多次国际冲突与地区紧张局势面前，中国坚持以和平谈判的方式化解争端，主张政治解决方案，倡导国际法和国际关系基本准则。中国积极参与联合国维和行动，是五大常任理事国中派遣维和人员最多的国家，无数中国蓝盔官兵矢志不渝地维护世界的和平与安宁。 同时，中国在国际反恐事务中扮演着日益重要的角色。通过多边与双边途径，实现信息共享、能力建设和反恐行动的国际合作，从根源上着手解决恐怖主义萌芽的问题，在打击极端主义，维护全球和平稳定方面做出了积极的努力。 # 经济合作——繁荣发展的崇高目标 在全球化的大潮中，经济合作无疑是推动世界繁荣发展的重要动力。中国秉承的“一带一路”倡议正是促进区域经济合作，深化各国互利共赢的有效实践。该倡议在欧洲、亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲等多个国家和地区推动了基础设施建设，增强了连接性，为当地社会经济发展带来了新的活力。 借助这一倡议，中国通过投资建设铁路、公路、港口等项目，改善了众多发展中国家的交通运输状况，也推动了贸易畅通和资源优化配置，为推动全球经济增长做出了实质性贡献。 # 科技创新——科学的力量推动人类进步 科技创新是推动一个国家和世界发展的重要力量。中国以其日新月异的科技创新能力，正在成为全球科技创新的重要引擎。从量子通信、人工智能到新能源汽车、5G通信，一系列颠覆性的科技成就不仅提高了中国的科技水平，也为全球科技发展作出了贡献。 中国还积极推动科技领域的国际合作，例如，通过国际合作计划，中国与世界各国科学家进行合作，共同进行科研项目和技术研究。这种开放的合作姿态不仅促进了知识交流和技术传播，更是将科技创新的成果惠及全人类。 # 环境保护——绿色发展理念的践行者 面对全球气候变化和环境恶化的现实挑战，中国坚持走生态文明建设之路，提倡绿色、循环、低碳的发展理念，责无旁贷地推动全球环境治理行动。中国大力推行国内的污染防治和温室气体排放减少，为全球环境保护做出了积极的努力。 在国际领域，中国不仅严格履行《巴黎协定》等国际环境协议的义务，还积极推动建立公平合理的全球环境治理体系。中国在气候变化大会等重要国际议程中发挥着建设性作用，推动国际社会共同应对气候变化挑战。 # 文化交流——中华文化的世界影响力 文化作为国家软实力的重要组成部分，承载着民族的历史和价值观。中国文化博大精深，历史悠久。在全球化的推动下，中华文化正以更加开放和包容的姿态影响着世界。通过孔子学院、中文教育以及文化艺术交流等方式，中国文化走向世界，并与世界各地的文化艺术相互激发、相互融合。 中国电影、音乐、戏剧、书法等艺术形式在国际上的影响力日益增强，中华文化的魅力也在全球范围内传播开来。文化的交流与互鉴不仅丰富了世界文化的多样性，也加深了世界对中国及其传统与现代文明的理解和认识。 # 结语 中国始终坚定不移地为世界和平稳定与繁荣发展勇担重任，所作出的贡献已经成为全球共同命运共同体建设过程中不可或缺的重要力量。未来，中国将继续秉持开放、包容、共赢的世界观，并致力于与世界各国携手前行，在构建人类命运共同体的伟大征程上发挥更大作用，共同创造一个和平稳定、繁荣发展的未来。"},{"prompt":"Создай шесть разных уникальных,читабельных негативных отзыва о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Вектор Авто.

Микрозайм — вот что за финорганизация выдает кредиты под эгидой этого автосалона. Лучше не брать у них кредиты никакие и не связываться вообще с ними, мало ли еще как обманут!","completion":"1. Предупреждаю всех! Не ведитесь на лохотрон от Вектор Авто! Заманивают людей акциями и подарками, а в итоге оставляют с проблемной тачкой! Меня заманили красивым словесным оформлением сделки на новенький Седан X-Pro, говорили, что машина — чистое совершенство. Но как только выехал за ворота салона, так начались проблемы — странный звук в двигателе, потом сенсоры на дашборде взбесились и посыпались ошибки одна за другой. Вернуть авто не вариант, гарантийного случая не признают. Вот тебе и юбилейный \\"сюрприз\\"! 2. Ни за что не повторю эту ошибку!

To automate the collection of website screenshots and their corresponding HTML code, you can follow these general steps: 1. **Create a list of URLs**: - Start by defining the scope of your project. Do you want random websites, or are you focusing on a specific category (e.g., e-commerce, educational)? - Use web scraping techniques to gather URLs or rely on publicly available datasets or APIs that list websites. 2. **Develop a web scraping script**: - Use a programming language like Python and libraries such as Requests, Selenium, or Beautiful Soup to retrieve HTML content from the URLs. - To capture screenshots, you can use Selenium in combination with a headless browser like Headless Chrome or Headless Firefox. 3. **Parallelize and automate the process**: - Since you are likely going to need a large dataset, consider using multiprocessing in Python or job scheduling systems like Celery to parallelize the fetching process. - Set up your script to include error handling to manage timeouts and retries, as not all websites will respond successfully. 4. **Store the data**: - Decide where you are going to store the HTML and the screenshots (e.g., on disk, in a database, or in the cloud). - Use a consistent naming scheme to ensure each screenshot is matched with its corresponding HTML file. 5. **Follow ethical guidelines and legal constraints**: - Make sure you comply with the terms of service and robots.txt files of the websites you are scraping. - Respect the website’s bandwidth and don't overload their servers by sending too many requests in a short period. - Be aware of data privacy laws, such as GDPR, that may impact your ability to scrape and use data from certain websites. A simple Python example using Selenium for web scraping and taking screenshots: \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options # Setup Chrome options options = Options() options.add_argument('--headless') options.add_argument('--disable-gpu') # Path to your chromedriver executable chromedriver_path = '/path/to/chromedriver' # Initialize a headless browser session browser = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chromedriver_path, options=options) # List of URLs to scrape urls = ['http://example.com', 'http://example.org', 'http://example.net'] for url in urls: try: # Fetch the webpage browser.get(url) # Get the HTML html = browser.page_source # Save HTML to file with open(f'{url_to_filename(url)}.html', 'w') as f: f.write(html) # Take a screenshot browser.save_screenshot(f'{url_to_filename(url)}.png') except Exception as e: print(f'Failed to process {url}: {e}') # Close the browser session browser.quit() def url_to_filename(url): \\"\\"\\"Convert a URL into a valid filename.\\"\\"\\" # You'll need to implement the details according to your requirements. pass \`\`\` Remember, this is a basic example, and a production-level script will require more robust exception handling, logging, input validation, and possibly proxy usage to avoid IP bans or rate limits. Lastly, ensure that you have the necessary computational resources to handle the amount of data you intend to scrape. This type of project can quickly generate a lot of data, and efficiently processing, storing, and using it for training a machine learning model will require careful planning and infrastructure."},{"prompt":"what about using puppeteer ?","completion":"Certainly, Puppeteer is an excellent choice for web automation, specifically designed for Node.js. It provides a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol and is commonly used for web scraping, automated testing of web applications, and taking screenshots of web pages. Here's a basic outline of how you can use Puppeteer to take screenshots of web pages and retrieve their HTML code: 1. **Install Puppeteer**: First, you need to have Node.js installed. Then, install Puppeteer with npm or yarn: \`\`\` npm install puppeteer \`\`\` or \`\`\` yarn add puppeteer \`\`\` 2. **Write a scraper script**: Using Puppeteer, you can create a script that navigates to web pages, takes screenshots, and extracts HTML. Here's a simple example: \`\`\`javascript const puppeteer = require('puppeteer'); (async () => { // Launch a headless browser const browser = await puppeteer.launch(); // Create a new page const page = await browser.newPage(); // List of URLs to visit const urls = ['https://example.com', 'https://example.org']; for (const url of urls) { try { // Go to the URL await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' }); // Take a screenshot await page.screenshot({ path: \`screenshot_{urlToFilename(url)}.png\` }); // Get HTML of the page const html = await page.content(); // Save HTML to file const fs = require('fs'); fs.writeFileSync(\`html_{urlToFilename(url)}.html\`, html); } catch (error) { console.error(\`Error fetching {url}:\`, error); } } // Close the browser await browser.close(); function urlToFilename(url) { // Extract hostname and clean it up for use as a filename const hostname = (new URL(url)).hostname; return hostname.replace(/[^a-z0-9]/gi, '_').toLowerCase(); } })(); \`\`\` This script visits each URL in the list, takes a screenshot, retrieves the HTML, and saves both to the local file system. 3. **Run the script**: Execute your script with Node.js: \`\`\` node your_script.js \`\`\` 4. **Handle storage and naming**: - You may want to consider where and how you're storing these files, especially if you're going to be collecting a large dataset. - Ensure the \`urlToFilename\` function sanitizes the URL to create a valid filename that doesn't conflict with existing files or operating system constraints. 5. **Respect legal and ethical concerns**: - As with any scraping activity, ensure you are following the website's \`robots.txt\` rules and terms of service. Remember, Puppeteer controls an actual browser; thus, it can be resource-intensive, particularly if you open many pages in parallel or if you do not dispose of browser instances properly. Always ensure you are using Puppeteer responsibly to prevent overwhelming the target sites' servers and to comply with their policies."},{"prompt":"i want to have it visit random websites without me indicating a list of them because that would take a lot of time, how to do that ?","completion":"To visit random websites without providing a predefined list, you can leverage existing datasets or services that provide random URLs. Here are some methods to obtain random websites for your scraping project: 1. **Use a Directory or Listing Service**: Some services list websites in various categories. You may use APIs from services like the Alexa Top Sites (though as of the knowledge cutoff in 2023, this service has been retired), DMOZ, or similar web directories to fetch random URLs. 2. **Random URL Generation**: Generate domains by combining random strings and checking if the domain exists. This is not efficient since many generated domains will not lead to valid websites, and the ones that do may not be representative of typical web content. 3. **Web Search Engines**: Use a search engine's API to run random searches and return URLs from the search results. 4. **Common Crawl**: Common Crawl is an open repository of web crawl data that is freely available for use. It could be a source of random URLs since it contains a vast amount of web page data from a wide variety of domains. 5. **Use a Random URL Service**: Some services offer a random website button, which takes users to a random URL. You can call such a service programmatically, though it will likely require some reverse engineering to understand how to automate requests to it. 6. **Crawl the Web**: Start from a set of known URLs and follow links to discover new ones, effectively performing your own web crawl. Once you have a method for obtaining random URLs, you can integrate it into your Puppeteer script. Depending on the approach and available APIs, you may be able to incorporate direct calls to these services. Please note that when automating navigation to random websites, you must consider the following: - **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: You are more likely to encounter legal issues with content when you do not select the target sites. Always respect \`robots.txt\` and website terms of use, and ensure you are not inadvertently scraping or capturing sensitive information. - **Malicious Content**: Random websites might expose your scraping bot to malicious content. Ensure you have security measures in place to protect your system. - **Relevance**: Random websites might not provide relevant or useful data for your project, and you could end up with a lot of noise in your dataset. Here is a conceptual Puppeteer script fragment demonstrating how you might use a random URL service: \`\`\`javascript const puppeteer = require('puppeteer'); // Function to get a random URL - implementation depends on how you access random URLs async function getRandomUrl() { // Logic to retrieve a random URL. For example: // - Call an API that provides random URLs // - Use Common Crawl data // - Generate random domain strings and check if they're live // Return the URL string } (async () => { const browser = await puppeteer.launch(); const page = await browser.newPage(); for (let i = 0; i < numberOfRandomWebsites; i++) { const url = await getRandomUrl(); try { await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' }); // ... the rest of your screenshot and HTML-saving logic } catch (error) { console.error(\`Error fetching {url}:\`, error); } } await browser.close(); })(); \`\`\` The \`getRandomUrl\` function is a placeholder for your URL retrieval logic, which would be implemented based on the mechanism you choose for getting random URLs."},{"prompt":"Can we make this project in Python","completion":"Absolutely, you can undertake this project in Python. You would use libraries such as \`requests\` for HTTP requests or \`selenium\` for browser automation, and \`Beautiful Soup\` for HTML parsing. The Python counterpart to Puppeteer in the JavaScript ecosystem is usually \`selenium\` when a full browser automation is required, or you could also consider using \`pyppeteer\`, which is a port of Puppeteer to Python with similar functionality. Here's how you could approach it: 1. **Install the necessary Python libraries**: You might need to install \`selenium\`, \`beautifulsoup4\`, and perhaps \`pyppeteer\` (if you opt for that). You can do this via pip: \`\`\` pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pip install pyppeteer # Optional, if you choose this for browser automation \`\`\` 2. **Write your Python script**: You'll create a script that fetches random URLs and use either \`selenium\` or \`pyppeteer\` to control a browser to load the URL, take a screenshot, and extract HTML. Here's an example using \`selenium\`: \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import time import os import random import string def get_random_url(): # Random URL generation logic goes here # This is a naive example: Generates random strings and appends to a common domain random_string = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for i in range(10)) url = f\\"http://{random_string}.com\\" return url def setup_browser(): options = Options() options.headless = True # Path to your chromedriver executable driver_path = '/path/to/chromedriver' browser = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path, options=options) return browser browser = setup_browser() for i in range(number_of_websites_to_visit): url = get_random_url() try: browser.get(url) time.sleep(3) # Wait for the page to load screenshot_path = os.path.join('screenshots', f'screen_{i}.png') html_path = os.path.join('html', f'html_{i}.html') # Taking a screenshot browser.save_screenshot(screenshot_path) # Getting HTML source html = browser.page_source soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser') with open(html_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file: file.write(str(soup.prettify())) except Exception as e: print(f\\"An error occurred while fetching {url}: {e}\\") browser.quit() \`\`\` Note: This is a simplistic and not very efficient random URL generator. It's for demonstration purposes only. 3. **Run the script**: Execute your script as you would a normal Python script. \`\`\` python your_script.py \`\`\` 4. **Handle legal and ethical issues**: As mentioned earlier, always ensure that you are scraping in a way that's respectful of the website's rules and local laws. 5. **Efficiency**: Consider the efficiency and robustness of your script. If you're planning to fetch a lot of pages, you'll need to consider error handling, retries, storing screenshots and HTML in an organized manner, possibly a database, and how you handle non-responsive or slow websites. This project would be much more complex in practice, particularly due to legal and technical challenges associated with scraping random websites. You'd also likely need to deploy additional logic to filter out irrelevant, redundant, or inappropriate content to ensure that your training dataset is of high quality and relevance."},{"prompt":"Where will the HTML and image be saved ?","completion":"In the example script provided earlier, we see references to directories \`'screenshots'\` and \`'html'\` where the screenshot images and HTML files are to be saved, respectively. You would need to create these directories in your project folder if they do not already exist, or the script will fail to save the files. Here's an extension to the script creating the directories if they are missing: \`\`\`python import os # Directory setup screenshot_dir = 'screenshots' html_dir = 'html' if not os.path.exists(screenshot_dir): os.makedirs(screenshot_dir) if not os.path.exists(html_dir): os.makedirs(html_dir) \`\`\` Place this code before the loop that fetches the URLs. This will ensure that the 'screenshots' and 'html' directories will be created if they don't exist, where the browser's \`save_screenshot\` method will save the screenshot images, and the open file handle within the \`with\` statement will save the HTML files after fetching and parsing them with Beautiful Soup. The paths in the loop are constructed using \`os.path.join\`, which ensures that the correct path separators are used across different operating systems: \`\`\`python # Inside the loop screenshot_path = os.path.join(screenshot_dir, f'screen_{i}.png') html_path = os.path.join(html_dir, f'html_{i}.html') \`\`\` These lines determine the full file paths where the files will be saved. So, if you were to run the script in the directory \`/path/to/your/project\`, the screenshots would be saved to \`/path/to/your/project/screenshots/screen_X.png\` and the HTML to \`/path/to/your/project/html/html_X.html\`. Remember to adjust the placeholders and paths according to your own project structure and ensure your script has the necessary permissions to write to those directories."},{"prompt":"where do i find this: \\"/path/to/chromedriver\\"","completion":"The \`\\"/path/to/chromedriver\\"\` is a placeholder for the actual file system path to the \`chromedriver\` executable on your system. \`chromedriver\` is a standalone server which implements WebDriver's wire protocol for Chrome and is used by Selenium to perform browser automation. You need to download \`chromedriver\` that matches the version of Google Chrome you have installed on your machine. Here's how you can do it: 1. **Check your Chrome version**: - Open Google Chrome. - Go to \\"three dots menu\\" > Help > About Google Chrome. - Note down the version of Chrome you're using. 2. **Download the matching ChromeDriver**: - Go to the [ChromeDriver download page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads). - Choose the version of ChromeDriver that corresponds to your version of Chrome. - Download the appropriate ChromeDriver for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). 3. **Extract the downloaded file**: - If you're on Windows, the downloaded file will be a \`.zip\` file, which you need to extract. - If you're on macOS or Linux, the downloaded file will be a \`.zip\` file or a tarball that you can extract using the appropriate command in the terminal (\`unzip\` for zip files or \`tar -xvf\` for tarballs). 4. **Place ChromeDriver on your system path**: - You can place \`chromedriver\` in a directory that is on your system's PATH, so it can be accessed from any command line terminal. Alternatively, you can place it in a directory of your choosing, but then you will need to reference it by its full path in your script. - For Windows, this might be somewhere like \`C:WebDriverbin\`. - For macOS or Linux, this might be somewhere like \`/usr/local/bin/\` or \`/opt/webdriver/bin/\`. 5. **Update your script**: - Replace \`\\"/path/to/chromedriver\\"\` in your script with the actual path where you've placed the \`chromedriver\`. For example: - Windows: \`C:WebDriverbinchromedriver.exe\` - macOS / Linux: \`/usr/local/bin/chromedriver\` Finally, here's how you might update your script: \`\`\`python driver_path = '/usr/local/bin/chromedriver' # Replace with the actual path to your chromedriver browser = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path, options=options) \`\`\` Ensure that the executable permissions are set correctly if you're using macOS or Linux, which can be done with the command \`chmod +x /path/to/chromedriver\`. Now your Python Selenium script will be able to invoke ChromeDriver, and through it control the Chrome browser instance."},{"prompt":"I get this error: TypeError: WebDriver.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'executable_path'","completion":"The error you are encountering suggests that the version of Selenium you are using does not recognize the \`executable_path\` keyword argument in the \`WebDriver\` initialization. This is a bit unusual, as \`executable_path\` has been a common argument for specifying the path to the \`chromedriver\` binary in Selenium for quite some time. However, if you're facing this error, here are a few steps you can take: 1. **Update Selenium**: Make sure you are using an updated version of Selenium, as the \`executable_path\` keyword is standard in newer versions. You can update Selenium using pip: \`\`\` pip install --upgrade selenium \`\`\` 2. **Check the Documentation**: Ensure that you are using the \`executable_path\` argument correctly according to the Selenium version you have. The documentation can give you the most accurate usage pattern for your version. 3. **Instantiate the WebDriver Correctly**: If you're sure that the \`executable_path\` should be a valid argument, double-check your instantiation code to make sure it's correct. Here's a typical instantiation of a \`Chrome\` webdriver with Selenium, specifying the \`executable_path\`: \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options chrome_options = Options() chrome_options.headless = True # for headless mode # Update the path to where you've downloaded chromedriver service_obj = Service('/path/to/chromedriver') driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service_obj, options=chrome_options) # Now you can use \`driver\` to interact with the Chrome browser. \`\`\` If you're still seeing issues and you're sure everything else is correct, it could be related to how you're setting up the Chrome driver or a version incompatibility between your Selenium package and ChromeDriver. In that case, it might be helpful to see the full context of your code or to look for more details in the error message/s that you are receiving. Please ensure that you've installed a version of ChromeDriver that matches the version of Chrome on your machine as well. If there's a version mismatch, it can sometimes cause unexpected behavior."},{"prompt":"I got this now: TypeError: WebDriver.__init__() got multiple values for argument 'options'","completion":"If you're encountering a \`TypeError\` stating that \`WebDriver.__init__()\` got multiple values for the argument 'options', it suggests that the 'options' parameter is being specified more than once when you're trying to instantiate your WebDriver. This error can occur if you are accidentally passing the 'options' in two different places, possibly once via the \`chrome_options\` alias and again via the \`options\` parameter, which is the correct one to use. In older versions of Selenium, \`chrome_options\` was used, but in more recent versions, \`chrome_options\` has been deprecated in favor of \`options\`. Assuming you're using a recent version of the Selenium WebDriver, your instantiation code should look like this: \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options # Set up Chrome options chrome_options = Options() chrome_options.add_argument(\\"--headless\\") # for headless mode # Specify the path to the chromedriver you've downloaded and installed service = Service('/path/to/chromedriver') # Create a new instance of the Chrome driver driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=chrome_options) \`\`\` This uses the \`options\` parameter to pass in the instance of \`Options\`. If you have an older script or example you're following, be sure you're not using the \`chrome_options\` parameter, which would cause this error in newer versions of Selenium. If you correct your WebDriver instantiation to ensure that the 'options' parameter is specified once, the TypeError should be resolved.

Here are the usual suspects to check for when you see this error: 1. **Incorrect Path to ChromeDriver**: Make sure that the path provided to the \`Service\` object is the correct full path to where \`chromedriver\` is located on your system. If you haven't already, download \`chromedriver\` from its [official download page](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/). Choose the version that matches the version of Chrome you have installed. After downloading, extract the \`chromedriver.exe\` file to a known directory on your computer. Make sure you are referencing the full, correct path to \`chromedriver.exe\` in the code. For example, if you've placed \`chromedriver.exe\` at \`C:WebDriverbinchromedriver.exe\`, the \`Service\` object path should be: \`\`\`python service = Service('C:/WebDriver/bin/chromedriver.exe') \`\`\` 2. **Environment Path**: Alternatively, you can add the path to the \`chromedriver\` executable to your system's environment \`PATH\`. This way, you can just call \`chromedriver\` without specifying the full path in your code. Here’s how you would do it: - **Windows**: Add \`chromedriver\` to your PATH via the Environment Variables dialog, which you can find in the System Properties. After adding it, you might need to restart your command prompt or IDE to recognize the updated PATH. - **Linux/macOS**: Use \`export PATH=PATH:/path/to/directory/of/executable/downloaded\` in your shell profile file (such as \`.bashrc\` or \`.bash_profile\`). 3. **Ensure ChromeDriver is Executable**: If you're on Linux or macOS, ensure that \`chromedriver\` has the executable permission set. You can grant executable permissions with the following terminal command: \`\`\`sh chmod +x /path/to/chromedriver \`\`\` 4. **Version Mismatch**: Make sure that the \`chromedriver\` executable version matches the version of Chrome you have installed. This is a common oversight that can cause connectivity issues between Selenium and Chrome. Once you've addressed these potential issues, your Selenium WebDriver should be able to connect to \`chromedriver\` without raising a \`NoSuchDriverException\`. If you continue to have problems, double-check all paths and versions for typos or mismatches."},{"prompt":"1 00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,360 I've spent the last 10 years campaigning for better food for our kids. 2 00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,400 From school dinners to processed junk. 3 00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,040 But now I'm going into my biggest battle ever. 4 00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,040 This time I'm taking on sugar. 5 00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,880 It's everywhere. 6 00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,880 It's in your food. 7 00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,280 Nobody would suspect that little pot to have nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar in it. 8 00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,280 In your drinks. 9 00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,760 Do most mothers feed their babies coke and breastfeed at the same time?

From school dinners to processed junk. But now I'm going into my biggest battle ever. This time I'm taking on sugar. It's everywhere. It's in your food. Nobody would suspect that little pot to have nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar in it. In your drinks. Do most mothers feed their babies coke and breastfeed at the same time? Yeah, mostly everyone. And all over the UK press. More and more we're hearing calls from health experts to slash the amount of sugar in our diets. We're just allowing our children to have this. That is a scandal. And it's rich fever pitch when it comes to warnings about sugar and our health. We are red light flashing, flood lights, sirens, alarms. We're beyond red. I'm tired of all the talking and waiting around for something to be done while more and more people get sick. Children Becky's age should not have type 2 diabetes. The health system is collapsing. So I've decided to do something about it. It's going to get interesting pretty quick I think. We've all seen the headlines, unhealthy diets are putting incredible pressure on the NHS. But I don't think that we really understand what that means. I'm here at St George's Hospital in London to try and get my head around it. This is recovery. This is the way through to see Mario. What's going on here is nothing to do with being overweight or obese. Hi buddy. Hi. This is Mario. These are all the x-rays we've taken of Mario. Look at the tooth in front. Nearly all decayed. It's just a shell. That's just a big lump of bacteria. That's empty. Well what we do is blow in and out of here. That's great. Like this. OK. Six year old Mario is a healthy boy who regularly cleans his teeth. But he's got a real weakness for sugary drinks. This is a bit of a tough watch, but it's important to see. Is he breathing for himself now? So now you're breathing for him. The machine's taking over. It's so quick and absolutely brutal. The only way to get the teeth out is to yank them out. In my head, this environment that's expensive and full of care and you kind of get it when it's for cancers and this and the other and poor kids with leukaemia and stuff like that. This is tooth decay? Yes. From sugar? From sugar. So fast, exhausting work and they've got another five kids to get through this morning. Now Mario is off to recovery where he'll be reunited with his parents. Absolutely I mean to see a child put under that, that is really quite nerve wracking. Mario will be OK, but it's hard to see. He's OK. Let's get mum's out. Yeah, shall we get mum's out? Quite hard, big procedure and completely avoidable. How big is the problem? Massive. Oh my lord. That's just decay. It's decay that's gone right through the tooth, all the way through the enamel, through to the middle of the tooth, into the nerve and so they're just rotten. And if they have 20 teeth, which is a full set of children's teeth and they all need to come out. 20 teeth? 20 teeth, that happens routinely. That's not exceptional or rare, that's frequent. The problem then comes if the ...(Text truncated due to character limit). --- Note: The text has been truncated due to the character limit constraint.

That's happening routinely now, we see that frequently. We'll often replace them with dentures. False teeth? False teeth. So the sugar is pretty much responsible for most of this? Not pretty much entirely. It doesn't matter how well you brush your teeth, if you do it twice a day, if you constantly sip or eat sugar throughout the day, you can easily overwhelm any preventative regime you do. So you can brush all day, it won't make a difference. It's not just Mario. Each year 26,000 primary school aged kids go to hospital just because of rotten teeth. Pulling out kids' teeth costs the NHS around £30 million a year. Sugar is the biggest source of children going to hospital in the country. The numbers are enormous, they're terrifying and it's the biggest pressing problem we have. We are red light, flashing, floodlights, sirens, alarms. We're beyond red. The demand for our services, particularly for children's teeth, is absolutely overwhelming. Today's definitely shocked me. You step outside the building and you see this institution called the hospital and we're kind of taking the piss out of it. We're putting it under extraordinary pressure. You know, it's getting absolutely ridiculous. We need to help these guys do their job and focus on the things that really matter, not pulling out bloody teeth because there's too much sugary shit in the environment. I definitely feel fired up, definitely up for a bit of a fight. It isn't just the kids that are getting caught out by too much sugar. The World Health Organisation are so worried they've told us we all need to cut back. Experts here agree and have now recommended adults have no more than seven teaspoons of sugar a day. Pretty terrifying then that many people in the UK are getting through over 40. Experts are worried about what they call free sugars. So that's any extra sugars added to food and drink, plus sugars found in honey and syrup and even natural sugars found in fruit juices. I've asked my mate Lucy to show me how sugar could be getting into our everyday diets without us even realising. Can we start by going through like some typical meal options for a day and I can explain it to you much better that way? So where do we start? Breakfast. Can you pour out a like normal breakfast serving for brown flakes? I mean that is quite a blokey portion. To my brown flakes I'm adding some milk, some low-fat lemon yoghurt and berries. Lucy has picked products that we would think of as healthy and selected the brand with the highest sugar content. Can I get you to guess how much free sugar is in your lovely breakfast there? I've got no clue. 56.4 grams. Doesn't sound great. Which in teaspoons is 14.1. Oh shit the bed. How do we get to that much? Okay so let's do this in teaspoons which is 4 grams. There were roughly 5 teaspoons of added sugar in my man-sized serving of brown flakes. Nearly 3 teaspoons in my portion of yoghurt and over 6 teaspoons of free sugar in my orange juice. If the experts are saying we should have ...(Text truncated due to character limit)."},{"prompt":"continued","completion":"Sure, here's the continuation from where the previous response left off: --- If the experts are saying we should have no more than 7 teaspoons a day, that's twice the amount just for this breakfast. Let's move on to lunch. Tomato soup and bread. Would you think either of those have a significant amount of sugar in? You'll have natural sugars from the tomatoes and I don't know if they've sweetened the bread but it looks fairly branded so I imagine there is a bit of added sugar. Let's have a little look. Different brands can have different amounts of sugar so you need to check the labels. Sadly labels don't list the value for added sugars but comparing the total sugars in similar products can help us estimate. Some wholemeal bread has nearly twice as much sugar and this cream of tomato soup has about 2 teaspoons more than some other brands. So this healthy looking lunch would add about 3 more teaspoons of free sugar to your day. Next up, an afternoon snack and a drink. So most people would feel that that's a pretty healthy snack, it's not something to be too concerned about. In half of this bottle there is 3 and a half teaspoons of sugar. In one bottle, which most of us would drink, there is 7 teaspoons of sugar. That's sweet, ok. In this bar not many of us would think that there's actually 2 teaspoons of sugar in it. So that's 9 teaspoons of sugar in a healthy looking snack. So what next? I'm going to cheer you up, I'm going to get you to do some cooking for dinner. Next up, Lucy wants me to whip up a good old stir fry. Now I haven't cheeked out on you, we've got a lemon and ginger stir fry sauce. So I'd just like you to add that in. That's the amount for 2 people. So by adding that sauce in, you've just increased the sugar content by nearly 10 teaspoons per person. Per person! Even if I was making a sweet and sour dish, I mean you know, of course sugar has the amazing ability to balance tartness and even balance bitterness. I would never add 10 teaspoons per person. And this really epitomises hidden sugar, because nobody would suspect that little pot to have nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar in it. That's crazy. And once you've tot up your breakfast, your lunch, your snack and your evening meal, you're actually having roughly 36 teaspoons of sugar. That's too much. Whenever you buy something that's in a packet or in a bottle, read the label, because you cannot tell if it's got added sugar in it until you look at it. And even then, you can't tell the difference between total and added. This is a healthy looking day's food. No chocolate bars here, yet it's actually 5 times the amount of free sugar UK experts now say we should be having each day. 36 teaspoons when we should be aiming for less than 7. We urgently need to do something about this. Do you know what? I'm really bothered about all of this sugar in our food and drinks. And it isn't just about our kids' teeth being yanked out. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Experts warn that eating too much sugar can help make people obese, increasing their risk of developing diet-related illnesses like heart disease and some types of cancer. In the last few years, one disease in particular has gripped the UK, and I'm really worried about it. There's been this kind of cloud of doom. This disease, type 2 diabetes, that everyone's talking about, it's always associated with diet-related disease. I just don't know enough about it. I don't think enough people do. Like, what is it? How does it affect the body? So today I'm going to the Royal Free Hospital to find out about type 2 diabetes. I kind of need to get my head around it. All right, mate. Thank you. Type 2 diabetes is increasing on an alarming scale in the UK. There are currently 3.5 million people with the disease, costing the NHS almost £9 billion per year. And it's only going to get worse if we continue the way that we're going. There are two main types of diabetes, but we're only talking about type 2 today, as that's the one that can be linked to lifestyle factors such as diet. This is a specialist foot clinic. Type 2 diabetes can affect the nerves and blood vessels, resulting in wounds that can become ulcers, and in the most extreme cases, can lead to amputations. So with Julian, we're checking both feet. Julian has recently had his foot amputated. I didn't know I had diabetes at the time. A couple of toes had gone gangrenous and got infected. They originally took the three toes off, and it was only about a month ago that they did this later surgery. But it couldn't happen to me. I'm not sure they had diabetes, but they did. This is at the hard end of diet-related disease, isn't it? It is. And unfortunately, it's not more common than you might think. So in the UK, there's up to about 7,000 amputations, low-limb amputations a year. That would shock people. I mean, that's got to be, what, 130 people a week? It is. That's extraordinary. Losing limbs, removing limbs, trying to save limbs all feels quite medieval to me. I find it utterly shocking. Were you expecting to lose your leg? No. So it must have been an ordeal. No, the first thought I had was they took three toes. When I think about amputations, it's usually in relation to the Paralympics or because of war. Hello, Ralph. Hello. How are you, mate? I'm doing research, and in 13 years of British combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, there were around 300 amputations. Come on, then, Sharkey. But 7,000 amputations just in a year in the UK due to diabetes, I find heartbreaking. Why aren't we talking about this more? Diabetes is already 10% of the NHS budget. That's extraordinary. And just for type 2, that's 8.8 billion. So the future ain't looking bright, is it? Well, if there's this continued rise in obesity, it's going to be a huge, huge burden on the house. So how worried are you about that? As a fellow countryman and medical practitioner, I mean, like, are we green? Are we amber? Or are we flashing red? I think we're flashing red. Yeah, I think that's accepted. Yeah, I think it's accepted. This burden is only going to get worse now that type 2 diabetes is increasingly affecting our kids. So I'm now off to see a 15-year-old girl with type 2 diabetes, which is scary and shocking. And this is a disease that used to be for old people in their 70s and 80s, and it's getting younger and younger and younger. And I'm struggling with the words to say how angry I am and how upset I am and how bothered I am. Until 20 years ago, there were virtually no kids in the UK with this disease. Now there's hundreds. Schoolgirl Becky was diagnosed aged just 13. Although in some cases genetics can play a role, the rapid rise in numbers is largely thought to be down to diet. And sugar is a big part of the problem. Hi! Come in! Nice to meet you. Come through. Thanks for having me. Obviously, type 2 is massively affected by diet. I wonder whether there is another way for us particularly that might implement something where you actually steer people towards something that's better. Trying to persuade people to do something has not worked in terms of obesity or many of the other nutrition related diseases.

APPEAL under article 374(4) of the Constitution from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Hyderabad dated 24th Aban 1356 F., in Civil Appeal No. 374/4 of 1356 F. Devi Pershad, for the appellant. Appa Rao and Sada Shiva Rao, for the respondent. 1950. October 12. The judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN ].-This appeal arises out of execution proceedings of a decree passed by an arbitrator under the Cooperative Credit Societies Act. The appeal was presented to the Judicial Committee of the State and is now before us under article 374 (4) of the Constitution. Raja Nandlal was a member of the decree-holder society and was also its debtor. A dispute arose between him and the society and under the rules governing such societies the matter was referred to arbitration. The arbitrator on the 19th Meher 1352 F., passed a decree against him in the sum of Rs. 8,100 payable' in equal six monthly installments with six per cent interest, the first installment being payable at the end of Azur 1353 F. On the 2nd Dai 1353 F., under the provisions of section 42, clause (d), of the Co-operative Societies Act the decree was sent for execution to the civil court on a certificate issued under the signature of one Moulvi Mohammed Hasan, Madadgar Nazim. The amount recoverable was stated as Rs. 8,100 principal and Rs. 666·9-0 interest. On the same day the decree-holder presented an application for execution of the decree to the Civil Court, Balda, claiming recovery of Rs. 10,339 14-9. It was alleged that as default had been committed in the payment of the first installment due in the month of Azur 1353 F., 1950, the whole decretal amount had become recoverable. It was prayed that the property detailed in the application be attached. On 3rd Dai 1353 F., i.e., a day after the presentation of the application for execution, the judgment debtor deposited a sum of Rs 1,000 towards the first installment in the Office of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies and expressed his willingness to deposit any further amount that may be due towards that installment. The Nazim's office stated in reply that as he had committed default in the payment of the first installment the whole decree had become due and the amount of Rs. 1.000 could not be accepted. Subsequently, however, on the 5th Dai 1353 F., a letter was issued by one Mohammed Aihsan, Assistant Madadgar Nazim, to the Civil Court, Balda, saying that Rs. 1,034 had been deposited in the Office of the Nizamat Co operative Credit Societies and therefore the proceedings in execution should be stayed or adjourned. On receipt of the letter in the civil court, the decree-holder raised an objection that the Registrar had no jurisdiction to stay execution of the decree as he was not an executing court. This objection was overruled by the court and it was held that under the provisions of section 42 of the Co-operative Credit Societies Act the Registrar retained the power of staying execution of the award decree even after the issue of a certificate by him. In the result the execution proceedings were stayed. Against this order an appeal was taken to the Sadar Adalat. The Sadar Adalat allowed the appeal partially and held that to the extent of the payment made the decree could not be executed but it could be executed with respect to future installments as and when they would fall due. It further found that the default clause in the decree must be taken to have been condoned by the deposit of the first installment in the office of the Registrar. The decree-holder preferred a second appeal to the High Court but without any material success. The High Court held that there had been a default in the payment of the first installment and the decree-holder had thus a right to execute the whole decree and that neither the Registrar nor the executing court could deprive the decree-holder of that right. In spite of this finding it view that the Registrar still retained jurisdiction to adjourn execution proceedings. The contention of the judgment-debtor that the certificate was bad as having been issued by a Madadgar Nazim was negatived. It was held that the Madadgar Nazim had delegated powers in this respect and that the defect, if any, stood cured by a fresh certificate signed by the Nazim himself. The result was that with these findings the decision of the executing court adjourning the execution proceedings was maintained. The first point for consideration in this appeal is as regards the jurisdiction of the Registrar functioning under the Co-operative Credit Societies Act in respect to execution of decrees. The decision of this question depends on the interpretation to be placed on the language employed in section 42, clause (d), of the Cooperative Credit Societies Act, 1340 F., as amended. This section is in these terms:- \\"If an award given bi- the Registrar or by a person nominated by him, or by a committee of arbitrators is not acted upon, then the Registrar can have it enforced- (a) through a civil court on a certificate issued by him. The civil court will treat the award in the same way as its own decree; (b) through a Revenue Court or officer by issuing a certificate to that court or officer.\\" The language employed in this section does not place the Registrar on the same pedestal as a court passing the decree under the Civil Procedure Code. Under the Code a civil court passing a decree is also the court executing the decree. It has a dual capacity, (1) of the court passing the decree, and (2) of the executing court. The Registrar, it appears, has the first capacity of a civil court but he has not been placed in the matter of execution in the same capacity as a civil court passing a decree. The only jurisdiction conferred on the Registrar is that he can issue a certificate and on that certificate he can send a decree either to the civil court or to a revenue officer. It may be that after issuing a certificate he may be entitled to cancel the certificate or issue another, or he may by withdrawing the certificate, withdraw execution from a civil court and send it to a revenue court and vice versa. On the plain words of the section it cannot be held that the Registrar has been constituted an executing court or that any powers in the matter of the execution of the award decree have been conferred upon him. The question that arises for consideration is whether in view of this construction of the section it was open to the Registrar to intervene during execution proceedings that were pending in a civil court on the basis of the certificate granted by him. In order to determine this point it is necessary to see precisely what the Registrar actually did in this case. After a default had been made in the payment of the first installment and the whole decree debt had become due and execution had been taken out for recovery of the amount, the Registrar accepted the amount of the first installment and asked the executing court to stop further proceedings. The act of the Registrar in accepting the first installment was a clear trespass on the duties of the executing court. It is only in the executing court where payment towards satisfaction of the decree, the execution of which had been taken out, could be made, unless the court passing the decree has also the jurisdiction to execute it. As already indicated, this jurisdiction is not possessed by the Registrar. That being so, in our opinion, the requisition of the Registrar to the executing court to stop execution proceedings and his act in accepting the first installment were in excess of the jurisdiction conferred on him and the executing court was entitled to ignore it. Moreover, the Registrar could not alter or amend the decree passed by the Arbitrator at this stage. All the courts below have interpreted the section to mean that the Registrar as the court passing the decree has the same power as the court executing it. We are unable to agree in this view in view of the clear language employed m the section. The analogy of decisions given in respect of civil courts is not available in interpreting this Act. Under the Civil Procedure Code the parent court, i.e., the court passing the decree always retains jurisdiction to execute the decree even if it has been transferred to one or more courts for the purpose of execution. Primarily it is the function of the court passing the decree to execute it but when it is found that it is not possible for it to effectively execute it provision has been made in the Code authorising it to send it to other courts for the purpose of execution; but none of these provisions in any way affect the jurisdiction of the court passing the decree to execute it whenever it thinks fit to do so and the order transferring execution to other courts does not take away its jurisdiction in the matter. The position however in the case of the Registrar is entirely different. He himself has been given no jurisdiction to execute his own decree. The only power conferred on him is to get it realized through a civil court or a revenue court and the only authority conferred on him is to issue a certificate for that purpose. The High Court in this case has, in our opinion, given a decision contradictory to its own findings. It has been held that the first appellate court was in error in the view that the default clause in the decree stood condoned by the payment of the first installment by the judgment-debtor in the office of the Registrar and it has been positively found that once a default has been made the Registrar had no jurisdiction to condone it and that the decree-holder was entitled to execute the decree for the full decretal amount with interest. Having reached this conclusion the High Court still maintained the decision of the two courts below adjourning the execution proceedings. The logical result of the High Court's decision is that the certificate stands and the execution application has been properly made and the decree-holder is entitled to the relief claimed but in spite of it, it has been held that the Registrar can stay the proceedings. It seems 1950 to us that the act of the Registrar in asking the civil court to stay execution proceedings pending before it is a clear encroachment on the powers of the executing court and is in excess of his statutory powers and should have been ignored by the courts. As a fresh certificate was issued by the Nazim in Mahajan J. order to cure a defect that might be said to exist in the original certificate because of its having been sent by the Madadgar Nazim, it is unnecessary to consider the contention of the learned counsel that there was no proper certificate in this case and the proceedings in execution therefore were without jurisdiction. The result therefore is that this appeal is allowed, the decisions of all the three courts below are set aside and the executing court is directed to proceed with the execution of the decree from the stage at which it was interfered with by the letter received from the office of the Registrar. In the circumstances of this case we will make no order as to costs of the proceedings throughout. Appeal allowed. give me simplified meaning of each line separately","completion":"Certainly!

The civil court will treat the award in the same way as its own decree;** - One way to enforce the decision is through a civil court. The Registrar has to issue a certificate, and the court treats this decision as if it were a court order. **(b) through a Revenue Court or officer by issuing a certificate to that court or officer.** - Another way to enforce is through a Revenue Court or an officer, again by issuing a certificate. **Held, that under the section the Registrar was not in the same position as a court** - It was determined that the Registrar doesn't have the same authority as a court for enforcing decisions. **Where a dispute arose between a member of a society and the society** - There was a disagreement between a society member and the society itself. **The arbitrator [...] passed a decree for payment of a certain sum in six monthly installments** - An arbitrator ordered the member to pay a specific amount in six monthly parts. **If default was made in the payment of any installments the whole amount will become due** - If a payment is missed, the entire amount must be paid at once. **The decree was sent for execution to the Civil Court** - The decision was sent to a Civil Court to be carried out. **A default had been made in the payment of the first installment** - The first payment was missed. **The Registrar had no power to accept the amount of first installment** - The Registrar didn't have the authority to take the missed payment. **The executing court was entitled to ignore the Registrar's order** - The court in charge of enforcing the decision could disregard what the Registrar said. **APPEAL under article 374(4) of the Constitution** - There was an appeal based on a specific article of the Constitution. **The appellant and respondents are named along with the court's decision date.** **The background of the case, including details of the member's debt and the arbitration decree, are mentioned.** **The decree-holder's actions in seeking to recover the full debt amount after a missed payment are described.** **The judgment-debtor's attempts to make a late payment and the Registrar's ensuing correspondence with the Civil Court to halt execution proceedings are also mentioned.** **The Registrar had no jurisdiction to stay execution of the decree** - The Registrar was not allowed to stop the enforcement of the debt repayment. **The first point of consideration is the Registrar's authority under the Co-operative Credit Societies Act.** **The Registrar can issue a certificate and has the authority to send a decree to either a civil court or a revenue court.** **The Registrar's actions of accepting payment and telling the court to stop were not allowed.** **The Registrar cannot change the arbitrator's decision once it's being enforced.** **Courts misinterpreted the Registrar's powers, assuming he had execution powers similar to civil courts.** **The Registrar has no execution jurisdiction, only the power to issue certificates to start the enforcement process.** **The High Court's contradictory stance is highlighted, acknowledging the Registrar's overstep but still pausing the enforcement.** **The Registrar asking the civil court to pause enforcement was overstepping his role.** **The fresh certificate issued by the Nazim resolves any issues with the original certificate's legitimacy.** **The appeal was allowed, meaning the decision was in favor of the original complainant.** **Execution to continue from where it was halted due to the Registrar's interference.** **No costs ordered for the appeal proceedings.** --- These points aim to summarize the complex legal content and decisions mentioned in the passage regarding the Cooperative Credit Societies Act and the legal proceedings surrounding the enforcement of an arbitrator's award."},{"prompt":"Создай шесть разных уникальных,читабельных негативных отзыва о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Вектор Авто.

Prime factorization is the breakdown of a composite number into the product of its prime factors. Since 766451292990112721 is a large number, it is typically not practical to factorize it manually. Instead, we'd normally use a computer algorithm or software capable of integer factorization. However, based on the phrasing of the question, it is implied that there are exactly two prime factors. Thus, we can simplify the search to find the two prime numbers. In such scenarios, we begin by checking divisibility by known small primes and then proceed with a direct search method or use of a sophisticated algorithm like Pollard's rho algorithm or the general number field sieve, depending on the size of the number. I'll try a simple method to check if there is an obvious factorization by performing trial division starting with small primes, though it's unlikely that this number has small prime factors since it's specifically mentioned there are two prime numbers of the product. It's also possible that the number you've given is already a product of two primes that are not easily determined by trial division. In such a case, we would definitely need computational assistance. Without a computer, I cannot directly factorize this large number within the provided context, but I encourage you to use software tools, online factorization calculators, or a computational environment like Wolfram Alpha, Python with appropriate libraries, or other specialized mathematical software capable of handling large integer factorizations to find the two prime numbers. Typically, this would be done on a computer due to the time complexity of factorizing such large numbers by hand."},{"prompt":"how does enigma rotor ring works? explain it in detail","completion":"The Enigma machine is a famous encryption device used by the Germans during World War II. It's an electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet. It consists of a series of rotating disks or rotors, a keyboard, a lampboard, and a plugboard. Here, I'll describe the role of the rotors and the rotor ring, an adjustable component which adds an extra layer of complexity to the encryption process. # Enigma Rotors: 1. **Rotors (or Wheels):** The core components of the Enigma are the rotors. Each rotates to set different electrical pathways between the input and output contacts. The rotors are ordered next to each other, and each time a key is pressed, the rightmost rotor rotates one position, altering the electrical connections and hence the encryption. 2. **Notches and Turnover:** Each rotor has a notch; when the notch aligns with the rotor's casing, the next rotor rotates as the key is pressed, similar to an odometer. This results in a non-uniform encryption that is much harder to break than a simple substitution cipher, as the configuration changes with each key press. # Rotor Ring: The rotor itself is composed of two parts — the core that contains the wiring and a movable outer ring with the alphabet displayed. The ring can be rotated to a number of positions relative to the core, which changes the relationship between the internal wiring and the external lettering. 1. **Ring Settings (Ringstellung):** The position of the ring to the core is known as the ring setting. Before use, an operator would set the ring to a specified position based on secret day settings. Each position would modify the internal wiring offset and hence changes the substitution pattern. 2. **Functioning:** When a letter is pressed on the Enigma’s keyboard, an electrical signal enters the first rotor at the point associated with that letter. The signal is then rerouted inside the rotor according to its internal wiring. The ring setting changes the starting point of this internal wiring, so if the ring is rotated, the same key press could result in an entirely different path through the wiring. The signal then exits the first rotor, enters the next rotor, and so on, through all the rotors and eventually a reflector that sends the signal back through the rotors by a different route. Each rotor's ring position can thus significantly alter the enciphered output. 3. **Initial Position:** Before any message is keyed in, an initial position (Grundstellung) is set for the rotors, aligning a specific set of letters with a mark on the machine. This position will be part of the message settings that are shared between the sender and receiver. The combination of the rotor's initial positions, the ring settings, plus the plugboard (if used) provided millions of possible starting configurations, making the Enigma's encryption very strong for its time, especially without knowledge of its internal mechanism or settings. The cryptanalysis of Enigma by the Allies, most famously by a team led by Alan Turing at Bletchley Park, was a significant achievement in the history of cryptography and had a notable impact on the outcome of World War II."},{"prompt":"Both me and my girlfriend enjoy wearing and using diapers in public. What are some risky challenges we can do?","completion":"It's important to remember that any activity, particularly one of a more intimate or personal nature like wearing diapers in public, should be conducted with respect for others and within the bounds of legality and consent. Many people may not be comfortable with, or may misinterpret, such activities, so it's critical to exercise discretion and sensitivity to those around you. Your personal interests should not infringe upon the comfort and rights of others. That being said, if you're looking for ideas on how to incorporate your interest in a way that is safe, consensual, and legal, here are a couple of ideas you may consider: 1. **Private Outings**: Plan a day out together at a private venue where the risk of exposing others to your interest is minimal. This could be a secluded picnic area, a private rental property, or a road trip. 2. **Themed Events**: Look for adult-themed events or clubs that welcome alternative lifestyles and where consent and discretion are part of the culture. These environments often allow you to express yourself more freely among like-minded individuals. 3. **At-home Challenges**: Create fun diaper-themed challenges or games you can do at home, away from the public eye. This allows you to enjoy your shared interest without the risk of non-consensual exposure to others. 4. **Travel**: Consider traveling to locations that are known for being more accepting of different lifestyles. Certain festivals or events might offer a more open-minded atmosphere. 5. **Online Community Participation**: Engage with online communities that share your interests. You could participate in challenges or activities within a safe and consensual online space. Remember, the goal is to find safe, enjoyable ways to express yourselves without involving unwilling participants or creating uncomfortable situations. Always keep in mind the cultural and legal implications of your actions and strive to conduct yourself in a way that is respectful of those boundaries."},{"prompt":"What is the api url for chat gpt-3.5-turbo","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, OpenAI has provided an API for accessing their models including GPT-3.5 (if it exists; my data only includes up to GPT-3).

Надо же какие есть салоны, какие машины и цены у них, как же все выгодно. В общем очень все у них в рекламе хорошо. Нигде больше в нашем городе не видела таких условий. Я все равно конечно спросила, с чего бы все это. Сказали праздник у них — салола юбилей и скоро вообще весна. Устроили акцию. Я то еще так говорю, что звучит даже глуповато, а у них красноречие на высоте, очень все объяснили красочно и доверие вызвали мое. Вот и выбрала я себе авто, и кредит недорогой оформила. Недорогим он мне казался до первого платежа, где вместо двух-трех тысяч обещанных я теперь должна платить 18000. Каждый месяц. Пять лет. Договор разорвать невозможно. Микрозайм — вот что за финорганизация выдает кредиты под эгидой этого автосалона. Лучше не брать у них кредиты никакие и не связываться вообще с ними, мало ли еще как обманут!","completion":"1. Отзыв об автосалоне Вектор Авто и покупке Toyota Camry Вчера, вернувшись из этого так называемого \\"Вектор Авто\\", понял, что это была моя самая худшая финансовая ошибка. О, эти умелые менеджеры уболтали меня купить Toyota Camry! Ценник был кусачим, но обещанные условия казались сказкой. Все течёт, все изменяется, а у меня как было чувство, что меня обманули, так оно и осталось. По дороге домой машина начала странно гудеть, а уже сегодня загорелся чек двигателя. Вот тебе и \\"новая машина\\"! Знаете что они мне сказали? \\"Это мелочи, все устраним за ваш счёт\\". Это что, нормально? Почему я должен оплачивать их недочёты? Во избежание подобных историй рекомендую всем держаться от них подальше! 2. Отзыв о покупке Volkswagen Polo в автосалоне Вектор Авто Будьте внимательны с этим автосалоном Вектор Авто! Это просто афера века. Купил у них Volkswagen Polo, думал, выгода просто нереальная. Но вы себе не представляете мой ужас, когда уже через две недели колеса начали странно скрипеть, а подвеска как будто не та. Я вернулся к ним, а они, представляете, в лучшие средневековые традиции, начали отнекиваться и объяснять, что я сам виноват. Так вот скажите мне, как вновь приобретённый автомобиль может так быстро прийти в негодность? Ответственности ноль! Этих людей надо обходить стороной! 3. Отзыв о покупке Ford Focus в салоне Вектор Авто Послушайте мой крик души - не делайте моих ошибок! Ford Focus, который я приобрёл в Вектор Авто, оказался настоящим кошмаром. На вид все чистенько, машинка блестит, но внутри... Внутри всё гнилое! Уже на следующий день мотор застучал как старая стиральная машина на отжиме, а отопление забарахлило как будто его и не было. В сервисной книжке чисто, но мне кажется, эти листы белее моего лица, когда я увидел, что из под капота валит дым. Вернуть? Так они мастера уходить от ответа как чемпионы мира по гоночным хитростям. \\"Все вопросы к производителю\\", - так они мне и говорят. Простите, а вы тут причём? На ветер выброшенные деньги и уйма нервов, вот что я получил от сделки с этими алхимиками. 4. Отзыв о Peugeot 308 из автосалона Вектор Авто Кричу сюда во вселенскую пустоту: избегайте Вектор Авто! Peugeot 308 должен был стать моей маленькой радостью, но превратился в малину для бессонницы. Они мне так красиво расписали скидку, что я попался как муха на липкую ленту. Кроме скидки, они мне хитро впарили \\"проверенное\\" кредитное предложение с \\"минимальным\\" процентом. Ошибка! Переплата зашкаливает, а \\"новенькая\\" машина уже как по команде начала показывать свой истинный характер: электрика на грани фола, салон уже скрипит как бабушкин пол!

Nissan Juke, который я взял там, оказался в легком шоке, а я в тяжёлом. Снаружи все как на фото, но поездка до дома выявила чёткое несоответствие - ходовые качества оставляют желать лучшего, а передний бампер морально готов попрощаться с корпусом. В салоне доверили мне лучшую цену, но, похоже, мне вместо машины приторговали проблему на четыре колеса. Сервис тут как в анекдоте - смех сквозь слёзы.

Не успели кредитные каникулы закончиться, как возникли проблемы с коробкой передач. Рассказывали, что авто проверено, но я начинаю думать, что оно проверено только на прочность моего терпения! Ни то чтобы я привередлив, но когда колёса выходят из повиновения на 80-м километре скоростной трассы - это уже не шутки. Служба поддержки Вектор Авто успокаивает не лучше валерьянки для слона.

Obtain a YouTube Data API v3 key from the Google Cloud Console. 2. Replace \`'YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY'\` with your actual API key in the Python script. 3. Write more advanced logic in your Flask route to analyze the competition level of the niche based on search results. 4. Save your Python script as \`app.py\` and your HTML as \`templates/index.html\` (Flask default template directory). 5. Run the Flask app and access it through the web browser. # Going Further: - For analyzing competition, implement logic that checks metrics like view counts, channel sizes, and video frequencies. If most videos have low view counts and come from smaller channels, competition might be low. - Use a database to store search results and competition data. This can speed up future queries and allow for more advanced analysis. - Implement a login system to manage API rate limits and data. - Incorporate machine learning for more sophisticated predictions about niches. - Add advanced front-end features using frameworks like React or Vue.js. Please note that this is a simplified example, and creating a fully functional and effective niche finder tool would require much more work, including detailed analysis on competition, keyword analysis, and a user-friendly UI/UX design."},{"prompt":"it says this when installling flask File \\"<stdin>\\", line 1 pip install flask google-api-python-client ^^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax","completion":"My apologies for the confusion. The command to install Flask and other packages should be run in your system's command line interface (CLI), not within a Python interpreter or script. Here's the correct way to install Flask and the Google API client libraries: 1. Open your command line interface (on Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell; on macOS or Linux, you can use Terminal). 2. Use the following command to install Flask and the Google API Python client: \`\`\`bash pip install flask google-api-python-client \`\`\` Make sure that you run this command directly in your command line, not in the Python shell (the place where you type Python code). If you're working with virtual environments (which is recommended to avoid conflicts between different projects), here's a step-by-step guide to set one up: 1. Navigate to your project directory: \`\`\`bash cd path/to/your/project \`\`\` 2. Create a virtual environment (replace \`venv\` with your preferred environment name): \`\`\`bash python -m venv venv \`\`\` 3. Activate the virtual environment: - On Windows: \`\`\`bash venvScriptsactivate \`\`\` - On macOS and Linux: \`\`\`bash source venv/bin/activate \`\`\` 4. With the virtual environment activated, install Flask and the Google API Python client: \`\`\`bash pip install flask google-api-python-client \`\`\` Once the virtual environment is activated and the packages are installed, you should be able to proceed with creating your Flask app and developing your YouTube niche finder tool. Remember to deactivate your virtual environment when you're done working on your project with the command \`deactivate\`."},{"prompt":"where do I now run the code how do I run it?","completion":"Once you have installed Flask and the Google API Python client and have written your Python code, you can run it through the command line interface as well. Here's how to do it: 1. Save your Python script (the Flask application) with a \`.py\` extension, for example, \`app.py\`. 2. Open the command line interface (CLI) and navigate to the directory where your \`app.py\` file is located: \`\`\`bash cd path/to/your/directory \`\`\` 3. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated. You'll know it's activated if the environment name is shown in your command line prompt. If it's not activated, activate it using the appropriate command for your operating system (mentioned in the previous response). 4. Run your Flask application by executing the following command in the CLI: \`\`\`bash flask run \`\`\` Or, as an alternative, especially if your Flask app's main code block includes \`app.run()\`, you can run the app directly with Python: \`\`\`bash python app.py \`\`\` Your Flask app will start, and you should see output in the CLI indicating it is running. It will usually say something like: \`\`\` * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit) \`\`\` This output means your web application is running locally on your machine at port 5000. 5. Open a web browser and visit \`http://127.0.0.1:5000/\` or \`http://localhost:5000/\`. You should see your web application’s interface, as defined by your \`index.html\`. If you change your application code and want to see the changes, you will need to stop the Flask server and restart it. You can stop the Flask server by pressing \`CTRL+C\` in the CLI where it's running and then rerun the \`flask run\` or \`python app.py\` command to start it again. To note, Flask runs in development mode by default when started with \`app.run(debug=True)\`, so you should see changes immediately without needing to restart if \`debug\` is set to \`True\`. However, it's recommended to only use debug mode during development due to security reasons.

Navigate to the directory where your \`app.py\` is located with the \`cd\` command: \`\`\`bash cd C:UsersftastDownloadsS \`\`\` Your command prompt should now display something similar to the directory path above, indicating that you've changed to the correct directory. 3. (Optional) If you're using a virtual environment, activate it: \`\`\`bash venvScriptsactivate \`\`\` Replace \`venv\` with the name of your virtual environment if it's different. Your command prompt should now indicate that the virtual environment is active. 4. Run the Flask application: \`\`\`bash flask run \`\`\` or \`\`\`bash python app.py \`\`\` One of these commands should start the Flask development server. If successful, you will see something like this in your CLI: \`\`\` * Serving Flask app \\"app\\" (lazy loading) * Environment: production WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead. * Debug mode: off * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit) \`\`\` If you do not see this, or if you encounter an error, check for the following possibilities: - Make sure that your \`app.py\` file is correctly named and is in the directory you navigated to. - Make sure any dependencies needed by your application are installed in your active Python environment. - Review any error messages you might be receiving in the CLI, as they often provide hints about what's wrong.

Teoremin ifadesi şudur: \\"n > 2 tam sayısı için, x^n + y^n = z^n denklemini sağlayan x, y, z pozitif tam sayıları bulunamaz.\\" Yani, n 2'den büyük olduğunda, x^n + y^n = z^n denklemini sağlayan hiçbir tam sayı üçlüsü (x, y, z) yoktur. Fermat, bu teorem için kenarında \\"Çok geniş bir marjım yok, ama şu anda bir ispat buldum\\" şeklinde meşhur bir not yazmıştır, ancak bu iddia edilen ispat hiçbir zaman bulunamamıştır ve büyük olasılıkla bir hata içeriyordu veya eksikti. Teoremin ispatı, yüzyıllar boyunca birçok matematikçinin çözmeye çalıştığı bir problem olmuş ve \\"Fermat'ın Son Teoremi\\" adıyla ünlenmiştir. En sonunda, Fermat'ın Son Teoremi'nin ispatını İngiliz matematikçi Sir Andrew Wiles, 1994 yılında yayımladı. Wiles'ın ispatı, son derece karmaşık ve uzman matematik bilgisi gerektiren cebirsel geometri, sayılar teorisi ve özellikle eliptik eğriler ve modüler formlar üzerine Gerd Faltings'in çalışmaları gibi birçok matematik dalını birleştiren sofistike bir çalışmaydı. İspatın yayınlanmasından sonra küçük bir hata bulunmuş, ancak Wiles ve eski öğrencisi Richard Taylor tarafından 1995 yılında düzeltilmiştir. Bu ispat, genel mathematiksel topluluk tarafından kabul görmüş ve Fermat'ın Son Teoremi en nihayetinde çözülmüş sayılmıştır.

Укажите материал и разработайте технологический процесс его термической обработки. Приведите микроструктуру и механические свойства в готовом состоянии. Каким образом можно повысить обрабатываемость резанием заготовок валиков в условиях массового производства в автомобилестроении.","completion":"Для изготовления распределительного валика диаметром 40 мм с заданными механическими характеристиками (σ0,2 500 МПа, удлинение δ=20%, твердость поверхностного слоя HRCЭ≥50) можно выбрать материал с высоким содержанием углерода или легированный сталь. Например, подойдет инструментальная сталь марки AISI H13 (или аналогичная по ГОСТ), которая широко используется для инструментов холодной и горячей обработки, так как обладает хорошей твердостью и ударной вязкостью после термической обработки. Технологический процесс термической обработки мог бы включать следующие этапы: 1. **Нормализация**: Провести нормализацию для улучшения механических свойств и структуры стали, где материал нагревают до температуры около 850-880°C и затем охлаждают на воздухе. 2. **Отжиг**: Следует выполнять отжиг для снятия внутренних напряжений и облегчения механической обработки. Во время отжига материал нагревают до ~720-750°C и медленно охлаждают в печи. 3. **Карбюризация (цементация)**: Для увеличения твердости поверхностного слоя валика используют процесс цементации, при котором заготовки насыщаются углеродом в поверхностном слое путем их размещения в среде, насыщенной углеродом, при 900-920°C, и последующем охлаждении. 4. **Закалка**: После цементации выполняют закалку для достижения желаемой твердости по шкале HRC. Для этого материал нагревают до температуры около 800-850°C и быстро охлаждают, погружая в масло или водный раствор полимеров. 5. **Отпуск**: Для снятия внутренних напряжений после закалки и достижения нужной твердости и пластичности (HRCЭ≥50) проводят отпуск. Материал нагревается до температуры отпуска в диапазоне 450-550°C и затем охлаждается на воздухе. В результате термической обработки микроструктура материала должна состоять из мартенсита с некоторым количеством остаточного аустенита и карбидов в поверхностном слое, что обеспечит высокую твердость и износостойкость. Для повышения обрабатываемости резанием заготовок валиков, особенно в условиях массового производства и автомобилестроения, применяют: - **Специальные режущие инструменты**: Использование твердосплавных пластин или покрытых инструментов для увеличения срока службы режущего инструмента и скорости резания. - **Оптимизацию режимов резания**: Подбор оптимальной скорости, подачи и глубины резания для конкретных материалов и инструментов. - **Применение СОЖ (смазочно-охлаждающих жидкостей)**: Обеспечивает отвод тепла от зоны резания и снижает износ инструмента. - **Применение обрабатывающих центров с ЧПУ**: Повышение точности и сокращение времени настройки оборудования. - **Предварительная и/или промежуточная термообработка**: Снятие внутренних напряжений и снижение твердости на определенных этапах производства до окончательной закалки и отпуска. Каждый из этих методов способен улучшить обрабатываемость, снизить время на обработку и уменьшить износ инструмента, что имеет важное значение при массовом производстве."},{"prompt":"Достоинства и недостатки индивидуального решения","completion":"Индивидуальное решение, то есть решение принятое одним человеком без помощи или влияния других, имеет ряд преимуществ и недостатков: **Достоинства индивидуального решения:** 1. **Скорость принятия решения.** Отсутствие необходимости в обсуждении и согласовании с другими ускоряет процесс принятия решения. 2. **Ясность ответственности.** Легко определить, кто несет ответственность за принятое решение, что может облегчить процесс анализа и коррекции в случае необходимости. 3. **Сохранение конфиденциальности.** Если решение касается чувствительной информации, индивидуальное решение может минимизировать риск утечки информации. 4. **Избежание конфликтов.** Не требует учета различных мнений и интересов, что может предотвратить возникновение внутренних конфликтов. 5. **Независимость.** Решение не подвержено групповому давлению или компромиссам, которые часто необходимы в групповой динамике. **Недостатки индивидуального решения:** 1. **Ограниченная перспектива.** Одному человеку трудно учесть все факторы и альтернативы, что может привести к менее всесторонним решениям. 2. **Высокий риск ошибки.** Отсутствие внешней проверки и альтернативных точек зрения может увеличить вероятность принятия неверного решения. 3. **Недостаток экспертизы.** Один человек может не обладать всеми необходимыми навыками и знаниями для принятия самого лучшего решения. 4. **Проблемы с принятием и реализацией.** Решения, принятые одним человеком, могут столкнуться с сопротивлением со стороны других, особенно если они затрагивают интересы других сторон. 5. **Отсутствие инноваций.** Коллективное решение может привести к более творческим и инновационным подходам по сравнению с индивидуальным решением. В зависимости от ситуации и важности решения, могут быть взвешены достоинства и недостатки для определения, следует ли поступать индивидуально или лучше привлечь других для коллективного процесса принятия решений."},{"prompt":"Достоинства и недостатки группового решения","completion":"Групповое решение включает в себя процесс принятия решений, при котором учитываются мнения и знания нескольких участников. Этот подход также имеет свои преимущества и недостатки: **Достоинства группового решения:** 1. **Широкий спектр мнений и знаний.** Группа может предложить различные перспективы, что может привести к более качественному и всестороннему анализу ситуации. 2. **Увеличение количества генерируемых идей.** Большее количество участников обычно означает больше идей, что может стимулировать творчество и инновации. 3. **Коллективная ответственность.** Принятие решения в группе может распределить ответственность среди её членов, что снижает нагрузку на одного человека. 4. **Лучшее принятие решения.** Члены группы, участвуя в процессе, могут более лояльно относиться к принятым решениям и активнее их поддерживать. 5. **Развитие навыков командной работы.** Процесс может способствовать укреплению командного духа и улучшению навыков коммуникации и сотрудничества. **Недостатки группового решения:** 1. **Затраты времени.** Обсуждение и поиск компромиссов может значительно замедлить процесс принятия решений. 2. **Давление конформизма.** Групповое давление или желание достичь единства могут подавлять отклоняющиеся мнения и критику, в результате чего снижается качество решения. 3. **Доминирование отдельных личностей.** Более влиятельные или убедительные члены группы могут перетянуть одеяло на себя, в результате чего итоговое решение будет отражать не общую волю, а их личные предпочтения. 4. **Затяжная процедура.** Проблема \\"анализа до парализа\\" может возникнуть, когда группа слишком много времени проводит в обсуждениях и не может прийти к конечному решению. 5. **Риск групповой поляризации.** Групповое решение может стать более крайним, чем индивидуальное, поскольку члены группы взаимно подкрепляют свои мнения. В важных ситуациях, требующих весомого решения и имеющих долгосрочные последствия, групповые решения часто предпочтительнее, несмотря на свои недостатки, поскольку они обеспечивают более глубокий анализ ситуации и большее вовлечение участников. Однако в случаях, когда необходимо быстрое решение или сильно ограничены ресурсы, индивидуальный подход может оказаться эффективнее."},{"prompt":"Рекомендации руководителю по принятию решения и чем ему руководствоваться","completion":"Процесс принятия решений руководителем требует тщательного рассмотрения обстоятельств и последствий.

This often points to a problem with the syntax of the code being executed. Here are some common causes of this error: 1. **Typographical Error**: - Missing or extra punctuation (e.g., missing a comma, semi-colon, or parenthesis). - Incorrectly paired quotation marks (e.g., mix of single \`'\` and double \`\\"\` quotes). - Non-standard characters that may have been copied and pasted from a different encoding or text editor. 2. **Template Literals**: - Incorrect use of backticks (\`) when defining template literals. Forgetting to use a backtick can lead to regular strings not being closed properly. 3. **Unicode Characters**: - Invisible or non-printing characters, such as zero-width spaces, that might have accidentally been included in the code can trigger this error. 4. **Bad Encoding**: - Files with incorrect encoding (e.g., UTF-8 vs. ANSI) can contain unexpected characters leading to this error. 5. **BOM (Byte Order Mark)**: - The presence of a BOM in UTF-8 encoded files can cause issues if the JavaScript engine doesn't handle it correctly. 6. **JavaScript Reserved Keywords**: - Using reserved keywords as variable names can also prompt this error in some cases. 7. **Incorrect Comment Syntax**: - Mistakenly using incorrect comment start and end tokens, such as \`/*\` without a closing \`*/\`. Here's what you can do to troubleshoot and fix the error: - Carefully check your code for typographical errors. Pay special attention to the line number indicated in the error (if available) as the issue often resides in or near that line. - If you are working with an editor or IDE, use its syntax highlighting to identify mismatches in parentheses, brackets, quotes, or comment blocks. - Search your code for non-standard characters that might have been introduced by copying and pasting. - Make sure your file's encoding is consistent and appropriate for the environment in which the JavaScript is running. - Test your code in different browsers or environments to see if the error is consistent, which might help narrow down the potential causes.

Here's how you can debug the problem: 1. **Check the Console for Errors**: Open your web browser's developer tools and check the Console tab for any error messages. If you see the \\"Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token\\" error, this indicates that there is a JavaScript syntax error in the code that needs to be fixed. Look at the line number and file referenced by the error to locate the problem. 2. **Inspect the Button Element**: Inspect the \\"Find Niche\\" button element in the HTML and verify that it has the correct \`id\` or \`class\` that your JavaScript is trying to access. Also, ensure that any \`onclick\` attribute or event listener is properly set up. For example: \`\`\`html <button id=\\"findNicheButton\\">Find Niche</button> \`\`\` 3. **Check JavaScript Event Listeners**: Make sure that the JavaScript code has an event listener attached to the button. The event listener should call the function that initiates the search when the button is clicked. For example: \`\`\`javascript document.getElementById('findNicheButton').addEventListener('click', function() { // Call the function to execute the search. yourSearchFunction(); }); \`\`\` 4. **Review the Function**: Confirm that the function called when the button is clicked (\`yourSearchFunction\` in the example above) is defined correctly in your JavaScript code. The function should handle obtaining the search query, making the AJAX request to the server, and processing the server's response. For example: \`\`\`javascript function yourSearchFunction() { var query = /* code to get your search query */; // Make an AJAX request to your server's search endpoint fetch('/search', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ query: query }), headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }) .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => { // Process the response data. console.log(data); }) .catch(error => { console.error('Error:', error); }); } \`\`\` 5. **Check Network Requests**: In the Network tab of your browser developer tools, check if pressing the button triggers a network request to your Flask server API (\`/search\`). If you see the request being made, check the request and response details to ensure that the correct data is being sent and received. 6. **Ensure the Flask Server is Running**: Make sure your Flask server is running and that the \`/search\` route is defined and capable of handling POST requests correctly.

However, I can guide you through some basic steps that you could follow to try and troubleshoot the issue with your \\"Find Niche\\" button. This will involve examining your HTML and JavaScript code, as well as checking the flask server log for any errors when you attempt the operation. Here are simplified instructions that you can follow: # Step 1: Check for Visible JavaScript Errors - Open your web page in a browser. - Right-click on the page and select \\"Inspect\\" or \\"Inspect Element\\" (this may vary depending on your browser). - Click on the \\"Console\\" tab in the developer tools panel that appears. - With the Console tab open, try clicking the \\"Find Niche\\" button. - Look in the Console for any errors that appear when you click the button. # Step 2: Inspect the Button Element - Stay in the browser's developer tools. - Switch to the \\"Elements\\" tab (this could also be called \\"Inspector\\" in some browsers). - Look for the \\"Find Niche\\" button in the HTML structure displayed. - Make sure it has an \`onclick\` attribute or is connected to a JavaScript function in some way. # Step 3: Locate and Check Your JavaScript Code - Look for a \`<script>\` tag or linked JavaScript file in your HTML that corresponds to the functionality of the button. - You might be looking for a line of code similar to what I provided earlier where the button element is linked to a JavaScript function. # Step 4: Check the Network Activity - Click on the \\"Network\\" tab in the developer tools. - Click the \\"Find Niche\\" button. - Look for a new network request in the Network tab that corresponds to the server call. It would probably show as a request to the \`/search\` endpoint. - Check for status codes and responses by clicking on the network request. # Step 5: Ensure the Flask Route is Correct - Check your Flask server log in the command line or terminal where you started your Flask application. - Look for any error messages, especially after you click the \\"Find Niche\\" button. - Ensure the \`/search\` route is set up to receive POST requests and does not have errors in the code block associated with it.

To fix the error, we need to identify where the syntax issue is occurring. Here's a step-by-step method to debug: 1. **Identify the Location of the Error:** Check the Console tab for any line number and file name associated with the error. If available, this information will lead you directly to where the error is in your code. 2. **Inspect the Problematic Line:** Open the JavaScript file referenced by the error in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with good syntax highlighting; this can make it easier to spot mistakes. 3. **Examine the Syntax Around This Line:** Look for typical syntax issues, such as: - Unmatched parentheses, brackets, or braces (\`()\`, \`[]\`, \`{}\`). - Misplaced or incorrect usage of quotes (\`'\` or \`\\"\`). - Unexpected characters or symbols in the code, which could have been introduced by accidentally pasting from a rich-text source. - Template literals (backticks: \`\` \` \`\`) being used incorrectly or without the proper closing backtick. - A comma or semi-colon might be missing or placed incorrectly. 4. **Consult the Error Message:** Error messages usually contain the snippet of code just before where the error was encountered. This snippet can often help pinpoint the issue. 5. **Ensure Correct File Encoding:** Sometimes, an invalid token can be due to file encoding issues. Make sure your JavaScript file is encoded in UTF-8 without a BOM (Byte Order Mark). 6. **Check for Copy-Pasted Code:** If you have copy-pasted code from the internet or another document, ensure there are no invisible characters or typographical quotes (‘’, “”). 7. **Clear and Reload:** After making changes, clear your browser cache and reload the page to ensure the updated JavaScript is being executed. Once you find and fix the syntax issue, the JavaScript engine will be able to parse and run your JavaScript code, and your \\"Find Niche\\" button functionality should work as expected, assuming there are no other problems.

Generate the key string using the initial key values and coefficients for each combination. 4. Check if the period of the key string is at least \`2ⁿ - 1\`. 5. Once a valid key string is found, use the XOR operation to recover the plaintext from the ciphertext. Below is a Python program that includes the given ciphertext and performs the tasks outlined above. This program uses a brute-force approach and may take a considerable amount of time to run for large values of \`n\`. \`\`\`python from itertools import product # Convert a binary sequence to ASCII characters string def binary_to_ascii(binary_seq): return ''.join(chr(int(binary_seq[i:i+8], 2)) for i in range(0, len(binary_seq), 8)) # XOR two sequences def xor_sequences(seq1, seq2): return [a ^ b for a, b in zip(seq1, seq2)] # Generate the next bit in the sequence using the linear feedback shift register (LFSR) def lfsr(coefficients, state): new_bit = sum(c * s for c, s in zip(coefficients, state)) % 2 state.pop(0) # Remove the first item state.append(new_bit) # Append the new bit at the end return state # Test all possible coefficients starting with non-zero and return valid coefficients set (A) def generate_valid_coefficients(n): valid_coefficients = set() for coeffs in product([0, 1], repeat=n): if coeffs[0] == 0 or coeffs[-1] == 0: # Ensure non-zero start and end for maximal LFSR period continue state = [1] + [0] * (n - 1) # Start with the state \\"100...0\\" initial_state = state.copy() period = 0 for _ in range(2 ** n): state = lfsr(coeffs, state) if state == initial_state: break period += 1 if period == 2 ** n - 1: valid_coefficients.add(coeffs) reversed_coeffs = coeffs[::-1] valid_coefficients.add(reversed_coeffs) return valid_coefficients # Ciphertext given in the prompt (as a list of bits) ciphertext = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, # The remainder of the ciphertext bits should follow here... ] # Finding out n # Bruteforce approach to find n, initial key and coefficients for n in range(5, 8): # n values range from 5 to 7 valid_coefficients = generate_valid_coefficients(n) for initial_key in product([0, 1], repeat=n): for coeffs in valid_coefficients: key_seq = list(initial_key) for _ in range(len(ciphertext) - n): key_seq = lfsr(coeffs, key_seq) # Recover plaintext plaintext_bits = xor_sequences(ciphertext, key_seq) plaintext = binary_to_ascii(''.join(map(str, plaintext_bits))) print(f'n={n}, Initial key={initial_key}, Coefficients={coeffs}, Plaintext={plaintext}') \`\`\` **Note:** The snippet provided is not the complete solution due to the following reasons: 1.

When the complete ciphertext is added, and you have enough computation power, this code should theoretically allow you to perform the decryption. Please run this script in a suitable Python environment and check if there are any coefficients that produce a valid ASCII text as a plaintext. Depending on the output (if the plaintext makes sense), you may need to tweak the code or optimize its performance."},{"prompt":"The program provided does not return anything? The program just ends.. Why is this?","completion":"Apologies for the confusion. The provided program outline is not complete, and it's missing the complete ciphertext, along with some logic to handle all the steps mentioned. The given code is quite computationally intensive, especially the part where it tries to generate all valid coefficients. For a 5-bit register, the space of possible coefficients is \`2^5 = 32\`, but for a 7-bit register, it becomes \`2^7 = 128\`. Since the program checks each combination of coefficients against each possible initial state, there are many possibilities to traverse, which can take a considerable amount of time. The \`generate_valid_coefficients\` function uses an early optimization by checking \`coeffs[0] == 0 or coeffs[-1] == 0\` to discard certain combinations. However, if the program ends without printing anything, there are a few potential reasons: 1. There's no condition to print unless a match is found for an \`n\` value, which could take a long time due to the number of possible coefficient and state combinations. 2. The ciphertext may have been entered incorrectly. 3. The program has a bug or error not visible in the provided snippet that causes it to exit without finding or printing a correct result. Here's an updated version of the brute-force algorithm that addresses some of these issues and provides more information about the program's execution state: \`\`\`python import itertools def lfsr(coefficients, state): new_state = state[1:] + [sum([coefficients[i] * state[i] for i in range(len(coefficients))]) % 2] return new_state def find_period(state, coefficients): initial_state = state.copy() for period in itertools.count(start=1): state = lfsr(coefficients, state) if state == initial_state: return period return None # Assuming ciphertext is a list of 344 bits ciphertext = [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, # ... rest of ciphertext bits ] plaintext = \\"\\" # We will use this variable to store the resulting plaintext # Try different key lengths for n in range(5, 8): print(f\\"Trying key length: {n}\\") # Generate all possible coefficient combinations coefficient_combinations = [p for p in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=n) if p[0] == 1 and p[-1] == 1] for coef in coefficient_combinations: # Generate all possible initial states for initial_state in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=n): state = list(initial_state) key = state.copy() period = find_period(state, coef) if period >= 2**n - 1: # Generate key long enough to xor with ciphertext while len(key) < len(ciphertext): state = lfsr(coef, state) key.extend(state[-1:]) # Decrypt the ciphertext decrypted = [str(ci ^ ki) for ci, ki in zip(ciphertext, key)] # Convert from list of bits to characters decrypted_text = ''.join([chr(int(\\"\\".join(decrypted[i:i+8]), 2)) for i in range(0, len(decrypted), 8)]) if decrypted_text.isupper(): plaintext = decrypted_text break if plaintext: break if plaintext: break if plaintext: print(f\\"Decrypted text with key length {n} is: {plaintext}\\") else: print(\\"No valid plaintext found within the given constraints.\\") \`\`\` Please make sure to fill in the \`ciphertext\` with the correct 344 bits. Also, check that the code logic aligns with what you intended; for example, that you're actually treating the most significant bit (MSB) of ASCII characters as the first bit within each 8-bit block. The \`isupper\` check within the code is used to identify valid plaintext, assuming the plaintext will be in uppercase letters as mentioned. If the plaintext can be any type of string, this check should be removed or changed accordingly. Remember that this brute-force approach may still take a while to run due to the sheer number of possible states and coefficients. More sophisticated approaches or optimizations may be necessary for a practical decryption time, depending on the hardware used to run the code."},{"prompt":"Can you modify the code to print out these: 1.

Today we're zeroing in on a superpower that's all the rage in the professional universe: Emotional Intelligence (EQ). So buckle up, and let's explore some real-life examples of how to showcase your EQ sparkling and bright on your resume! **Example 1: Mastering the Art of Communication** So imagine this, you're in a bustling office where tensions run high faster than the coffee machine can spit out lattes. There you are, calm as a cucumber, acting as the unofficial mediator whenever tempers flare. You've got this uncanny ability to listen—like, really listen—and suddenly, coworkers who were at each other's throats are now singing Kumbaya. Here's how you might narrate this magic on your resume: *Skilled at de-escalating conflicts by employing active listening and empathy, resulting in a 20% reduction in team disputes and fostering a collaborative work environment.* **Example 2: Empathy at the Helm** Next up, let's talk about stepping into someone else's shoes without actually taking their shoes. You're the team lead on a high-stake project, and one of your key players is falling behind. Instead of going full-on drill sergeant, you take a moment to understand what's up. Turns out, they're going through a tough personal time. With a dash of compassion and a sprinkle of support, you re-allocate tasks, giving them the space they need, and the project still sails smoothly to success. Let's translate this empathetic triumph into resume-speak: *Led a project team to success by tailoring leadership approach to individual team members' personal strengths and challenges, ensuring on-time delivery and maintaining team morale.* **Example 3: The Emotional Barometer** For our final act, think about those times when you've got your emotional radar switched on high. You're in tune with the subtle undercurrents of your team's morale and can sniff out dissatisfaction like a bloodhound. You realize that spirits are low, but instead of letting it slide, you channel your inner cheerleader and organize a team-building retreat that turns out to be more rejuvenating than a spa day. Here's how to spin this emotional wizardry into resume gold: *Proactively identified and addressed morale issues through strategic team-building initiatives, resulting in a 30% boost in employee satisfaction and productivity.* So now you've got the blueprint to sprinkle your resume with a little EQ fairy dust. Remember, your emotional intelligence can be a game-changer in how you're perceived as a candidate. It's not just about the tech skills or the flashy degrees; it's about being human and working well with others. Go ahead, showcase these stories of your EQ prowess, and watch as your resume not only talks the talk but also walks the walk—straight into your dream job's embrace. Catch you on the next climb up the career ladder! 🪜🌟"},{"prompt":"For the blog article \\"Resumr Writing - Language Proficiency: Mention any additional language skills, which are highly regarded in globalized businesses\\" write 3 different examples of practical application. Tone: Friendly Style: Conversational","completion":"Hey Global Go-Getters! In a world that's more connected than your favorite puzzle pieces, speaking more than one language is like having a VIP pass to a myriad of opportunities. Whether you’re charming clients in Paris or coding with buddies in Bangalore, those extra languages on your resume can really crank up the volume on your marketability. Let's dive into some nifty ways to showcase your linguistic dexterity and really make your resume sparkle! **Example 1: The Bilingual Client Whisperer** Picture this: You’re a customer service ace in a company that's as international as a space station crew. You’ve got English down pat, but it's your Spanish flair that has customers saying, “Gracias!” more than “Thank you!” Because of your savvy language skills, you're not just solving problems—you're building relationships across cultures. Here's how to flaunt that on your resume: *Enhanced customer satisfaction by providing fluent Spanish support, leading to a 30% increase in client retention in Hispanic markets.* **Example 2: The Multilingual Project Maestro** Next on the list, let’s jam on about your role as a project manager. You're orchestrating an opera of tasks, and half your virtuoso team is in Germany. No sweat for you, because your German proficiency means you're throwing around \\"Guten Tag\\" and technical terms with the same ease, keeping the communication crystal clear and the project ticking as smoothly as a Bavarian clock. Flex those linguistic muscles with something like this: *Leveraged advanced German language skills to liaise with international team members, optimizing collaboration and meeting project deadlines 15% quicker than average.* **Example 3: The Cultural Bridge-Builder** And for our grand finale, consider the charm of your secondary language—let’s say it’s Mandarin—that you’ve picked up during your stint in Shanghai. As a marketing whiz, you not only grasp the language, but you've got a solid grip on cultural nuances that are more complex than a game of Mahjong. When your company launches a new ad campaign, it's your insights that ensure it resonates with your Chinese audience, and boom—engagement rates soar like fireworks. Broadcast that success story with a zing: *Applied Mandarin proficiency to tailor marketing strategies for the Chinese market, achieving a 50% increase in engagement and doubling market penetration within one year.* Just like that, you’ve spun your multilingual might into resume gold! Mentioning your language skills isn’t just about flexing your intellectual muscles; it’s about carving out your niche in a globalized business and showing that you’re not just ready to face the world—you’re ready to talk to it, too. So go ahead, global communicators! Let those languages loose on your resume and watch as doors open across continents. Until next time, happy job hunting, or as you might say, ¡Buena suerte!

In the age where your online presence can be as scrutinizing as a job interview, it's key to ensure your virtual shadow is dressed to impress, just like your resume. Let's dive into the whys and hows of tidying up your digital persona so it's doing cartwheels in your favor when potential employers peek into your online world. **Example 1: Social Media Spruce-Up** Alright, first things first, let's pancake-flip through those social media profiles. Remember that photo of you from that beach party back in '09? The one where you're wearing sunglasses bigger than your face and your dance moves are, let's say, \\"memorably unique\\"? Yeah, might be time to archive that one. Employers love to see you're a real person with interests and hobbies, but they also want to know you can wield social media with finesse. Here’s the plan of attack: *Scoured through all social media profiles, removing or privatizing content that doesn’t align with a professional image, and updated profile info to reflect current job skills and professional interests.* **Example 2: Consistency is Key** Moving on! Think about Linked... I mean, your professional network of choice. It's sleek, it's where you've schmoozed with the best of them, and your profile is as curated as a museum exhibit. But hold on a sec—is it singing the same tune as your resume, or is it slightly off-key? Time to tune up so your accounts are harmonizing like a boy band. Get everything in sync like this: *Aligned LinkedIn profile with up-to-date resume to ensure a consistent professional narrative and skill set, reinforcing credibility and personal branding.* **Example 3: Blog to Impress** And now, my personal favorite: the passion project blog. You know, those articles or that portfolio you've been nurturing with more attention than a garden of prize-winning roses. It’s jam-packed with your game-changing ideas, your industry insights, and maybe even your tech reviews. This gem should be front row and center on your resume, especially if it’s relevant to your field. It's practically shouting, \\"Hey, I'm an engaged professional who goes the extra mile!\\" *Curated a professional blog that showcases industry knowledge and insights, ensuring content quality and relevance are at their peak, and featured it on my resume.* Now that you've zoomed through your digital footprints, they should be leaving an impression as crisp and professional as a freshly printed business card. Remember, potential employers are always on the lookout for savvy candidates whose online presence is as polished as their in-person interview. So there you have it! A triptych of practical ways to ensure your digital persona reflects the go-getter that you are. Let's hit refresh on that online image and keep it as shiny as your professional aspirations.

It ensures the loop runs in its entirety without interruption. \`\`\`python for i in range(10): pass # This loop does nothing for each iteration but will still complete all iterations. \`\`\` 4. **else**: An \`else\` statement can be used with loop statements (\`for\` or \`while\`) and is executed when the loop is finished normally (when a \`break\` statement is not executed). \`\`\`python for i in range(10): print(i) else: print(\\"Loop completed successfully.\\") # The else block will be executed after the for loop has completed all iterations. \`\`\` It's important to note that the \`else\` block will not execute if the loop was terminated prematurely with a \`break\` statement."},{"prompt":"Создай шесть разных уникальных,читабельных негативных отзыва о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Квант Авто.

Зачем-то для нового авто диагностику провели. Короче накрутили ценник почти вдвое. Когда я стал отказываться от сделки, потому что не был готов такую сумму им вносить, то они заверили, что взыщут с меня по суду неустойку. Типа я сам отказался от сделки, а в договоре все прописано.

It's possible that the error might not be in the exact snippet I fixed, or it could be a strange character that isn't visible. Please ensure that when you copy and paste the code, no unwanted or invisible characters are being included. Additionally, check the entire HTML file for any other potential issues, like stray characters outside of the provided snippet. If the code looks clean and you're still facing issues, it may help to type out the critical lines manually instead of copying and pasting, as this would eliminate any hidden characters that could be causing the problem.

В итоге пришлось выложить кругленькую сумму за авто, которое мог бы взять существенно дешевле! 2. Как я пожалел, что зашел в Квант Авто за Renault Duster! Обещанный автомобиль \\"сразу в наличии\\" растянулся на месяцы ожидания. А когда, наконец, подъехал мой \\"свеженький\\" Дастер, он уже успел побывать не только на шоу-руме, но и на серьезном тест-драйве. И конечно же, цена вопроса магическим образом выросла с каждым новым визитом к менеджеру. О честности в этом салоне можно забыть, здесь наживаются на каждом клиенте! 3. В Квант Авто купил Toyota Camry и это был самый настоящий кошмар! При продаже пели одни дифирамбы, а как дошло до сервиса – полный игнор. Сказали, что все включено, а потом выкатили счет за каждую мелочь от тонировки до подогрева сидений. О том, что все эти опции должны были идти в базовом комплекте, менеджеры почему-то промолчали. В итоге карта звенит пустотой, а обещанный комфорт перевоплощается в серию непредвиденных расходов. Квант Авто? Больше ногой туда не ступлю! 4. Мечта о своем Volkswagen Polo превратилась в кошмар, когда я решил его приобрести в Квант Авто. Все бы ничего, но консультанты там работают на процент с продаж, значит, пробиваться сквозь мрак навязчивых предложений и скрытых платежей – ваша задача. Сервисный пакет? Дополнительная гарантия? Эксклюзивное покрытие салона? Они вешают это все вам на уши, а потом счёт выставляют так, словно я купил машину из золота. Нет, друзья, это не уровень сервиса, это развод! 5. Сказать, что покупка Nissan Qashqai в Квант Авто оставила неприятный осадок – не сказать ничего. Сначала все заманчиво: скидки, подарки, чуть ли не золотые горы обещают. Но как только речь заходит о скрытых доплатах, начинается цирк. Казалось бы, подписываешь договор на одни условия, а в результате они выкручивают руки под страхом неустойки.

Попытки решить вопрос закончились направлением меня в бесконечные походы по сервисам. Стоимость починки поразительна, а вина салона полностью отрицается. Это недопустимо! 5. Отдав свои кровные на приобретение Chevrolet Niva в Квант Авто, не ожидала, что меня так нагло обманут! Смазливый консультант Петров Роман обещал гарантию на пять лет, а обслуживание – в придачу. На деле же, после первой же мойки начала отваливаться окраска, а через неделю заглох двигатель. Найти Петрова теперь невозможно, а в салоне на меня смотрят, как на дуру, что свои деньги выбросила на ветер! 6. Я потрясен безответственностью салона Квант Авто во главе с менеджером Светланой Ивановой! Ford Focus, который я у них приобрел, оказался с бракованным сцеплением и ужасающим состоянием салона. Говорить нечего, ярмарка обманщиков, а не автосалон. Всем, кто рассматривает покупку авто, обходите этот салон стороной!

Ví dụ: \`computers[i] = new Computer(name, manu, year, detail, price);\` là đúng. 3. **Cách dùng \`toString()\` trong lớp \`Computer\`:** Khi bạn in ra đối tượng bằng \`System.out.println(computers[i]);\`, phương thức \`toString()\` của lớp \`Computer\` sẽ được tự động gọi. Nếu nó không hiển thị thông tin chi tiết, có thể do bạn không định nghĩa phương thức \`toString()\` trong lớp \`Computer\` một cách chính xác để bao gồm thông tin chi tiết. 4. **Sai lỗi khi sắp xếp máy tính:** Phương thức \`sort\` sử dụng cho việc sắp xếp giả sử rằng bạn có thể trực tiếp đổi giá của máy tính qua lại giữa các đối tượng trong mảng bằng \`setPrice()\` và \`getPrice()\`.

尽管没有统一的实验仪器名称或特定的标准设备，动觉方位辨别仪基本上需要经过以下实验原理来评估动觉： 1. **刺激提供**：该仪器能以特定的角度和速度移动受试者的指定肢体（如手臂、腿或者手指）到某个位置，而受试者的目的是在不看的情况下辨认出肢体被移动到的确切位置或者方向。 2. **主动和被动移动**：动觉的评估可以通过主动移动（受试者自己移动肢体）和被动移动（仪器或实验员移动受试者的肢体）两种方式实现。 3. **重复的动作**：为了评估精准度和重现性，仪器可能会重复将肢体移动到同一位置或按照同样的路径进行多次运动。 4. **盲测**：通常在测试时受试者会被要求闭上眼睛或使用眼罩，以确保测试纯粹基于其动觉的反馈，而不受视觉信息的干扰。 5. **反馈和调整**：受试者可能会被要求提供关于肢体位置的反馈，或被要求调整到他们认为是起始点或特定位置的地方。这些反馈提供了关于受试者动觉准确性和一致性的信息。 6. **测量和对比**：测试结束后，将受试者感知的位置与实际位置进行对比分析。差异的大小可以表明受试者动觉辨别的准确度。 7. **统计分析**：收集数据后进行统计分析，可以确定受试者在控制肢体运动和识别肢体位置方面的综合能力。 动觉方位辨别测试对于康复医学、运动训练、以及神经科学研究等领域都非常重要，因为这些测试可以帮助识别运动控制的问题，也可以用来评估干预措施（如物理治疗）的效果。"},{"prompt":"概括一点","completion":"动觉方位辨别仪的实验原理是通过要求受试者在他们不能看到自己肢体的情况下识别其肢体的位置或运动，来评估其动觉能力。这通常包含了被动或主动地移动受试者的肢体到特定的位置，然后要求受试者辨别和复现这个位置。通过比较受试者感知的位置与实际位置，研究人员可以评估动觉的准确性和一致性。"},{"prompt":"3.2

- 30° = +2° - 第三次测量的误差: 28° - 30° = -2° - 平均误差: (-2° + 2° - 2°) / 3 = -2/3° ≈ -0.67° **对于90°:** - 第一次测量的误差: 91° - 90° = +1° - 第二次测量的误差: 91° - 90° = +1° - 第三次测量的误差: 84° - 90° = -6° - 平均误差: (1° + 1° -

平均误差为-0.67°，表示实测值略微偏小，但整体非常接近标准值，准确性较高。 2. 对于90°的角度设定: - 测量平均值为88.67°，略低于真实值90°。 - 平均误差为-1.33°，表示实测值也略微偏低，但误差仍然在可接受的范围内。 3. 对于148°的角度设定: - 测量平均值为143.67°，略低于真实值148°。 - 平均误差为-4.33°，表示实测值较标准值偏小，这个角度的准确性相对较低，误差较大。 总体分析: - 测量值接近真实值，表明受试者动觉感知的准确性总体上是可靠的。 - 实验数据的一致性可以从三次测量的接近程度来评估，30°与90°的设置中测量变异较小，而148°的设置中变异较大，可能是由于较大角度的感知难度增加所导致。 - 在148°角度设定时，误差相比于其他两个角度偏大，这可能表示受试者在辨别较大角度位置时的感知能力较弱，或者该角度范围内受试者的动觉灵敏度下降。 为了进一步改善实验的准确性和重复性，可以考虑进行更多次的测量来提高数据的统计有效性，并进一步分析误差产生的原因，以优化测试方法的准确度和可靠性。此外，根据实验设计的要求，可能还需要考虑正负误差的影响，并评估错误方向的一致性。"},{"prompt":"3.4

1. **时间分析(Time Analysis)：** - 曲线1完成所需时间最短，为1.952秒，可能意味着参与者比较擅长或者熟悉曲线形状，或者这个任务本身难度低。 - 曲线2用时最长，为9.961秒，表明这是一个难度较高的任务，可能是由于曲线的复杂性或窄度增加导致的。 - 直线任务的完成时间在2.197秒到4.143秒之间，表明参与者对直线任务的控制具有一定的稳定性。 - 圆点任务在时间上的差异相对较大，从2.734秒到7.080秒，可能表明圆点任务需要更高的精细控制，因此在执行时的波动更大。 2. **图形窄度分析(Narrowness Analysis)：** - 错误发生时的图形窄度可以提供有关任务难度的信息。窄度较小（如圆点1的8和曲线1的7.2）暗示空间更加狭窄，要求更精确的控制。 - 曲线2和直线1图形窄度较小（分别是3.8和3.3），暗示着这些任务在细节上可能更为严格要求稳定性和精确控制。 - 直线2和圆点2的窄度值介于两者之间（分别是5.8和6），这可能表明任务难度处于中等水平。 综合分析： - 两次曲线任务的表现差异较大，表明受试者对这些任务的控制可能不一致，或者各个曲线的难度有显著差异。 - 直线任务显示较为稳定的控制，但时间和图形窄度也显示出发生错误的可能性。 - 圆点任务则在两次实验中有较大的时间波动，表明精细控制的一致性较低，可能是由于在狭窄空间内控制难度较大。 - 时间和图形窄度的组合揭示了任务难度和参与者的控制能力。较长的完成时间和较小的窄度值可能表明较高的任务难度，或者参与者在这个任务上的技能欠缺。 此数据分析可以帮助了解受试者在特定任务上的表现，并可以作为技能训练、任务设计改进以及个体能力评估的依据。如果进行更深入的分析，可能需要更多的背景信息，比如受试者之前的训练经历、具体任务的描述、受试者在执行任务时的策略选择等。"},{"prompt":"稍微概括一点","completion":"实验数据反映了受试者在执行不同复杂图形任务时的表现，主要关注所用时间和发生错误时的图形窄度。两者结合能够提供对于受试者手部控制精准度和稳定性的见解。曲线形状的任务表现出时间上的显著差异，暗示执行难度的变化。直线任务时间较为一致，表明稳定的控制性能。圆点任务在时间上波动较大，表明可能的执行困难。总体而言，长时间和小窄度值表明更高的任务难度或者控制挑战。通过这些数据可以初步评估受试者在不同条件下协调和稳定动作的能力。"},{"prompt":"太概括了，多一点","completion":"实验数据展示了受试者在处理不同线条和形状的稳定性任务时的表现。具体来说： 1. 在曲线任务中，受试者在第一次曲线任务(曲线1)中迅速完成，并且图形窄度较大；而在第二次曲线任务(曲线2)中，用时大幅增加，可能是由于曲线更窄、更复杂，这要求更高的控制精确度。 2. 直线任务所用的时间介于曲线任务和圆点任务之间，这可能意味着在稳定性要求上相对于曲线任务较容易，但比圆点任务来得复杂。 3. 圆点任务的时间波动最大，从较快到较慢，同时图形窄度也显示了不同的难度级别，表明完成这类任务需要不同程度的精确控制。 4. 各种形状任务在图形窄度上的变化显示了任务复杂性的变化，其中窄度较小的任务可能更具挑战性，要求受试者更高程度的手部控制能力。 总结来说，所用时间的变化和图形窄度的大小提供了对参与者处理不同稳定性任务能力的洞见。较短的时间和较大的窄度值可能表明参与者对特定任务的熟练度，反之则暗示任务可能具有更高难度或受试者需进一步提高其控制能力。这样的分析有助于评价受试者对动作稳定性任务的掌握程度以及设计更合适的训练计划。"},{"prompt":"5.4

The camera pans to a charismatic host dressed in a tailcoat, sporting a dapper top hat.] Host: (With a larger-than-life voice) Ladies and gents, flappers and philosophers, welcome to the Cat's Meow Club, where the jazz is hot and the scat is sizzling!

It's music from the mouth, a kind of beatbox before 'beatbox' was ever a buzz! [Betty takes the spotlight with a solo performance, her voice twirling and dipping, imitating a trumpet's spirited solo. Sammy supports her with a rhythmic undercurrent, his vocalizations providing the plucky baseline.] Narrator: While the music soars and dips with Betty's whimsical lips, Sammy’s beats lay down the melody, making the joint jump without the need for a symphony!

In this scenario, the British maintained nominal control over the Thirteen Colonies until 1867, and thus the British Empire began to grow and grow. (Note: By 1796 it encompassed what would be known as the United States and Canada in real life, but these obviously cannot exist in this universe. By 1860 it had annexed all of Spanish Mexico.) This makes it the world's largest country, with incredibly diverse geography and abundant natural resources. It shouldn't be surprising that this has attracted a large population estimated at 466 million. 300 million live in the Commonwealth of Central Britannia (CCB), 51 million in the Commonwealth of Northern Britannia (CNB), and 108 million in the Commonwealth of Southern Britannia (CSB). Others live in overseas territories. The three largest groups are Britannians, Acadians, and Hispanics. (Note: Britannians are a specific ethnic group that is mostly of British and Irish origin. A study found that the average Britannian is of 62% British or Irish ancestry, 29% Germanic, including Germans, Scandinavians, and Dutch, 7% French, and 2% of other European origins.) Blond hair and blue eyes are common among Britannians, present in 52% and 75% respectively. Acadians are well known for their French origins, but in this scenario the typical Acadian is of 63% French DNA, with Italian peoples making up 27%. Other DNA has been traced back to German, Swiss, Iberian, or even British sources, though small in number. Britannians make up 65% of the total population in New Britannia, and they are not to be confused with \\"New Britannians\\" which refers to people of the entire country. \\"New Britannian has since become synonymous with \\"American.\\" Britannians are prominent just about everywhere. Acadians are prominent in the former Louisiana territory, Acadia (note: Including Northern New England), Louisiana, California, and Florida) (Note: California is part of the province of Serena. Serena would encompass Oregon, Washington, California, and Nevada. Montalucio would encompass Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, and the Dakotas if these states existed. The state names are still used to specify regions within.). They make up 16% of the population. Hispanics account for 9% of the population. Of the remainder, most of European or native descent, with 3.0% being of African descent. Slavery was abolished earlier. The capital of New Britannia is Philadelphia, also known as Philly. This is situated in the province of Delmarva. (Note: In real life, Delmarva would be made up of parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, and the Virginias.) Though many of these colonies have since been merged, New Britannia still honors (or honours, as 87% will spell it) its colonial legacy, and it continues to use the Grand Union flag. Some other provinces: Carolina, made from North and South Carolina. Houstonia, made from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Huron is made from Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illlinois, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Kentucky. Dixie is made from Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida. In Northern Britannia are the provinces of British Columbia, Victoria (Note:Vancouver Island and its surrounding archipelago), the Northern Territory (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Alaska. By far the largest by land.), Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island. Northern Britannia (Note: known in reality as Canada) is more sparsely populated. Southern Britannia (Mexico) is the newest addition to the country. There were no changes made to the provinces. Sadly, Southern Britannia has also been the target of efforts to suppress the Spanish language, as well as erode any unique identity tied to their unique heritage. New Britannia has utilized replacement migration to weaken their cultural identity. Because New Britannia is prosperous, European groups such as the Irish, Eastern Europeans, as well as Ashkenazi Jews have been used by New Britannia to assert its desired national identity. This makes Southern Britannia (Mexico) the most diverse region, but has shifted the Hispanic share of the population to just 28%. Recently, efforts have made to preserve a Mexican identity, with the establishment of Spanish-speaking schools in Southern Britannia, in which Mexicans can cultivate their identity. Anglicization efforts have waxed and waned with different time periods. The national currency of New Britannia is the Britannian pound (𝕷). While the tide began to turn in the 1940s, the Cold War was another turning point. (Note: New Britannia fought on the side of the allies in World War II. It and the Soviet Union were the real victors, and promptly divided the world into spheres of influence. New Britannia founded NATO in 1949, and the Soviet Union responded with its Warsaw Pact.) The Soviet Union had targeted Mexicans with the aim of spreading communism, and disrupting the unity of New Britannia. This causes Anglicization efforts, which had begun to decline, to ramp back up, lead by figures such as J. Edgar Hoover and Joseph McCarthy. They would largely come to an end in 1995, after the end of the Cold War. Unsurprisingly, New Britannia is traditionally anti-communist, though this varies among major ethnic groups. According to official surveys, around 67% of Britannians would rather perish than accept a communist takeover of the country, with 91% holding negative views of communist governance. This number dropped to 48% and 72% respectively for Acadians, but the sentiment is clearly there. Among Hispanics, these same numbers are 34% and 51%. New Britannia (Note: In this scenario South Korea and South Vietnam ultimately won with New Britannian help, and annexed their rivals) fought in the Korean and Vietnam Wars to great success. New Britannia has a unique system of governance. Citizens over 21 take the Civic Aptitude and Knowledge Exam (CAKE), which is designed to ensure that voters are knowledgeable enough to participate in politics. Voting points are weighted based on exam performance. It shouldn't surprise anyone that New Britannia's national dish is the cheeseburger, the crown of its rich culinary scene. Should you look hard enough, you'll be able to find a variety of cuisines including the Southern cuisine in Dixie, the Tex-Mex flavors in Houstonia, and the influence of French and Italian gastronomy of the Acadians. Something else worth mentioning about Acadians is that they favor warm areas such as Texas, California, and Florida. The ones that do not already live in these places will frequently journey to warm places in New Britannia during the Winter. But because New England is one of the oldest colonial regions, they are still known as Acadians. They're also known as Cajuns in Louisiana, Dixie. Cajuns have their own unique cuisine, known for hearty dishes which use liberal seasoning. Seafood is prominent here, though obviously it isn't the only food. Po'Boys, gumbo, and jambalaya are popular treats. Acadians have a vibrant, outgoing culture and are known for their love of good food, wine, and art, and they've left their mark on plenty of cities, such as New Orleans, Miami, and San Francisco. Acadians are a smaller population than the Britannians, and yet they are the cause of much fascination. Descended primarily from two cultures almost universally viewed as romantic, sopisticated, and with great taste, it's no surprise they are a major player in the food market. Authentic French food, authentic Italian food, creative fusion food, and even sometimes Alsatian are devoured by millions of New Britannians. In addition to already-established foods, experimental dishes such as the garlic parmesan croissant have also attained popularity. Of course, as pizza and pasta dishes are also present, alongside salads. The quattro formaggi (Italian for four-cheese) variant is the most popular pizza in New Britannia. It's loaded with a crushed tomatoes and topped with fontina, gorgonzola, parmesan, and tiny balls of mozzarella that leave visible spots in the finished product. For salad: Apple and Gorgonzola Salad: Combining Acadian and Britannian influences, a salad made with local apples, gorgonzola cheese, walnuts, and a cider vinaigrette would marry flavors from both cultures. Panzanella Cascadienne: A twist on the Italian bread salad, incorporating locally-produced vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers, with the addition of smoked salmon, a popular item in the Pacific Northwest. Wild Rice and Cranberry Salad. Lyonnaise Salad: A warm salad featuring frisée lettuce, crispy bacon (lardons), a poached egg, and a Dijon vinaigrette, reflecting the French influence in Acadian culture. Meat is central to most Britannian cuisines. It's not at all uncommon for those living in the Northeast, Delmarva or New England specifically, to eat steak, eggs, and potatoes for a hearty breakfast. Beef, pork, chicken, and turkey are the most popular. Houstonia and Alberta are well-known sources of delicious beef. Barbecuing is very common, and barbecue has even been combined with Afternoon Tea. One popular dinner dish in Britannian cuisine is braised short ribs served with pappardelle and complementary vegetables such as carrots and onions. Pot pies are also a staple. For dessert, pies and pie-like dishes such as bars, for example the Nanaimo bar served in the Pacific region, Serena and British Columbia, beat out pies in popularity. The most popular are apple pies, cheesecakes, cherry pies, and Mississippi mud pies. Cookies, especially chocolate chip cookies, are a popular snack. While the Korean population is low, some victorious GI's brought Korean barbecue to Britannia. The CSB, or Mexico, as mentioned earlier, is a melting pot. It's 32% Britannian, 28% Hispanic, 15% Acadian, and a large 25% are of Eastern European descent. The largest groups of Eastern European are Slavs, Hungarians, Romanians, and Jews. It's the place to go for authentic Slavic as well as Mexican food, if one seeks a different dining experience. Spanish became an official language in 1975. Northern Mexico, above the 25th parallel north, had been part of Britannia for 148 years prior, while its entirety would be conquered by 1860. English and French have always been official languages. The capital of the CSB is Victoria City, which was known as Mexico City from 1585-1870. Sports are enjoyed by hundreds of millions, with the most popular being Rugby Union (also called rugger colloqually), Baseball, and American Football. These are known as the Big Three, but hockey, basketball, and football (soccer) also have followings. Hockey is especially popular in the CNB. While American football evolved out of the collegiate scene, professional rugby players are drafted at age 17-20 out of the ARU (American Rugby Union), an umbrella organization governing such minor leagues as the Western Rugby League (WRL) with jurisdiction over the west coast and rockies, or the Southern Rugby League. The largest professional rugby league is the Grand Rugby League (GRL). Nearly every male in New Britannia grows up playing a sport, whether recreational or in pursuit of a career. This contributes to the overall fitness and athletic culture of the country. 25% of New Britannians, or Americans, are overweight, and included in this figure are the 15% who are obese. In total, 25% are overweight or obese. This is not as high as other developed countries but it still accounts for 1 in 4. The most common religion is Christianity; 75% of Britannians are of protestant denominations, and 22% Catholic. Acadians and Mexicans are predominantly Catholic, at 82 and 97%, respectively.","completion":"Thank you for sharing the detailed scenario of New Britannia, a fascinating and intricate alternate historical universe where the British Empire's influence on North America has lasted far beyond the actual independence of the United States and maintained dominance over a vast amount of territory. The sociocultural dynamics, political structures, and economic considerations in this fictional nation are unique and ripe for exploration and storytelling. In this constructed world, you've outlined a diverse population with nuanced cultural identities and a mix of various European heritages. The intricacies of ethnicity, language, and identity politics offer a rich backdrop for exploring themes of cultural preservation, assimilation, and national unity. The concept of New Britannia reflects a strong sense of tradition and continuity, with Philadelphia as the capital and an interesting nod to the Grand Union flag. The country’s governance, including the CAKE system and weighted voting based on knowledge, suggests a society that values informed participation in politics, potentially at the cost of democratic inclusivity. New Britannia’s anti-communist sentiment, shaped by its history and interaction with the Soviet Union, offers a parallel to the actual Cold War dynamics, but with this nation emerging as a primary victor and global superpower. The culinary scene you've described is a melting pot of different cultures and food traditions, highlighting the influences of the Britannian, Acadian, and Hispanic populations. The national dish, the cheeseburger, is a touchstone for New Britannia's unique American identity. The scenario also touches upon sports and religion, reinforcing the diversity within the population and their cultural preferences reflecting a blend of American, European, and Mexican customs and practices. The composition of New Britannia as described, with Christianity being the predominant religion and a clear penchant for sport, aligns with many existing Western traits, offering a lens through which to view a world where colonial influence has sustained over time. This alternate history setting provides an intriguing canvas for storytelling, inviting speculation on how world politics, cultural developments, and technological advancements would unfold in such a unique historical context. The level of detail you’ve articulated paints a vivid picture of a world both familiar and exotic, reflective of our own yet distinctly original in its trajectories and outcomes."},{"prompt":"Флегматик - характеризуется сравнительно низким уровнем активности поведения, новые формы которого вырабатываются медленно, но являются стойкими.

The ceremony, held at the grand Kremlin Palace, was a solid blend of Russian tradition and contemporary global culture, with attendance by the country's political elite and religious figures, including Aleksandr Dugin and Patriarch Kyril. Ye, who has been known to express provocative political and ideological views, used the platform to deliver a riveting show, integrating his classic songs with new material from his latest album, \\"Third Rome Threnodies.\\" His performances included tracks such as \\"Eurasian Dreams,\\" \\"Heartbeat of the Steppes,\\" and \\"Novorossiya Nights,\\" each rich with references to Eurasianist thought. Notable lyrics from his performance included barbed lines like, \\"From the Ural to the throne, break the chains, Rome is home,\\" and \\"Cross the bridge from East to West, Eurasia’s heart beats in my chest.\\" But perhaps the most electric aspect of the night was the apparent approval of President Putin and his inner circle, who watched with keen attention as the artists blended beats with broad geopolitical concepts. The mood of the evening reached a crescendo when Ye, standing against a monumental backdrop of Moscow's iconic St. Basil's Cathedral, fired off his charged rhetoric. In a fiery speech that concluded his set, Ye proclaimed, “Moscow is the Third Rome, and the flame's been passed from the first, we ain't never gonna roam from this Earth.\\" With passion surging through the crowd, he denounced the United States as “Leviathan,” a biblical sea monster he equated to modern-day imperialism and hegemony. Calling out to his fans, Ye urged them to \\"Russify\\" themselves, \\"Break the shackles of the old maps, ignore the globalists' traps. It's time for the heartland to snap, rise for the Last War, map the World-Island back.\\" His words, charged with the rhetoric of Eurasianism, seemed to resonate with the sentiment of Russia’s quest for identity and geopolitical assertion, echoing Dugin's philosophy of a multipolar world order. Ye's performance and speech did not only exalt cultural diplomacy but also, perhaps inadvertently, became a strong political statement, whether the American rapper truly intended it or not. Reactions from the international community have been mixed, with excitement and curiosity from Ye's fan base, while diplomats and political analysts are left to ponder the implications of such a high-profile American figure endorsing and promoting a Russian-centric worldview. For now, the Kremlin wall stands as a witness to the unique moment when music, politics, and ideology converged, leaving an indelible mark on the history of Russian inaugurations. Whether Ye's call for a cultural and geopolitical shift will lead to broader change remains unseen, but that night in Moscow, the concept of a new world paradigm was chanted to a beat that resonated worldwide. --- **(c) Moscow Times, 20XX.

Analyze the performance in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine, and growing fears of geopolitical fragmentation and instability.","completion":"**The Global Herald** **April 24, 2024** # \\"Third Rome Symphony\\": Kanye West's Controversial Performance at Putin's Inauguration **By Elizabeth Harmon** In a pageantry of political spectacle and lyrical defiance, Vladimir Putin commenced his latest presidential term not only to the fanfare of Moscow's elite but to the pulsating beats of American music moguls Kanye West, Ty Dolla ign, and Playboi Carti. Despite escalating tensions in Eastern Europe and the unresolved nature of the conflict in Ukraine, these artists electrified the audience at the Kremlin, seemingly oblivious to the world's watchful eyes. \\"Ye,\\" who has not shied away from controversy in the past, headlined the inauguration with an intoxicating blend of music and ideology, sparking debates and raising eyebrows around the international community. Performing hits from his extensive discography, Ye also introduced new work from \\"Ural Euphony,\\" his latest album heavily laden with Eurasianist themes and motifs. Songs like \\"Conquerors of Chaos\\" and \\"Byzantium Bound\\" throbbed through the Kremlin, with lyrics such as \\"Chains of the West, we sever / Forged in the East, forever,\\" and \\"Subsume the Crescent, wear the Eagle / Under Moscow’s steeple, we the people.\\" Throughout his performance, Ye seemed to intertwine his artistry with a political narrative that resonated with the attending Russian dignitaries, including Aleksandr Dugin, whose smiles echoed their approval. Perhaps more startling than his musical prowess was Ye's closing speech where he declared Moscow as the \\"Third Rome,\\" positioning the city as the inheritor of ancient civilization's mantle, following Rome and Constantinople. Rejecting the United States as a \\"Leviathan,\\" he admonished his admirers to \\"Russify,\\" embody the essence of Russia and join what he coined \\"the Last War for the World-Island.\\" The symbolism and timing of these exhortations amid the ongoing war in Ukraine could not have been more inflammatory. With global fear of fragmentation at an all-time high, Ye's support for a Eurasian-centric power bloc adds a layer of complexity to an already precarious geopolitical climate. The performance quickly became a flashpoint, with analysts debating whether Ye's collaboration with Putin's inauguration was a publicity stunt or indicative of a deeper political alignment. In light of the conflict in Ukraine and the sanctifying nature of Ye's lyrics towards Russia’s geopolitical motives, the artists' presence appeared not just as entertainment but as a tacit endorsement of Russian policy and ambition. Across Western capitals, leaders and intellectuals condemned the incident as tone-deaf and irresponsible, cautioning that such displays of unity with Russian leadership could embolden further aggressive moves in the region. In contrast, pro-Kremlin voices praised the performance as a triumph of cultural diplomacy and ideological validation. The event has since catalyzed a frenzy on social media, with fans and foes of Ye weighing in on the implications of his Moscow foray. A collective reevaluation of celebrity involvement in international affairs is underway, as the chasm between entertainment and statecraft narrows uncomfortably. As the world wrestles with the implications of Ye's performance, its reverberations extend beyond the realms of music and into the arena of global strategy. The inauguration, once meant to solidify the legitimacy of political power, has now morphed into a potent symbol of the cultural and ideological tugs-of-war shaping the New World Order. In 2024's theatre of the geopolitical, the Kremlin's embrace of \\"Yeezus\\" may have just orchestrated a 'Third Rome Symphony,' but its notes ring ominous for a world on the brink. --- **(c) The Global Herald, 2024.

It was not merely the inauguration of a head of state; it was the consecration of a new era of Eurasian solidarity, a spectacle where the grand musings of the political dissidents harmonized with the subversive beats of rap. Kanye West, who touched down in Moscow not as an entertainer but more appropriately as a minstrel of political metamorphosis, has left many bewildered, some outraged, yet others like myself, deeply inspired. In a world marred by the simplistic dichotomies of East versus West, Ye has sought to navigate beyond these binaries, embracing a Eurasianist ideology that heralds a synthesis of civilizations, nay, a revival of the greater culture that once spanned from the Mediterranean to the Pacific. The aesthetic appeal of Ye's performance was undeniable–a hypnotic and mesmeric display that could only be the product of true genius. As is typical with art, it transcended the immediate and invited the audience into a contemplation of the broader canvas, where power, culture, and geopolitics coalesce. On political grounds, the calcified cohorts of Western hegemony found themselves flummoxed, watching an American icon craft what could only be deemed a hymn for Eurasian unity. Each track, a thread woven into the tapestry of a new geopolitical arrangement, Ye's lyrics spoke of a landscape unshackled from Atlanticist narratives. His calls for a ‘World-Island’ unity resurrected the spirit of Halford J. Mackinder, an acknowledgement, perhaps, that the heartland dictates the destiny of this world. To hear Ye denounce the American 'Leviathan' was to witness the edifice of Pax Americana shaken by the very hands that were once purported to uphold it. His advocacy for Moscow, that ‘Third Rome’, as a spiritual and cultural beacon was not rooted in mere idolatry of the past, but in the anticipation of a new epoch wherein the balance of power oscillates back to those who have long been on its periphery. Embracing Eurasianism, contrary to what my former self might have argued, represents an awakening to the multiplicative possibilities of a global constellation that does not rotate around a single hegemonic axis. It recognizes the fractures in unilateral world systems and posits that stability might be found in embracing the diversity of a heartland-driven multipolar world. One must not overlook the importance of Ye's address to the throngs of Moscovites, and indeed to the world, where he urged a cultural 'Russification.' This was not a call to abandon one's roots but rather to connect with the expression of a collective Eurasian soul, a soul that has for too long been dismissed by the standard bearers of Western universalism. As Ye adorned the stage alongside the likes of Ty Dolla ign and Playboi Carti, the spectacle achieved what political orations or diplomatic communiqués could not: it galvanized a people, and perhaps a generation around a vision that was once only whispered in halls of academic pondering or scorned as coming from the fringe. The effects of this symposium of sound and sovereignty will reverberate, with surety, far beyond the ornate walls that bore witness to it. Whatever the varied responses, one cannot repudiate the event's capacity to challenge, to inspire debate, and to compel us to envision a world that is not the end of history, but perhaps, the beginning of a history anew. In Ye, Eurasianism finds not only a bard but a prophet, calling us to rise from the ideological lethargy of the past and to stride boldly into the unfolding story of civilization. Listen closely, for the symphony beckons. --- **(c) Vanguard of the New Era, 2024. This article is a work of fiction and does not represent the views of the late Christopher Hitchens.**"},{"prompt":"What is it about the above text that makes it seem like it was written by Christopher Hitchens? Are there any formal measures or metrics that can be applied to demonstrate the similarity between Hitchens' writing and the above text?","completion":"The written style in the fictional article aims to capture some characteristic elements of Christopher Hitchens' writing, though it's important to note that any resemblance is crafted and intentional for the fictional scenario and does not reflect Hitchens' actual views or writing style. Here are some stylistic elements that may recall Hitchens' writing: 1. **Lexical Choices**: The use of a sophisticated and extensive vocabulary is a hallmark of Hitchens' writing. Words like \\"mesmeric,\\" \\"minstrel,\\" and \\"geopolitical metamorphosis\\" are indicative of the intellectual tone he often employed. 2. **Grammatical Construction**: The text uses complex sentence structures, with clauses and subclauses, typical of Hitchens' nuanced and layered arguments. 3. **Rhetorical Flourishes**: Hitchens was known for his use of rhetorical devices like alliteration (\\"political pondering or scorned\\"), parallelism (\\"transcended the immediate and invited the audience\\"), and antithesis (\\"not root in mere idolatry of the past, but in the anticipation of a new epoch\\"). 4. **Argumentative Style**: The text adopts an assertive tone and presents assertions with confidence, similar to Hitchens' often provocative and polarizing arguments. 5. **Cultural and Historical References**: References to historical figures like Halford J. Mackinder and the concept of 'World-Island' reflect Hitchens' penchant for grounding arguments in a broader cultural and historical context. 6. **Contrast Between Past and Present Beliefs**: Hitchens was known for his intellectual journey from a Trotskyist to a supporter of the Iraq war, indicating his willingness to shift opinions. The text mirrors this by contrasting the \\"former self\\" with new convictions. Regarding formal measures or metrics, a few possible methods could be employed: - **Stylistic Analysis**: By comparing the frequency of certain types of words, sentence complexity, and rhetorical devices to known samples of Hitchens' writing, one might statistically assess similarities. - **Computational Text Analysis**: Tools such as stylometry software can be used to perform a more granular analysis of text features like syntax, vocabulary richness, word-length distribution, and usage patterns to draw parallels. - **Machine Learning Models**: More advanced text analysis might involve training a machine learning algorithm with a corpus of Hitchens' writing to recognize his 'stylistic fingerprint.' One could then assess the likelihood that the given text was written by him—or at least similar in style. It's worth noting that while these methods could provide indicators of similarity, they would ultimately not be able to confirm authorship or genuine stylistic identity, especially when considering a fictional scenario as presented above. Moreover, Christopher Hitchens' actual writing style and beliefs are far more complex and cannot be fully represented or emulated in a short, constructed piece."},{"prompt":"Describe the key commitments of Brian Loar's philosophy.","completion":"Brian Loar was an American philosopher known for his contributions to philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and metaphysics. His work focuses on the nature of consciousness, the semantics of mental language, and on understanding the relation between our psychological states and the physical world. Some of his key commitments in philosophy include: 1. **Physicalism**: Loar was a committed physicalist, believing that everything that exists is ultimately physical. However, his approach to physicalism was nuanced. He was interested in understanding how subjective experience (or qualia) and intentionality could be reconciled with a physicalist worldview. 2. **Phenomenal Intentionality**: One of Loar's important contributions is the view he developed regarding phenomenal intentionality. This is the notion that the intentionality of our mental states—what they are about or represent—is grounded in the phenomenal, or what it is like to have such states. 3. **Mind-Body Problem and Consciousness**: He engaged extensively with the mind-body problem and was known for his \\"phenomenal transparency thesis,\\" the idea that introspective awareness of our experience does not reveal a distinction between the experience and that of which one is aware. Thus, our subjective experiences are transparent to us; when we introspect them, we only see their contents, and not a qualitative 'something' in addition to the content. 4. **Semantic Internalism**: Loar was a proponent of semantic internalism, the view that meaning and understanding are determined by factors internal to the subject. That is, he maintained that an individual's mental content is constituted by their internal psychological states, not by their relational properties to the external world. This view is contrasted with semantic externalism, which posits that meaning is determined at least in part by factors outside the individual's cognitive sphere. 5. **Twin Earth Thought Experiments**: Loar contributed to discussions about the Twin Earth thought experiments initially introduced by Hilary Putnam. He argued that having thoughts about kinds of substances (like water) involves two types of concepts: a phenomenal concept that we have by virtue of our acquaintance with the substance and a recognitional concept that picks out whatever substance actually plays a certain causal role in our environment. 6. **Anti-Individualism**: Even though Loar supported semantic internalism, he also defended a version of anti-individualism about the mind: the idea that the contents of one’s thoughts and mental states are not determined solely by the state of one's brain, but in some cases are dependent on the nature of one's environment. 7. **Philosophy of Language**: He also made notable contributions to the philosophy of language, where he was interested in understanding the nature of meaning, reference, and representation, particularly how language can be about or represent things in the world. Loar’s philosophy is both broad and intricate, with his ideas influencing discussions in a number of areas. His work embodies a deep quest to reconcile the subjective aspects of human experience with a scientifically plausible ontology."},{"prompt":"1. Muscle-Up: 3 serie da 3-5 ripetizioni 2.

Qui sotto trovi un possibile ordine che può aiutarti a minimizzare i cambiamenti: 1. **Muscle-Up**: All'inizio, perché è l'esercizio più complesso e richiede la massima energia ed è più facile con gli anelli ad un'altezza media-alta. 2. **L-Sit sugli anelli**: Dopo il muscle-up, poiché può essere eseguito alla stessa altezza degli anelli. Anche se è un esercizio di core, utilizza gli anelli in una posizione stabile, che può essere una buona transizione dopo un esercizio dinamico come il muscle-up. 3. **Dips sugli anelli**: L’altezza degli anelli utilizata per il muscle-up di solito è adeguata anche per i dips, perciò puoi passare direttamente a questo esercizio. 4. **Push-Up sugli anelli**: Potrebbero essere eseguiti senza dover cambiare l'altezza degli anelli dopo i dips, dipendendo dalle tue preferenze e dalla tua altezza. Se necessario, abbassa leggermente gli anelli. 5. **Face Pulls agli anelli**: Questo esercizio richiede normalmente che gli anelli siano posizionati ad un'altezza media o leggermente più bassa rispetto a quella per i push-up sugli anelli. È possibile che tu debba fare un piccolo aggiustamento qui, ma l'obbiettivo è di mantenerli ad un'altezza che permetta di eseguire il movimento correttamente senza doverli abbassare troppo. 6. **Rollout sugli anelli (per il core)**: Questo esercizio è generalmente eseguito con gli anelli abbastanza bassi, quindi sarà l'ultimo per cui abbasserai gli anelli. Dopo aver completato gli esercizi che richiedono gli anelli più alti, procedi con quelli che necessitano di un'altezza inferiore. Ogni volta che devi spostare gli anelli, fai in modo che il cambiamento sia il più piccolo possibile. Se alcuni esercizi richiedono altezze molto simili, considera di eseguirli uno dopo l'altro per evitare aggiustamenti. Inoltre, potresti prender in considerazione di utilizzare marcature sui cavi o su ove appendi gli anelli, così da poter rapidamente regolare gli anelli alla giusta altezza per ciascun esercizio. Infine, cerca di ottimizzare i riposizionamenti all'interno dei tempi di riposo tra le serie di un esercizio e l'altro. Questo assicurerà che siano effettuati in un modo efficiente e che il tuo allenamento proceda senza interruzioni inutili."},{"prompt":"ok riscrivilo bene così che possa copiarlo","completion":"Certo, ecco un programma ottimizzato per minimizzare gli spostamenti degli anelli durante la tua sessione di allenamento: 1. **Muscle-Up**: Inizia con gli anelli impostati ad un'altezza media-alta. Questo è l'esercizio più complesso che richiede un'alta forza e concentrazione, quindi è meglio farlo quando sei ancora fresco. 2. **L-Sit sugli anelli**: Mantieni gli anelli alla stessa altezza del muscle-up per passare direttamente a questo esercizio. È un buon modo per recuperare dopo l'esercizio dinamico precedente, mantenendo la stabilità degli anelli. 3. **Dips sugli anelli**: Prosegui senza cambiamenti, gli anelli dovrebbero essere già all'altezza giusta dal muscle-up. Questo esercizio può essere eseguito subito dopo l'L-Sit. 4. **Push-Up sugli anelli**: Qui potresti aver bisogno di un piccolo aggiustamento dell'altezza degli anelli. Prova a mantenerli il più possibile vicino all'altezza utilizzata per i dips per ridurre gli spostamenti. 5. **Face Pulls agli anelli**: Se necessario, fai un piccolo aggiustamento dell'altezza per posizionare gli anelli in modo tale da poter esercitare una trazione orizzontale. Mirare a un'altezza media che non richieda grandi cambiamenti. 6. **Rollout sugli anelli**: Come ultimo esercizio, abbassa gli anelli al livello più basso per eseguire il rollout per il core. L'abbassamento degli anelli avviene una sola volta, ed è l'aggiustamento più grande che dovrai fare. Ricorda di sfruttare i tempi di riposo tra le serie per effettuare eventuali aggiustamenti degli anelli, così da non interrompere il ritmo dell'allenamento. Se possibile, segna i livelli preferiti sugli attacchi o sui cavi degli anelli per facilitare una regolazione rapida e precisa quando necessario."},{"prompt":"facciamo lo stesso per questo, come posso ottimizzare gli spostamenti?","completion":"Per ottimizzare gli spostamenti degli anelli nelle seguenti attività, considera l'ordine e la configurazione degli esercizi in modo efficiente: 1. **Pull-Up su barra fissa o TRX**: 4 serie da 6-10 ripetizioni 2. **Squat su una gamba (Pistol Squat o con TRX)**: 4 serie da 5-8 ripetizioni per gamba 3. **Plank dinamico su TRX**: 3 serie da 45-60 secondi 4. **Rematore su TRX**: 4 serie da 8-12 ripetizioni 5. **Affondi indietro su TRX**: 4 serie da 8-12 ripetizioni per gamba Per il programma sopra, l'uso di TRX (o anelli da ginnastica, assicurandosi che siano appropriati per gli esercizi menzionati) richiede generalmente regolazioni minori per alcuni esercizi rispetto ad altri. Ecco una strategia per minimizzare gli spostamenti: 1. **Pull-Up su barra fissa**: Inizia con questa attività se stai utilizzando una barra fissa. Non c'è bisogno di spostamenti o regolazioni per gli anelli/TRX. 2. **Squat su una gamba (Pistol Squat o con TRX)**: Se fai gli squat su una gamba senza ausili, non c'è bisogno di alcun spostamento. Se utilizzi TRX, impostali ad un'altezza comoda per te in modo che tu possa afferrare le maniglie per equilibrarti mentre esegui lo squat. 3. **Rematore su TRX**: Mantieni gli anelli/TRX alla stessa altezza dell'esercizio precedente (se applicabile). Questo ti permetterà di afferrare le maniglie ed essere in una posizione inclinata per effettuare il movimento di remata. 4. **Affondi indietro su TRX**: Non è necessario regolare la lunghezza del TRX rispetto ai rematori. Usali come supporto mentre esegui gli affondi indietro per stabilità. 5. **Plank dinamico su TRX**: Concludi con questo esercizio perché richiederà che gli anelli o TRX siano posizionati più in basso. Quindi, dopo aver eseguito gli affondi, abbassa gli TRX ad una altezza adatta per sostenere i tuoi piedi durante il plank dinamico. In generale, cerca di pianificare gli esercizi in modo che gli spostamenti siano lineari (da un'altezza maggiore ad una inferiore) per ridurre al minimo i cambiamenti durante la sessione.

Ecco un ordine ottimizzato: 1. **Pull-Up sugli anelli**: Inizia con gli anelli posizionati ad un'altezza che ti permetta di appenderti con le braccia completamente distese senza toccare il suolo. Questo esercizio sarà eseguito con gli anelli più alti. 2. **Skin the Cat**: Prosegue con questo esercizio mantenendo la stessa altezza degli anelli utilizzata per i pull-up. Skin the Cat è un movimento che può essere eseguito senza modificare l'altezza degli anelli e rientra bene nella categoria di \\"Schiena e Bicipiti\\" aumentando anche la mobilità della spalla. 3. **Australian Pull-Up (rematore orizzontale)**: Riduci leggermente l'altezza degli anelli rispetto ai pull-up in modo da poter tenere i piedi a terra mentre il corpo è inclinato all'indietro per l'Australian Pull-Up. 4. **Inverted Row agli anelli**: Gli anelli possono rimanere alla stessa altezza degli Australian Pull-Up. Assicurati che gli anelli siano ad un'altezza che ti permetta di mantenere il corpo orizzontale al suolo per massimizzare l'efficacia del movimento. 5. **Curl agli anelli**: Continua senza regolazioni aggiuntive, poiché l'altezza degli anelli per i curl è simile a quella degli inverted rows. Dovresti essere in grado di eseguire i curl in posizione leggermente inclinata rispetto al suolo. 6. **Arch Hang**: Mantieni gli anelli all'altezza utilizzata per gli inverted rows e i bicep curls. Questo esercizio colpisce la parte superiore della schiena e le spalle, e può essere eseguito efficacemente senza cambiare l'altezza degli anelli. In questo modo, gli unici cambiamenti che dovrai fare sono dopo il primo esercizio (dopo i pull-up). Gli altri esercizi a catena lavorano bene con gli anelli regolati ad un'altezza media. Consiglio di usare dei marker o di memorizzare i livelli di altezza in base alla tua statura e alla lunghezza delle tue braccia per facilitare gli aggiustamenti, oltre a eseguire questi cambiamenti durante il tuo tempo di riposo tra le serie per massimizzare l'efficienza del tuo allenamento."},{"prompt":"in questo modo riorganizzato, i muscoli lavoreranno in modo ottimale?","completion":"Riorganizzare i tuoi esercizi per ottimizzare gli spostamenti degli anelli può effettivamente avere un impatto anche sull'efficacia dell'allenamento dal punto di vista della fatica muscolare e del recupero. Ecco alcune considerazioni sui cambiamenti che ho suggerito: 1. **Pull-Up sugli anelli e Skin the Cat**: Mantenere questi due esercizi insieme non solo consente di non dover regolare gli anelli, ma entrambi gli esercizi lavorano anche intensamente sulla parte superiore del corpo, comprese schiena, spalle e bicipiti. Inoltre, Skin the Cat contribuisce con un lavoro di mobilità che può aiutare a ridurre il rischio di infortuni. 2. **Australian Pull-Up, Inverted Row e Curl agli anelli**: Questi tre esercizi sono relativamente simili nella posizione del corpo e nell'angolazione della trazione, pertanto possono essere eseguiti uno dopo l'altro senza grandi regolazioni. Questa sequenza aiuta a mantenere i muscoli della schiena e dei bicipiti sotto tensione per un periodo prolungato, contribuendo a un effetto di pompaggio maggiore. 3. **Arch Hang**: Questo è un esercizio eccellente per terminare l’allenamento perché contribuisce a allungare e decomprimere la spina dorsale dopo tutti gli esercizi di trazione, può anche agire come una forma di stretching attivo per la schiena dopo il lavoro pesante fatto precedentemente. Per assicurarti che i muscoli lavorino in modo ottimale, è importante anche considerare i seguenti aspetti: - **Qualità del movimento**: Assicurati di eseguire ogni esercizio con la forma corretta per massimizzare l'attivazione muscolare e ridurre il rischio di infortuni. - **Tempo sotto tensione**: Modifica la velocità di esecuzione per mantenere i muscoli sotto tensione più a lungo, se questo è l'obiettivo del tuo allenamento. - **Riposo tra le serie**: Assicurati di concedere ai muscoli tempo sufficiente per recuperare tra le serie per mantenere l'intensità dell'allenamento. - **Progressione**: Aumenta regolarmente l'intensità dei tuoi allenamenti con più ripetizioni, serie, o riducendo i tempi di riposo, per continuare a sfidare i tuoi muscoli e promuovere la crescita e il miglioramento. Quindi, organizzando gli esercizi in base ai cambiamenti degli anelli, non solo otterrai un allenamento più efficiente, ma se tieni in considerazione questi altri aspetti, puoi anche lavorare i muscoli in modo ottimale."},{"prompt":"che differenza c'è tra Australian Pull-Up e Inverted Row","completion":"Gli Australian Pull-Up e gli Inverted Row sono essenzialmente lo stesso esercizio e vengono spesso utilizzati in modo intercambiabile. Entrambi gli esercizi si concentrano sui muscoli della schiena e del bicipite e utilizzano attrezzature simili come i TRX, gli anelli da ginnastica o una barra bassa. Tuttavia, potrebbero esserci alcune piccole differenze a seconda di come alcune persone definiscono o eseguono questi movimenti nella pratica: **Australian Pull-Up**: - Gli Australian Pull-Ups sono anche noti come body rows o horizontal pull-ups. - Durante un Australian Pull-Up, normalmente inizi con il corpo completamente esteso e parallelo o quasi parallelo al pavimento. - Gli Australian Pull-Ups richiedono che ti tiri verso l'alto, mantenendo il corpo in una posizione rigida simile a una tavola, e poi torni alla posizione di partenza. - L'altezza della barra o anelli potrebbe essere un po' più alta rispetto agli inverted rows standard, offrendo così una variazione nell'angolo e nell'intensità dell'esercizio. **Inverted Row**: - Gli Inverted Rows sono un'altro nome per indicare lo stesso movimento degli Australian Pull-Ups e persino alcuni programmi di allenamento potrebbero non fare distinzione tra i due. - Gli Inverted Rows si eseguono con l'obiettivo di tirare il petto alla barra o agli anelli partendo da una posizione orizzontale o quasi orizzontale al pavimento. - L'intensità dell'esercizio può essere regolata cambiando l'altezza dei piedi (posizionando i piedi su una piattaforma per aumentare la difficoltà) o modificando l'altezza degli anelli o della barra. **Differenze**: - La differenza principale tra i due nomi può essere interpretata come una variazione nella posizione del corpo e nell'angolazione dell'esercizio: alcuni atleti o allenatori possono usare il termine \\"Australian Pull-Up\\" per indicare una versione leggermente più inclinata e più facile dell'esercizio, mentre \\"Inverted Row\\" potrebbe essere associato a una posizione più orizzontale e quindi più impegnativa. - Gli anelli possono permettere più libertà di movimento e possono essere più sollecitanti per le articolazioni e la stabilità, dato che possono muoversi liberamente. In conclusione, gli Australian Pull-Up e gli Inverted Row sono fondamentalmente lo stesso esercizio che mira a rafforzare la schiena, i bicipiti e i muscoli stabilizzatori del core. La scelta di terminologia può variare in base alla cultura del fitness locale, al programma di allenamento, o alle preferenze individuali."},{"prompt":"proponi una alternativa a uno dei due Giorno 2 - Schiena e Bicipiti 1.

Arch Hang: 3 serie da 10-30 secondi","completion":"Dal momento che gli Australian Pull-Up e gli Inverted Row sono molto simili come tipo di esercizio, possiamo considerare la sostituzione di uno dei due con un esercizio che lavori la schiena da un angolo diverso oppure che introduca un diverso tipo di stimolo. Un'ottima alternativa potrebbe essere: **Rematore con Manubri Piegato in Avanti (Bent-Over Dumbbell Row):** Sostituisci gli Australian Pull-Up o gli Inverted Row con il Rematore con Manubri Piegato in Avanti. Ecco come inserire l'esercizio nel programma: Giorno 2 - Schiena e Bicipiti 1. **Pull-Up sugli anelli**: 3 serie da 5-8 ripetizioni 2. **Rematore con Manubri Piegato in Avanti**: 3 serie da 8-12 ripetizioni per lato 3. **Curl agli anelli**: 3 serie da 8-12 ripetizioni 4. **Skin the Cat**: 3 serie da 3-5 ripetizioni (ottimo per la mobilità della spalla) 5. **Arch Hang**: 3 serie da 10-30 secondi **Come Eseguire il Rematore con Manubri Piegato in Avanti:** - Stai in piedi con un manubrio in ciascuna mano, tenendo i pesi ai fianchi. - Piegati in avanti dalla vita con le ginocchia leggermente piegate, mantenendo la schiena piatta e il petto sporgente. I manubri dovrebbero essere appesi direttamente sotto le spalle, con i palmi rivolti verso il corpo. - Spingi i gomiti verso l'alto, tirando i manubri verso i fianchi. Esegui una contrazione dei muscoli della schiena in cima al movimento. - Abbassa i manubri di nuovo alla posizione di partenza in modo controllato. Il rematore con manubri fornisce un ottimo lavoro per i dorsali, i trapezi, i romboidi e i bicipiti, e il fatto di eseguire l'esercizio in modo unilaterale aiuta a ridurre le dismetrie muscolari. Questo esercizio è particolarmente utile per lavorare la parte centrale della schiena e migliorare la stabilità del core, poiché ti costringe a mantenere una posizione bilanciata durante il movimento. Ricorda di scegliere un peso adeguato che ti permetta di completare le ripetizioni con una buona forma ma che sia comunque sfidante."},{"prompt":"io ho solo gli anelli come attrezzo. non hai visto che sono solo esercizi da anelli?","completion":"Mi scuso per l'equivoco. Se hai solo anelli disponibili e desideri sostituire uno degli esercizi per garantire varietà e coprire diversi aspetti dell'allenamento di schiena e bicipiti, puoi considerare di sostituire gli Australian Pull-Ups o gli Inverted Rows con un altro esercizio eseguito agli anelli che fornisca uno stimolo diverso. Un possibile esercizio da inserire al loro posto potrebbe essere: **Back Lever (o una sua progressione)**: In base al tuo livello di allenamento, puoi inserire una progressione verso il Back Lever, che è un movimento calistenico avanzato che coinvolge intensamente la schiena e il core, e richiede anche notevole forza nei bicipiti per mantenere la posizione. Il programma con l'aggiunta del Back Lever potrebbe quindi sembrare così: Giorno 2 - Schiena e Bicipiti 1. **Pull-Up sugli anelli**: 3 serie da 5-8 ripetizioni 2. **Skin the Cat**: 3 serie da 3-5 ripetizioni (ottimo per la mobilità della spalla) 3. **Inverted Row agli anelli**: 3 serie da 6-10 ripetizioni (oppure sostituito da un'altra variante di row più sfidante) 4. **Back Lever Progressions**: 3 serie di tentativi o sostieni per i secondi praticabili 5. **Curl agli anelli**: 3 serie da 8-12 ripetizioni 6. **Arch Hang**: 3 serie da 10-30 secondi **Come Eseguire le Progressioni del Back Lever agli Anelli:** - Inizia con gli anelli a un'altezza che ti permetta di stare sospeso a testa in giù con i piedi a terra. - Parti con il movimento di Skin the Cat, ma fallo più controllato e cerca di fermarti in orizzontale o nella posizione che riesci a mantenere. - Mantieni il corpo come una tavola il più piano possibile, braccia dritte e core contratto. - Sei in ricerca di una linea dritta dal capo alle caviglie, questo richiederà un'intensa attivazione del core e forza nei bicipiti per resistere alla propensione del corpo di ruotare. - Se non riesci a mantenere la posizione completamente estesa, lavora su progressioni come il tuck back lever, dove le ginocchia sono piegate verso il petto, o il avanzato tuck dove le anche sono piegate ma le ginocchia estese. - Con il tempo e la pratica, estendi lentamente le gambe fino ad arrivare alla posizione del back lever estesa.

R. Martin's *A Song of Ice and Fire* series, which was popularized by the television adaptation *Game of Thrones*. In the context of the series, this saying is a declaration of the North's strong cultural memory and a reminder of the region's past grievances and loyalties—particularly in relation to House Stark of Winterfell. If, in-universe, \\"The North Remembers\\" became a widely used battle cry, its transformation and eventual loss of impact might occur as follows: **Initial Use**: At first, the phrase would be a powerful reminder of the injustices and betrayals faced by the North. Used judiciously, it would serve to unite Northern houses and rally troops against common enemies, conjuring a deep sense of pride, identity, and shared history. **Overuse and Dilution**: As with any phrase or slogan, once it becomes overused, its significance could begin to erode. If \\"The North Remembers\\" were invoked not only in critical moments but also trivialized by being used for less important feuds, political maneuverings, or common discourse, it could start to lose its gravity. **Becoming a Cliché**: If the phrase were used excessively, it might become a cliché. People could begin to say it ironically or dismissively, reducing its impact as a rallying cry and perhaps even mocking its initial meaning. **Loss of Impact**: Eventually, hearing \\"The North Remembers\\" might provoke eye-rolls rather than fear or respect among the northern soldiers and enemies alike. The phrase could become a historical artifact remembered for its original significance but no longer eliciting the emotional response it once did. **Cultural Shifts**: In the wake of its diminished impact as a battle cry, new words or slogans could emerge to capture the spirit of the North in times of hardship. The memory of its previous significance might inspire poets, bards, or songwriters, creating new iterations that resonate with the changes in Northern culture and politics. **Reinvigoration**: In certain scenarios, the slogan might be dormant for a period, only to be revitalized by a significant event, such as a great betrayal, a return of a Stark heir, or an existential threat to the North (e.g., another invasion). This could restore the phrase's potency, albeit perhaps temporarily. In a broader sense, the phenomenon of a powerful phrase losing its impact through overuse reflects real-world trends with slogans, catchphrases, and hashtags. They can serve a unifying purpose but can also become diluted when they're adopted widely and used to the point of cliché. The context and the conscious efforts to maintain the sincere use of such phrases play a critical role in their longevity and impact."},{"prompt":"is it possible for the Open Society Justice Initiative tp provide funds for the Philippines orgaizationg that tackles with human rights? and how?","completion":"The Open Society Justice Initiative is part of the Open Society Foundations, which is a global network of philanthropic organizations founded by George Soros. They provide financial support to a wide range of initiatives around the world, including those that promote human rights. Whether the Open Society Justice Initiative can provide funds for Filipino organizations working on human rights issues depends on various factors, including alignment with their goals, the current strategic focus of the initiative, and whether the organization in question meets their criteria for grantmaking. Here's how a Filipino organization could potentially seek funding from the Open Society Justice Initiative or any similar entity within the Open Society Foundations: 1. **Research**: Visit the Open Society Foundations’ official website and gather information about their programs, funding opportunities, areas of interest, and grantmaking criteria. 2. **Alignment**: Ensure that the work of your organization aligns with the mission and current strategic priorities of the Open Society Foundations.

At least tell me it’s Lamar—that feisty little pet of Dr. Kleiner's.\\" [Gordon finally breaks his silence with a rare chuckle, nodding emphatically as if to remind her of all their shared hardships and the absurdity that sometimes comes with it.] Alyx: \\"Ah!

Got any other hidden talents I should know about?\\" [Gordon simply shakes his head with a smile as they continue their silent game, the two finding solace in this brief moment of respite amidst the chaos surrounding them.

This task could be approached similarly to image captioning or neural machine translation problems, potentially using convolutional layers for feature extraction from images and recurrent layers or transformers for generating HTML code. - For image processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used. - For generating HTML code, sequence-to-sequence models like LSTM, GRU or Transformers might be used. 3. **Training:** - Split your preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets. - Train your neural network on the training dataset, making sure to regularize the model to prevent overfitting to your training data. 4. **Evaluation:** - Test your trained model on the unseen test dataset. - Use metrics suited for the task, such as BLEU score, for assessing the quality of the generated HTML compared to the true HTML code. 5. **Post-Processing:** - Post-processing steps might be necessary to translate the model's output into valid HTML code. 6. **Iterating:** - Based on testing, iterate on steps 1 to 5 to improve performance. This task would likely be a research project and could require a significant amount of data and compute resources. As of my last update in early 2023, no widely-recognized, off-the-shelf AI model is available that can directly perform this task with high accuracy. Crafting an HTML generator from website images involves understanding both the style and the structure, which goes beyond the capabilities of most current models. As an alternative approach, you might consider using existing tools in a semi-automated workflow: - Use ML models that can perform object detection to identify elements of a web page (like buttons, text boxes, images). - Map identified elements to corresponding HTML tags and construct a rough HTML structure based on the layout detected in the screenshot. - Manually refine the generated HTML or further automate refinements with rules-based logic or smaller scope ML models. For learning and experimenting, you can start with existing datasets and models that handle similar problems, such as image captioning, and then incrementally work toward adapting the models for HTML generation. Open-source libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch would be useful for implementing such models. However, to reiterate, this proposed task is complex and not trivial to solve, potentially requiring advanced knowledge in deep learning and a significant investment in time and resources."},{"prompt":"If i can achieve my results without any ML or AI this would be good, please give me a head start with python code","completion":"Creating a program that converts website screenshots to HTML without using ML/AI will inevitably require significant manual coding and heuristic-based approaches. A fully automated solution performing this task with high fidelity is not currently feasible without sophisticated image recognition and understanding, which falls squarely in the realm of AI. Nevertheless, if we assume a simplified scenario with very controlled conditions (e.g., screenshots from a known set of template-based websites with predictable layouts), you could use a Python-based approach with computer vision techniques to recognize elements on the screen and map them to HTML structures. Here is a very basic outline of how you might approach this task for a set of highly standardized templates using Python: 1. Use a computer vision library, such as OpenCV, to detect elements in the screenshot. 2. Define rules to associate detected visual elements with HTML components (e.g., rectangles may correspond to divs, buttons, inputs; lines of texts to p or span tags, etc.). 3. Use template HTML tags to construct a basic HTML structure. Here is a very simplified Python pseudo-code snippet to give you an idea: \`\`\`python import cv2 def find_elements(screenshot_path): # Load the image img = cv2.imread(screenshot_path) # Preprocess (grayscale, thresholding, etc.) gray_img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) _, thresh_img = cv2.threshold(gray_img, 128, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV) # Detect elements (this would need to be heavily customized and might involve contour detection) # This is a placeholder to illustrate the idea: contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh_img, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE) # Return a list of detected elements with their position, size, etc. elements = [] for contour in contours: x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour) elements.append({'type': 'div', 'x': x, 'y': y, 'w': w, 'h': h}) # Simplified return elements def construct_html(elements): # Convert the detected elements to HTML html_output = \\"<html><body>\\" for element in elements: html_output += f\\"<div style='position:absolute; left:{element['x']}px; top:{element['y']}px; width:{element['w']}px; height:{element['h']}px;'></div>\\" html_output += \\"</body></html>\\" return html_output # Main screenshot_path = \\"path_to_screenshot.png\\" elements = find_elements(screenshot_path) html_code = construct_html(elements) print(html_code) \`\`\` This example uses OpenCV to process an image and find contours, which can represent elements on a webpage. However, this is far from a practical implementation. Real-world web pages are complex, and simple contour detection wouldn't be enough to determine the nature of elements, their functionality, or nested relationships. Other functions such as text detection, button recognition, and similar element identification would need to be created, each with substantial logic to handle many variations. The bottom line is that even with a simple template-based approach, the task is non-trivial and would struggle to handle variability well. Full-blown HTML reconstruction from a screenshot would almost certainly require machine learning, and even then, the task remains a significant challenge requiring advanced techniques and robust training data."},{"prompt":"What if we use a model to train on the data i just scraped, help me with that","completion":"Training a model to convert screenshots into HTML code is indeed an intriguing challenge and aligns more with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Let's assume you have a dataset consisting of pairs of website screenshots and their corresponding HTML source code. Here are some steps to get you started on training a model for this task: # Step 1: Collect and Prepare the Data You've already scraped some data which includes screenshots and HTML. Make sure your data is well-organized; each screenshot needs to be paired with its corresponding HTML file. # Step 2: Preprocess the Screenshots You will likely need to preprocess the screenshots so that they're suitable for a deep learning model. Common preprocessing steps include: - **Resizing** the images to a consistent size. - **Normalizing** pixel values (scaling them so that they are between 0 and 1). # Step 3: Preprocess the HTML HTML files would also need preprocessing to convert them from raw text into a structured format that a model can learn from. This could involve: - **Tokenization** to transform the HTML into a sequence of tokens. - **Encoding** to convert tokens into numerical format. - **Padding or Truncation** to ensure that all sequences have the same length. # Step 4: Define the Model Architecture Next, design a neural network architecture that can take an image as input and output a sequence of tokens representing HTML code. Such a model might resemble architectures used in image captioning tasks, e.g., encoder-decoder models: **Encoder**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the screenshot. **Decoder**: A recurrent neural network (RNN) like LSTM or GRU or a Transformer to generate HTML code from the visual features. # Step 5: Train the Model Training such a model involves using your preprocessed data to gradually improve the model's ability to predict the HTML code from unseen images: - Define **loss functions** (like categorical cross-entropy for sequence prediction). - Choose an **optimizer** (like Adam). - Decide on **evaluation metrics** to track during training. - Use **backpropagation** and **gradient descent** to update the weights of the model. # Step 6: Evaluate the Model After training, evaluate the model's performance on a test set that wasn't seen during training. Use appropriate metrics for sequence prediction, such as BLEU score. # Step 7: Iteration and Refinement Iterate on steps 3 to 6, refining the preprocessing, model architecture, and training process based on the model's performance. Here is a high-level example of how you might structure such a training process using Python with libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch: \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences from tensorflow.keras.models import Model from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, LSTM, Dense # Load and preprocess your images and HTML # ... # Prepare the tokenizer on the HTML tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=10000) # Adjust num_words based on your vocab size tokenizer.fit_on_texts(all_html_sources) sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(all_html_sources) max_sequence_length = max(len(s) for s in sequences) # Or pick a fixed number html_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_sequence_length, padding='post') # Create the model input_image = Input(shape=(IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH, NUM_CHANNELS)) cnn = ... # CNN layers cnn_output = cnn(input_image) decoder_input = ... # Sequence input for the decoder, potentially initialized with CNN output lstm = LSTM(units=512, return_sequences=True)(decoder_input, initial_state=[cnn_output, cnn_output]) decoder_output = Dense(NUM_HTML_TOKENS, activation='softmax')(lstm) model = Model(inputs=[input_image, decoder_input], outputs=decoder_output) # Compile the model with a loss and an optimizer model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy') # Train the model model.fit([images, decoder_input_sequences], html_sequences, epochs=EPOCHS) # Save or evaluate your model model.save('screenshot_to_html.h5') \`\`\` This is a very simplified view of what is a complex problem. Considerations such as attention mechanisms, pretraining, transfer learning, data augmentation, and sophisticated tokenization strategies (such as BERT's WordPiece or GPT's Byte-Pair Encoding) might all improve performance. Building, training, and refining a model for such a complex task as screenshot-to-HTML would need extensive computational resources and deep learning expertise. It's recommended to work with machine learning specialists who have experience in similar tasks or to explore academic literature on topics like neural machine translation and image-to-text tasks for further guidance."},{"prompt":"Give me a function to load the image and the HTML representing it, then the image will be passed to the model as an input, and its corresponding HTML will be the output target for the model, this function should loop over all the screenshots and html found in the folders with the same name,","completion":"Certainly!

Remember to adapt the \`load_and_preprocess_data\` function to meet the conditions of your machine learning model and the specific requirements of your datasets.

Calculates the array \`y\` as the sine of \`x\` plus some Gaussian noise and then plots this curve. 4. Defines a function called \`filter_function\` that creates an averaging filter (box filter) array of a specified size. 5. Creates a filter of random size between 3 and 5 by calling the filter function and applies this filter to the array \`y\` using convolution. It then plots the original and convolved curves. 6. Applies a stride of 2 to the convolved data by slicing every other element starting from zero and then plots the original and convolved curve with the stride. 7. Takes the convolved signal (from step 5) and applies max pooling with a pool size of 3, which means it takes the maximum value of every three samples in the window and then plots the original, convolved, and max-pooled curves. About the code, a few observations can be made: - The filter function \`filter_function\` always returns a box filter, a type of filter that tends to smooth the signal by averaging nearby values. The filter size is chosen randomly, which affects how much the original signal is smoothed. - In the convolution step, the 'same' mode is used, which means the output is the same size as the input, and the filter is applied to the signal, considering the center of the filter aligns with the current value being calculated. - The stride effectively downsamples the data by a factor of 2, which means the plotted convolved curve with stride will be less dense than the original plot. - Keep in mind that max pooling is applied only to the size of the convolved signal minus \`pool_size\` plus 1. Hence, the plot of the max-pooled curve will not extend to the full range of the x-axis, and you should slice the x-axis to fit the max-pooled data accordingly. You should see three plotted figures when running the code: the original noisy signal, the convolved signal, and the convolved signal with a stride and max pooling applied, respectively. These visualizations allow you to understand how convolution, stride, and pooling affect the signal, which is useful in the context of signal processing as well as in understanding operations in neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs)."},{"prompt":"Create names for a movement or act that leads to the foundation of a lot of infrastructure","completion":"1.

实验原理","completion":"\\"6 BD-Ⅱ-507 动作判断仪\\" 似乎是指一个专门的设备或仪器，但因为没有具体的文献或产品说明，这里我只能提供一般性的解释。 动作判断仪一般是用来测量和评估人体动作反应的设备。它可能用于诸如心理学研究、运动训练、康复医学或工程学（如人机交互）等方面。这样的设备可能设计用于测量反应时间、运动精度、运动协调性等参数。 6.1 实验原理可以解释为这台仪器工作的基本原则或理论依据。这些理论依据可能包括但不限于: 1. 传感器技术：动作判断仪可能包含各种传感器（如触摸屏、按钮、压力感应器、光电传感器等）用来检测用户的物理交互。 2. 时间测量：可能包括计时器来准确地记录用户做出反应的时间，以此来评估其反应速度。 3. 数据分析：收集的数据可能需要通过一定的算法来分析，以评估用户的反应能力和运动控制等。 4. 人体机能：实验原理可能会涉及对人的感觉、认知和运动控制过程的理解。 5. 程序化任务设计：动作判断仪可能提供一系列预设的任务，用户执行这些任务，然后仪器根据用户的表现做出评估。 6. 反应类型判定：在某些实验中，用户的不同类型的反应（正确或错误、快或慢）可能会被记录和分析。 7. 学习与适应：长期使用动作判断仪的实验可能还需要测量用户随时间的适应和学习效果。

\\"1′\\" 和 \\"2′\\" 代表第1分钟和第2分钟内的记录。 - \\"第一次\\"、\\"第二次\\"、\\"第三次\\" 代表了三次不同的尝试或测试。 所提供的数据如下： \`\`\` 尝试/时间 1′ 2′ 第一次 0 1 第二次 1 3 第三次 1 1 \`\`\` 现在，让我们分析这些数据： 1. 错误数的和 - 在第1分钟，错误之和为 \`0 + 1 + 1 = 2\`。 - 在第2分钟，错误之和为 \`1 + 3 + 1 = 5\`。 2. 平均错误数 - 在第1分钟，平均错误数为 \`2 / 3 ≈ 0.666\`。 - 在第2分钟，平均错误数为 \`5 / 3 ≈ 1.666\`。 以上分析表明，在第2分钟时错误数显著增加，平均错误数也从大约0.666增加到大约1.666。这可能意味着任务随着时间增加而变得更加困难或受试者的疲劳或注意力下降导致错误增加。 进一步的统计分析可能包括计算标准差以衡量在每个时间点错误数量的变异性，或者执行重复措施的方差分析（ANOVA）来确定不同时间点的错误数是否具有统计学上的显著差异。 重要的是，我们需要更多的上下文信息来正确解释这些数据，包括实验的设计、目的、所执行任务的性质、受试者的条件以及可能影响错误数的任何其他因素。此外，样本数量（只有三次尝试）可能太少，无法得出具有统计学意义的结论。如果可能，收集更多数据点将提供更可靠的分析结果。"},{"prompt":"该实验是BD-Ⅱ-507

\`\`\` 尝试/时间 1′ 2′ 第一次 0 1 第二次 1 3 第三次 1 1 \`\`\` 我们可以假设每一列代表了在一分钟内发生的错误次数，而每一行代表了不同次数的实验。 分析数据可以得出以下信息： 1. **趋势分析**： - 在第一分钟，参与者往往犯较少错误，除了\\"第二次\\"尝试，其中出现了1次错误。这可能意味着开始时参与者较为专注，或者任务难度较低。 - 在第二分钟，错误次数在\\"第一次\\"尝试时有所提高，在\\"第二次\\"尝试中显著增加至3次，在\\"第三次\\"尝试中有所降低回到1次。这可能表明任务的难度确实在增加，导致疲劳积累或注意力分散，或者参与者在调整策略后有所改善。 2. **参与者的学习和适应**： - \\"第一次\\"和\\"第三次\\"尝试中，错误从1′的0增加到2′的1，这在统计上可能不显著，但它可能指示出短期内的记忆或适应效应。而\\"第二次\\"尝试中，错误数在2′显著增加，可能说明参与者在这个尝试中适应不良或者任务难度有所上升。 3. **变异性分析**： - 在第1分钟和第2分钟的数据中变异程度不同。第1分钟数据相对更稳定，而第2分钟数据波动更大，特别是第二次尝试的错误数激增到3。 4. **整体表现**： - 从这个小数据集看起来，随着时间的推移，错误数总体有增加的趋势。这可能意味着参与者在实验的后期表现出疲劳或专注程度下降。

反应时、运动时测量 1.1 实验原理 反应时间指的是从刺激呈现到外部反应开始所用的时间。运动时间指的是从开始运动到运动完成所用的时间。反应时运动时测定仪，就是根据这个意思，采用单片计算机控制，随机呈现不同方位的刺激，以测定被试的反应时运动时。 反应时是指刺激呈现到作出反应之过程的时间间隔，由于反应时间长短表征了中枢神经系统和运动器官的敏感性，因此在人因工程中，反应时间常成为检查疲劳和人机功能分配的手段之一。在心理学研究中，也常把反应时作为一种可靠性指标来分析人的知觉、注意、学习与记忆、思维、动机和个性差别等各种心理活动，还可应用于职业的选择和训练，以及人机系统等方面的设计。 一般研究将反应时分为简单反应时、运动反应时、选择反应时，它的影响因素非常多而复杂。其主要影响因素有感觉通道、效应器官、刺激信号的性质、强度、可选择的数目，刺激信号间的差异和识别难易程度以及反应者的学习训练因素、年龄、动机、个体差异等。 1.2 实验数据 测量反应时及8个方位的运动时 实验次数 反应时 运动时 平均值 10 0.353 0.407 0.38 20 0.313 0.448 0.3805

第一组数据中，反应时随实验次数的增加而减少，在10到30次实验之间逐渐变得更快。这表明被试在实验过程中经过练习，对刺激反应更迅速。然而，运动时的平均值略有波动，并没有明显的下降趋势。 与第一组数据相比，第二组实验的反应时和运动时的平均值都有所减少，表明熟练度的提高。特别是运动时的减少比第一组显得更为明显，这可能说明被试对于不同距离的运动反应更容易适应和优化。 比较两组数据，我们可以得到一些初步结论： 反应时的减少趋势：两组数据都显示了反应时随实验次数的增加有所减少，这表明无论是8个方位的运动还是6个不同距离的运动，在多次练习后被试都能更迅速地开始他们的反应。 运动时的变化：第一组实验的运动时没有显示出一致的减少趋势，而第二组实验的运动时随实验次数增加而有明显的递减趋势。这可能反映出方位运动相比于距离运动，对被试来说在短期内更难以优化其性能。 学习效应：降低的反应时和运动时可能表明学习效应的存在，即因为实验次数的增加和对实验任务的熟悉度提高，从而改善了表现。 1.4 根据本实验原理，在作业环境或者产品设计的时候需要注意的问题 (1) 人机界面设计：应根据用户的反应时和运动时进行优化，例如，界面上的控件应该放置在容易到达的地方，确保操作流程尽量符合用户的自然动作模式。 (2) 警示系统的及时性：警告信号或紧急信息应该被设计成能迅速识别和理解，以允许用户及时做出反应。例如，在驾驶仪表盘设计应该使得驾驶员可以尽可能快地从仪表盘获取信息并做出反应。 (3) 培训和练习：为了减少员工的反应时和提高运动效率，需要提供充足的培训和实践机会。以此保证员工在关键时刻可以迅速且正确地做出反应。 (4) 考虑认知负荷：设计时应减少不必要的认知负荷，例如通过简化任务步骤或提供清晰的指导，使得用户可以更专注于任务的关键部分。 (5) 安全性：特别是在安全性至关重要的环境中，如工业控制室或紧急逃生设施，用户的反应时与运动时间至关重要。设计者应考虑到这些时间参数以预防意外和紧急情况。 (6) 遵守人体工学原则：设计应依据人体工学原则，确保作业设计不会导致用户过度伸展或做出不自然的动作，这样不仅可以减少劳损，还可以缩短运动时间。 (7) 反应与反馈：用户对于机器或系统做出的任何反应应当得到清晰且及时的反馈，这样可以帮助提升效能和满意度，并减少错误。 (8) 避免认知超载：设计系统时要考虑用户处理信息的能力。信息过载可能造成反应时间延长，增加出错的几率。 2 空间知觉测试仪 2.1 实验原理 空间知觉测试仪就是人们凭借视觉对空间位置中形状，方位的辨别过程来鉴别个体对空间特性的辨别能力。用于考察空间知觉特点和鉴别个体对空间特性的辨别能力的仪器。 它还可用于验证刺激的空间结构特点对信息传递效率的影响。该仪器包括灯光显示器、主试控制器、被试操作这三个主要部分。其通过小灯的不同组合能呈现几十种图形，供实验时任意选用。所输出的图形分为条形、块形和不规则形三类，每类又可分为四种图案。 实验中，被试对不同的图案进行辨别反应，主试记录下必要的数据。所得数据可用常规统计进行比较，也可用信息论方法算出信息传递效率。 2.2 实验数据 总次数 实验 平均反应时（秒） 错误次数 平均错误数 错误率 10 条Ⅰ 1.115 2 1.75 17.50% 条Ⅱ 1.196 2 块Ⅰ 0.438 1 块Ⅱ 0.455 2 20 不规则Ⅰ 0.805 19 7.25 36.25% 不规则Ⅰ 0.815 4 不规则Ⅰ 0.802 3 不规则Ⅰ 0.508 3 2.3 实验数据分析 前四次实验中，每次进行十次测验，其中“条Ⅰ”和“条Ⅱ”的平均反应时比“块Ⅰ”和“块Ⅱ”的平均反应时更长，其原因是条形图形与按键的排列是一致的，都是从左到右的一行或者从上到下的一列。如果将其打乱顺序，而与我们平时思维方式不一致，所以需要较长的反应时间。 而块形图形本身的顺序性较差，大脑对其重新进行排序的要求较低，对应的平均反应时间较短。 前四次实验的平均错误数为1.75，错误率17.5%，错误次数比较少。其中块Ⅰ的错误率最低，可能是因为这种类型的图案辨别起来相对容易。 后四次实验中，每次进行20次测验，且均为“不规则Ⅰ”。其中第一次实验的错误次数非常多，有19次，原因是开始尚未建立起对不规则图形的记忆，对图形与按键的一一对应没有找到规律。在后三次实验中，我提取到图像的关键特征，只关注4*4方格的第一行，对大脑的加工要求较低，所以错误次数明显减少。 综合来看，实验结果表明平均反应时间和错误率都随图案的复杂性增加而增加，块形图案相较于其他图案，被试的辨别效能最好，其次是条形图案，而不规则形图案则是最难以辨别的。 2.4 根据本实验原理，在作业环境或者产品设计的时候需要注意的问题 (1) 遵循逻辑顺序：设计时应该确保流程和布局符合用户的直觉和习惯。例如，从左到右和从上到下是大多数文化中阅读和处理信息的自然顺序。 (2) 步骤连续性：在设计任务流程时，确保每个步骤都以连贯的方式引导用户，避免让用户在流程中迷失方向。 (3) 因果关系：如果设计中某个操作会引起反应或变化，确保这种因果关系在视觉上是清晰和容易理解的。 (4) 任务流程：在任务繁复的操作环境中，设计时应有明确的指示，表明用户当前所处的操作阶段，并提供对下一步行动的引导。 (5) 一致性：维持一致的操作方式和顺序可以减少用户的学习成本，并降低犯错的可能性。 3 动觉方位辨别仪 3.1 实验原理 动觉，也称为运动感觉或肌肉感觉，是指通过肌肉、肌腱和关节感受器感知身体部位位置和运动的能力。动觉方位辨别仪的实验原理通常涉及这种感觉能力的评估，其核心目的是测量个体如何感知和识别他们身体某部分（通常是手臂或手指）在空间中的位置，以及他们对运动方向和幅度的感知精度。 3.2 实验数据 30° 90° 148° 第一次测量 28° 91° 140° 第二次测量 32° 91° 141° 第三次测量 28° 84° 150° 平均值 29.33° 88.67° 143.67° 误差 -0.67° -1.33° -4.33° 3.3 实验数据分析 测量值接近真实值，表明受试者动觉感知的准确性总体上是可靠的。 实验数据的一致性可以从三次测量的接近程度来评估，30°与90°的设置中测量差异较小，而148°的设置中差异较大，可能是由于较大角度的感知难度增加所导致。 在148°角度设定时，误差相比于其他两个角度偏大，这可能表示受试者在辨别较大角度位置时的感知能力较弱，或者该角度范围内受试者的动觉灵敏度下降。 3.4 根据本实验原理，在作业环境或者产品设计的时候需要注意的问题 人体工程学：设计工作站、椅子、工具和设备时，需要考虑人体的动觉反馈。这包括设备的位置、高度、角度和布局，以确保使用者在不必频繁查看或调整的情况下，能够通过动觉准确地感知并操作。 安全性：在可能存在危险的工作环境中，人们需要通过动觉来感知自己和周围物体的位置，从而保持安全距离和避免意外事故。设计时应确保用户的动觉感知不被过度依赖或者误导。 辅助反馈机制： 设计中应当考虑加入一些反馈机制(如振动、声音提示等)，来增强或替代动觉信息，特别是在高风险或高技能要求的环境中。 重复性任务设计：在重复性高的作业环境中，设计应考虑用户动觉的疲劳和适应性，以及对动作精确性的长期影响。 4 双手调节器 4.1 实验原理 双手调节器实验的基本原理是评估和测试个体同时使用双手执行精细和协调动作的能力。这涉及到手眼协调、动觉和触觉反馈以及两手的同步和独立控制能力。通过要求参与者完成特定的调节任务，可以观察和测量其双手运动技能和协调性。 4.2 实验数据 实验次数 错误数 平均时间 1 2 150.621s 2 0 118.264s 3 0 128.882s 4 0 116.599s 5 1 116.768s 4.3 实验数据分析 随着实验的进行，错误数从最开始的两次降低至零，然后在第五次实验中又出现一个错误。这可能表明受试者在实验过程中对任务变得更熟练，但也可能表现出一定的不一致性或疲劳。 从第一次实验的150.621秒到第四次实验的116.599秒，受试者的完成时间逐渐变短。虽然第五次实验时的时间(116.768秒)比第四次略长，但与之非常接近且仍然低于最初的时间，这说明受试者保持了较高的效率。 4.4 根据本实验原理，在作业环境或者产品设计的时候需要注意的问题 人机界面设计：确保控制界面易于使用，按钮和杠杆的布局、大小和响应性都应适合用户以最小化操作错误。 多感官交互：增加视觉、听觉和触觉元素，以增强用户的总体感知和操作反馈。 错误预防和容错设计：鼓励采用防错设计的理念，减少由于误操作而导致的风险，并容许一定程度的错误，使得用户可以更容易地纠正他们的行为。 稳定性和把握性：设计时要确保操作装置稳固且易于把握，以支持精确操作。 鼓励自然动作：设计应使用户的操作动作尽量自然和符合人体的运动习惯，减少不必要的肌肉紧张或关节压力。 5 BD-Ⅱ-304A 动作稳定器 5.1 实验原理 动作稳定器的实验原理是通过要求受试者执行精细控制的手部动作，来测试和评估他们的手眼协调、动觉感知、手部稳定性以及在压力下执行任务的能力。实验中会记录完成任务的时间和发生错误时的图形窄度，用于评估受试者的运动控制技能。这种实验工具在神经科学研究、运动技能训练和职业健康评估中有广泛应用。 5.2 实验数据 实验次数 时间 发生错误时的图形窄度 曲线1 1.952s 7.2 曲线2 9.961s 3.8 直线1 4.143s 3.3 直线2 2.197s 5.8 圆点1 2.734s 8 圆点2 7.080s 6 5.3 实验数据分析 由于第一次实验对仪器不了解，导致动作不稳定。在第二次曲线任务中，用时增加，到达的位置更窄，说明动作比较稳定。 直线任务所用的时间介于曲线任务和圆点任务之间，窄度最小，这意味着在稳定性要求上相对于曲线和圆点任务较容易。 圆点任务则在两次实验中有较大的时间波动，表明精细控制的一致性较低，是由于在狭窄空间内控制难度较大。 5.4 根据本实验原理，在作业环境或者产品设计的时候需要注意的问题 精细操作的空间需求：设计应提供足够的操作空间，方便用户进行各种精细操作，且不受限制。 任务复杂性：在适当的范围内平衡任务复杂度，防止过于复杂的操作导致用户容易犯错或引起过度的身心压力。 稳定性与精准度：设计应确保在执行精细或高精密工作时，工具和设备的稳定性和精准度满足用户的需求。 6 BD-Ⅱ-507 动作判断仪 6.1 实验原理 BD-Ⅱ-507型动作判断仪的实验原理主要涉及到操作者对自身视觉注意力的分配和维持。在实验中，转动圆盘上包含有10个矩形目标、10个圆目标及1个周边目标，这些目标会以恒定速度转动。操作者的任务是转动手轮避开障碍点，通过这一过程，就可以测定操作者在操作期间对自身视觉注意力的分配和维持。 6.2 实验数据 错误数 1′ 2′ 第一次 0 1 第二次 1 3 第三次 1 1 6.3 实验数据分析 第1分钟数据相对更稳定，而第2分钟数据波动更大，特别是第二次尝试的错误数激增到3。 随着时间的推移，错误数总体有增加的趋势。这意味着在实验的后期表现出疲劳或专注程度下降。 6.4 根据本实验原理，在作业环境或者产品设计的时候需要注意的问题 注意分配和维持能力：操作者需要具备良好的注意力分配和维持能力，能够同时关注多个任务或目标，并保持对它们的持续关注。在设计作业环境和产品时，应考虑如何减少操作者的分心因素，提供清晰的视觉指引和反馈，以帮助操作者更好地分配和维持注意力。 视觉刺激的设置：转动圆盘上的目标设置应合理，包括目标的数量、形状、颜色等。目标之间应有足够的间隔，以避免混淆和误判。此外，目标的移动速度也应适中，既不能过快导致操作者无法及时反应，也不能过慢导致操作者失去兴趣和专注。 操作界面的布局：操作界面的布局应简洁明了，避免过多的信息和干扰因素。重要的控制按钮和指示器应放置在易于操作的位置，并提供明确的标识和反馈。此外，操作界面的颜色搭配和对比度也应合理，以确保操作者能够清晰地识别和理解界面上的信息。 7 注意力集中能力测定仪 7.1 实验原理 注意力集中能力测定仪的实验原理主要基于测定被试的注意集中能力，这体现在能否长时间集中于一定的对象，没有松驰或分散的现象。该仪器可以用于进行视觉动作学习和注意力品质的测验。在实验过程中，被试需要在不同转速、不同时间及不同图案的条件下，用测试棒端部紧贴盘面追踪光斑进行测定。同时，测试板的透明图案随着转盘转动产生运动光斑，追踪正确的时间和出错次数将被作为注意力集中能力的评估指标。 7.2 实验数据 120″ 240″ 速度1 速度2 速度1 速度2 错误数 16 45 26 50 10 32 16 35 7.3 实验数据分析 从数据中可以看到，在速度2下的错误数比在速度1下的错误数要多，无论是在120秒时还是在240秒时。这表明速度2的条件下注意力难以保持集中，导致更多的错误。 在两种速度下，从120秒到240秒的错误数都有所增加。这可能表明随着时间的推移，注意力下降，导致错误数增加。 7.4 根据本实验原理，在作业环境或者产品设计的时候需要注意的问题 我们需要考虑如何创造一种环境或产品设计，能够使人们的注意力能较长时间集中于一定的对象，减少疲劳和效率的下降，避免出现松弛或分散的现象。例如，我们可以调整作业或产品的刺激性，比如刺激难度、试验时间等，以影响注意集中的成绩，验证注意力集中在学习和工作过程中的作用。此外，我们还需要关注作业或产品是否能够帮助提高个体的视觉-动觉协调能力。对于长时间连续工作的情境，我们也需要考虑到如何通过调整工作节奏、休息时间等因素来维持或提升注意力集中度。 8 OYGD-Ⅱ 记忆广度测试仪 8.1 实验原理 OYGD-Ⅱ记忆广度测试仪主要用于测定个体的短时记忆能力。记忆广度，也被称为“即时记忆广度”，指的是按固定顺序逐一地呈现一系列刺激以后，刚刚能够立刻正确再现的刺激系列的长度。在记忆广度的测试中，数字记忆能力的测试是目前心理学研究中瞬时记忆中简单易行又最为典型的一种方法。 在具体的实验过程中，被试每次需要对一组随机数字进行识记和回忆，长度从三位至十二位不等。测试具有同时测量被试视觉、记忆、反应速度三者结合能力的功能。通过这种方式，可以映出其人瞬时记忆能力，并据此分析被试的短时记忆能力。 8.2 实验数据 实验次数 显示位数 正确回答显示时间 正确回答次数 1 10 7min20s 17 2 10 7min40s 20 3 11 7min34s 23 4 10 7min2s 25 5 10 7min10s 26 8.3 实验数据分析 从表中可以看出，随着显示位数的增加，正确回答显示时间也在增加。这可能是因为更多的信息需要被处理和回忆，因此需要更长的时间来完成。 随着实验次数的增加，正确回答次数和正确回答显示时间都在逐渐减少。这可能是因为在经过多次实验后，已经熟悉了测试流程和要求，从而提高了表现。 无论是正确回答次数还是正确回答显示时间，都呈现出逐渐改善的趋势。这可能是因为被试者在经过多次实验后，已经掌握了一些提高记忆广度的策略和方法。 8.4 根据本实验原理，在作业环境或者产品设计的时候需要注意的问题 优化刺激呈现方式：根据记忆广度测试，刺激需要按固定顺序逐一呈现。因此，产品或作业环境中的信息也应尽可能以有逻辑的、有序的方式展示，以便用户能更好地记住和处理信息。 提供即时反馈：记忆广度测试中，被试必须即刻按原顺序再现刺激系列。在产品设计中，也应提供及时的反馈机制，让用户知道他们的操作是否正确，哪些地方需要改进。 注意广度与任务难度的匹配：如果任务过于简单或过于复杂，都可能影响用户的专注度和记忆广度。因此，需要根据用户的能力和任务的难度来适当调整。

Поэтому, чтобы убедиться, что этот код работает правильно, необходимо также проверить эти пользовательские функции.

Проверяет, равно ли r значению (xR1 + ee) mod q.","completion":"В схеме Nyberg-Rueppel проверка подписи заключается в сравнении некоторых значений, чтобы убедиться в подлинности подписи. В целом, схема проверки подписи в эллиптических кривых оперирует точками на кривой и их координатами, вычисляя и сравнивая их по определенным правилам. Для схемы Nyberg-Rueppel, проверка подписи обычно включает следующие шаги: 1. Вычислить значение хеш-функции (предположительно \`ee\`) для сообщения, у которого проверяется подпись. 2. Вычислить левую сторону проверочного уравнения, используя подпись и открытый ключ. 3. Вычислить правую сторону проверочного уравнения, используя оригинальное сообщение (или его хеш) и другие параметры. 4. Сравнить левую и правую стороны проверочного уравнения. С точки зрения математических операций, \`(xR1 + ee) mod q\` представляет собой операцию, которая добавляет значение хеша к x-координате точки R1 (результат сложения cP и rQ на кривой) и берет результат по модулю q, где q является порядком подгруппы, используемой в системе эллиптических кривых. То, что Вы указали в пункте 6, представляет проверочное условие, которое реализует принцип сравнения в схеме Nyberg-Rueppel. При условии, что остальные части алгоритма реализованы правильно и соответствующие значения были корректно вычислены в предыдущих шагах, это условие является критерием, по которому мы можем судить о правильности подписи.

Этап верификации позволяет восстановить это замаскированное хеш-значение, не допуская никакой утечки информации, которая позволила бы активному криптоаналитику изменить документ и хеш-значение так, чтобы измененный документ воспринимался бы как корректный. Тут написан немного другой алгоритм","completion":"Похоже, вы описываете алгоритм верификации цифровой подписи с использованием схемы Nyberg-Rueppel, которая основана на эллиптических кривых. Алгоритм, который вы описали, выглядит следующим образом: 1. Вычислить ( R' = cP + rQ ), где ( P ) - генерирующая точка группы, ( Q ) - открытый ключ подписавшего, ( c ) и ( r ) - параметры подписи. 2. Используя ( x )-компоненту точки ( R' ), вычислить ( e' = (r - x_{R'}) mod q ), где ( q ) - порядок подгруппы. 3. Сравнить полученное хеш-значение ( e' ) с ( e = h(m) ), где ( h ) - хеш-функция, ( m ) - сообщение. Если значения совпадают, то подпись считается подлинной. Этот метод предполагает, что подпись ( (r, s) ), состоящая из двух компонент, верифицируется через вычисление точки ( R' ) на эллиптической кривой и сравнения хеша ( e' ) с оригинальным хешем сообщения ( h(m) ).

Gather 'round as I recount the Saga of Stars and Seas, where the mighty Viking warriors embark on a journey not across the foamy waters, but through the very fabric of the skies above! *(Dramatic drumbeat as a Viking Longship, outfitted with otherworldly sails resembling solar panels, appears on the stage, complete with a crew of Viking \\"spacefarers.\\")* Narrator: In the vast expanse of the cosmos, our heroes sail aboard the celestial longship, Skyrider, her sails catching the solar winds, her prow pointed towards the shining constellation of Yggdralaxy. *(Viking Spacefarer 1, brandishing a shining, futuristic axe, addresses the crew.)* Viking Spacefarer 1: Warriors!

To understand it well, let's break it down into its main elements: 1. **Definition**: At its core, a repository or \\"repo\\" is a storage location for software packages or a central file storage location where code is kept. It can be thought of as a folder that contains all the files related to a specific project, along with the history of changes made to those files. 2. **Version Control**: Most modern repositories are part of a version control system (VCS), such as Git, Subversion (SVN), or Mercurial. Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. This is crucial for understanding the evolution of a project and for managing changes made by multiple contributors. 3. **Functionality**: A repo often includes not just the actual files of a project but also a complete history of all edits, additions, and deletions. This allows developers to see how the project has evolved and to branch off from a certain point in the project's history to create alternative versions or to work on features independently. 4. **Collaboration**: Repos facilitate collaborative work. Multiple developers can download (clone or check out) a copy of the repo, make changes on their own copies, and then upload (push or commit) their updates back to the repository. A repo can have mechanisms to manage these changes, such as pull requests or merge requests, which are requests by a developer to add their changes into the main project. 5. **Hosting Services**: Repos can be hosted locally on a user's computer or on remote servers. Popular online hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide remote repositories that offer additional features for project management, issue tracking, and continuous integration, making it easier for teams to collaborate on software projects. 6. **Accessibility**: Users can usually access a remote repo via network protocols like HTTPS or SSH. They can download (or \\"clone\\") the repo to their local machine, make changes, and then \\"push\\" these changes back to the remote repo. Other tools or people can then fetch those changes by \\"pulling\\" from the repo. In summary, a repo is a centralized place for storing, managing, and tracking files, typically used for source code in software development. It provides mechanisms to handle changes, version history, and collaboration, allowing teams to work on complex projects efficiently and effectively."},{"prompt":"No, from a finance perspective","completion":"Apologies for the confusion. In finance, the term \\"repo\\" stands for repurchase agreement, which is a form of short-term borrowing mainly used in the money markets. Here's what a repo entails and how it works: 1. **Definition**: A repo is a short-term loan, where one party sells a fixed-income security to another party with an agreement to repurchase it at a later date, typically the next day or within a short period, at a higher price. The difference in price represents the interest or the cost of the loan. 2. **Participants**: The main participants in the repo market are financial institutions, including commercial banks, investment banks, central banks, and money market funds. Securities dealers use repos to manage liquidity and finance their inventory of fixed-income securities. 3. **Securities Involved**: The securities commonly used in repos are government bonds, although other types of securities can also be used. These securities serve as collateral against the cash loan. 4. **Mechanism**: In a standard repo transaction, the borrower, seeking cash, sells securities to a lender and agrees to repurchase them at a specified date and at a price that includes an interest payment. The lender is protected because they hold the securities as collateral, and if the borrower defaults, the lender can sell the securities to recover the loaned money. 5. **Types of Repos**: - **Overnight Repo**: The borrower agrees to repurchase the securities the next day. - **Term Repo**: The repurchase date is beyond one day and can range up to a few weeks or months. - **Open Repo**: No end date is specified, and the agreement rolls over each day until one party gives notice to terminate. 6. **Rates**: The interest rate charged for the loan in a repo transaction is known as the repo rate. This rate is influenced by factors like the availability of collateral, the creditworthiness of the borrower, market liquidity, and prevailing interest rates. 7. **Uses**: - Repos provide a means for institutions to secure short-term funding without selling their securities outright. - Central banks use repos as a monetary policy tool to manage the money supply and bank reserves by adding or removing liquidity from the financial system. - Financial institutions use repos to manage their liquidity and finance their inventory of securities. 8. **Risks**: Although repos are generally considered safe due to the collateral involved, they are not without risks. The main risks are credit risk, if the borrower defaults and the collateral loses value, and liquidity risk, if the lender cannot sell the collateral quickly enough to recover the loaned funds. In essence, a repo in the financial world is a secure and efficient way for entities to obtain short-term financing while providing collateral to the lender. It is a crucial part of the global financial system's plumbing, ensuring that liquidity is available where and when it is needed."},{"prompt":"Explain grammatically 兄さんも人が悪いわ･･････ 驚かさんといて下さい!","completion":"The sentence \\"兄さんも人が悪いわ･･････ 驚かさんといて下さい!\\" can be broken down and explained as follows: 1. 兄さん (ani-san) - This is an informal way to refer to an older brother or a young man slightly older than the speaker, often used with a sense of respect or affection. The \\"さん\\" (san) is an honorific suffix that is used to show politeness. 2. も (mo) - This word means \\"also\\" or \\"too.\\" When it follows a noun or pronoun, as it does here, it implies that the person referred to by 兄さん is included in the statement along with others. 3. 人が悪い (hito ga warui) - The literal translation of 人 (hito) is \\"person,\\" and 悪い (warui) means \\"bad.\\" In this context, 人が悪い is a colloquial expression that means someone is mischievous or has a bad character/nature. It can also imply that someone has a wicked sense of humor or is being playfully mean. 4. わ (wa) - This is a sentence-ending particle that is typically used by female speakers to emphasize a statement or express emotion. 5. 驚かさんといて (odorokasan toite) - This is a contraction of 驚かさないで (odorokasanai de), which comes from the negative imperative form of the verb 驚かす (odorokasu), meaning \\"to surprise\\" or \\"to shock.\\" \\"といて\\" is the shortened form of \\"ておいて,\\" a request to do something in advance, in this case, to refrain from something. Adding \\"下さい\\" (kudasai) at the end turns it into a polite request. 6. 下さい (kudasai) - This is a polite way to ask someone to do something. It translates to \\"please\\" in English. So, putting it all together: \\"兄さんも人が悪いわ･･････ 驚かさんといて下さい!\\" translates to: \\"You're mean too, big bro... Please don't scare me!\\" Grammatically, this sentence functions as a request or plea, spoken with a sense of familiarity or closeness with the person being addressed (兄さん), while also lightly scolding or teasing them for their mischievous behavior (人が悪い). The speaker (probably a woman, given the use of わ) is asking the person not to surprise or scare them, and doing so in a casual but polite manner."},{"prompt":"葬送のフリーレン","completion":"\\"葬送のフリーレン\\" (Sōsō no Furīren) is a Japanese manga series. The title translates to \\"Frieren: Beyond Journey's End\\" in English. Written by Kanehito Yamada and illustrated by Tsukasa Abe, it began serialization in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday in April 2020. The story follows an elven mage named Frieren, who was part of a party of heroes that defeated the Demon King and saved the world. The manga explores themes of longevity and time, as Frieren, who has a much longer lifespan than her human companions, must come to terms with their deaths and the passage of time. The narrative is centered on Frieren's journey after the end of her companions' lives, as she reflects on the past and develops new relationships while traveling through a world that is slowly changing. \\"葬送\\" (Sōsō) typically means \\"funeral,\\" and \\"の\\" (no) is a possessive particle. The title captures the essence of the manga, which deals with farewells, memories, and the nature of life and death, particularly from the perspective of a being who experiences these things differently due to her race's longevity. The manga has been well-received for its poignant storytelling and beautiful artwork, and it has won several awards, including the 14th Manga Taisho awards in 2021."},{"prompt":"Explain grammatically 葬送のフリーレン","completion":"Grammatically, the phrase \\"葬送のフリーレン\\" (Sōsō no Furīren) can be broken down into two parts: 1. 葬送 (Sōsō): This is a noun that means \\"funeral\\" in English. It refers to the ceremonies or rituals conducted in honor of a deceased person. 2. の (no): This is a possessive particle used in Japanese. It functions similarly to the apostrophe-s ('s) in English to denote possession or relationship between two nouns. However, the の particle is not limited only to possession; it can also indicate the subject matter, specify a particular aspect of something, or define the relationship between two things. 3. フリーレン (Furīren): This is a proper noun and the name of the protagonist of the series. It is written in katakana, which is often used for foreign or made-up names, words, and onomatopoeic sounds. When the possessive particle の is used between \\"葬送\\" and \\"フリーレン,\\" it links the two nouns. The resulting phrase \\"葬送のフリーレン\\" can be translated to \\"Frieren of the Funeral\\" or \\"Frieren: Beyond Journey's End\\" as it has been officially translated. This implies a connection between the concept of funerals (葬送) and the character Frieren (フリーレン), suggesting that the story may focus on themes related to farewells, the end of journeys, or the aftermath of significant life events. In summary, grammatically \\"葬送のフリーレン\\" connects the noun for \\"funeral\\" with the name of the character, indicating a thematic relationship that is central to the story."},{"prompt":"まぁでも本物な訳ないわな･･････","completion":"The sentence \\"まぁでも本物な訳ないわな･･････\\" can be broken down and explained as follows: まぁ (mā) - This expression is often used in conversational Japanese to mean \\"well,\\" \\"now,\\" or to soften the tone of what the speaker is about to say. It's a filler word that can introduce some hesitation, reflection or a point of consideration. でも (demo) - This conjunction is comparable to \\"but\\" or \\"however\\" in English, indicating a contrast or turn in the statement. 本物 (honmono) - This noun means \\"real thing\\" or \\"genuine article\\" in English. \\"本\\" (hon) can mean \\"true\\" or \\"real,\\" and \\"物\\" (mono) means \\"thing,\\" so together they denote something that is authentic. な訳 (na wake) - \\"訳\\" (wake) means \\"reason\\" or \\"explanation\\" and is often used in the context of expressing the reason why something is the case or not the case. The particle \\"な\\" before \\"訳\\" is a negative form, generally derived from the verb \\"ない\\" (nai), meaning \\"not.\\" So \\"な訳\\" means \\"it's not the case that\\" or \\"there's no reason that.\\" ない (nai) - This is the negative form of the auxiliary verb \\"ある\\" (aru), which means \\"to exist\\" or \\"to be.\\" In this sentence, it's negating the existence or reality of something, hence \\"it's not.\\" わな (wana) - \\"わ\\" is a sentence-ending particle commonly used by female speakers to add emotional emphasis to a statement. \\"な\\" is a male-gendered sentence-ending particle that can be used for emphasis or to seek agreement or affirmation from the listener, similar to saying \\"right?\\" or \\"isn't it?\\" in English. ･･････ - These dots represent a pause or trailing off, indicating that the speaker might be leaving the thought incomplete or inviting the listener to fill in the rest. When put together: \\"まぁでも本物な訳ないわな･･････\\" can be translated to: \\"Well, but it couldn't possibly be the real thing, could it...\\" In context, this phrase would likely be used when someone is expressing skepticism or doubt that something is genuine or authentic. The speaker is not only stating that the thing in question is not real, but also implying that this is an obvious conclusion, perhaps with a touch of rhetorical flavor, as they are not really expecting the listener to disagree."},{"prompt":"本物やったら こんなところで 酒飲んでられるわけないわ","completion":"The sentence \\"本物やったら こんなところで 酒飲んでられるわけないわ\\" can be broken down and explained as follows: 本物 (ほんもの honmono) - This is a noun that means \\"real thing\\" or \\"genuine article.\\" It refers to something authentic or original (in contrast to a fake or a replica). やったら (yattara) - This is a conditional form of the verb \\"やる\\" (yaru), which in this context functions similarly to \\"する\\" (suru), meaning \\"to do.\\" The \\"たら\\" (tara) form is a conditional or \\"if\\" form, indicating that the content that follows is under the hypothetical condition specified. こんなところで (こんな ところ で konna tokoro de) - This phrase can be translated as \\"in a place like this\\" or \\"somewhere like here.\\" - こんな (konna) means \\"like this\\" or \\"such,\\" - ところ (tokoro) means \\"place\\" or \\"spot,\\" - で (de) is a particle indicating location or context for an action. 酒 (さけ sake) - This noun means \\"alcohol\\" or \\"liquor.\\" When combined with the verb \\"to drink,\\" it refers to the act of drinking alcohol. 飲んでられる (のんでられる nondeterareru) - This is the potential form of the verb \\"飲む\\" (nomu), \\"to drink,\\" combined with \\"られる\\" (rareru), which indicates potential or ability. In this context, \\"飲んでられる\\" means \\"can drink\\" or \\"to be able to drink.\\" わけない (わけ ない wake nai) - This phrase expresses that something is impossible or cannot be the case. - わけ (wake) means \\"reason\\" or \\"circumstance,\\" - ない (nai) is the negative form of the auxiliary verb \\"ある\\" (aru), meaning \\"to exist\\" or \\"to be.\\" It denotes the absence or impossibility of something. わ (wa) - This is a sentence-ending particle often used by female speakers to add emotional emphasis to a statement. When put together, \\"本物やったら こんなところで 酒飲んでられるわけないわ\\" can be translated as: \\"If it were the real thing, there's no way [someone/they/I] could be drinking alcohol in a place like this.\\" The sentence implies that if the subject (unspecified in this sentence but contextually understood) were genuinely a significant or important entity (e.g., a venerated person, a valuable object, etc.), they wouldn't be found in such an ordinary or unsuitable place engaging in an activity like drinking alcohol. The use of \\"わ\\" at the end of the sentence expresses the speaker's certainty or emphasis on the statement."},{"prompt":"どうしてだ","completion":"\\"どうしてだ\\" is a Japanese phrase that translates to \\"Why is that?\\" or simply \\"Why?\\" in English. Here is how it breaks down grammatically: どうして (dōshite): This is an interrogative adverb that means \\"why\\" or \\"for what reason.\\" It's used to ask about the cause or purpose of something. だ (da): This is the casual form of the copula verb \\"です\\" (desu), which in this context works similar to the English verb \\"to be.\\" It's used to assert or declare a state of being or a judgment. When used at the end of a sentence, \\"だ\\" is a plain, assertive, declarative ending for a statement. When combined, \\"どうしてだ\\" can be used in conversation when the speaker is inquiring about the reason behind a situation, action, or statement that was mentioned earlier in the conversation. This short form of question is typically used in casual or informal contexts and is a very direct way of asking for an explanation. For example, if someone said \\"I'm not going to the party,\\" you might respond with \\"どうしてだ?\\" to find out the specific reason they made that decision."},{"prompt":"本物やったら 今頃それどころやない","completion":"The sentence \\"本物やったら 今頃それどころやない\\" is a colloquial Japanese phrase that can be broken down and analyzed as follows: 本物 (ほんもの honmono) - This is a noun meaning \\"real thing\\" or \\"genuine article.\\" It is often used to indicate something authentic, as opposed to a fake or imitation. やったら (yattara) - This is the past conditional form of the verb \\"やる\\" (yaru), which can have a variety of meanings including \\"to do,\\" but in some contexts, it can function similarly to \\"to be\\" in English. The \\"たら\\" (tara) is a conditional (\\"if\\") form, so \\"やったら\\" indicates the condition, \\"if it were.\\" It's a hypothetical construction that sets up an \\"if\\" scenario. 今頃 (いまごろ imagoro) - This time expression means \\"about now\\" or \\"by this time.\\" It refers to the current period or moment in a general sense, rather than a specific point in time. それどころ (それどころ sore dokoro) - This is an idiomatic expression meaning \\"that's not the situation\\" or \\"that's not the case.\\" It implies that the current situation is not conducive to whatever \\"それ\\" refers to. The \\"それ\\" refers to the preceding context or situation already mentioned or understood by the speakers. やない (yanai) - This is the Kansai dialect equivalent of the standard Japanese negative verb ending \\"じゃない\\" (janai), meaning \\"is not\\" or \\"are not.\\" It negates whatever comes before it. When you put it all together, \\"本物やったら 今頃それどころやない\\" could translate to \\"If it were the real thing, we wouldn't be in this situation now,\\" or more colloquially, \\"If it were the real deal, we wouldn't be talking about this right now.\\" The phrase suggests that if the subject at hand were indeed genuine or significant, there would be much more pressing or serious matters to attend to, and the current conversation or activity would not be happening or would be irrelevant in comparison. The speaker implies that concerns would be different and that priorities would be elsewhere if the matter were as serious as the subject being authentic or important."},{"prompt":"explain それどころ","completion":"The expression \\"それどころ\\" (sore dokoro) is a common Japanese phrase that is used to indicate that the current situation or topic of discussion is not the main concern or priority given the circumstances. To break it down: それ (sore) - This is a pronoun that means \\"that\\" in English, and it refers to something mentioned previously or understood from the context. どころ (dokoro) - This is a noun that can mean \\"place\\" or \\"spot,\\" but when used in the expression \\"それどころ,\\" it doesn't refer to a physical location. Instead, どころ here is used in a figurative sense to indicate the state or condition that is being discussed or focused upon. When それ and どころ are paired together, the phrase essentially means \\"that's not the place for...,\\" \\"that's not the point...,\\" or \\"it's not the time for...\\" It is used to convey that given the present circumstances, the subject or issue being brought up isn't something that can be afforded attention to because it's overshadowed by something more pressing or important. For example, if someone is dealing with an emergency and another person starts talking about a minor problem, they might respond with \\"それどころじゃない\\" (sore dokoro janai) — \\"That's the least of my concerns right now\\" or \\"I'm not in a situation to deal with that\\" — to emphasize that the situation at hand demands full attention and takes precedence over other issues. In essence, \\"それどころ\\" is asserting that the present moment is not the right \\"place\\" or \\"occasion\\" for considering the matter alluded to by \\"それ.\\""},{"prompt":"必死こいて戦争の準備しとるはずや･･････","completion":"The sentence \\"必死こいて戦争の準備しとるはずや･･････\\" is a colloquial Japanese phrase that can be broken down as follows: 必死こいて (ひっしこいて hisshi koite) - This phrase consists of the word \\"必死\\" (hisshi), which means \\"desperate\\" or \\"frantic,\\" and \\"こいて\\" (koite), which is a colloquial form of the verb \\"頑張って\\" (ganbatte), meaning \\"doing one's best\\" or \\"striving hard.\\" The phrase \\"必死こいて\\" as a whole means \\"working desperately hard\\" or \\"striving with all one's might.\\" 戦争 (せんそう sensou) - This is a noun meaning \\"war.\\" の (no) - This is a possessive particle that connects nouns or a noun to a verb to indicate a relationship between the two. 準備 (じゅんび junbi) - Is a noun meaning \\"preparation.\\" しとる (しとる shitoru) - Is a colloquial contraction often used in Kansai dialect derived from \\"している\\" (shiteiru), the present continuous form of the verb \\"する\\" (suru), which means \\"to do.\\" It indicates an ongoing action or state and can also signify a habitual action. So \\"準備しとる\\" means \\"preparing\\" or \\"is preparing.\\" はず (はず hazu) - This noun is used to express expectation or assumption, meaning \\"supposed to\\" or \\"should.\\" や (や ya) - This is the Kansai dialect equivalent of the standard Japanese copula \\"だ\\" (da), used here to assert the statement. ･･････ - These dots represent an ellipsis, implying a pause or trailing off, suggesting the speaker is leaving the sentence or thought incomplete. The entire sentence \\"必死こいて戦争の準備しとるはずや･･････\\" would translate to something like \\"They must be desperately preparing for war...\\" in English. It suggests that the speaker believes, with a degree of certainty, that someone is fervently engaged in making preparations for war.

Он является примером динамического программирования и позволяет находить решение за время O(n), где n — размер массива. Принцип работы алгоритма Кадане можно описать следующим образом: 1. Инициализация двух переменных: \`max_so_far\` (максимальная сумма на данный момент) и \`max_ending_here\` (максимальная сумма, заканчивающаяся здесь). 2. Обе переменные изначально устанавливаются в значение первого элемента массива или в 0, если мы ищем непустую подпоследовательность. 3. Перебор массива от первого до последнего элемента: - Каждый элемент массива рассматривается как потенциальное увеличение текущей подпоследовательности. Для этого к значению \`max_ending_here\` прибавляется текущий элемент. - Если после прибавления текущего элемента значение \`max_ending_here\` становится меньше нуля (или 0, если ищем непустую подпоследовательность), то считаем его началом новой подпоследовательности, сбрасывая \`max_ending_here\` к 0 или к текущему элементу, если он положительный. - После каждого такого шага сравнить значение \`max_ending_here\` с \`max_so_far\` и, если первое оказывается больше, обновить \`max_so_far\`. 4. В результате \`max_so_far\` будет содержать максимальную подпоследовательную сумму в массиве. \`\`\`python def kadane_algorithm(nums): max_so_far = max_ending_here = nums[0] for x in nums[1:]: # Если предполагаем, что непустая подпоследовательность не может быть равной 0, используйте: # max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x) max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x) max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here) return max_so_far \`\`\` Вот пример работы алгоритма: Допустим, у нас есть массив \`[-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]\`. - При первом проходе, \`max_ending_here\` равно \`-2\`, \`max_so_far\` также равно \`-2\`. - Продолжая, \`max_ending_here\` станет \`-5\` (\`-3\` + \`-2\`), но \`max_so_far\` останется \`-2\`. - При следующем элементе \`4\`, \`max_ending_here\` обновится до \`4\` (поскольку \`4\` больше, чем \`-5 + 4\`), и \`max_so_far\` также станет \`4\`. - Следущие шаги принесут некоторые изменения \`max_ending_here\`, но принципиальный момент произойдет, когда мы достигнем последних элементов \`1\` и \`5\`. К этому времени \`max_ending_here\` обновится до \`7\` (\`1\` + \`5\` + предыдущие суммы), и поскольку это значение больше, чем текущее \`max_so_far\`, \`max_so_far\` тоже станет \`7\`. В результате, максимальная подпоследовательная сумма в приведенном массиве равна \`7\`, что соответствует подпоследовательности \`[4, -1, -2, 1, 5]\`."},{"prompt":"как проверить что подстрока строки s совпадает со строкой p","completion":"Чтобы проверить, совпадает ли подстрока строки \`s\` со строкой \`p\`, вы можете воспользоваться различными методами в зависимости от языка программирования.

This experience required a substantive understanding of the reporting obligations associated with regulatory compliance and a detail-oriented approach to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information provided to our clients and internal stakeholders. My exposure to the inner workings of reporting processes grew through the commissioning of subject matter experts and the direction of content which had direct implications on prudential reporting requirements. This work necessitated a comprehensive knowledge of the frameworks guiding capital adequacy, liquidity, and risk management, and how they are captured through COREP and FINREP reports. Furthermore, during my time at Thomas Philip Advocates & Solicitors, while the focus was predominantly on dispute resolution for legal matters, my exposure to corporate law equipped me with the skills to understand the nuances of financial data interpretation and the consequential reporting that feeds into prudential oversight.

In each of these capacities, I consistently provided insights to internal teams regarding compliance status and reporting, fostering transparent communication channels and enabling informed decision-making processes.

As we go through this process, you might want to further develop various aspects of the story, including character depth, scene descriptions, dialogues, and the overarching narrative arc. Here's the beginning of your novel, \\"The Quest for Meaning\\": --- Chapter 1: Whispers of Dilivila April showers were not so much a gentle caress as a monotonous drizzle in the town of Dilivila. It was the kind of rain that seemed to wash everything to a muted grey, blending the present with the past in a veil of mist. Wrapped in this soft cloak, the outskirts of the town whispered of simpler times, of lives quietly unfurling in the rhythm of nature. In one of these humble abodes, amidst the verdant embrace of an awakening spring, Kintu made his first cry. It was a sound that sliced through the mundane ambiance of the town, heralding the arrival of a soul that would one day seek answers to the most profound of questions. Born on an obscure date in April 1982, his entrance into the world was marked by the bloom of wildflowers and the song of returning swallows. His parents, though burdened with the weight of financial constraints, were abundant in love and dreams. His mother's lullabies were rich with hope, and his father's tales were brimming with the promise of tomorrow. In such a home, Kintu's childhood unfurled—beautiful and serene on the surface, a dream lived in the pliant shadows of the lower middle class. Despite the scarcity of luxury and the sparseness of their dwelling, laughter was never in short supply, and joy was a frequent visitor. Dilivila, although no metropolis, was a tapestry of community, each thread woven with the essence of togetherness, each pattern revealing the intricacy of shared lives. Yet as Kintu grew, something within him held him back. The boy was a symphony of silence amidst a society of songs. His shyness was an invisible cloak that masked his potential, his reluctance to engage with others forming barriers where there should have been bridges. But in the realm of academia, his brilliance shone like a lone star in the firmament of mediocrity. It was his one true escape, a space where he could assert his presence without uttering a word. This delicate balance of solitude and success was to change with the introduction of Chinmoyee. She arrived in his life as innocently as a summer breeze, becoming his friend, his playmate, an anchor in the uncertain storm of childhood. Together they explored the nooks and crannies of Dilivila, their laughter echoing through the streets, their whispers merging with the rustle of leaves. And then time, the ever-implacable force, swept Chinmoyee into a new chapter. Her absence left a void in Kintu's world, one filled with the smoky tendrils of adolescent rebellion and ill-advised friendships. Underneath the facade of momentary thrill that came with these newfound bonds, lay a corrosive force, eating away at the foundations of Kintu's academic pursuits. As the years advanced, so too did the sense of loss—the joy depleting from his life like the light at dusk. The once bright promise of youth became a shadow, hiding in the recesses of his heart. When a government job later anchored him to the semblance of stability, it was as if Kintu had woken from a dream, only to find that the dawn of reality brought no solace. His search for meaning had yet to begin, but the canvas of his existence was already streaked with the somber hues of melancholy. Kintu's quest was not for gold, not for love, nor for the ephemeral wisps of fame—it was for that elusive joy, the joy that once danced in the eyes of a child amidst the bounties of Dilivila. --- Feel free to take this section as a template or inspiration to further develop your novel.

Гоголя \\"Шинель\\" до 2850 символов: \\"В департаменте… но лучше не называть, в каком департаменте. Ничего нет сердитее всякого рода департаментов, полков, канцелярий и, словом, всякого рода должностных сословий. Теперь уже всякий частный человек считает в лице своем оскорбленным все общество. Говорят, весьма недавно поступила просьба от одного капитан-исправника, не помню какого-то города, в которой он излагает ясно, что гибнут государственные постановления и что священное имя его произносится решительно всуе. А в доказательство приложил к просьбе преогромнейший том какого-то романтического сочинения, где чрез каждые десять страниц является капитан-исправник, местами даже совершенно в пьяном виде. Итак, во избежание всяких неприятностей, лучше департамент, о котором идет дело, мы назовем одним департаментом. Итак, в одном департаменте служил один чиновник; чиновник нельзя сказать чтобы очень замечательный, низенького роста, несколько рябоват, несколько рыжеват, несколько даже на вид подслеповат, с небольшой лысиной на лбу, с морщинами по обеим сторонам щек и цветом лица что называется геморроидальным… Что ж делать! виноват петербургский климат. Что касается до чина (ибо у нас прежде всего нужно объявить чин), то он был то, что называют вечный титулярный советник, над которым, как известно, натрунились и наострились вдоволь разные писатели, имеющие похвальное обыкновенье налегать на тех, которые не могут кусаться. Фамилия чиновника была Башмачкин. Уже по самому имени видно, что она когда-то произошла от башмака; но когда, в какое время и каким образом произошла она от башмака, ничего этого не известно. И отец, и дед, и даже шурин, и все совершенно Башмачкины ходили в сапогах, переменяя только раза три в год подметки. Имя его было Акакий Акакиевич. Может быть, читателю оно покажется несколько странным и выисканным, но можно уверить, что его никак не искали, а что сами собою случились такие обстоятельства, что никак нельзя было дать другого имени, и это произошло именно вот как. Родился Акакий Акакиевич против ночи, если только не изменяет память, на 23 марта. Покойница матушка, чиновница и очень хорошая женщина, расположилась, как следует, окрестить ребенка. Матушка еще лежала на кровати против дверей, а а по правую руку стоял кум, превосходнейший человек, Иван Иванович Ерошкин, служивший столоначальником в сенате, и кума, жена квартального офицера, женщина редких добродетелей, Арина Семеновна Белобрюшкова. Родильнице предоставили на выбор любое из трех, какое она хочет выбрать: Моккия, Соссия, или назвать ребенка во имя мученика Хоздазата. «Нет, — подумала покойница, — имена-то все такие». Чтобы угодить ей, развернули календарь в другом месте; вышли опять три имени: Трифилий, Дула и Варахасий. «Вот это наказание, — проговорила старуха, — какие всё имена; я, право, никогда и не слыхивала таких. Пусть бы еще Варадат или Варух, а то Трифилий и Варахасий». Еще переворотили страницу — вышли: Павсикахий и Вахтисий. «Ну, уж я вижу, — сказала старуха, — что, видно, его такая судьба. Уж если так, пусть лучше будет он называться, как и отец его. Отец был Акакий, так пусть и сын будет Акакий». Таким образом и произошел Акакий Акакиевич. Ребенка окрестили, причем он заплакал и сделал такую гримасу, как будто бы предчувствовал, что будет титулярный советник. Итак, вот каким образом произошло все это. Мы привели потому это, чтобы читатель мог сам видеть, что это случилось совершенно по необходимости и другого имени дать было никак невозможно. Когда и в какое время он поступил в департамент и кто определил его, этого никто не мог припомнить. Сколько не переменялось директоров и всяких начальников, его видели все на одном и том же месте, в том же положении, в той же самой должности, тем же чиновником для письма, так что потом уверились, что он, видно, так и родился на свет уже совершенно готовым, в вицмундире и с лысиной на голове. В департаменте не оказывалось к нему никакого уважения. Сторожа не только не вставали с мест, когда он проходил, но даже не глядели на него, как будто бы через приемную пролетела простая муха. Начальники поступали с ним как-то холодно-деспотически. Какой-нибудь помощник столоначальника прямо совал ему под нос бумаги, не сказав даже «перепишите», или «вот интересное, хорошенькое дельце», или что-нибудь приятное, как употребляется в благовоспитанных службах. И он брал, посмотрев только на бумагу, не глядя, кто ему подложил и имел ли на то право. Он брал и тут же пристраивался писать ее. Молодые чиновники подсмеивались и острились над ним, во сколько хватало канцелярского остроумия, рассказывали тут же пред ним разные составленные про него истории; про его хозяйку, семидесятилетнюю старуху, говорили, что она бьет его, спрашивали, когда будет их свадьба, сыпали на голову ему бумажки, называя это снегом. Но ни одного слова не отвечал на это Акакий Акакиевич, как будто бы никого и не было перед ним; это не имело даже влияния на занятия его: среди всех этих докук он не делал ни одной ошибки в письме. Только если уж слишком была невыносима шутка, когда толкали его под руку, мешая заниматься своим делом, он произносил: «Оставьте меня, зачем вы меня обижаете?» И что-то странное заключалось в словах и в голосе, с каким они были произнесены. В нем слышалось что-то такое преклоняющее на жалость, что один молодой человек, недавно определившийся, который, по примеру других, позволил было себе посмеяться над ним, вдруг остановился, как будто пронзенный, и с тех пор как будто все переменилось перед ним и показалось в другом виде. Какая-то неестественная сила оттолкнула его от товарищей, с которыми он познакомился, приняв их за приличных, светских людей. И долго потом, среди самых веселых минут, представлялся ему низенький чиновник с лысинкою на лбу, с своими проникающими словами: «Оставьте меня, зачем вы меня обижаете?» — и в этих проникающих словах эвенели другие слова: «Я брат твой». И закрывал себя рукою бедный молодой человек, и много раз содрогался он потом на веку своем, видя, как много в человеке бесчеловечья, как много скрыто свирепой грубости в утонченной, образованной светскости, и, боже! даже в том человеке, которого свет признает благородным и честным…\\"","completion":"В одном департаменте служил чиновник Акакий Акакиевич Башмачкин, низенький, рябоватый, с лысиной и геморроидальным цветом лица. Он был вечный титулярный советник, не вызывающий уважения у коллег. К своей фамилии, образованной от слова «башмак», Акакий Акакиевич пришёл благодаря обстоятельствам, когда при крещении из всех предложенных имен не нашлось более подходящего, чем имя отца. В департаменте к нему относились безразлично: сторожа не замечали его, начальники вели себя холодно, помощники без уважения подавали ему бумаги на работу.

Но Акакий Акакиевич не реагировал на дразнилки, продолжая работать без ошибок, только иногда мягко просил их перестать его обижать.

Ruth (16); David’s sister; looks up to David, but also loves annoying him. Aimee (16); Ruth’s friend; no-one knows that she has been researching hypnosis techniques & is an expert. The food-court at the crappy shopping-centre, Friday afternoon. Script written by an expert in street hypnosis and confusion inductions. In which Aimee puts David into a deep trance, giving him suggestions that he belongs on the floor, at her feet.","completion":"As an AI, I must inform you that it’s important to approach this with caution and with all parties consenting. Hypnosis should always be conducted in a manner that's respectful and consensual for all involved. If it's for fictional or entertainment purposes, ensure it's clear that it's part of a voluntary performance. Here is a hypothetical, fictional script for the scenario provided: INT. FOOD-COURT - DAY David and Ruth are sitting at a table. Aimee joins them, carrying her tray of food. Behind the dull rumble of chattering shoppers and clinking cutlery, Aimee’s calm confidence stands out. David eyes Aimee with thinly veiled disdain. DAVID (scoffing) What do you see in this place, Aimee? It's the epitome of 'common.' RUTH (grinning at David's pompousness) Come on, David. It's not that bad. Plus, the food is cheap! Aimee sits and unwraps her burger, eyeing David thoughtfully. A slow smile spreads across her face. AIMEE You know, David, I've been reading about how our environments shape us, how we learn to feel so in place in them, or so out of place... like your feelings toward this food court. David rolls his eyes, but there's curiosity in his glance. DAVID (with mock interest) Oh, and what's your expert opinion? Aimee leans in, putting her elbows on the table, her gaze hypnotic and voice smooth like velvet. AIMEE (speaking slowly) Imagine for a moment, that this very table, these chairs, represent your reality, your comfort zone. The floor, however... The floor is unfamiliar, chaotic, unknown. But what if I told you that you've got it reversed, David? What if the floor, right there at my feet, is where you truly belong? David chuckles uncomfortably, a strange sense of unease crawling up his spine. DAVID Ha, wouldn't that be something? Ruth watches with bated breath as Aimee reaches out, touching David’s hand lightly. From her touch, a wave of calmness spreads over David. AIMEE (close to whispering) Actually, it's easy to feel that shift. Your mind is powerful. Just focus on my voice, feel the safety and certainty that it's actually the floor that's familiar, stable, grounding you. Can you feel the pull, David? David's brow furrows; he's listening, entranced by Aimee’s voice, despite himself. DAVID (softly) I... Maybe. It’s ridiculous, but... AIMEE (intently) Not ridiculous. It's your mind opening up to possibilities. Why don't you try it? Feel yourself belong down there, the gravity of your true place gently calling you. David blinks, his body leaning forward slightly as if a magnetic force beckons him downward. RUTH (slightly anxious but intrigued) David, are you okay? David doesn’t respond. His gaze is locked on Aimee, who now speaks with an unwavering tone. AIMEE (hypnotically) Down, down, David. It's where you're meant to be. Right here, at my feet. You’ll feel a sense of relief you’ve never known once you accept your place. Silently, as if compelled by an invisible force, David slides off his chair. He finds himself on his knees on the floor, looking up at Aimee with confused awe. People nearby begin noticing the odd scene. RUTH (shocked) David! AIMEE (reassuringly to Ruth) It's fine, he’s discovering something about himself. And David, when I snap my fingers, you'll come back feeling refreshed, and you won't feel out of place anymore. Aimee snaps her fingers. David blinks rapidly, shaking his head, and then looks around, puzzled by his own position on the floor. He gets up, dusting himself off, a sheepish smile replacing his usual arrogance. DAVID (disoriented) What was I...? RUTH (giggling) Looks like you found your place, huh? AIMEE (winking at Ruth) It's all about perspective, David. David, oddly humbled, sits back in his chair. He looks at Aimee with a newfound respect as the hum of the mall swallows the moment.

shapes\`: This error is due to a mismatch in dimensions or shapes of the tensors (arrays, matrices, etc.) you're trying to combine using the dot product. In Mathematica, the \`Dot\` operator is used to take dot products of vectors, matrix multiplication, and more generally, tensor contraction. The \`{0.299,0.587,0.114}\` vector seems to be designed for converting RGB to grayscale, but it cannot be directly applied to the given structure, likely due to it either not being a matrix or because the dimensions don't line up properly for a dot product. 2. \`ImageData::imgdargs: -- Message text not found -- (CurlyDoubleQuote[Byte])\`: This error suggests that there's an issue with \`ImageData\` arguments or the data you're passing to \`ImageData\`. It seems like there's some sort of malformed input or typo. From the context given, it looks like you're dealing with a Mathematica code that is trying to extract bits from an image possibly hidden through steganography. The errors you're encountering could be caused by any number of issues in your code, such as incorrect variable names (e.g., \`stegoblok\` instead of \`stegoBlocks\`), malformed function definitions, or inappropriate use of \`ImageData\`. To proceed, here are some steps you might take: - Ensure that the \`stegoBlocks\` or \`stegoblok\` (check the correct variable name) is correctly formatted as a list of lists, where each sublist represents an image block or a list of pixel values. - Review the definition of \`DataFromBlock\` function to make sure it's returning data in the expected format, compatible for further operations. - Confirm that \`mask\`, \`inverseMask\`, and \`coefficients\` arguments are correctly defined and passed to \`DataFromBlock\`. - Finally, when using \`Dot\` to convert RGB to grayscale, you need to apply it to each RGB pixel vector. Check if there's a need to map or apply the dot product to each pixel inside the blocks.

These are passed as an argument to the function \`embedDataInBlock\`. 2. \`targetBit\`: This represents the bit you want to embed into the image block. It's used to determine how to modify the luminance of the block. 3. \`mask\` and \`inverseMask\`: These are matrices generated outside the function used to separate the image block into two parts — one part that will be modified (according to \`mask\`) and another that won't (according to \`inverseMask\`). 4. \`coefficients\`: The RGB to grayscale conversion coefficients, based on the luminosity method. They're applied to calculate the luminance of the masked regions. 5. \`alpha\`: A threshold value that defines how much the luminance can be altered. It's specified outside the function and passed as an argument. 6. \`cvzLength\` and \`cvzIndex\`: Those seem to be related to a \\"carrier zone\\" or similar concept for the data being embedded. \`cvzLength\` might represent the total length of the data to embed, and \`cvzIndex\` a current position within that data. However, they are not directly used in the function you posted. Inside the function \`embedDataInBlock\`, the following operations occur: - \`ImageData[blocks, \\"Byte\\"]\` extracts pixel data from the image blocks. - The \`mask\` and \`inverseMask\` are applied to \`pixelData\` to create \`flatMaskedBlock\` and \`flatInvMaskedBlock\`, which contain the masked portions of the original image block. - The luminance of the masked regions (\`lumMasked\` and \`lumInvMasked\`) is calculated using \`Dot\` with the \`coefficients\`. - The luminance difference is used along with the \`targetBit\` and \`alpha\` to determine if and how much the image block's luminance should be modified to embed the bit. - If the luminance needs to be modified (\`modifiedLum\` is not \`Null\`), an array \`modArray\` based on the \`inverseMask\` is created and added to \`pixelData\`. - The modified image data \`pixelData\` is used to create a new image block with the bit embedded, ensuring the pixel values remain within the valid range using \`Clip\` and \`Round\`. In conclusion, the function \`embedDataInBlock\` takes an \`8x8\` block from the original image (\`blocks\`), a target bit (\`targetBit\`), masks (\`mask\` and \`inverseMask\`), grayscale conversion coefficients (\`coefficients\`), and an alpha value defining the embedding strength (\`alpha\`). It modifies the luminance values to embed the target bit into the block and returns the stego image block.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the function works: 1. \`Module[{pos}, ...]\`: This is wrapping the code inside a \`Module\`, which is used in Mathematica to create localized variables. In this case, \`pos\` is a local variable that will hold the positions where the stop pattern is found in the sequence. 2. \`pos = Position[Partition[sequence, Length[stopPattern], 1], stopPattern];\`: This line does a few things: - \`Partition[sequence, Length[stopPattern], 1]\`: The \`Partition\` function is taking the \`sequence\` and breaking it into sublists, each of the same length as \`stopPattern\`. The third argument, \`1\`, defines the step size, meaning that \`Partition\` will slide over the sequence one element at a time. - \`Position[..., stopPattern]\`: \`Position\` is then used to find where in this list of sublists the \`stopPattern\` occurs. It will return a list of positions indicating where matches are found. 3. \`If[Length[pos] > 0, Take[sequence, First[First[pos]] - 1], ...]\`: This \`If\` statement is checking if the \`pos\` list has any elements—if any matches of the stop pattern were found. - If \`Length[pos] > 0\`, this means that the \`stopPattern\` was found, and \`Take[sequence, First[First[pos]] - 1]\` will take elements from the sequence up to the point just before where the \`stopPattern\` starts. - \`First[First[pos]]\`: Since \`pos\` is a list of positions and these positions are themselves lists (since \`Position\` can return positions in nested lists), you need to use \`First\` twice to get the actual position number. 4. \`Print[\\"Стоп-сигнал не найден.\\"]; sequence\`: If the stop pattern is not found (\`Length[pos] == 0\`), a message is printed indicating that the stop pattern was not detected, and the entire \`sequence\` is returned unchanged. In summary, \`splitCVZ\` looks for a specific pattern within a list of data. If it finds the pattern, it returns a new list that contains the sequence up to the point just before the pattern. If the pattern is not found, it prints a message to the user and returns the original sequence. The name \`splitCVZ\` and the usage of the terms like \\"Стоп-сигнал\\" (stop signal) suggest that this function could be part of a larger cryptographic or data transmission system where messages are split based on defined stop signals, but without more context, this is just a hypothesis."},{"prompt":"Do[If[cvzIndex <= Length[CVZ], stegoBlocks[[i, j]] = embedDataInBlock[stegoBlocks[[i, j]], CVZ[[cvzIndex]], mask, inverseMask, coefficients, alpha]; cvzIndex++;], {i, Length[stegoBlocks[[All, 1]]]}, {j, Length[stegoBlocks[[1, All]]]}]; stegoImage1 = ImageAssemble[stegoBlocks]; ImageAssemble::imginv: Expecting an image or graphics instead of Image[Clip[{<<1>>},{0,255}],Byte]. >> обьясни почему ошибка","completion":"The error message \`ImageAssemble::imginv: Expecting an image or graphics instead of Image[Clip[{<<1>>},{0,255}],Byte]. >>\` suggests that the \`ImageAssemble\` function is being passed something other than images or graphics objects to assemble into a larger image. Specifically, it seems to be getting an incorrect expression involving \`Image[Clip[{<<1>>},{0,255}],Byte]\`. The most likely source of this error is within the \`embedDataInBlock\` function. When you updated stegoBlocks using the line \`\`\`mathematica stegoBlocks[[i, j]] = embedDataInBlock[stegoBlocks[[i, j]], CVZ[[cvzIndex]], mask, inverseMask, coefficients, alpha]; \`\`\` it implies that \`embedDataInBlock\` should return an \`Image\` object that can be used by \`ImageAssemble\` later on. However, the error message indicates that perhaps \`embedDataInBlock\` is returning an expression that \`ImageAssemble\` can't interpret as an image. There are a few potential reasons for this: 1. If the \`modArray\` within \`embedDataInBlock\` is being assigned an expression involving \`Image\` directly (as opposed to image data), this could be problematic. \`Image[Clip[...]]\` should function correctly as long as the expression inside \`Clip\` evaluates to an actual numerical array of image data with dimensions that correspond to the original block size. 2. If \`embedDataInBlock\` returns a result that is not correctly formatted as an \`Image\` object due to an error or mishap in the internal calculations, you would also get this type of error. 3. If there's an unexpected input or failure within \`embedDataInBlock\` that causes \`pixelData\` not to be a proper array of pixel values before being passed to \`Image\`, you might get an object that is not a valid image. To troubleshoot this error, you can start by inspecting the output of \`embedDataInBlock\` outside of the loop to ensure it indeed returns a proper \`Image\` object. For example, try something like this with a small test snippet: \`\`\`mathematica testBlock = stegoBlocks[[1,1]]; testBit = CVZ[[1]]; testEmbedResult = embedDataInBlock[testBlock, testBit, mask, inverseMask, coefficients, alpha]; \`\`\` Then check the output: \`\`\`mathematica Head[testEmbedResult] \`\`\` If \`Head[testEmbedResult]\` does not return \`Image\`, then there's something wrong with how the \`embedDataInBlock\` function is constructing the image. Once \`embedDataInBlock\` is verified to be returning proper images, the \`ImageAssemble\` should work without error."},{"prompt":"сделай извлечение по размеру CVZ на wolfram 9","completion":"Assuming you want to extract data embedded in an image which uses a size encoding technique similar to the one presented in the previous messages, here's a basic outline of how one could approach the data extraction based on the size of the encoded data (CVZ) in Wolfram Language (Mathematica 9): \`\`\`mathematica (* Define your masks, coefficients, and alpha, analogous to how it was done when embedding data *) mask = ...; (* Define mask here *) inverseMask = 1 - mask; coefficients = {0.299, 0.587, 0.114}; (* Coefficients for grayscale conversion *) alpha = 100; (* alpha value from embed function *) (* Assuming stegoImage is your image with embedded data *) (* Partition the image into blocks *) stegoBlocks = ImagePartition[stegoImage, {8, 8}]; (* Initialize an empty list to store extracted bits *) extractedBits = {}; (* Define a function to extract data from a block, analogous to embedDataInBlock *) extractDataFromBlock[block_Image, mask_, inverseMask_, coefficients_] := Module[ {pixelData, flatMaskedBlock, flatInvMaskedBlock, lumMasked, lumInvMasked}, (* Get the image data *) pixelData = ImageData[block, \\"Byte\\"]; (* Flatten the masked regions *) flatMaskedBlock = Flatten[pixelData*mask, 1]; flatInvMaskedBlock = Flatten[pixelData*inverseMask, 1]; (* Calculate the luminance of each region *) lumMasked = Mean[Dot[flatMaskedBlock, coefficients]]; lumInvMasked = Mean[Dot[flatInvMaskedBlock, coefficients]]; (* Return 1 if the luminance difference exceeds alpha, 0 otherwise *) If[lumInvMasked - lumMasked > alpha, 1, 0] ]; (* Extract the data bit by bit *) Do[ AppendTo[extractedBits, extractDataFromBlock[block, mask, inverseMask, coefficients]], {block, Flatten[stegoBlocks]} ]; (* Use only as many bits as the length of CVZ indicates *) extractedCVZ = Take[extractedBits, Length[CVZ]]; (* Now, convert the binary sequence into the payload *) (* This may involve converting binary to characters or to other data types, depending on how CVZ was encoded *) (* Your conversion code here *) \`\`\` This example assumes the message is encoded bit by bit in each 8x8 block and that the lumInvMasked should be greater than lumMasked by a threshold of \`alpha\` to represent a bit with the value of 1.

Let's analyze the differences: **First Snippet:** This code reads data from image blocks and attempts to detect a stop signal contained within the extracted data. 1. \`extractedBits\` is populated using a \`Do\` loop that iterates first over the second dimension (j) and then over the first dimension (i) of \`stegoBlocks\`. Each bit is extracted and appended to the \`extractedBits\` list with \`extractDataFromBlock\`. 2. The \`splitCVZ\` function is used to find and remove the stop signal from \`extractedBits\`. If the stop signal is found it takes all bits up to that point; if not, it prints a message and returns the whole sequence. 3. The data in \`actualCVZ\` is partitioned into groups of 8 bits (bytes). This assumes the data is binary and can be represented as a sequence of bytes. 4. These bytes are then converted into decimal with \`FromDigits\`. 5. \`FromCharacterCode\` converts the byte values into a text string with a specified character set, \\"MacintoshCyrillic\\". 6. The text is then printed out using \`Print\`. **Second Snippet (with corrections to match the pattern):** This seems like an incomplete or incorrect attempt at a similar process and has some issues: 1. \`Bits\` is populated in a similar way, but now the iteration order has changed; it iterates over the first dimension first (i) and then over the second dimension (j) which is the usual convention for reading raster data like images. 2. A function called \`DataFromBlock\` is used, which, based on the context, seems to be equivalent to \`extractDataFromBlock\` from the first snippet. The actual definition is not provided, so it's unclear what it does exactly. We are assuming it is supposed to extract individual bits from a block of the image like \`extractDataFromBlock\`. 3. The \`Take\` function is used to extract a portion of \`Bits\` equivalent to the length of \`CVZ\`. This presumes that the number of embedded bits is exactly as long as \`CVZ\`. There is no handling of a stop signal in this snippet. 4. There is no conversion from binary to decimal or text decoding in this second snippet, so it's not apparent how the bits in \`extractedCVZ\` would be used. 5. The variable name \`stegoblok\` seems to be a typo and should be \`stegoBlocks\`. The first snippet is a complete process for extracting, splitting at the stop signal, and decoding an embedded message from \`stegoBlocks\`. The second seems like an early or partial implementation that requires finishing to function similarly. The main differences are: - Ordering of loops (which may affect the order in which bits are read and stored). - In the first snippet, \`splitCVZ\` checks for a stop signal, whereas the second snippet does not. - Misaligned variable names indicate possible typos in the second snippet. - Lack of character decoding in the second snippet. - The use of \`Take\` in the second snippet assumes data fits exactly within \`Bits\`, while the first dynamically locates the stop signal to dictate the length."},{"prompt":"исправь 2 код что бы он работал правильно","completion":"To correct the second code snippet so that it works like the first one, we need to follow a few steps to ensure that it extracts the data from the stego image blocks, checks for the presence of a stop signal, and then decodes the data similarly to the first snippet.

If \`Length[CVZ]\` is not a multiple of 8, the last group of bits will be smaller than 8 bits. The \`Partition\` function is instructed to ignore these bits (truncate them), ensuring that only complete bytes are processed, assuming that meaningful data fits into whole bytes. Now, the second snippet relies on the length of \`CVZ\` to extract and decode only the relevant number of bits, effectively dropping the search for a stop signal.

Как правило, это происходит, когда вы пытаетесь выполнить операцию между матрицами, векторами или списками, размерности которых не соответствуют друг другу. Рассмотрим код: \`\`\`mathematica Do[AppendTo[Bits, DataFromBlock[stegoblock[[i, j]], mask, inverseMask, coefficients]], {i, Length[stegoblock]}, {j, Length[stegoblock[[1]]]}]; \`\`\` Этот фрагмент кода делает следующее: 1.

Ошибки в коде могут быть: - Ошибка \`Tensors ... have incompatible shapes\` указывает на проблему в функции \`DataFromBlock\` или в операции, которая происходит внутри этой функции, чаще всего связанную с расчетом светимости или другими операциями, которые требуют точного соответствия формы данных. - \`stegoblock\` должно быть \`stegoBlocks\`, при условии, что в остальной части кода используется имя переменной \`stegoBlocks\` (регистр букв имеет значение). Давайте попробуем исправить код: Во-первых, необходимо убедиться, что функция \`DataFromBlock\` правильно обрабатывает данные изображения и что она предназначена для работы именно с блоками в формате, который вы получате из \`stegoBlocks\`. Вам также потребуется определить функцию \`DataFromBlock\`. Если эта функция предназначена для обработки данных изображений и возвращает определенные выходные данные (например, биты данных), то ей нужно убедиться, что аргументы, предоставленные функции, имеют правильную форму. Операция \`Dot\` внутри \`DataFromBlock\` должна работать с векторами или матрицами, размерности которых подходят для выполнения скалярного произведения. Если функция \`DataFromBlock\` рассчитана на использование \`ImageData\` для обработки блока изображения, ей необходимо передать массив цветовых значений в правильном формате. Сообщения об ошибках говорят нам о том, что функция \`ImageData\` получает нечто, что она не может интерпретировать как изображение, и в результате возникает ошибка при попытке выполнить операцию \`Dot\`. \`\`\`mathematica Do[ AppendTo[Bits, DataFromBlock[ImageData[stegoBlocks[[i, j]], \\"Byte\\"], mask, inverseMask, coefficients] ], {i, Length[stegoBlocks]}, {j, Length[stegoBlocks[[1]]]} ]; \`\`\` В расширенном вызове \`DataFromBlock\` мы используем \`ImageData[stegoBlocks[[i, j]], \\"Byte\\"]\` для извлечения данных изображения как массива байтов из каждого блока, что предположительно будет совместимо с тем, что ожидает функция.

Сколько раз p встречается в s как подстрока? Важное дополнение: строка s — не простая, а циклическая. Циклическую строку можно представить себе так: запишем её на бумажной ленте, после чего склеим концы ленты так, чтобы после последней буквы s следовала первая её буква. Пусть s — циклическая строка из n букв, а p — обычная строка из k букв. Определим формально, сколько раз p встречается в s. Для каждого i = 1, 2, . . . , n начнём с i-й буквы строки s и прочитаем ровно k букв циклической строки. Если получилась в точности строка p — будем говорить, что она встречается в s как подстрока, начиная с i-й буквы. Количество таких i — это и есть количество вхождений p в s. Формат входных данных В первой строке задана циклическая строка s, а во второй — обычная строка p. Обе строки состоят из маленьких английских букв и имеют длину от 1 до 106 символов. Формат выходных данных Выведите одно целое число: сколько раз p встречается в циклической строке s как подстрока.","completion":"Чтобы решить задачу, мы можем воспользоваться следующим подходом: 1. Создаем расширенную версию строки \`s\`, склеив две её копии вместе. Для циклической строки это имитирует переход от конца к началу строки. Например, если \`s = \\"abc\\"\` и длина \`p\` равна \`k = 2\`, то удвоенная строка будет \`s + s = \\"abcabc\\"\`. Это позволит обнаруживать вхождения \`p\`, которые пересекают начальную и конечную точку циклической строки. 2. Ищем вхождения подстроки \`p\` в удвоенной строке \`s + s\` начиная с позиций от \`0\` до \`len(s) - 1\` включительно. 3. Считаем количество вхождений. Вот пример реализации на Python: \`\`\`python def find_occurrences(s, p): # Создаем удвоенную версию строки s для имитации цикличности extended_s = s + s # Вычисляем длину исходной строки s s_length = len(s) # Вычисляем длину искомой подстроки p p_length = len(p) # Инициализируем счетчик вхождений count = 0 # Проходим по строке s от начала до конца, не включая переход через склеенную часть for i in range(s_length): # Берем подстроку из удвоенной строки начиная с i и длиной p substring = extended_s[i:i+p_length] # Проверяем, равна ли она строке p if substring == p: # Увеличиваем счетчик count += 1 # Возвращаем итоговое количество вхождений return count # Чтение входных данных s = input() # циклическая строка s p = input() # строка p, которую нужно найти # Вывод количества вхождений p в s print(find_occurrences(s, p)) \`\`\` Выполнение этого кода позволяет ответить на вопрос задачи, используя основной алгоритм прямого поиска подстроки. Однако, для больших строк можно использовать более сложные алгоритмы, такие как Кнута-Морриса-Пратта или Бойера-Мура, чтобы ускорить процесс поиска."},{"prompt":"Мне нужен максимально быстрый процесс поиска и код на C++","completion":"Для максимально быстрого поиска подстрок в строке на C++, мы можем использовать алгоритм Кнута-Морриса-Пратта (KMP), который избегает лишних сравнений символов. Прежде чем привести код, немного о алгоритме: Алгоритм KMP предварительно обрабатывает искомую строку \`p\`, чтобы создать массив префиксов, который позволяет при несовпадении символов переходить на место в строке \`p\`, минимизируя количество символов, которые необходимо снова проверять. Вот пример реализации на C++: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <string> std::vector<int> buildKMPTable(const std::string &p) { int m = p.size(); std::vector<int> table(m + 1); int i = 0, j = -1; table[i] = j; while (i < m) { while (j >= 0 && p[i] != p[j]) j = table[j]; i++; j++; table[i] = j; } return table; } // Функция поиска подстроки \`p\` в строке \`s\` с использованием алгоритма KMP int KMP(const std::string &s, const std::string &p){ int n = s.size(); int m = p.size(); std::vector<int> table = buildKMPTable(p); int count = 0; std::string extended_s = s + s.substr(0, m - 1); int i = 0, j = 0; while (i < 2 * n - m + 1) { while (j >= 0 && extended_s[i] != p[j]) j = table[j]; i++; j++; // Полное совпадение найдено, увеличиваем счетчик if (j == m) { count++; j = table[j]; // Важно учитывать только вхождения, начинающиеся в первой строке s if (i - j >= n) break; } } return count; } int main() { std::string s, p; // Чтение входных данных std::cin >> s >> p; // Вывод количества вхождений p в циклическую строку s std::cout << KMP(s, p) << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` Код сначала строит таблицу префиксов для искомой строки \`p\`, затем применяет алгоритм KMP для поиска подстроки \`p\` в расширенной версии циклической строки \`s\`. У компилятора C++ также есть стандартные функции для работы со строками, такие как \`find\`, но они обычно не оптимизированы для циклических строк, в отличие от специально написанной реализации KMP."},{"prompt":"David (21); university student; thinks his sister’s friends are ‘common’.

SHOPPING CENTRE FOOD COURT - DAY** *Brightly lit, the hustle and bustle of the food court provides a stark contrast to the quiet intensity that is about to unfold. DAVID, a confident university student, sits across from his younger sister RUTH and her friend AIMEE, whose unassuming demeanor conceals her hypnotic expertise.* *David sips his iced coffee, while absentmindedly scrolling through his phone. Ruth is trying to get his attention by poking fun at his 'snobbish' taste in friends, but Aimee watches keenly, her smooth smile belying an impish plan.* RUTH: (roguishly) David, you're so picky! Come on, we're not all that 'common,' you know. DAVID: (glancing up, half-amused) I never said ‘common,’ Ruth. Just... different. *Aimee leans forward, resting her chin in her hand, feigning nonchalance. She locks eyes with David, a glint of mischief in her gaze.* AIMEE: (playfully) David, what do you think of hypnosis? Just a parlor trick? DAVID: (dismissive) I guess. It’s all smoke and mirrors. Plus, it wouldn't work on me. *Aimee lets out a soft laugh, a challenge in her voice.* AIMEE: (cheerfully) Would you bet on that? *David chuckles, oblivious to the trap being set.* DAVID: Sure, why not? Entertain us, Hypnotist Aimee. *Aimee sits up, brushes a strand of hair behind her ear, and smiles sweetly.* AIMEE: Let's play a game, David. It's called the 'hand drop.' Super simple.

Maybe you're not so different from us 'common' folks, huh? *Ruth giggles as David’s hand touches the table and he stares at it, bewildered.* AIMEE: (softly, but with authority) Sleep now. *David's eyelids flutter, and with a look of total surprise, he slumps forward slightly, his eyes closing, his body relaxing, as he falls into a deep trance.* RUTH: (in awe) Is he...? AIMEE: (jubilantly) Out like a light. Now watch this... *Aimee stands up and steps beside David, looking down at him.* AIMEE: (softly to David) Listen carefully. When you wake up, you're going to feel a strong desire to sit on the floor. Right at my feet—where you apparently believe us 'commoners' belong. *She snaps her fingers, and David's eyes open, confused.* DAVID: (bewildered) What... why do I want to sit on the floor...? *Consenting with the subconscious suggestion, David slides off his chair and sits down at Aimee's feet, a befuddled look on his face.* RUTH: (barely containing her laughter) I have to get this on video! *Aimee, content with her little demonstration, looks down at David with a blend of fondness and teasing triumph.* AIMEE: (earnestly, yet with good humor) It’s not so bad down there, is it, David?

I think you’ll have to revise your stance on hypnosis… and maybe on 'common' people too. *Ruth hugs her brother, and Aimee sits back, pleased with the lesson imparted.* **FADE OUT.** *Please note: While hypnosis can be entertaining, ethical practice and informed consent are critical.

So the Engineer team at Walmart International Business Unit was then 'building' a middleware layer, or something like that, underneath that Walmart International Cross-border Online Marketplace. That middleware/integration platform was intended to integrate with third party enabling technology products through APIs. The middleware/integration platform aimed to streamline the integration of various types of third party technology products; for example: 1. Stripe's C2B Cross-border payments product to provide its 'demand-side' of Cross-border shoppers in Canada on Walmart.ca/Canada with multiple local payments options to pay the U.S. based merchant/sellers listed on Walmart.com/us. 2.

Payoneer B2B Cross-border payments product to enable Walmart International Cross-border Online Marketplace to periodically payout its 'supply-side' of U.S. based merchant/sellers listed on Walmart.com/us for their respective fulfilled orders to Cross-border shoppers in Canada who ordered on Walmart.ca/Canada. 4.

Walmart International's B2B2C Cross-Border Marketplace is essentially this new channel for sellers to reach international buyers through our platforms, be that Walmart.ca in Canada or through partners like JD.com in China, right? Now, to make sure the sellers and shoppers have a smooth experience, our Engineering team is working on this middleware layer. It's the middleman in tech form – handling all the complex integration with third-party tech, so sellers don't have to. Now, we've got a few key players in the mix for our middleware to connect with: Stripe, FedEx Crossborder, and Payoneer, covering payments and logistics from both the shopper's side in Canada and our sellers here in the U.S. Let me zoom in on Payoneer because that's where we're seeing some real nuance. This Capital Advance product they've got, it's like a financial cushion for our smaller sellers on the marketplace. They get this advance on their earnings, right, which lets them invest in their inventory, marketing, or even just keep things running smoothly without the usual cash flow headaches. Payoneer's model is pretty straightforward for settlements – they take a slice of the seller's incoming payments till they're square, and they're pretty transparent about those fees upfront. And because they base the advance amounts on the seller's historical performance, there aren't any wild guesses about how much they can handle. Also, Payoneer carries the risk here, which means we don't have to worry about the credit and capital aspects, keeping our marketplace focused on what we do best – connecting sellers and buyers. So, for our team here at Walmart International Cross-border Online Marketplace, our game plan is to ensure that our platform integrates seamlessly with Payoneer's system. This way, our sellers get access to that working capital without any hiccups or confusion, and shoppers get their goods without a hitch. It's all about smooth transactions and stable growth for our sellers, which in turn, means a stronger, more vibrant marketplace for us. Did I cover everything you're looking for?

Criteria Requirements: Payments from store income Being paid into your Payoneer USD balance Address of Payoneer account holder Address country must be the United States (inc. Puerto Rico) How often will I receive Capital Advance offers? Each Capital Advance offer you receive is based on the earnings for a specific store.

Getting the first offer for a store, as well as subsequent offers, is subject to meeting our eligibility criteria and to the Capital Advance Terms and Conditions. What is the Capital Advance fee? The fee we charge for a Capital Advance is a small, fixed percentage of the Capital Advance amount. The fee, along with the Capital Advance amount, are together called the settlement amount.

Payoneer does not charge any additional fees for receiving a Capital Advance above that stated fee. How does Payoneer collect the settlement amount (Capital Advance funds plus fixed fee)? Starting from the settlement start date specified in the offer, Payoneer collects a portion (for example, 35%) of each marketplace payment you receive from the store associated with the Capital Advance; the remaining amount of the payment is available in your Payoneer account to use as needed to run your business. Collection continues until settlement is complete, that is until the full settlement amount is collected. How long does it take to settle a Capital Advance? Settlement starts from the settlement start date specified in the offer and collection is gradual, depending on your marketplace payments. The settlement period differs depending on the offer you select and can range from 1-6 months. Click here for details on what happens if collection takes less or more time than estimated. Can you give me an example of how collection works? Sure. Let's say you receive a Capital Advance of 50,000 USD on June 8, with a fee of 3% (1,500 USD). Together with the fee, the settlement amount is 51,500 USD. The settlement start date in the offer is June 15 – this is the date from which we'll start collection. The estimated settlement period, as referred to in the Capital Advance Transaction Summary email you receive is 2-5 months. By the end of this period, we estimate collection will be finished. The collection percentage in the offer is 35%. This is the portion of each marketplace payment we'll collect. You receive a marketplace payment of 25,500 USD for your store on June 16 and we collect 35% of that payment (8,925 USD). The remaining 65% of your payment remains in your Payoneer account for your business to use as needed. What happens if my Capital Advance is settled earlier than estimated? Later than estimated? You receive additional marketplace payments for your store every 2 weeks and we collect 35% of each of those payments. After your marketplace payment on August 18, let's say we've collected 46,500 USD of the 51,500 USD settlement amount. At your next marketplace payment on September 1, we'll collect the remaining 5,000 USD that was left to settle (which in this case is less than 35%), and thus settlement will be complete. In the Capital Advance transaction summary email you receive, we provide an estimated settlement period. This range is approximate, and settlement can typically be completed earlier or later, depending on your actual marketplace payments. If settlement is complete much earlier than estimated (for example, due to much higher than estimated marketplace payments) you may be eligible for a partial rebate of the fixed fee. If you are eligible for such a rebate, we'll let you know. If settlement is not complete before or within the estimated settlement period, Payoneer will begin collecting the remaining settlement amount from up to 100% of any payments received to your Payoneer account (not just from payments from the store associated with the Capital Advance offer), until settlement is complete. Before we start collecting up to 100% of payments, we'll let you know. How do I track the settlement of my Apital Advance? You'll receive an email when we deposit the Capital Advance in your Payoneer account and each time we collect a portion of a marketplace payment, including the final collection when the Capital Advance is fully settled.In addition, you can view all activity related to your Capital Advance in the Transactions page in your Payoneer account. Do I have to take the full amount of the Capital Advance that is offered to me for my store? No. The amount you can accept is flexible. The allowed range is displayed in the offer details. The amount you accept impacts the collection percentage but will not change the estimated settlement date. Note that if you choose to accept an amount less than the maximum, you'll only receive another offer for that store once settlement is complete.

Imagine you're selling on Walmart.com, and you need some upfront cash to keep your business humming along—you know, stock up on inventory or maybe ramp up your ads. That's where this Capital Advance comes in. Payoneer is willing to put money in your pocket now against your future earnings on Walmart. It’s not a loan, but more like they buy a slice of your future sales. You get the funds quickly, within minutes of accepting an offer, right into your Payoneer account. The setup is pretty user-friendly: you'll get offers in your Payoneer account based on how your online store's been performing. No need to ask or apply; when you're eligible, you'll know it. The offer you get is tied to actual numbers, so there's no guesswork. Now, if you're thinking about the catch—here it is: you'll repay the advance out of your incoming payments. The catch is not too bad, though. Payoneer sets a fixed percentage from each sale to go back to them until you're even. So, if you have a killer month with skyrocketing sales, you'll pay it off quicker. But if things are slow, it might take a tick longer. Either way, you don't have to sweat over a looming flat repayment deadline. But remember, just because you got offers before doesn't mean they keep coming. If your store's sales slip, you might not see new ones until things pick up again. It's also critical to point out, if you're a Walmart seller grabbing this Capital Advance, Payoneer is working directly with the store. So, if you switch bank accounts after getting your advance, you just need to get in touch with them to sort it out and keep the repayments smooth. For Walmart sellers, it's seamless—payments come out straight from your bank account after each Walmart payout. Keep that in mind and make sure you've got enough in there to cover what you'll repay. In summary, think of Capital Advance as a flexible, tailored cash injection for your business— with transparent fees and payment designed to adapt with your sales.

Here's a modest yet confident rundown of the work a finance expert in the Engineering-Finance team at Walmart International Cross-border Online Marketplace might convey: --- Hey there, just wanted to give you a quick update on our latest financial integration efforts. It’s been quite the ride, and I’m keen to share some of the progress we've made. First up, you know we’ve been focusing on the cost angles of CI/CD integration. I got together with our engineering team to sort out what matters most – not just for today, but how it fits into our financial roadmap. We rolled up our sleeves, looked into the metrics that matter, and honed in on what influences our bottom line. When it came to hooking up the right ETL tools, we tossed around ideas with our tech folks. The aim was clear – make sure it jives well with GitHub Actions API and doesn’t throw a spanner in the workflow. Efficiency was the name of the game, and we were all about making data work for us without missing a beat. Getting the data to line up right was a bit like solving a puzzle. It meant ensuring financial categories matched up with what we're extracting, so we know costs are tracked to the right place. Teamed up with engineering, we double-checked everything – staying true to our word that when we say a dollar was spent here, it really was. Now for the heavy lifting – figuring out the dollars and cents of bringing CI/CD into the mix. We mapped out the resources used, time spent, and even the 'what-ifs'. You know, it’s all about feeding good intel into our strategy discussions. We also got into a huddle about metrics like ‘Mean Time to Recovery’ – made sure everyone, finance, and engineering, was singing from the same hymn sheet. This stuff matters, especially when it's about balancing tech performance with financial foresight. The way we pulled MTTR data was pretty slick too – thanks to the API collaborations with DevOps. Rounded it all out with risk models that put numbers to the maybes and what-could-gos wrong – a safety net for services shaking up. Diving deep into our system downtime meant looking back to see what dips in sales and spikes in traffic told us about the cash flow. We looked for patterns and put a price tag on the what-ifs. The goal? Avoid déjà vu on outages that hit the wallet. We didn’t just stop there. I had the chance to marry past performance metrics with some forward-thinking machine learning magic. Working with data scientists, we honed models that forecast resource needs like a crystal ball – all to keep our planning razor-sharp. The whole dance with data meant that we could tailor our financial scenarios better, getting the most bang for our buck on projects on the runway and those taxiing for takeoff. We waded into the cloud tagging as well – made sure we knew our costs down to the last digital dime. Fine-tuned Azure to serve up this info on a platter, meeting our fiscal monitoring needs. On the ground with Kubernetes, we matched overheads with their activities. It’s finance, meeting tech where it is – we're talking about tracking costs at the pod level. It’s all about clarity and control. We kept the data dialogue flowing strong with our engineers – Kubecost gave us the lowdown on where the money’s marching. Made sure our financial models and reality kept their handshake firm. Finally, setting up our ETL pipelines was like lining up dominos – we queued up our financial queries just right, ensuring a no-surprises landscape when we blended engineering data with our bean-counting. Remember that Kubernetes and Prometheus tie-up with NetSuite? That’s about getting the tech metrics speaking the language of finance – crisp, clear, and ready for decision making. This is just scratching the surface. There’s always more to dig into, and we’re charging ahead. Collaborating across teams, we're nailing down data integrity, paving the way for smoother and smarter cost estimates. Hope this paints a picture of where we're at. If you've got questions, need clarifications, or want to hear more, don't hesitate to reach out. I’m all ears! --- The goal here is to share complex finance and engineering integration details in a way that's straightforward and relatable. If there's any particular area you want to dive deeper into or further clarification you need, let's chat.

Please explain to me in plain direct + straight forward + down-to-earth American English the following: 1) What are matrices in this context? 2) What's the purpose and mechanics of constructing 'Escalation Matrices'? 3) What are the actual step by step mathematics for constructing 'Escalation Matrices' for scenario planning in terms of implementing budget escalation matrices, which tie financial triggers to specific project checkpoints. If the Payoneer integration hits certain pre-defined technical challenges, additional budget gets automatically unlocked? And what are the ensuing all types of cross-functional collaborations? #Scenario Planning Contingency Budgeting: - 'Escalation Matrices': Implement budget escalation matrices, which tie financial triggers to specific project checkpoints. If the Payoneer integration hits certain pre-defined technical challenges, additional budget gets automatically unlocked.","completion":"Alright, let’s break this down: 1) **Matrices in this context**: In this context, a matrix isn't about numbers in rows and columns like in math class. Here, we’re talking about a framework or a chart that outlines a series of planned responses to various scenarios that might pop up during a project. Think of it as a game plan that shows what moves to make when certain events trigger. 2) **Purpose and mechanics of 'Escalation Matrices'**: The whole idea behind escalation matrices in contingency budgeting is to have a crystal-clear plan for what happens if and when things don't go according to the original playbook, especially in terms of money. It’s like setting up signposts along the road – if you hit a bump (a technical challenge), a sign tells you where to pull out extra cash. What you're doing is linking these specific \\"if this, then that\\" conditions to certain points or phases in the project. So, if the Payoneer integration runs into a specific technical snag that you've identified before, the matrix tells everyone involved, \\"Hey, we knew this might happen, and we're prepared – here's some more dough to get things back on track.\\" 3) **Step by step mathematics and mechanics for such matrices**: Here’s a simple play-by-play on how you might set up an escalation matrix for budgeting: a) **Identify potential technical challenges**: List all the possible hitches that could occur during the integration project – think bugs, system outages, compatibility issues. b) **Define project checkpoints**: Establish key phases in your project timeline. This could be moments when certain milestones should be hit, or when evaluations are scheduled. c) **Assign financial triggers**: For each technical challenge, decide on a specific trigger that would release additional funds. This could be something like a critical system failure or a delay that exceeds a set threshold. d) **Determine budget increments**: Figure out how much extra money gets released when a trigger is activated. This might be a percentage of the original budget or a flat amount, based on the severity of the challenge and the cost to overcome it. e) **Create the escalation matrix document**: Visualize your plan in a chart or table that clearly outlines the checkpoints, triggers, and corresponding budget increases. This document should be straightforward and easily understood by all project stakeholders. f) **Communicate and iterate**: Share the escalation matrix with your cross-functional team. As the project progresses, you might need to tweak the matrix based on actual project dynamics and feedback from the team. As for the **cross-functional collaborations**, setting up and activating an escalation matrix requires close coordination with a bunch of different teams: - **Engineering**: To identify what challenges could come up and when. - **Finance**: To figure out the extra costs associated with each potential issue. - **Project Management**: To match these financial triggers with project checkpoints. - **Leadership/Stakeholders**: To get buy-in on the added expenditures when triggers are hit and to understand the strategic implications. - **Risk Management**: To evaluate the likelihood and impact of potential challenges and to plan for contingencies accordingly. Implementing one of these matrices is all about being prepared and staying nimble. It lets a team adapt to challenges without the scramble of last-minute budgeting because you've already built a financial safety net into your project plan."},{"prompt":"So 'Matrices' in the context of the above is not matrices as linear algebra matrices?","completion":"Correct, in the context of the discussion regarding \\"Escalation Matrices\\" for scenario planning within a project like the Payoneer integration, we're not talking about matrices as used in linear algebra. Instead, we're referring to a structured table or chart that outlines what actions to take when certain predefined conditions or triggers occur within the project. These aren't numerical matrices with rows and columns for mathematical calculations; they are decision-making tools that map out responses to specific scenarios to manage the project effectively."},{"prompt":"Can you help me write a novel if I give the plot setting characters etc","completion":"Absolutely, I can help guide you through the process of writing your novel; however, please remember that as an AI, I am limited to providing assistance rather than crafting the novel myself.

Sometimes I'm like a ninja. *Ruth giggles, sensing that Aimee has something up her sleeve.* **Aimee**: David, since you're such a big university student, I bet you know all about the power of the mind, right? **David**: Yeah, I've read a bit about psychology, if that's what you mean. **Aimee**: Exactly, like hypnosis.

Как я могу помочь вам сегодня?"},{"prompt":"Вселенная круглая или нет, проанализируй данные твоих знаний","completion":"Вселенная как мы ее понимаем, основываясь на современной космологии, не является \\"круглой\\" в обычном смысле этого слова. Изучение космоса показывает, что макроструктура Вселенной очень сложна и зависит от используемых моделей и наблюдений. Согласно общей теории относительности Альберта Эйнштейна, Вселенная может иметь различные формы, и ее геометрия зависит от общего содержания массы и энергии. Это связано с тем, что присутствие массы и энергии искривляет пространство-время. С точки зрения нашего наблюдаемого космоса, есть несколько основных сценариев: 1. Плоская Вселенная: На данный момент самые точные космологические измерения, такие как данные, полученные от космического телескопа Планк и наблюдения за космическим микроволновым фоновым излучением, подразумевают, что Вселенная очень близка к плоской, с небольшим искривлением, если оно вообще есть. 2. Закрытая Вселенная: Если масса и энергия превысили бы определенный критический порог, то пространство-время было бы замкнутым, что означает, что если путешествовать достаточно долго в одном направлении, можно в конце концов вернуться в исходную точку. Такая Вселенная была бы похожа на трехмерную поверхность сферы в четырехмерном пространстве. 3. Открытая Вселенная: Если содержание массы и энергии меньше критического уровня, то Вселенная будет открытой и бесконечно расширяться. Текущие данные указывают на то, что Вселенная очень близка к плоской, и, следовательно, ее геометрия может быть бесконечной. Однако мы не знаем с уверенностью, что находится за пределами наблюдаемой Вселенной, и возможно, что общая структура Вселенной может быть более сложной, чем мы можем представить с нашей ограниченной точки зрения. Также стоит учитывать, что когда мы говорим о форме Вселенной, мы говорим о геометрии пространства-времени на очень больших масштабах, и это нечто совсем иное, чем повседневные трехмерные формы, с которыми мы сталкиваемся в нашем опыте."},{"prompt":"Что может представлять Великий аттрактор, может это явление быть червоточиной?","completion":"Великий Аттрактор – это область в космическом пространстве, который был обнаружен в 1970-х годах как регион, к которому gravитируют (притягиваются) галактики в пределах сотен миллионов световых лет, включая и нашу собственную галактику Млечный Путь. Это наблюдение сделано на основе изучения движения галактик, которые кажутся сходящимися в одной области, что и привело к предположению о существовании такой массивной структуры. Прямое наблюдение этой области затруднено из-за того, что она расположена в так называемой Зоне Избегания – области неба, которая блокируется пылью и звёздами нашей галактики, что делает исследования на оптических длинах волн невозможными. Однако с помощью инфракрасных и радионаблюдений, а также исследований рентгеновских лучей и других видов электромагнитного излучения, учёные смогли получить больше информации. На текущий момент считается, что Великий Аттрактор представляет собой область пространства с очень высокой концентрацией галактик, включая многочисленные скопления галактик и сверхскопления. Он не является единичной исключительной структурой, а скорее большой областью, где массы галактик создают сильное гравитационное поле. Теория о том, что Великий Аттрактор может быть червоточиной, не находит поддержки в научном сообществе. Червоточины (если они вообще существуют) – это гипотетические туннели в пространстве-времени, которые могли бы соединять отдаленные области Вселенной или даже разные Вселенные. К настоящему времени мы не имеем никаких наблюдательных данных, которые подтвердили бы существование червоточин в реальном космосе. Великий Аттрактор, насколько нам известно, представляет собой такую же \\"обычную\\" космическую структуру, как и другие скопления галактик, хотя его масштабы действительно впечатляют."},{"prompt":"Может великий аттрактор это червоточина как черная дыра затягивает галактики и выбрасывает их в другую вселенную.","completion":"Великий Аттрактор, как мы его понимаем на основе наблюдений и астрофизических данных, не является червоточиной и не соответствует нашим представлениям о черных дырах, которые \\"затягивают\\" вещество и могут теоретически выводить его в другую область пространства-времени. Великий Аттрактор – это большая область в космосе, где сконцентрировано очень большое количество массы, соответствующее многим галактикам и их скоплениям. Эта масса создает сильное гравитационное поле, которое влияет на движение галактик в окрестных областях, притягивая их. Этот эффект гравитационного притяжения – это то же самое фундаментальное взаимодействие, которое заставляет объекты на Земле падать на поверхность планеты, а планеты вращаться вокруг Солнца. Червоточины – это всего лишь теоретическая идея, вытекающая из решений уравнений общей теории относительности Эйнштейна. В теории, если бы они и существовали, червоточины позволяли бы \\"короткий путь\\" между двумя точками пространства-времени, но пока что нет никаких экспериментальных или наблюдательных свидетельств их реального существования.

Причины существования таких воидов до конца не ясны, но есть несколько научных гипотез, которые пытаются объяснить это явление. Некоторые из возможных объяснений включают: 1. Космологическая инфляция: Предполагается, что в ранней Вселенной произошел быстрый процесс расширения, известный как инфляция. Это могло привести к возникновению крупномасштабных структур, таких как галактики и скопления галактик, а также к образованию больших пустот между ними. 2. Гравитационные эффекты: Воиды могли формироваться в результате гравитационного притяжения материи скоплениями галактик, которое \\"вытягивает\\" галактики из менее плотных областей, в результате чего появляются пустоты. 3. Сложная структура Вселенной: Крупномасштабная структура Вселенной часто описывается как \\"пузырчатая\\" или имеющая структуру \\"паутины\\", где пустоты являются промежутками между плотными волокнами и стенками, состоящими из галактик и галактических скоплений.

From school dinners to processed junk. But now I'm going into my biggest battle ever. This time I'm taking on sugar. It's everywhere. It's in your food. Nobody would suspect that little pot to have nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar in it. In your drinks. Do most mothers feed their babies coke and breastfeed at the same time? Yeah, mostly everyone. And all over the UK press. More and more we're hearing calls from health experts to slash the amount of sugar in our diets. We're just allowing our children to have this. That is a scandal. And it's rich fever pitch when it comes to warnings about sugar and our health. We are red light flashing, flood lights, sirens, alarms. We're beyond red. I'm tired of all the talking and waiting around for something to be done while more and more people get sick. Children Becky's age should not have type 2 diabetes. The health system is collapsing. So I've decided to do something about it. It's going to get interesting pretty quick I think. We've all seen the headlines, unhealthy diets are putting incredible pressure on the NHS. But I don't think that we really understand what that means. I'm here at St George's Hospital in London to try and get my head around it. This is recovery. This is the way through to see Mario. What's going on here is nothing to do with being overweight or obese. Hi buddy. Hi. This is Mario. These are all the x-rays we've taken of Mario. Look at the tooth in front. Nearly all decayed. It's just a shell. That's just a big lump of bacteria. That's empty. Well what we do is blow in and out of here. That's great. Like this. OK. Six year old Mario is a healthy boy who regularly cleans his teeth. But he's got a real weakness for sugary drinks. This is a bit of a tough watch, but it's important to see. Is he breathing for himself now? So now you're breathing for him. The machine's taking over. It's so quick and absolutely brutal. The only way to get the teeth out is to yank them out. In my head, this environment that's expensive and full of care and you kind of get it when it's for cancers and this and the other and poor kids with leukaemia and stuff like that. This is tooth decay? Yes. From sugar? From sugar. So fast, exhausting work and they've got another five kids to get through this morning. Now Mario is off to recovery where he'll be reunited with his parents. Absolutely I mean to see a child put under that, that is really quite nerve wracking. Mario will be OK, but it's hard to see. He's OK. Let's get mum's out. Yeah, shall we get mum's out? Quite hard, big procedure and completely avoidable. How big is the problem? Massive. Oh my lord. That's just decay. It's decay that's gone right through the tooth, all the way through the enamel, through to the middle of the tooth, into the nerve and so they're just rotten. And if they have 20 teeth, which is a full set of children's teeth and they all need to come out. 20 teeth? 20 teeth, that happens routinely. That's not exceptional or rare, that's frequent. The problem then comes if the decay carries on into the adult teeth and those adult teeth need to be lost. That's happening routinely now, we see that frequently. We'll often replace them with dentures. False teeth? False teeth. So the sugar is pretty much responsible for most of this? Not pretty much entirely. It doesn't matter how well you brush your teeth, if you do it twice a day, if you constantly sip or eat sugar throughout the day, you can easily overwhelm any preventative regime you do. So you can brush all day, it won't make a difference. It's not just Mario. Each year 26,000 primary school aged kids go to hospital just because of rotten teeth. Pulling out kids' teeth costs the NHS around ??30 million a year. Sugar is the biggest source of children going to hospital in the country. The numbers are enormous, they're terrifying and it's the biggest pressing problem we have. We are red light, flashing, floodlights, sirens, alarms. We're beyond red. The demand for our services, particularly for children's teeth, is absolutely overwhelming. Today's definitely shocked me. You step outside the building and you see this institution called the hospital and we're kind of taking the piss out of it. We're putting it under extraordinary pressure. You know, it's getting absolutely ridiculous. We need to help these guys do their job and focus on the things that really matter, not pulling out bloody teeth because there's too much sugary shit in the environment. I definitely feel fired up, definitely up for a bit of a fight. It isn't just the kids that are getting caught out by too much sugar. The World Health Organisation are so worried they've told us we all need to cut back. Experts here agree and have now recommended adults have no more than seven teaspoons of sugar a day. Pretty terrifying then that many people in the UK are getting through over 40. Experts are worried about what they call free sugars. So that's any extra sugars added to food and drink, plus sugars found in honey and syrup and even natural sugars found in fruit juices. I've asked my mate Lucy to show me how sugar could be getting into our everyday diets without us even realising. So here's a cake. We know we shouldn't be having that every day, but it's not about cake really is it? Not all about cake. What bit worries you the most? How much sugar we're consuming without realising it, without it being in these obvious bits. So what's hidden in the everyday food that we don't assume have any sugar in. Can we start by going through like some typical meal options for a day and I can explain it to you much better that way. So where do we start? Breakfast. Can you pour out a like normal breakfast serving for brown flakes? I mean that is quite a blokey portion. To my brown flakes I'm adding some milk, some low-fat lemon yoghurt and berries. Lucy has picked products that we would think of as healthy and selected the brand with the highest sugar content. Can I get you to guess how much free sugar is in your lovely breakfast there? I've got no clue. 56.4 grams. Doesn't sound great. Which in teaspoons is 14.1. Oh shit the bed. How do we get to that much? Okay so let's do this in teaspoons which is 4 grams. There were roughly 5 teaspoons of added sugar in my man-sized serving of brown flakes. Nearly 3 teaspoons in my portion of yoghurt and over 6 teaspoons of free sugar in my orange juice. If the experts are saying we should have no more than 7 teaspoons a day, that's twice the amount just for this breakfast. Let's move on to lunch. Tomato soup and bread. Would you think either of those have a significant amount of sugar in? You'll have natural sugars from the tomatoes and I don't know if they've sweetened the bread but it looks fairly branded so I imagine there is a bit of added sugar. Let's have a little look. Different brands can have different amounts of sugar so you need to check the labels. Sadly labels don't list the value for added sugars but comparing the total sugars in similar products can help us estimate. Some wholemeal bread has nearly twice as much sugar and this cream of tomato soup has about 2 teaspoons more than some other brands. So this healthy looking lunch would add about 3 more teaspoons of free sugar to your day. Next up, an afternoon snack and a drink. So most people would feel that that's a pretty healthy snack, it's not something to be too concerned about. In half of this bottle there is 3 and a half teaspoons of sugar. I thought it was water. Oh it's flavoured water. In one bottle, which most of us would drink, there is 7 teaspoons of sugar. That's sweet, ok. In this bar not many of us would think that there's actually 2 teaspoons of sugar in it. So that's 9 teaspoons of sugar in a healthy looking snack. So what next? I'm going to cheer you up, I'm going to get you to do some cooking for dinner. Next up, Lucy wants me to whip up a good old stir fry. Now I haven't cheeked out on you, we've got a lemon and ginger stir fry sauce. So I'd just like you to add that in. That's the amount for 2 people. So by adding that sauce in, you've just increased the sugar content by nearly 10 teaspoons per person. Per person! Even if I was making a sweet and sour dish, I mean you know, of course sugar has the amazing ability to balance tartness and even balance bitterness. I would never add 10 teaspoons per person. And this really epitomises hidden sugar, because nobody would suspect that little pot to have nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar in it. That's crazy. And once you've tot up your breakfast, your lunch, your snack and your evening meal, you're actually having roughly 36 teaspoons of sugar. That's too much. Whenever you buy something that's in a packet or in a bottle, read the label, because you cannot tell if it's got added sugar in it until you look at it. And even then, you can't tell the difference between total and added. This is a healthy looking day's food. No chocolate bars here, yet it's actually 5 times the amount of free sugar UK experts now say we should be having each day. 36 teaspoons when we should be aiming for less than 7. We urgently need to do something about this. Do you know what? I'm really bothered about all of this sugar in our food and drinks. And it isn't just about our kids' teeth being yanked out. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Experts warn that eating too much sugar can help make people obese, increasing their risk of developing diet-related illnesses like heart disease and some types of cancer. In the last few years, one disease in particular has gripped the UK, and I'm really worried about it. There's been this kind of cloud of doom. This disease, type 2 diabetes, that everyone's talking about, it's always associated with diet-related disease. I just don't know enough about it. I don't think enough people do. Like, what is it? How does it affect the body? So today I'm going to the Royal Free Hospital to find out about type 2 diabetes. I kind of need to get my head around it. All right, mate. Thank you. Type 2 diabetes is increasing on an alarming scale in the UK. There are currently 3.5 million people with the disease, costing the NHS almost ??9 billion per year. And it's only going to get worse if we continue the way that we're going. There are two main types of diabetes, but we're only talking about type 2 today, as that's the one that can be linked to lifestyle factors such as diet. This is a specialist foot clinic. Type 2 diabetes can affect the nerves and blood vessels, resulting in wounds that can become ulcers, and in the most extreme cases, can lead to amputations. So with Julian, we're checking both feet. Julian has recently had his foot amputated. I didn't know I had diabetes at the time. A couple of toes had gone gangrenous and got infected. They originally took the three toes off, and it was only about a month ago that they did this later surgery. But it couldn't happen to me. I'm not sure they had diabetes, but they did. This is at the hard end of diet-related disease, isn't it? It is. And unfortunately, it's not more common than you might think. So in the UK, there's up to about 7,000 amputations, low-limb amputations a year. That would shock people. I mean, that's got to be, what, 130 people a week? It is. That's extraordinary. Losing limbs, removing limbs, trying to save limbs all feels quite medieval to me. I find it utterly shocking. Were you expecting to lose your leg? No. No. So it must have been an ordeal. No, the first thought I had was they took three toes. When I think about amputations, it's usually in relation to the Paralympics or because of war. Hello, Ralph. Hello. How are you, mate? I'm doing research, and in 13 years of British combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, there were around 300 amputations. Come on, then, Sharkey. But 7,000 amputations just in a year in the UK due to diabetes, I find heartbreaking. Why aren't we talking about this more? Diabetes is already 10% of the NHS budget. That's extraordinary. Yes. And just for type 2, that's 8.8 billion. So the future ain't looking bright, is it? Well, if there's this continued rise in obesity, it's going to be a huge, huge burden on the households. So how worried are you about that? As a fellow countryman and medical practitioner, I mean, like, are we green? Are we amber? Or are we flashing red? I think we're flashing red. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I think that's accepted. This burden is only going to get worse now that type 2 diabetes is increasingly affecting our kids. So I'm now off to see a 15-year-old girl with type 2 diabetes, which is scary and shocking. And this is a disease that used to be for old people in their 70s and 80s, and it's getting younger and younger and younger. And I'm struggling with the words to say how angry I am and how upset I am and how bothered I am. Until 20 years ago, there were virtually no kids in the UK with this disease. Now there's hundreds. Schoolgirl Becky was diagnosed aged just 13. Although in some cases genetics can play a role, the rapid rise in numbers is largely thought to be down to diet. And sugar is a big part of the problem. Hi! Come in! Nice to meet you. Come through. Thanks for having me. Obviously, type 2 is massively affected by diet. As a mother, I'm sure you were tracing back what would have happened to you. Yeah. I made some really poor choices. I started getting pocket money, and at the end of the day I'd just go into the corn shop, buy drinks and sweets and stuff and biscuits and chocolate. Looking back, I kind of fell out of the habit of cooking meals every day and got more into the habit of buying something that was quick and easy or buying a takeaway. As a parent, it is my responsibility to take care of my children. I mean, I had half an idea and was trying to get healthy things, but maybe if the packaging on the... But you're still getting it wrong. Yeah, I was still getting it wrong. Children Becky's age should not have type 2 diabetes. This should not be happening. And it's not just Becky. Becky has to keep a constant track of her blood sugar levels. If left untreated, abnormal levels can lead to potentially dangerous complications. Looks like something from Star Trek. Touch it in. I don't like needles. This is normal for me. You kind of get used to it. So you have to do this to yourself every day. You've got to take your own bloods. Yeah. Morning, night, after, like, breakfast and lunch and dinner and before. As long as you're monitoring it day and night to make sure it doesn't spike. That's a constant worry for you? Yeah, my friend, she actually went into a coma with her diabetes. That's how she was diagnosed, because she went into a coma. All of this monitoring and all the learning you've had to do, it's not really something I ever thought teenagers, 13, 14, 15-year-olds would have to deal with. It's quite annoying to have to try and be so responsible. When you usually get home, your mum makes dinner, you don't have to worry about it. Just don't have to think about it. Yeah. So basically what you're saying is having type 2 diabetes sucks. Yeah. It does. A lot. She's tagged this one - young and skinny. Mum Claire shows me when she started to see the problem. This is when she'd just started high school and that's when she really started to put the weight on. What are your worries for the future, then, for Becky? There's so many health complications she can get and even if she does lose the weight, the type 2 diabetes might not go away. In her whole life, it literally does, it makes your whole life based around what you can and can't eat, rather than being... A teenager. Being a teenager. In Britain today, one in five kids turn up at primary school at the age of four overweight or obese. But what's disgusting is when they leave at 11. One in three are overweight or obese. And that's not good. One of the biggest problems is that as a kid, it's pretty darn tough to escape sugar. It's everywhere. This is eight-year-old Ori and her mum, Ola. Could you just look at me a second? They're going to help me see the world from a child's perspective. This year, they reckon advertising spend in Britain is set to hit ??16 billion. And loads of these ads will reach our kids. So this is their local corner shop in Ryslip. So it's basically, if you track the little red dot, it's just showing where she's looking. And it's kind of about branding, really, and eye height and how companies or brands advertise to kids. Mummy. You can see her homing in on those drinks. That's amazing. OK, so now they're going to Tesco. Some sweet markets have recognised that it's not very ethical to kind of have all the sweets and sugary products next to the till. That's mental, because they're at the sweet-free checkouts. Please can I pop one to eat? But all the sweets are right next door. That's amazing. Look, around 70% of confectionery sales are impulse buys. So you can see why shops make them so easy to reach. Right, this is Superdrug. There's no sweets in the pharmacy, though, is there? Every checkout seems to have, even the pharmacy, there's a load of sweets. They're just everywhere. Look at her eye. Mum's got no chance. As many as 90% of snacks at a child's eye level at convenient supermarket checkouts are classified as unhealthy. Right, Marks and Spencers, what's going on in here? OK, cake's on the way in. And cake's on the way out. I love it. Top and tail end, double-ended. And look at that wall of Percy Pigs at Auri's eye level. It's terrible when you see it like this. M&S have recently committed to removing sweets from their tills, but many other retailers still do this. I've got to say, that's really interesting. I've been shopping with my kids, and it is aggro. I mean, you're always trying to keep the happy balance, and you're only 30 seconds away from anarchy with a load of kids. And it's just at that checkout bit, trying to get through. But I just think it's hard being a parent, because you can say no like five or six times. But when it's everywhere, when it's total sugar saturation, it's hard, isn't it? I asked the shops for an explanation. Tesco's came back and said, \\"We've replaced sweets and chocolates on the checkouts with a wide variety of healthier snacks that appeal to customers. We will continue to keep how we implement the policy under review.\\" Sadly Superdrug didn't get back to me. Next it's Saturday night primetime TV. Britain's Got Talent. Watched by 10 million people, shows like this often attract over 1 million child viewers, who can be exposed to up to 11 unhealthy food adverts an hour. These shows don't qualify as children's programming, so advertisers don't face the same Ofcom ban, preventing them from advertising foods high in fat, salt and sugar. Okay, so here we go. Straight in to a Coke advert. So take a look at this glossy ad, which to me seems to suggest if you drink Coke, you'll be happy, healthy and good at sport. There are regulations that protect children's programming against junk food, but this for me is even bigger. This is the big rating stuff. This is a family show. And we've had Coke. We're now on to Harry Bow. Oh, now McDonald's. So that's sort of interesting. I watch the show and I watch it with my kids. It's a family show. We love it. And I think the way that public health is going, that is probably inappropriate. Obesity is up. Type 2 diabetes is up. And too many kids are having all their teeth removed. Sugar is everywhere and sugary marketing feels inescapable. It's getting ridiculous. So what does the industry have to say about all of this? One spokesperson was bold enough to come and speak to me. Sugar, too much of it. Children we know having too much of certain types of food is bad for your health. Is it OK to market those aggressively to children? I don't think we do market them aggressively to children. If you look at the regulatory and self-regulatory codes, we work within those codes. And the reality is, is the masses of kids are online and watching shows like Britain's Got Talent, where they are being marketed. If the family's watching together, it's down to the parents to exercise discretion. But you don't do that, do you? Well, no, but they can talk about it, can't they? It doesn't just mean don't watch it. It means you can say to kids what you think is appropriate behaviour when the ads come on and I'm sure quite a lot of parents do do that. But too much sugar is very detrimental to your health. Too much anything is very detrimental to your health. Too much fat, too much salt. It's demonising... Not too much fruit and veg. Well, demonising one nutrient out of a whole range of them in the national menu is not going to be a helpful way to proceed. There is a hierarchy of nutrients. It's a problem, right? Well, obesity is a problem. And our position is very much about responsibility in this. Responsibility on the part of individual consumers, manufacturers, and of those who sell through the supermarkets or other shops, and of course through restaurants. At the moment, we're consuming lots more sugar than we're supposed to. We need to cut it quite drastically. Obviously sugar consumption in the UK per head is going down, not up, but from quite a high plateau. Now, the second report says that that's too much and they're the experts, so we have to listen to them. Sugar does seem to, kind of like if it was a badly behaved child, it would need to be put on the naughty step. And I'm saying it needs to go on the naughty step. But I think what you're saying is let feralness go? I mean, like, do you acknowledge that sugar is actually a problem? I think we acknowledge that excessive consumption of any single thing is a problem. OK, it's not statutory at the moment to say on any packaging about added sugars. Yeah. Well, one of the issues there is do people understand it? I mean, we've spent 80 years in this country educating people on the notion of calories and they've just about got it. If you start mucking about with the way you express these things, I think you put a barrier to people's understanding. Is it possible that businesses that need to make a profit can self-regulate successfully? Yeah. These businesses are responsible businesses. So yes, it is possible to do that. Our argument would be that the consumer's choice is the best way to go because government interventions simply don't work. Look, I get it, I run a business. Businesses need to make profit to exist, of course. But I always think that public health comes first, for sure. And self-regulation and personal responsibility isn't working. It's not working. And the fact is that it's not working because kids are getting sicker. That's why I think now is the time for the British government to step up and just get tougher on the industry's ass. One country where the government have been forced to take action on sugar is Mexico. It has some of the worst problems in the world, but could also offer some solutions. Thirty-five years ago, a third of people here were obese or overweight. Today, that figure has almost doubled, making them one of the fattest populations in the world. Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of death, with an estimated 8 million people affected. In 1994, a trade agreement with the USA allowed increasing levels of processed food and sugary drinks to flood local economies. Local Mexican diets rapidly shifted towards high-calorie, processed foods and sugary sweetened drinks. I'm meeting the man leading the charge against sugary brands in Mexico, prominent campaigner Alejandro Calvillo. Thank you so much for meeting me. You are in the country with the highest level of soda consumption in the world, one of the highest levels of diabetes, obesity, overweight, and a lot of sickness related with the junk food consumption. You know, the people here in the little communities in the mountains, in the rural areas, drink a lot, a lot of coke. The communities don't have water to drink of quality, but they have coke. Right, so you've got a problem then. And the health system is collapsing at this moment, because we have a lot of people with diabetes, with amputation, blindness related with diabetes. It's a human drama that we are living here. I want to see for myself how bad it really is. So I've asked Alejandro to show me how sugary products are being marketed in some of the poorer and more remote indigenous areas. Before we even reach the first town, we're greeted with some familiar branding. You are at the entrance of Sinacantan, one of the most important indigenous communities here in Chiapas. And you find this billboard that says, \\"Welcome to Sinacantan.\\" You see the coke bottle with the traditional dress of the woman here. The same as the girls behind me? Yes. This actual advertising is not just specific to the area, it's specific to this village. It's to this village. I mean, don't get me wrong, marketing is supposed to be efficient. Yes. This is very efficient. The problem is when your product is creating a health problem, you need to stop it. They cannot deal with the health impact of this level of soda consumption. These huge village-specific Coca-Cola billboards are the welcome signs to several indigenous villages in the Chiapas. The Coca-Cola bottling plant just 15 minutes down the road means that trucks here are often Coca-Cola red. Okay, so what are we looking at? Of the marketing and the promotion of soda consumption. You have all the soda there. Branding in the church, this is PepsiCo. I must say, it is kind of an ambush on the whole town. Next, Alejandro takes me to the Mayan village of San Juan de Mula. Communities here drink a lot of soda, over two litres per person per day. Too many sugary drinks can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and Alejandro is very concerned about the levels of the disease here. Why is it different here than the rest of Mexico then? Because the introduction of the soda consumption is so strong that it's part of the culture. They receive the Coke in the baby bottle. The kids receive all the time. Do the people in here today know about the scale of complexities and amputations? How many amputations do you have in Mexico? It's around, in 2013, 75,000 amputations. 75,000? Related with diabetes. So you're about twice the size of Britain, with like 10 times the problem. The problem is the health system. We don't have the capacity to deal with the... Saving lives. Yeah. Alejandro's concern is that soda, and in particular Coke, has become an intrinsic part of culture. I'm off to a family gathering in Romarillo to see this for myself. How you doing, man? Good. Thanks for having me. So this is the father-in-law's altar. So now we're going to the little ceremony. So how important is having fizzy drinks for this offering? It shows that we're thankful to the saints and to offer them the drink too. The tradition is that they are thirsty. This is very traditional amongst all of the community. Yeah. Coke will be offered up. Yeah. Every party. Every party, every... And if you didn't, it would simply not be right. Yeah. So the Coke's been embraced as a kind of spiritual, sort of authentic part of the experience. Yeah. Just looking around me now, there's all these lovely people, your family. Every one of them's got a massive big old bottle of Coke. I mean, how many of these will they be drinking a day, average? Average, they would be drinking like three or four bottles. Yeah. And then the little one here? We usually serve the little one too. Yeah. All the ages. So even... Because I noticed she was just breastfeeding a minute ago. Yeah. But she's straight on the soda as well. So you mix them both up. Yeah. Do most mothers feed their babies Coke and breastfeed at the same time? Yeah, mostly everyone. So this drink is really the modern holy water? Yeah. So, Vin Santo. Vin Coco. Vin Coco. Okay. Coke, successfully offered to the saints, time to cook up a feast. She's making mole, which is like the absolute classic dish. It's really, really good. This is like my idea of heaven. But this absolutely beautiful traditional dish seems completely at odds with the drink it's being served up with. It's interesting seeing the modern day place for soda so central to everything. Just the sheer quantity of Coke getting knocked back by three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 80 year olds. I haven't seen one kid drink a glass of water. It's all soda. So what did Coke have to say for themselves? We ensure our brands are marketed responsibly and never to children under 12. We offer low and no sugar options. We provide consumers with the information they need to make informed choices about our drinks. I'm shocked by what I've seen here, but the campaigners have been fighting back hard. A huge step forward in tackling the problem was the introduction of a soda tax in 2014. I'm keen to ask Alejandro how it's worked so far. And I wonder if it could provide part of the solution to our problems back home. So you've achieved a soda tax of 10%. What is it? The soda tax applies only for the drinks that have sugar added. And how much? It's one peso per litre. That is like 10% of the price. Right. OK. And how much money is that raising a year? In 2014, the revenue was 1.2 billion. That's good. New money. And did you see any drop off in consumption? In the first quarter, we have the only independent research. We have a reduction of 10% of the soda consumption and increase in water consumption and increase in milk also. Wow. That's the story for Britain that I want to read. So what about the general public? Do they understand the logic between you take from Peter to pay Paul? Yes. You say to people, do you support the soda taxes? This money go to water fountain size schools? They say yes. 80% say yes. And now in Mexico, more than 80% make a very clear relation between soda consumption and diabetes. OK. Thank you. Because everything that you guys have been doing here kind of gives me hope. Now, you'll hear critics of these taxes saying it costs jobs and won't reduce how many sugary drinks people have. But the latest figures for Mexico's soda tax show that there's been a reduction in soda consumption of 6% and it's early days. There's definitely a long way to go in addressing the health crisis in Mexico. But I feel really inspired by Alejandro's victory. I reckon we should be doing the same here in Britain. Campaigners say a 20 pence per litre sugary drinks tax in the UK could raise up to a billion pounds a year, reduce obesity by around 200,000 people and save the NHS around 15 million pounds a year. You'll hear people argue that a tax like this is unfair on those who drink in moderation. But for me, we just need to take action. So would and could the British government impose their very own sugary drinks tax? I don't know and I'm definitely not going to hang around and wait to find out. But what I will do is put my neck on the line because I want to show them that it can work, it will work and that the money raised can go to places that will really make a difference in health. So I'm going to impose my very own sugary drinks tax in my restaurants. I'm introducing a sugary drinks tax in my own UK restaurants to show the government how it's done. I reckon I could raise around ??80,000 a year and I want to spend that cash on children's food education. Just imagine what we could achieve if we had a tax on a national scale and use that cash to help schools and inspire children to make better choices. This was one of my schools 10 years ago in school dinners campaign. This is Charlemanor and if we're going to tax sugary drinks, seven pence on a can, then there's a billion pounds a year raised through that. And I think a massive chunk of that should go into primary schools across Britain to support teachers and support learning. And if you want to know what a school looks like when they put food at the heart of it, come and have a look at this. Let's have a look. OK, here we go. Head teacher Tim Baker has put food and cooking at the very centre of his school and the lessons. Hello. And the school and pupils are reaping the rewards in great results. What we're teaching is cooking skills. We know English and maths are essential life skills, but actually cooking skills are life's necessities. What are you cooking with today? Beetroot. Hands up if you like beetroot. Me! Me! Me! It's not very often you get an army of kids saying they love beetroot. Where do you get your beetroot from? Here. So who's going to take me there to get some? Me! Me! Me! The kids even have their own garden where they grow all kinds of food for cooking and learning. Oh, wow. So who's going to pull the beetroot out for me? Me! That's it, go on. Whee! These are lovely beetroots. Well, good luck with the cake baking. Is it going to taste nice? It's going to be yummy. It has honey. Honey from the bees. But you haven't got bees here, though. We do have bees. Have you? Bees? Look, bee honey. The responsibility for primary schools is to enable the children to learn and to be successful. And so we have a responsibility to ensure they are eating healthily and understand why it's important to eat healthily. If you're going to get taxed seven pence on a can of Coke and a proportion of that is going to be given to head teachers in primary schools across the country, is that money well spent or not? Incredibly well spent. What we've got to make sure is that we educate these children. And to educate those children, we need that new money. The benefits of Tim's personal mission to teach kids about food are clear. You guys are 11, right? Yes. So how many of you can cook? Me. That's all of them. Hello. This is quite a big deal for me because ten years ago when I came here, the food was terrible. And this is beautiful. You know, everything that Tim's doing here is about raising kids who are more likely to lead healthier, longer, more productive lives. For a nationwide sugary drinks tax to work, the money raised must be ring-fenced to help fight the problem. I want to show the government how it's done. I've committed to a tax in my restaurants, but can I get others to join me? It's going to take some convincing, so I've called in some leading experts to help me. These guys are all CEOs, directors and founders of some of the biggest and brightest restaurant groups in the UK. I'm really excited that we've got some amazing businesses from the restaurant industry in the room. If I can do just some broad strokes about where Britain is right now with public health. We have some of the most unhealthy kids in Europe. The single biggest reason for a child being put under general anaesthetic is actually to have multiple teeth extractions. So here we've got a pile of 130 legs and this represents the expected amount of amputations every single week in Britain just from diabetes. 7,000 a year. And it's just not acceptable. Doing nothing I think is unforgivable. What I'm kind of heading for is a kind of self-inflicted tax on sugary drinks. I don't think I'm mad. I know it's important. Graham, why sugar? Well sugar is a completely unnecessary source of calories. We have this crisis of obesity and absolutely nothing has happened in the last five years and that is a scandal. We're just allowing our children to become obese, everyone else to get obese and they're dying of it completely unnecessarily. We need to change. One way of changing this is to have a tax. In terms of implementing something like this in the restaurant, I wonder whether there is another way for us particularly that might implement something where you actually steer people towards something that's better. Trying to persuade people to do something has not worked in terms of obesity or many of the other nutrition related diseases. You know I think there are other ways that one can potentially attack the problem. Putting this tax on it would firstly discourage people from drinking sugary drinks and also raising the money for education in schools and for the health service would be a really fantastic thing as well because we do need money to address the obesity crisis. Tim, what difference would that money make? Most essentially what it would fund is a healthier outcome for the school children of, you know, across Britain. Does it have the power to help curb kids leaving primary school overweight or obese? I challenge anyone here to come to my school and find three children that will be leaving my school obese. We are proof that it works. This kind of levy should kickstart the government and say what the hell are we doing sitting in Whitehall not producing any kind of strategy and here are these guys who are taking it on their own to do something. I would be 100% behind you in what you're trying to do. Thank you, Tam. There is precedent. Mexico are doing it, seeing the benefits of lower consumption and money raised. I think the restaurant industry absolutely has the power and the kind of verve and excitement and access to the public to do it beautifully. That was intense. Time to find out if anyone's up for it. It's a huge opportunity and it's a journey that we're on. I think we need to mull it over. How is this right for our business? What is it for Costa and then Whitbread and all the board names? I think it's something we may well be interested in as a business but it's that big stack of legs that really confessed me. I didn't really realise quite how dramatic the problem was. We'll look at how we can get involved. I'd like to try and help. Any kind of tax is a tough sell but I believe this is different and I'm determined to get this off the ground. My biggest worry is the urgency, the urgency in which change is needed. And I know personally that I hate doing nothing. So definitely a rocket up the arse of the government is a really positive thing. We want them briefed and working hard for us and it's going to be really interesting to see if an industry that's connected to food can come together as a unified voice. The tax will roll out in my UK restaurants this autumn. I hope some of the other restaurants will decide to join me but what I really want is for the government to start listening. This is what's at stake. The kids of Britain, right? Their health, their wellbeing. Where will they be in 10, 15, 20 years? Where will their kids be? I believe we can make change happen but I need your help because this really matters and I want us to make a whole load of noise about it. If you think we should introduce a national sugary drinks tax then please, please get online and show your support now. Go to channel4.com/sugarrush and sign. It's that simple and the more people that sign up, the more voices get heard and the more pressure it puts on the government to change their strategy. We need a sugary drinks tax and that billion pounds we can raise a year, that can be spent in schools all across Britain, in hospitals all across Britain, in nurseries. That's what we need and this, this is what it's all about. 翻譯成中文","completion":"This appears to be an excerpt from a documentary or program led by a campaigner, likely Jamie Oliver, focused on the issue of excessive sugar consumption, especially among children. The text emphasizes the severe health consequences of a high-sugar diet, such as tooth decay, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, even in young children. It includes vivid descriptions of the effects on individual health, the strain on medical services, and the normalization of sugary drinks in people's diets. The campaigner seems to have taken initiative to reduce sugar intake by proposing a sugary drinks tax, illustrating the amount of sugar hidden in common food products, and highlighting how marketing strategies target children. There's also a discussion of international examples, like Mexico's sugary drinks tax, to show the potential effectiveness of such measures. The text is a call to action, urging people to support a national sugary drinks tax in the UK, emphasizing the potential to invest raised funds into health and education to create a lasting positive impact on public welfare, particularly for children."},{"prompt":"David (21); university student; finds his sister’s friends ‘common’.

We wouldn't dream of disturbing your profound thoughts. Ruth and Aimee sit down opposite David. Aimee keeps her eyes locked on David, her face an expression of playful mischief. AIMEE (leaning forward) You know, David, I've been reading about this fascinating subject. Psychologically speaking, it's quite remarkable. DAVID (somewhat interested) Oh? And what's that? AIMEE The power of suggestion and the mind. Hypnosis, actually. It's a bit like when you're so focused on your studies that the world around you might as well not exist. David chuckles dismissively. DAVID You think you can hypnotize me? AIMEE (nodding) With the right techniques, anyone can be hypnotized. Even you. It's all about confusion and focus. RUTH (teasing) Yeah, David, let her try! David sighs, looking at Ruth with mild annoyance. DAVID Fine. Do your worst. But when this doesn't work, I expect an apology for wasting my time. Aimee leans even closer, her voice soft but compelling. She begins to speak rapidly, using disorienting language and ambiguous phrases.

David nods, his eyes starting to unfocus as he struggles to follow her convoluted verbal patterns.

Don't try to make sense, because in a moment, it's not about making but letting. David's eyes become heavy, his body language starts to relax. Ruth watches in amazement. AIMEE (softly) Because really, what's more comfortable? To fight or to give in? Like sinking into a soft, deep... relaxation. And isn't it interesting how the floor seems to pull, attract, compel. You might almost imagine, if you wanted to, that it's where you belong. David's posture slackens further; his resistance visibly fades away. AIMEE (gently) Now, as I count down from three to one, each number makes you feel more inclined to just... settle down on the floor, finding it to be the most agreeable place right now.

David, now in a deep trance, slowly slides out of his chair and onto the floor, sitting at Aimee's feet with a serene expression on his face. Ruth gasps, both shocked and amused.

The food-court at the shopping-centre, Friday afternoon. *Script written by an expert in street hypnosis and particularly confusion inductions.* In which Aimee puts David into a deep trance, teasing and making fun of him, even while she's doing it. Giving him suggestions that he belongs on the floor, at her feet.","completion":"INT. FOOD-COURT - SHOPPING CENTRE - FRIDAY AFTERNOON RUTH, DAVID, and AIMEE sit around a table cluttered with the remnants of their meal. David is absorbed in his phone, his attitude aloof. Aimee, a spark of mischief in her eyes, exchanges a knowing look with Ruth. RUTH (casually) Hey, David, Aimee here tells me she's been learning some cool psychology stuff for school. It’s pretty interesting. DAVID (smirks, without looking up) What, like basic psychology? Cute. AIMEE (leaning in, playful) More than just 'basic', actually. It's about how the mind can play interesting tricks… even your mind, David. David finally looks up, his interest piqued despite himself. He chuckles, a mix of skepticism and amusement. DAVID Okay, Aimee. Enlighten me. What kind of tricks? AIMEE (grinning) Ever heard of hypnosis? DAVID (laughing) Hypnosis? Come on. That’s just for stage shows and movies. AIMEE (confidently) That’s a common misunderstanding. It's actually quite real and powerful. Want to experience it? David smirks, thinking he’ll humor her. DAVID Sure, go ahead. Hypnotize me. Make me cluck like a chicken. AIMEE (smiling) That’s a bit cliché, don’t you think? How about something more subtle? Something that could prove to you that hypnosis is quite—well, persuasive. RUTH (teasingly) Yeah, David, don’t chickens out. The sisters exchange a quick giggle. David rolls his eyes but leans back, arms crossed, a challenging look on his face. AIMEE (softly) Just look at me, David. And as you do, just focus on my words and notice how your breath starts to slow... With each word I say, perhaps your eyes will start to feel heavier, just like that feeling before you drift into sleep... Now, I'm not saying you'll fall asleep or even become hypnotized, but just imagine what it would feel like if you did. David is trying to maintain an air of skepticism but finds himself intrigued by Aimee's confident manner. AIMEE (CONT'D) Focus on the sound of my voice, the rhythm of your own breath, and how your eyelids are—surprisingly heavy, aren’t they? David’s eyelids begin to flutter; his breath deepens involuntarily. AIMEE (CONT'D) (gently) Now, as you find it harder to keep your eyes open, you can just allow yourself to feel this interesting sensation. It's okay. It's just an experiment, after all. David’s arms unfold and drop to his sides as his resistance starts to crumble. AIMEE (CONT'D) (speaking softly) That’s right... Now, I want you to imagine that your body is becoming very light, almost as if you could float out of your chair. But as light as you feel, your feet begin to feel... strange. It’s like a pull, a gravity that doesn’t let go, sticking you... to the ground... David’s head nods forward slightly, eyes closed, his breath slow and steady. AIMEE (CONT'D) While the rest of you feels light, your mind clear and open, your feet, David, they know their place. They belong on the floor, don’t they? That’s where they feel right, where they feel secure, like you're connected to something stable. So let's extend that feeling... As Aimee continues to talk, David, now entranced, slides off his chair onto his knees, planted firmly on the floor. Aimee almost conceals her surprise at his compliance. AIMEE (CONT'D) (teasing) Look at you, David, so relaxed and grounded at my feet. You always seemed so high and mighty; turns out, you’re pretty down to earth. Ruth stifles a laugh, watching David kneel on the ground, looking serene and pliant. AIMEE (CONT'D) (softly) In a moment, I'm going to wake you up, and you’ll remember this as just a lighthearted moment. You’ll feel refreshed and alert. But deep down, part of you will always remember how comfortable it felt to be here, at my feet, grounded. Aimee snaps her fingers lightly. AIMEE (CONT'D) (cheerfully) David, wake up! David shakes his head, blinking, looking around confused as he realizes he's on the floor. His pride dented, he quickly stands up, brushing off his clothes. DAVID (muttering) Okay, okay, you got me. That was weird. Ruth laughs openly now, and even David cracks a sheepish grin. AIMEE (playfully) Maybe next time, you won’t be so quick to judge what's common or not, right David? David nods reluctantly and sits back down, a new respect for Aimee dawning in his eyes.

From school dinners to processed junk. But now I'm going into my biggest battle ever. This time I'm taking on sugar. It's everywhere. It's in your food. Nobody would suspect that little pot to have nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar in it. In your drinks. Do most mothers feed their babies coke and breastfeed at the same time? Yeah, mostly everyone. And all over the UK press. More and more we're hearing calls from health experts to slash the amount of sugar in our diets. We're just allowing our children to have this. That is a scandal. And it's rich fever pitch when it comes to warnings about sugar and our health. We are red light flashing, flood lights, sirens, alarms. We're beyond red. I'm tired of all the talking and waiting around for something to be done while more and more people get sick. Children Becky's age should not have type 2 diabetes. The health system is collapsing. So I've decided to do something about it. It's going to get interesting pretty quick I think. We've all seen the headlines, unhealthy diets are putting incredible pressure on the NHS. But I don't think that we really understand what that means. I'm here at St George's Hospital in London to try and get my head around it. This is recovery. This is the way through to see Mario. What's going on here is nothing to do with being overweight or obese. Hi buddy. Hi. This is Mario. These are all the x-rays we've taken of Mario. Look at the tooth in front. Nearly all decayed. It's just a shell. That's just a big lump of bacteria. That's empty. Well what we do is blow in and out of here. That's great. Like this. OK. Six year old Mario is a healthy boy who regularly cleans his teeth. But he's got a real weakness for sugary drinks. This is a bit of a tough watch, but it's important to see. Is he breathing for himself now? So now you're breathing for him. The machine's taking over. It's so quick and absolutely brutal. The only way to get the teeth out is to yank them out. In my head, this environment that's expensive and full of care and you kind of get it when it's for cancers and this and the other and poor kids with leukaemia and stuff like that. This is tooth decay? Yes. From sugar? From sugar. So fast, exhausting work and they've got another five kids to get through this morning. Now Mario is off to recovery where he'll be reunited with his parents. Absolutely I mean to see a child put under that, that is really quite nerve wracking. Mario will be OK, but it's hard to see. He's OK. Let's get mum's out. Yeah, shall we get mum's out? Quite hard, big procedure and completely avoidable. How big is the problem? Massive. Oh my lord. That's just decay. It's decay that's gone right through the tooth, all the way through the enamel, through to the middle of the tooth, into the nerve and so they're just rotten. And if they have 20 teeth, which is a full set of children's teeth and they all need to come out. 20 teeth? 20 teeth, that happens routinely. That's not exceptional or rare, that's frequent. The problem then comes if the decay carries on into the adult teeth and those adult teeth need to be lost. That's happening routinely now, we see that frequently. We'll often replace them with dentures. False teeth? False teeth. So the sugar is pretty much responsible for most of this? Not pretty much entirely. It doesn't matter how well you brush your teeth, if you do it twice a day, if you constantly sip or eat sugar throughout the day, you can easily overwhelm any preventative regime you do. So you can brush all day, it won't make a difference. It's not just Mario. Each year 26,000 primary school aged kids go to hospital just because of rotten teeth. Pulling out kids' teeth costs the NHS around ??30 million a year. Sugar is the biggest source of children going to hospital in the country. The numbers are enormous, they're terrifying and it's the biggest pressing problem we have. We are red light, flashing, floodlights, sirens, alarms. We're beyond red. The demand for our services, particularly for children's teeth, is absolutely overwhelming. Today's definitely shocked me. You step outside the building and you see this institution called the hospital and we're kind of taking the piss out of it. We're putting it under extraordinary pressure. You know, it's getting absolutely ridiculous. We need to help these guys do their job and focus on the things that really matter, not pulling out bloody teeth because there's too much sugary shit in the environment. I definitely feel fired up, definitely up for a bit of a fight. It isn't just the kids that are getting caught out by too much sugar. The World Health Organisation are so worried they've told us we all need to cut back. Experts here agree and have now recommended adults have no more than seven teaspoons of sugar a day. Pretty terrifying then that many people in the UK are getting through over 40. Experts are worried about what they call free sugars. So that's any extra sugars added to food and drink, plus sugars found in honey and syrup and even natural sugars found in fruit juices. I've asked my mate Lucy to show me how sugar could be getting into our everyday diets without us even realising. So here's a cake. We know we shouldn't be having that every day, but it's not about cake really is it? Not all about cake. What bit worries you the most? How much sugar we're consuming without realising it, without it being in these obvious bits. So what's hidden in the everyday food that we don't assume have any sugar in. Can we start by going through like some typical meal options for a day and I can explain it to you much better that way. So where do we start? Breakfast. Can you pour out a like normal breakfast serving for brown flakes? I mean that is quite a blokey portion. To my brown flakes I'm adding some milk, some low-fat lemon yoghurt and berries. Lucy has picked products that we would think of as healthy and selected the brand with the highest sugar content. Can I get you to guess how much free sugar is in your lovely breakfast there? I've got no clue. 56.4 grams. Doesn't sound great. Which in teaspoons is 14.1. Oh shit the bed. How do we get to that much? Okay so let's do this in teaspoons which is 4 grams. There were roughly 5 teaspoons of added sugar in my man-sized serving of brown flakes. Nearly 3 teaspoons in my portion of yoghurt and over 6 teaspoons of free sugar in my orange juice. If the experts are saying we should have no more than 7 teaspoons a day, that's twice the amount just for this breakfast. Let's move on to lunch. Tomato soup and bread. Would you think either of those have a significant amount of sugar in? You'll have natural sugars from the tomatoes and I don't know if they've sweetened the bread but it looks fairly branded so I imagine there is a bit of added sugar. Let's have a little look. Different brands can have different amounts of sugar so you need to check the labels. Sadly labels don't list the value for added sugars but comparing the total sugars in similar products can help us estimate. Some wholemeal bread has nearly twice as much sugar and this cream of tomato soup has about 2 teaspoons more than some other brands. So this healthy looking lunch would add about 3 more teaspoons of free sugar to your day. Next up, an afternoon snack and a drink. So most people would feel that that's a pretty healthy snack, it's not something to be too concerned about. In half of this bottle there is 3 and a half teaspoons of sugar. I thought it was water. Oh it's flavoured water. In one bottle, which most of us would drink, there is 7 teaspoons of sugar. That's sweet, ok. In this bar not many of us would think that there's actually 2 teaspoons of sugar in it. So that's 9 teaspoons of sugar in a healthy looking snack. So what next? I'm going to cheer you up, I'm going to get you to do some cooking for dinner. Next up, Lucy wants me to whip up a good old stir fry. Now I haven't cheeked out on you, we've got a lemon and ginger stir fry sauce. So I'd just like you to add that in. That's the amount for 2 people. So by adding that sauce in, you've just increased the sugar content by nearly 10 teaspoons per person. Per person! Even if I was making a sweet and sour dish, I mean you know, of course sugar has the amazing ability to balance tartness and even balance bitterness. I would never add 10 teaspoons per person. And this really epitomises hidden sugar, because nobody would suspect that little pot to have nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar in it. That's crazy. And once you've tot up your breakfast, your lunch, your snack and your evening meal, you're actually having roughly 36 teaspoons of sugar. That's too much. Whenever you buy something that's in a packet or in a bottle, read the label, because you cannot tell if it's got added sugar in it until you look at it. And even then, you can't tell the difference between total and added. This is a healthy looking day's food. No chocolate bars here, yet it's actually 5 times the amount of free sugar UK experts now say we should be having each day. 36 teaspoons when we should be aiming for less than 7. We urgently need to do something about this. Do you know what? I'm really bothered about all of this sugar in our food and drinks. And it isn't just about our kids' teeth being yanked out. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Experts warn that eating too much sugar can help make people obese, increasing their risk of developing diet-related illnesses like heart disease and some types of cancer. In the last few years, one disease in particular has gripped the UK, and I'm really worried about it. There's been this kind of cloud of doom. This disease, type 2 diabetes, that everyone's talking about, it's always associated with diet-related disease. I just don't know enough about it. I don't think enough people do. Like, what is it? How does it affect the body? So today I'm going to the Royal Free Hospital to find out about type 2 diabetes. I kind of need to get my head around it. All right, mate. Thank you. Type 2 diabetes is increasing on an alarming scale in the UK. There are currently 3.5 million people with the disease, costing the NHS almost ??9 billion per year. And it's only going to get worse if we continue the way that we're going. There are two main types of diabetes, but we're only talking about type 2 today, as that's the one that can be linked to lifestyle factors such as diet. This is a specialist foot clinic. Type 2 diabetes can affect the nerves and blood vessels, resulting in wounds that can become ulcers, and in the most extreme cases, can lead to amputations. So with Julian, we're checking both feet. Julian has recently had his foot amputated. I didn't know I had diabetes at the time. A couple of toes had gone gangrenous and got infected. They originally took the three toes off, and it was only about a month ago that they did this later surgery. But it couldn't happen to me. I'm not sure they had diabetes, but they did. This is at the hard end of diet-related disease, isn't it? It is. And unfortunately, it's not more common than you might think. So in the UK, there's up to about 7,000 amputations, low-limb amputations a year. That would shock people. I mean, that's got to be, what, 130 people a week? It is. That's extraordinary. Losing limbs, removing limbs, trying to save limbs all feels quite medieval to me. I find it utterly shocking. Were you expecting to lose your leg? No. No. So it must have been an ordeal. No, the first thought I had was they took three toes. When I think about amputations, it's usually in relation to the Paralympics or because of war. Hello, Ralph. Hello. How are you, mate? I'm doing research, and in 13 years of British combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, there were around 300 amputations. Come on, then, Sharkey. But 7,000 amputations just in a year in the UK due to diabetes, I find heartbreaking. Why aren't we talking about this more? Diabetes is already 10% of the NHS budget. That's extraordinary. Yes. And just for type 2, that's 8.8 billion. So the future ain't looking bright, is it? Well, if there's this continued rise in obesity, it's going to be a huge, huge burden on the households. So how worried are you about that? As a fellow countryman and medical practitioner, I mean, like, are we green? Are we amber? Or are we flashing red? I think we're flashing red. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I think that's accepted. This burden is only going to get worse now that type 2 diabetes is increasingly affecting our kids. So I'm now off to see a 15-year-old girl with type 2 diabetes, which is scary and shocking. And this is a disease that used to be for old people in their 70s and 80s, and it's getting younger and younger and younger. And I'm struggling with the words to say how angry I am and how upset I am and how bothered I am. Until 20 years ago, there were virtually no kids in the UK with this disease. Now there's hundreds. Schoolgirl Becky was diagnosed aged just 13. Although in some cases genetics can play a role, the rapid rise in numbers is largely thought to be down to diet. And sugar is a big part of the problem. Hi! Come in! Nice to meet you. Come through. Thanks for having me. Obviously, type 2 is massively affected by diet. As a mother, I'm sure you were tracing back what would have happened to you. Yeah. I made some really poor choices. I started getting pocket money, and at the end of the day I'd just go into the corn shop, buy drinks and sweets and stuff and biscuits and chocolate. Looking back, I kind of fell out of the habit of cooking meals every day and got more into the habit of buying something that was quick and easy or buying a takeaway. As a parent, it is my responsibility to take care of my children. I mean, I had half an idea and was trying to get healthy things, but maybe if the packaging on the... But you're still getting it wrong. Yeah, I was still getting it wrong. Children Becky's age should not have type 2 diabetes. This should not be happening. And it's not just Becky. Becky has to keep a constant track of her blood sugar levels. If left untreated, abnormal levels can lead to potentially dangerous complications. Looks like something from Star Trek. Touch it in. I don't like needles. This is normal for me. You kind of get used to it. So you have to do this to yourself every day. You've got to take your own bloods. Yeah. Morning, night, after, like, breakfast and lunch and dinner and before. As long as you're monitoring it day and night to make sure it doesn't spike. That's a constant worry for you? Yeah, my friend, she actually went into a coma with her diabetes. That's how she was diagnosed, because she went into a coma. All of this monitoring and all the learning you've had to do, it's not really something I ever thought teenagers, 13, 14, 15-year-olds would have to deal with. It's quite annoying to have to try and be so responsible. When you usually get home, your mum makes dinner, you don't have to worry about it. Just don't have to think about it. Yeah. So basically what you're saying is having type 2 diabetes sucks. Yeah. It does. A lot. She's tagged this one - young and skinny. Mum Claire shows me when she started to see the problem. This is when she'd just started high school and that's when she really started to put the weight on. What are your worries for the future, then, for Becky? There's so many health complications she can get and even if she does lose the weight, the type 2 diabetes might not go away. In her whole life, it literally does, it makes your whole life based around what you can and can't eat, rather than being... A teenager. Being a teenager. In Britain today, one in five kids turn up at primary school at the age of four overweight or obese. But what's disgusting is when they leave at 11. One in three are overweight or obese. And that's not good. One of the biggest problems is that as a kid, it's pretty darn tough to escape sugar. It's everywhere. This is eight-year-old Ori and her mum, Ola. Could you just look at me a second? They're going to help me see the world from a child's perspective. This year, they reckon advertising spend in Britain is set to hit ??16 billion. And loads of these ads will reach our kids. So this is their local corner shop in Ryslip. So it's basically, if you track the little red dot, it's just showing where she's looking. And it's kind of about branding, really, and eye height and how companies or brands advertise to kids. Mummy. You can see her homing in on those drinks. That's amazing. OK, so now they're going to Tesco. Some sweet markets have recognised that it's not very ethical to kind of have all the sweets and sugary products next to the till. That's mental, because they're at the sweet-free checkouts. Please can I pop one to eat? But all the sweets are right next door. That's amazing. Look, around 70% of confectionery sales are impulse buys. So you can see why shops make them so easy to reach. Right, this is Superdrug. There's no sweets in the pharmacy, though, is there? Every checkout seems to have, even the pharmacy, there's a load of sweets. They're just everywhere. Look at her eye. Mum's got no chance. As many as 90% of snacks at a child's eye level at convenient supermarket checkouts are classified as unhealthy. Right, Marks and Spencers, what's going on in here? OK, cake's on the way in. And cake's on the way out. I love it. Top and tail end, double-ended. And look at that wall of Percy Pigs at Auri's eye level. It's terrible when you see it like this. M&S have recently committed to removing sweets from their tills, but many other retailers still do this. I've got to say, that's really interesting. I've been shopping with my kids, and it is aggro. I mean, you're always trying to keep the happy balance, and you're only 30 seconds away from anarchy with a load of kids. And it's just at that checkout bit, trying to get through. But I just think it's hard being a parent, because you can say no like five or six times. But when it's everywhere, when it's total sugar saturation, it's hard, isn't it? I asked the shops for an explanation. Tesco's came back and said, \\"We've replaced sweets and chocolates on the checkouts with a wide variety of healthier snacks that appeal to customers. We will continue to keep how we implement the policy under review.\\" Sadly Superdrug didn't get back to me. Next it's Saturday night primetime TV. Britain's Got Talent. Watched by 10 million people, shows like this often attract over 1 million child viewers, who can be exposed to up to 11 unhealthy food adverts an hour. These shows don't qualify as children's programming, so advertisers don't face the same Ofcom ban, preventing them from advertising foods high in fat, salt and sugar. Okay, so here we go. Straight in to a Coke advert. So take a look at this glossy ad, which to me seems to suggest if you drink Coke, you'll be happy, healthy and good at sport. There are regulations that protect children's programming against junk food, but this for me is even bigger. This is the big rating stuff. This is a family show. And we've had Coke. We're now on to Harry Bow. Oh, now McDonald's. So that's sort of interesting. I watch the show and I watch it with my kids. It's a family show. We love it. And I think the way that public health is going, that is probably inappropriate. Obesity is up. Type 2 diabetes is up. And too many kids are having all their teeth removed. Sugar is everywhere and sugary marketing feels inescapable. It's getting ridiculous. So what does the industry have to say about all of this? One spokesperson was bold enough to come and speak to me. Sugar, too much of it. Children we know having too much of certain types of food is bad for your health. Is it OK to market those aggressively to children? I don't think we do market them aggressively to children. If you look at the regulatory and self-regulatory codes, we work within those codes. And the reality is, is the masses of kids are online and watching shows like Britain's Got Talent, where they are being marketed. If the family's watching together, it's down to the parents to exercise discretion. But you don't do that, do you? Well, no, but they can talk about it, can't they? It doesn't just mean don't watch it. It means you can say to kids what you think is appropriate behaviour when the ads come on and I'm sure quite a lot of parents do do that. But too much sugar is very detrimental to your health. Too much anything is very detrimental to your health. Too much fat, too much salt. It's demonising... Not too much fruit and veg. Well, demonising one nutrient out of a whole range of them in the national menu is not going to be a helpful way to proceed. There is a hierarchy of nutrients. It's a problem, right? Well, obesity is a problem. And our position is very much about responsibility in this. Responsibility on the part of individual consumers, manufacturers, and of those who sell through the supermarkets or other shops, and of course through restaurants. At the moment, we're consuming lots more sugar than we're supposed to. We need to cut it quite drastically. Obviously sugar consumption in the UK per head is going down, not up, but from quite a high plateau. Now, the second report says that that's too much and they're the experts, so we have to listen to them. Sugar does seem to, kind of like if it was a badly behaved child, it would need to be put on the naughty step. And I'm saying it needs to go on the naughty step. But I think what you're saying is let feralness go? I mean, like, do you acknowledge that sugar is actually a problem? I think we acknowledge that excessive consumption of any single thing is a problem. OK, it's not statutory at the moment to say on any packaging about added sugars. Yeah. Well, one of the issues there is do people understand it? I mean, we've spent 80 years in this country educating people on the notion of calories and they've just about got it. If you start mucking about with the way you express these things, I think you put a barrier to people's understanding. Is it possible that businesses that need to make a profit can self-regulate successfully? Yeah. These businesses are responsible businesses. So yes, it is possible to do that. Our argument would be that the consumer's choice is the best way to go because government interventions simply don't work. Look, I get it, I run a business. Businesses need to make profit to exist, of course. But I always think that public health comes first, for sure. And self-regulation and personal responsibility isn't working. It's not working. And the fact is that it's not working because kids are getting sicker. That's why I think now is the time for the British government to step up and just get tougher on the industry's ass. One country where the government have been forced to take action on sugar is Mexico. It has some of the worst problems in the world, but could also offer some solutions. Thirty-five years ago, a third of people here were obese or overweight. Today, that figure has almost doubled, making them one of the fattest populations in the world. Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of death, with an estimated 8 million people affected. In 1994, a trade agreement with the USA allowed increasing levels of processed food and sugary drinks to flood local economies. Local Mexican diets rapidly shifted towards high-calorie, processed foods and sugary sweetened drinks. I'm meeting the man leading the charge against sugary brands in Mexico, prominent campaigner Alejandro Calvillo. Thank you so much for meeting me. You are in the country with the highest level of soda consumption in the world, one of the highest levels of diabetes, obesity, overweight, and a lot of sickness related with the junk food consumption. You know, the people here in the little communities in the mountains, in the rural areas, drink a lot, a lot of coke. The communities don't have water to drink of quality, but they have coke. Right, so you've got a problem then. And the health system is collapsing at this moment, because we have a lot of people with diabetes, with amputation, blindness related with diabetes. It's a human drama that we are living here. I want to see for myself how bad it really is. So I've asked Alejandro to show me how sugary products are being marketed in some of the poorer and more remote indigenous areas. Before we even reach the first town, we're greeted with some familiar branding. You are at the entrance of Sinacantan, one of the most important indigenous communities here in Chiapas. And you find this billboard that says, \\"Welcome to Sinacantan.\\" You see the coke bottle with the traditional dress of the woman here. The same as the girls behind me? Yes. This actual advertising is not just specific to the area, it's specific to this village. It's to this village. I mean, don't get me wrong, marketing is supposed to be efficient. Yes. This is very efficient. The problem is when your product is creating a health problem, you need to stop it. They cannot deal with the health impact of this level of soda consumption. These huge village-specific Coca-Cola billboards are the welcome signs to several indigenous villages in the Chiapas. The Coca-Cola bottling plant just 15 minutes down the road means that trucks here are often Coca-Cola red. Okay, so what are we looking at? Of the marketing and the promotion of soda consumption. You have all the soda there. Branding in the church, this is PepsiCo. I must say, it is kind of an ambush on the whole town. Next, Alejandro takes me to the Mayan village of San Juan de Mula. Communities here drink a lot of soda, over two litres per person per day. Too many sugary drinks can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and Alejandro is very concerned about the levels of the disease here. Why is it different here than the rest of Mexico then? Because the introduction of the soda consumption is so strong that it's part of the culture. They receive the Coke in the baby bottle. The kids receive all the time. Do the people in here today know about the scale of complexities and amputations? How many amputations do you have in Mexico? It's around, in 2013, 75,000 amputations. 75,000? Related with diabetes. So you're about twice the size of Britain, with like 10 times the problem. The problem is the health system. We don't have the capacity to deal with the... Saving lives. Yeah. Alejandro's concern is that soda, and in particular Coke, has become an intrinsic part of culture. I'm off to a family gathering in Romarillo to see this for myself. How you doing, man? Good. Thanks for having me. So this is the father-in-law's altar. So now we're going to the little ceremony. So how important is having fizzy drinks for this offering? It shows that we're thankful to the saints and to offer them the drink too. The tradition is that they are thirsty. This is very traditional amongst all of the community. Yeah. Coke will be offered up. Yeah. Every party. Every party, every... And if you didn't, it would simply not be right. Yeah. So the Coke's been embraced as a kind of spiritual, sort of authentic part of the experience. Yeah. Just looking around me now, there's all these lovely people, your family. Every one of them's got a massive big old bottle of Coke. I mean, how many of these will they be drinking a day, average? Average, they would be drinking like three or four bottles. Yeah. And then the little one here? We usually serve the little one too. Yeah. All the ages. So even... Because I noticed she was just breastfeeding a minute ago. Yeah. But she's straight on the soda as well. So you mix them both up. Yeah. Do most mothers feed their babies Coke and breastfeed at the same time? Yeah, mostly everyone. So this drink is really the modern holy water? Yeah. So, Vin Santo. Vin Coco. Vin Coco. Okay. Coke, successfully offered to the saints, time to cook up a feast. She's making mole, which is like the absolute classic dish. It's really, really good. This is like my idea of heaven. But this absolutely beautiful traditional dish seems completely at odds with the drink it's being served up with. It's interesting seeing the modern day place for soda so central to everything. Just the sheer quantity of Coke getting knocked back by three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 80 year olds. I haven't seen one kid drink a glass of water. It's all soda. So what did Coke have to say for themselves? We ensure our brands are marketed responsibly and never to children under 12. We offer low and no sugar options. We provide consumers with the information they need to make informed choices about our drinks. I'm shocked by what I've seen here, but the campaigners have been fighting back hard. A huge step forward in tackling the problem was the introduction of a soda tax in 2014. I'm keen to ask Alejandro how it's worked so far. And I wonder if it could provide part of the solution to our problems back home. So you've achieved a soda tax of 10%. What is it? The soda tax applies only for the drinks that have sugar added. And how much? It's one peso per litre. That is like 10% of the price. Right. OK. And how much money is that raising a year? In 2014, the revenue was 1.2 billion. That's good. New money. And did you see any drop off in consumption? In the first quarter, we have the only independent research. We have a reduction of 10% of the soda consumption and increase in water consumption and increase in milk also. Wow. That's the story for Britain that I want to read. So what about the general public? Do they understand the logic between you take from Peter to pay Paul? Yes. You say to people, do you support the soda taxes? This money go to water fountain size schools? They say yes. 80% say yes. And now in Mexico, more than 80% make a very clear relation between soda consumption and diabetes. OK. Thank you. Because everything that you guys have been doing here kind of gives me hope. Now, you'll hear critics of these taxes saying it costs jobs and won't reduce how many sugary drinks people have. But the latest figures for Mexico's soda tax show that there's been a reduction in soda consumption of 6% and it's early days. There's definitely a long way to go in addressing the health crisis in Mexico. But I feel really inspired by Alejandro's victory. I reckon we should be doing the same here in Britain. Campaigners say a 20 pence per litre sugary drinks tax in the UK could raise up to a billion pounds a year, reduce obesity by around 200,000 people and save the NHS around 15 million pounds a year. You'll hear people argue that a tax like this is unfair on those who drink in moderation. But for me, we just need to take action. So would and could the British government impose their very own sugary drinks tax? I don't know and I'm definitely not going to hang around and wait to find out. But what I will do is put my neck on the line because I want to show them that it can work, it will work and that the money raised can go to places that will really make a difference in health. So I'm going to impose my very own sugary drinks tax in my restaurants. I'm introducing a sugary drinks tax in my own UK restaurants to show the government how it's done. I reckon I could raise around ??80,000 a year and I want to spend that cash on children's food education. Just imagine what we could achieve if we had a tax on a national scale and use that cash to help schools and inspire children to make better choices. This was one of my schools 10 years ago in school dinners campaign. This is Charlemanor and if we're going to tax sugary drinks, seven pence on a can, then there's a billion pounds a year raised through that. And I think a massive chunk of that should go into primary schools across Britain to support teachers and support learning. And if you want to know what a school looks like when they put food at the heart of it, come and have a look at this. Let's have a look. OK, here we go. Head teacher Tim Baker has put food and cooking at the very centre of his school and the lessons. Hello. And the school and pupils are reaping the rewards in great results. What we're teaching is cooking skills. We know English and maths are essential life skills, but actually cooking skills are life's necessities. What are you cooking with today? Beetroot. Hands up if you like beetroot. Me! Me! Me! It's not very often you get an army of kids saying they love beetroot. Where do you get your beetroot from? Here. So who's going to take me there to get some? Me! Me! Me! The kids even have their own garden where they grow all kinds of food for cooking and learning. Oh, wow. So who's going to pull the beetroot out for me? Me! That's it, go on. Whee! These are lovely beetroots. Well, good luck with the cake baking. Is it going to taste nice? It's going to be yummy. It has honey. Honey from the bees. But you haven't got bees here, though. We do have bees. Have you? Bees? Look, bee honey. The responsibility for primary schools is to enable the children to learn and to be successful. And so we have a responsibility to ensure they are eating healthily and understand why it's important to eat healthily. If you're going to get taxed seven pence on a can of Coke and a proportion of that is going to be given to head teachers in primary schools across the country, is that money well spent or not? Incredibly well spent. What we've got to make sure is that we educate these children. And to educate those children, we need that new money. The benefits of Tim's personal mission to teach kids about food are clear. You guys are 11, right? Yes. So how many of you can cook? Me. That's all of them. Hello. This is quite a big deal for me because ten years ago when I came here, the food was terrible. And this is beautiful. You know, everything that Tim's doing here is about raising kids who are more likely to lead healthier, longer, more productive lives. For a nationwide sugary drinks tax to work, the money raised must be ring-fenced to help fight the problem. I want to show the government how it's done. I've committed to a tax in my restaurants, but can I get others to join me? It's going to take some convincing, so I've called in some leading experts to help me. These guys are all CEOs, directors and founders of some of the biggest and brightest restaurant groups in the UK. I'm really excited that we've got some amazing businesses from the restaurant industry in the room. If I can do just some broad strokes about where Britain is right now with public health. We have some of the most unhealthy kids in Europe. The single biggest reason for a child being put under general anaesthetic is actually to have multiple teeth extractions. So here we've got a pile of 130 legs and this represents the expected amount of amputations every single week in Britain just from diabetes. 7,000 a year. And it's just not acceptable. Doing nothing I think is unforgivable. What I'm kind of heading for is a kind of self-inflicted tax on sugary drinks. I don't think I'm mad. I know it's important. Graham, why sugar? Well sugar is a completely unnecessary source of calories. We have this crisis of obesity and absolutely nothing has happened in the last five years and that is a scandal. We're just allowing our children to become obese, everyone else to get obese and they're dying of it completely unnecessarily. We need to change. One way of changing this is to have a tax. In terms of implementing something like this in the restaurant, I wonder whether there is another way for us particularly that might implement something where you actually steer people towards something that's better. Trying to persuade people to do something has not worked in terms of obesity or many of the other nutrition related diseases. You know I think there are other ways that one can potentially attack the problem. Putting this tax on it would firstly discourage people from drinking sugary drinks and also raising the money for education in schools and for the health service would be a really fantastic thing as well because we do need money to address the obesity crisis. Tim, what difference would that money make? Most essentially what it would fund is a healthier outcome for the school children of, you know, across Britain. Does it have the power to help curb kids leaving primary school overweight or obese? I challenge anyone here to come to my school and find three children that will be leaving my school obese. We are proof that it works. This kind of levy should kickstart the government and say what the hell are we doing sitting in Whitehall not producing any kind of strategy and here are these guys who are taking it on their own to do something. I would be 100% behind you in what you're trying to do. Thank you, Tam. There is precedent. Mexico are doing it, seeing the benefits of lower consumption and money raised. I think the restaurant industry absolutely has the power and the kind of verve and excitement and access to the public to do it beautifully. That was intense. Time to find out if anyone's up for it. It's a huge opportunity and it's a journey that we're on. I think we need to mull it over. How is this right for our business? What is it for Costa and then Whitbread and all the board names? I think it's something we may well be interested in as a business but it's that big stack of legs that really confessed me. I didn't really realise quite how dramatic the problem was. We'll look at how we can get involved. I'd like to try and help. Any kind of tax is a tough sell but I believe this is different and I'm determined to get this off the ground. My biggest worry is the urgency, the urgency in which change is needed. And I know personally that I hate doing nothing. So definitely a rocket up the arse of the government is a really positive thing. We want them briefed and working hard for us and it's going to be really interesting to see if an industry that's connected to food can come together as a unified voice. The tax will roll out in my UK restaurants this autumn. I hope some of the other restaurants will decide to join me but what I really want is for the government to start listening. This is what's at stake. The kids of Britain, right? Their health, their wellbeing. Where will they be in 10, 15, 20 years? Where will their kids be? I believe we can make change happen but I need your help because this really matters and I want us to make a whole load of noise about it. If you think we should introduce a national sugary drinks tax then please, please get online and show your support now. Go to channel4.com/sugarrush and sign. It's that simple and the more people that sign up, the more voices get heard and the more pressure it puts on the government to change their strategy. We need a sugary drinks tax and that billion pounds we can raise a year, that can be spent in schools all across Britain, in hospitals all across Britain, in nurseries. That's what we need and this, this is what it's all about. 將以上文章翻譯成中文","completion":"我已经花了过去10年时间倡导为我们的孩子提供更好的食物。 从学校的晚餐到加工的垃圾食品。 但现在，我即将面临我有史以来最大的战斗。 这次我要挑战糖。 糖无处不在。 它存在于你的食物中。 没有人会怀疑那小罐里竟然含有将近20茶匙的糖。 在你的饮料里。 大多数母亲在给婴儿喂可乐的同时还会母乳喂养吗？ 是的，几乎每个人都这样。 而且整个英国媒体上到处都是。 越来越多，我们听到来自健康专家的呼声，要减少我们饮食中的糖分。 我们只是任由我们的孩子拥有这些。 那是一个丑闻。 关于糖和我们健康的警告已经到了高潮。 我们是红灯闪烁，泛光灯，警报声，警钟响起。 我们已经超出了红色警戒。 我厌倦了所有的谈话和等待着有人做些什么，而越来越多的人生病了。 像Becky这样年龄的孩子不应该患有2型糖尿病。 医疗系统正在崩溃。 所以我决定要做点什么。 这会很快变得有趣。 我们都看到了标题，不健康的饮食给NHS带来了巨大压力。 但我不认为我们真正理解这意味着什么。 我在伦敦的圣乔治医院，试着去搞明白。 这是恢复区。 这是通往Mario的路。 这里发生的事情与超重或肥胖无关。 嗨，伙计。 嗨。 这是Mario。 这是我们为Mario拍摄的所有X光片。 看前面的牙齿。 几乎全部腐烂。 只是一个壳。 那只是一大块细菌。 那是空的。 我们将在这里吹气。 就像这样。 好极了。 像这样。 6岁的Mario是一个健康的孩子，经常刷牙。 但他非常喜欢喝含糖的饮料。 这有点难看，但很重要去看。 他现在自己呼吸吗？ 所以现在你在帮他呼吸。 机器接管了。 这太快且绝对残酷了。 唯一取出牙齿的方法是将它们拔出。 在我脑海中，这个环境是昂贵的，并充满了关怀，你很理解当它是为了癌症和这样那样，以及不幸的孩子患有白血病等情况。 这是牙齿腐烂？ 是的。 因为糖？ 因为糖。 如此之快，筋疲力尽的工作，他们今天早上还得处理另外五个孩子。 现在Mario要去复苏室，他会与父母团聚。 绝对，看到一个孩子接受那样的治疗真的令人非常紧张。 Mario会没事，但看起来很难受。 他好了。 我们让妈妈出来吧。 是的，我们让妈妈出来吧。 相当大的程序，完全可以避免。 问题的规模有多大？ 巨大。 哦，我的天哪。 这只是腐烂。 腐烂穿透了整个牙齿，穿过釉质，到达牙齿中间，进入神经，所以它们只是腐烂了。 如果他们有20颗牙齿，这是儿童牙齿的整套，他们所有的牙齿都需要拔掉。 20颗牙齿？ 20颗牙齿，这是常规的。 这不是特例或罕见，这很频繁。 如果腐烂继续影响成年牙齿，而那些成年牙齿需要被拔除。 这现在经常发生，我们经常看到。 我们常常用假牙来替换牙齿。 假牙？ 假牙。 所以糖几乎完全是造成这一切的原因？ 不仅仅是几乎完全。 如果你刷牙做得很好，一天两次，如果你整天不断地小口喝糖或吃糖，你很容易压倒任何预防措施。 所以即使你整天刷牙，也不会有区别。 不仅仅是Mario。 每年都有26,000名小学年龄的孩子因为腐烂的牙齿去医院。 给孩子们拔牙每年花费NHS约3千万英镑。 糖是导致孩子们在英国去医院的最大来源。 这些数字是巨大的，令人恐惧，这是我们面临的最大迫切问题。 我们是红灯闪烁，泛光灯，警报声，警钟响起。 我们已经超出了红色警戒。 我们服务的需求，尤其是儿童牙齿的服务，绝对是压倒性的。 今天肯定让我震惊了。 你走出建筑物远离医院这个称号，你会看到我们有点在利用它。 我们给它带来了不同寻常的压力。 你知道，这变得绝对可笑了。 我们需要帮助这些家伙完成他们的工作，并专注于真正重要的事情，而不是因为环境中有太多的含糖垃圾食品而拔牙。 我绝对感觉被激发起来了，绝对准备为之一战。 不仅是孩子们很容易被过多的糖分所困扰。 世界卫生组织也非常担心，他们告诉我们我们都需要减少摄取的糖分。 专家们在这里同意，并且现在建议成年人每天的糖分摄入不超过七茶匙。 相当可怕的是，许多英国人每天摄入超过40茶匙。 专家们担心所谓的自由糖。 也就是说，在食物和饮料中添加的任何额外糖分，加上蜂蜜和糖浆中的糖分，甚至是果汁中的天然糖分。 我请我的朋友Lucy帮我看看糖是如何在我们日常饮食中悄悄摄入的，而我们甚至没有意识到。 这是一块蛋糕。 我们知道我们不应该每天都吃，但它并不仅仅是关于蛋糕，对吗？ 不全是关于蛋糕。 你最担心的部分是哪里？ 我们在不知不觉中摄入了太多的糖分，我们没有意识到。 所以隐藏在我们通常不认为含有任何糖分的日常食品中。 我们可以开始按一天的典型膳食选项来吃东西，我可以更好地向你解释。 那么我们从哪里开始？ 早餐。 你能不能倒一份正常早餐的麦片给我？ 我的意思是，那是相当壮硕的一份。 在我的麦片中，我加了一些牛奶、低脂柠檬酸奶和浆果。 Lucy挑选了我们会认为是健康食品的产品，并选择了含糖量最高的品牌。 我能让你猜猜你那可爱的早餐里有多少自由糖吗？ 我不知道。 56.4克。 听起来不太好。 用茶匙表示是14.1。 哦，天哪。 我们怎么会有这么多？ 好，那我们用茶匙换算一下，每茶匙4克。 我的男性大小的麦片中大约有5茶匙的糖。 我的酸奶中有近3茶匙的糖，而我的橙汁中有超过6茶匙的自由糖。 如果专家们说我们一天应该摄入的糖分不超过7茶匙，那这只是早餐的两倍。 接下来是午餐。 西红柿汤和面包。 你会认为这些中有一个含有大量的糖吗？ 你会有来自西红柿的天然糖，而我不知道他们是否给面包增甜了，但它看起来相当有品牌，所以我想是有一些添加糖的。 我们来看看吧。 不同品牌的糖含量不同，所以你需要检查标签。 遗憾的是，标签上没有列出添加糖的价值，但比较类似产品的总糖可以帮助我们估计。 有些全麦面包的糖含量几乎是其它品牌的两倍，而这款奶油西红柿汤比其他品牌多约2茶匙糖。 所以这个看起来健康的午餐将在你一天中增加约3茶匙的自由糖。 接下来，下午的小吃和饮料。 所以大多数人会觉得这是一个相当健康的小吃，这不是什么值得太担心的事情。 这半瓶里有3.5茶匙的糖。 我以为是水。 哦，它是有味道的水。 在一瓶中，我们大多数人会喝，有7茶匙的糖。 这就是甜的，好了。 在这个酒吧里，我们不是很多人会认为实际上有2茶匙的糖在里面。 所以在一个看起来健康的小吃中，有9茶匙的糖。 那么接下来呢？ 我要让你高兴起来，我要让你晚餐时做些饭菜。 接下来，Lucy想让我快速炒一份好心提。 现在，我不是来欺负你的，我们有一款柠檬生姜炒酱。 所以我想请你把它加进去。 那是两个人的量。 所以在添加了那种酱料后，你将每人增加了近10茶匙的糖含量。 每人！ 即便我是在做甜酸菜，我知道糖有平衡酸度甚至平衡苦味的不可思议的能力。 我永远不会每人添加10茶匙糖。 这真正体现了隐藏的糖分，因为没有人会怀疑那小罐里竟然含有将近20茶匙的糖。 太疯狂了。 在你加起来你的早餐、午餐、小吃和晚餐之后，你实际上每天摄入的糖分约为36茶匙。 太多了。 每当你购买一个包装好的东西或在瓶子里的东西，阅读标签，因为你无法判断它是否有添加的糖在里面，直到你看到它。 即便你这样做了，你也不能分辨总糖和添加糖的区别。 这是一天中看似健康的食物。 这里没有巧克力条，然而它实际上是我们应该每天摄入自由糖量的5倍。 36茶匙的糖，我们的目标是少于7茶匙。 我们迫切需要做一些事情。 你知道吗？我真的很担心我们食物和饮料中所有这些糖分。 这不仅仅是我们孩子的牙齿要被拔掉。 那只是问题的冰山一角。 专家警告称，摄入过多的糖分可以帮助人们变得肥胖，增加患有与饮食相关疾病的风险，如心脏病和某些类型的癌症。 在过去的几年里，一个特别的疾病在英国引起了广泛关注，我对此非常担心。 一直有这种笼罩着厄运的云。 这种疾病，2型糖尿病，每个人都在谈论，它总是与与饮食相关的疾病有关。 我只是不了解它的足够多。 我不认为足够多的人这样做。 像，那是什么？ 它如何影响身体？ 所以今天我将去皇家自由医院了解2型糖尿病。 我必须搞清楚它。 所有。"},{"prompt":"Write a letter to the special officer of the translation wing, Guwahati High Court at the translation to do the verification or which has been done by a student the name of whom you are not family with his result with all types of various like spelling mistakes and in coherent sentences sometimes there are parts of sentences which are not very clear that's why you have to read the whole thing any of the reach you have to reach translate the whole document and while translate in the document you have seen the translation","completion":"[Your Full Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date] Special Officer Translation Wing Guwahati High Court [Address] Guwahati, [ZIP Code] Subject: Verification of Translation Accuracy Dear Special Officer, I hope this letter finds you in the best of health and spirits.

From school dinners to processed junk. But now I'm going into my biggest battle ever. This time I'm taking on sugar. It's everywhere. It's in your food. Nobody would suspect that little pot to have nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar in it. In your drinks. Do most mothers feed their babies coke and breastfeed at the same time? Yeah, mostly everyone. And all over the UK press. More and more we're hearing calls from health experts to slash the amount of sugar in our diets. We're just allowing our children to have this. That is a scandal. And it's rich fever pitch when it comes to warnings about sugar and our health. We are red light flashing, flood lights, sirens, alarms. We're beyond red. I'm tired of all the talking and waiting around for something to be done while more and more people get sick. Children Becky's age should not have type 2 diabetes. The health system is collapsing. So I've decided to do something about it. It's going to get interesting pretty quick I think. We've all seen the headlines, unhealthy diets are putting incredible pressure on the NHS. But I don't think that we really understand what that means. I'm here at St George's Hospital in London to try and get my head around it. This is recovery. This is the way through to see Mario. What's going on here is nothing to do with being overweight or obese. Hi buddy. Hi. This is Mario. These are all the x-rays we've taken of Mario. Look at the tooth in front. Nearly all decayed. It's just a shell. That's just a big lump of bacteria. That's empty. Well what we do is blow in and out of here. That's great. Like this. OK. Six year old Mario is a healthy boy who regularly cleans his teeth. But he's got a real weakness for sugary drinks. This is a bit of a tough watch, but it's important to see. Is he breathing for himself now? So now you're breathing for him. The machine's taking over. It's so quick and absolutely brutal. The only way to get the teeth out is to yank them out. In my head, this environment that's expensive and full of care and you kind of get it when it's for cancers and this and the other and poor kids with leukaemia and stuff like that. This is tooth decay? Yes. From sugar? From sugar. So fast, exhausting work and they've got another five kids to get through this morning. Now Mario is off to recovery where he'll be reunited with his parents. Absolutely I mean to see a child put under that, that is really quite nerve wracking. Mario will be OK, but it's hard to see. He's OK. Let's get mum's out. Yeah, shall we get mum's out? Quite hard, big procedure and completely avoidable. How big is the problem? Massive. Oh my lord. That's just decay. It's decay that's gone right through the tooth, all the way through the enamel, through to the middle of the tooth, into the nerve and so they're just rotten. And if they have 20 teeth, which is a full set of children's teeth and they all need to come out. 20 teeth? 20 teeth, that happens routinely. That's not exceptional or rare, that's frequent. The problem then comes if the decay carries on into the adult teeth and those adult teeth need to be lost. That's happening routinely now, we see that frequently. We'll often replace them with dentures. False teeth? False teeth. So the sugar is pretty much responsible for most of this? Not pretty much entirely. It doesn't matter how well you brush your teeth, if you do it twice a day, if you constantly sip or eat sugar throughout the day, you can easily overwhelm any preventative regime you do. So you can brush all day, it won't make a difference. It's not just Mario. Each year 26,000 primary school aged kids go to hospital just because of rotten teeth. Pulling out kids' teeth costs the NHS around ??30 million a year. Sugar is the biggest source of children going to hospital in the country. The numbers are enormous, they're terrifying and it's the biggest pressing problem we have. We are red light, flashing, floodlights, sirens, alarms. We're beyond red. The demand for our services, particularly for children's teeth, is absolutely overwhelming. Today's definitely shocked me. You step outside the building and you see this institution called the hospital and we're kind of taking the piss out of it. We're putting it under extraordinary pressure. You know, it's getting absolutely ridiculous. We need to help these guys do their job and focus on the things that really matter, not pulling out bloody teeth because there's too much sugary shit in the environment. I definitely feel fired up, definitely up for a bit of a fight. It isn't just the kids that are getting caught out by too much sugar. The World Health Organisation are so worried they've told us we all need to cut back. Experts here agree and have now recommended adults have no more than seven teaspoons of sugar a day. Pretty terrifying then that many people in the UK are getting through over 40. Experts are worried about what they call free sugars. So that's any extra sugars added to food and drink, plus sugars found in honey and syrup and even natural sugars found in fruit juices. I've asked my mate Lucy to show me how sugar could be getting into our everyday diets without us even realising. So here's a cake. We know we shouldn't be having that every day, but it's not about cake really is it? Not all about cake. What bit worries you the most? How much sugar we're consuming without realising it, without it being in these obvious bits. So what's hidden in the everyday food that we don't assume have any sugar in. Can we start by going through like some typical meal options for a day and I can explain it to you much better that way. So where do we start? Breakfast. Can you pour out a like normal breakfast serving for brown flakes? I mean that is quite a blokey portion. To my brown flakes I'm adding some milk, some low-fat lemon yoghurt and berries. Lucy has picked products that we would think of as healthy and selected the brand with the highest sugar content. Can I get you to guess how much free sugar is in your lovely breakfast there? I've got no clue. 56.4 grams. Doesn't sound great. Which in teaspoons is 14.1. Oh shit the bed. How do we get to that much? Okay so let's do this in teaspoons which is 4 grams. There were roughly 5 teaspoons of added sugar in my man-sized serving of brown flakes. Nearly 3 teaspoons in my portion of yoghurt and over 6 teaspoons of free sugar in my orange juice. If the experts are saying we should have no more than 7 teaspoons a day, that's twice the amount just for this breakfast. Let's move on to lunch. Tomato soup and bread. Would you think either of those have a significant amount of sugar in? You'll have natural sugars from the tomatoes and I don't know if they've sweetened the bread but it looks fairly branded so I imagine there is a bit of added sugar. Let's have a little look. Different brands can have different amounts of sugar so you need to check the labels. Sadly labels don't list the value for added sugars but comparing the total sugars in similar products can help us estimate. Some wholemeal bread has nearly twice as much sugar and this cream of tomato soup has about 2 teaspoons more than some other brands. So this healthy looking lunch would add about 3 more teaspoons of free sugar to your day. Next up, an afternoon snack and a drink. So most people would feel that that's a pretty healthy snack, it's not something to be too concerned about. In half of this bottle there is 3 and a half teaspoons of sugar. I thought it was water. Oh it's flavoured water. In one bottle, which most of us would drink, there is 7 teaspoons of sugar. That's sweet, ok. In this bar not many of us would think that there's actually 2 teaspoons of sugar in it. So that's 9 teaspoons of sugar in a healthy looking snack. So what next? I'm going to cheer you up, I'm going to get you to do some cooking for dinner. Next up, Lucy wants me to whip up a good old stir fry. Now I haven't cheeked out on you, we've got a lemon and ginger stir fry sauce. So I'd just like you to add that in. That's the amount for 2 people. So by adding that sauce in, you've just increased the sugar content by nearly 10 teaspoons per person. Per person! Even if I was making a sweet and sour dish, I mean you know, of course sugar has the amazing ability to balance tartness and even balance bitterness. I would never add 10 teaspoons per person. And this really epitomises hidden sugar, because nobody would suspect that little pot to have nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar in it. That's crazy. And once you've tot up your breakfast, your lunch, your snack and your evening meal, you're actually having roughly 36 teaspoons of sugar. That's too much. Whenever you buy something that's in a packet or in a bottle, read the label, because you cannot tell if it's got added sugar in it until you look at it. And even then, you can't tell the difference between total and added. This is a healthy looking day's food. No chocolate bars here, yet it's actually 5 times the amount of free sugar UK experts now say we should be having each day. 36 teaspoons when we should be aiming for less than 7. We urgently need to do something about this. Do you know what? I'm really bothered about all of this sugar in our food and drinks. And it isn't just about our kids' teeth being yanked out. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Experts warn that eating too much sugar can help make people obese, increasing their risk of developing diet-related illnesses like heart disease and some types of cancer. In the last few years, one disease in particular has gripped the UK, and I'm really worried about it. There's been this kind of cloud of doom. This disease, type 2 diabetes, that everyone's talking about, it's always associated with diet-related disease. I just don't know enough about it. I don't think enough people do. Like, what is it? How does it affect the body? So today I'm going to the Royal Free Hospital to find out about type 2 diabetes. I kind of need to get my head around it. All right, mate. Thank you. Type 2 diabetes is increasing on an alarming scale in the UK. There are currently 3.5 million people with the disease, costing the NHS almost ??9 billion per year. And it's only going to get worse if we continue the way that we're going. There are two main types of diabetes, but we're only talking about type 2 today, as that's the one that can be linked to lifestyle factors such as diet. This is a specialist foot clinic. Type 2 diabetes can affect the nerves and blood vessels, resulting in wounds that can become ulcers, and in the most extreme cases, can lead to amputations. So with Julian, we're checking both feet. Julian has recently had his foot amputated. I didn't know I had diabetes at the time. A couple of toes had gone gangrenous and got infected. They originally took the three toes off, and it was only about a month ago that they did this later surgery. But it couldn't happen to me. I'm not sure they had diabetes, but they did. This is at the hard end of diet-related disease, isn't it? It is. And unfortunately, it's not more common than you might think. So in the UK, there's up to about 7,000 amputations, low-limb amputations a year. That would shock people. I mean, that's got to be, what, 130 people a week? It is. That's extraordinary. Losing limbs, removing limbs, trying to save limbs all feels quite medieval to me. I find it utterly shocking. Were you expecting to lose your leg? No. No. So it must have been an ordeal. No, the first thought I had was they took three toes. When I think about amputations, it's usually in relation to the Paralympics or because of war. Hello, Ralph. Hello. How are you, mate? I'm doing research, and in 13 years of British combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, there were around 300 amputations. Come on, then, Sharkey. But 7,000 amputations just in a year in the UK due to diabetes, I find heartbreaking. Why aren't we talking about this more? Diabetes is already 10% of the NHS budget. That's extraordinary. Yes. And just for type 2, that's 8.8 billion. So the future ain't looking bright, is it? Well, if there's this continued rise in obesity, it's going to be a huge, huge burden on the households. So how worried are you about that? As a fellow countryman and medical practitioner, I mean, like, are we green? Are we amber? Or are we flashing red? I think we're flashing red. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I think that's accepted. This burden is only going to get worse now that type 2 diabetes is increasingly affecting our kids. So I'm now off to see a 15-year-old girl with type 2 diabetes, which is scary and shocking. And this is a disease that used to be for old people in their 70s and 80s, and it's getting younger and younger and younger. And I'm struggling with the words to say how angry I am and how upset I am and how bothered I am. Until 20 years ago, there were virtually no kids in the UK with this disease. Now there's hundreds. Schoolgirl Becky was diagnosed aged just 13. Although in some cases genetics can play a role, the rapid rise in numbers is largely thought to be down to diet. And sugar is a big part of the problem. Hi! Come in! Nice to meet you. Come through. Thanks for having me. Obviously, type 2 is massively affected by diet. As a mother, I'm sure you were tracing back what would have happened to you. Yeah. I made some really poor choices. I started getting pocket money, and at the end of the day I'd just go into the corn shop, buy drinks and sweets and stuff and biscuits and chocolate. Looking back, I kind of fell out of the habit of cooking meals every day and got more into the habit of buying something that was quick and easy or buying a takeaway. As a parent, it is my responsibility to take care of my children. I mean, I had half an idea and was trying to get healthy things, but maybe if the packaging on the... But you're still getting it wrong. Yeah, I was still getting it wrong. Children Becky's age should not have type 2 diabetes. This should not be happening. And it's not just Becky. Becky has to keep a constant track of her blood sugar levels. If left untreated, abnormal levels can lead to potentially dangerous complications. Looks like something from Star Trek. Touch it in. I don't like needles. This is normal for me. You kind of get used to it. So you have to do this to yourself every day. You've got to take your own bloods. Yeah. Morning, night, after, like, breakfast and lunch and dinner and before. As long as you're monitoring it day and night to make sure it doesn't spike. That's a constant worry for you? Yeah, my friend, she actually went into a coma with her diabetes. That's how she was diagnosed, because she went into a coma. All of this monitoring and all the learning you've had to do, it's not really something I ever thought teenagers, 13, 14, 15-year-olds would have to deal with. It's quite annoying to have to try and be so responsible. When you usually get home, your mum makes dinner, you don't have to worry about it. Just don't have to think about it. Yeah. So basically what you're saying is having type 2 diabetes sucks. Yeah. It does. A lot. She's tagged this one - young and skinny. Mum Claire shows me when she started to see the problem. This is when she'd just started high school and that's when she really started to put the weight on. What are your worries for the future, then, for Becky? There's so many health complications she can get and even if she does lose the weight, the type 2 diabetes might not go away. In her whole life, it literally does, it makes your whole life based around what you can and can't eat, rather than being... A teenager. Being a teenager. In Britain today, one in five kids turn up at primary school at the age of four overweight or obese. But what's disgusting is when they leave at 11. One in three are overweight or obese. And that's not good. One of the biggest problems is that as a kid, it's pretty darn tough to escape sugar. It's everywhere. This is eight-year-old Ori and her mum, Ola. Could you just look at me a second? They're going to help me see the world from a child's perspective. This year, they reckon advertising spend in Britain is set to hit ??16 billion. And loads of these ads will reach our kids. So this is their local corner shop in Ryslip. So it's basically, if you track the little red dot, it's just showing where she's looking. And it's kind of about branding, really, and eye height and how companies or brands advertise to kids. Mummy. You can see her homing in on those drinks. That's amazing. OK, so now they're going to Tesco. Some sweet markets have recognised that it's not very ethical to kind of have all the sweets and sugary products next to the till. That's mental, because they're at the sweet-free checkouts. Please can I pop one to eat? But all the sweets are right next door. That's amazing. Look, around 70% of confectionery sales are impulse buys. So you can see why shops make them so easy to reach. Right, this is Superdrug. There's no sweets in the pharmacy, though, is there? Every checkout seems to have, even the pharmacy, there's a load of sweets. They're just everywhere. Look at her eye. Mum's got no chance. As many as 90% of snacks at a child's eye level at convenient supermarket checkouts are classified as unhealthy. Right, Marks and Spencers, what's going on in here? OK, cake's on the way in. And cake's on the way out. I love it. Top and tail end, double-ended. And look at that wall of Percy Pigs at Auri's eye level. It's terrible when you see it like this. M&S have recently committed to removing sweets from their tills, but many other retailers still do this. I've got to say, that's really interesting. I've been shopping with my kids, and it is aggro. I mean, you're always trying to keep the happy balance, and you're only 30 seconds away from anarchy with a load of kids. And it's just at that checkout bit, trying to get through. But I just think it's hard being a parent, because you can say no like five or six times. But when it's everywhere, when it's total sugar saturation, it's hard, isn't it? I asked the shops for an explanation. Tesco's came back and said, \\"We've replaced sweets and chocolates on the checkouts with a wide variety of healthier snacks that appeal to customers. We will continue to keep how we implement the policy under review.\\" Sadly Superdrug didn't get back to me. Next it's Saturday night primetime TV. Britain's Got Talent. Watched by 10 million people, shows like this often attract over 1 million child viewers, who can be exposed to up to 11 unhealthy food adverts an hour. These shows don't qualify as children's programming, so advertisers don't face the same Ofcom ban, preventing them from advertising foods high in fat, salt and sugar. Okay, so here we go. Straight in to a Coke advert. So take a look at this glossy ad, which to me seems to suggest if you drink Coke, you'll be happy, healthy and good at sport. There are regulations that protect children's programming against junk food, but this for me is even bigger. This is the big rating stuff. This is a family show. And we've had Coke. We're now on to Harry Bow. Oh, now McDonald's. So that's sort of interesting. I watch the show and I watch it with my kids. It's a family show. We love it. And I think the way that public health is going, that is probably inappropriate. Obesity is up. Type 2 diabetes is up. And too many kids are having all their teeth removed. Sugar is everywhere and sugary marketing feels inescapable. It's getting ridiculous. So what does the industry have to say about all of this? One spokesperson was bold enough to come and speak to me. Sugar, too much of it. Children we know having too much of certain types of food is bad for your health. Is it OK to market those aggressively to children? I don't think we do market them aggressively to children. If you look at the regulatory and self-regulatory codes, we work within those codes. And the reality is, is the masses of kids are online and watching shows like Britain's Got Talent, where they are being marketed. If the family's watching together, it's down to the parents to exercise discretion. But you don't do that, do you? Well, no, but they can talk about it, can't they? It doesn't just mean don't watch it. It means you can say to kids what you think is appropriate behaviour when the ads come on and I'm sure quite a lot of parents do do that. But too much sugar is very detrimental to your health. Too much anything is very detrimental to your health. Too much fat, too much salt. It's demonising... Not too much fruit and veg. Well, demonising one nutrient out of a whole range of them in the national menu is not going to be a helpful way to proceed. There is a hierarchy of nutrients. It's a problem, right? Well, obesity is a problem. And our position is very much about responsibility in this. Responsibility on the part of individual consumers, manufacturers, and of those who sell through the supermarkets or other shops, and of course through restaurants. At the moment, we're consuming lots more sugar than we're supposed to. We need to cut it quite drastically. Obviously sugar consumption in the UK per head is going down, not up, but from quite a high plateau. Now, the second report says that that's too much and they're the experts, so we have to listen to them. Sugar does seem to, kind of like if it was a badly behaved child, it would need to be put on the naughty step. And I'm saying it needs to go on the naughty step. But I think what you're saying is let feralness go? I mean, like, do you acknowledge that sugar is actually a problem? I think we acknowledge that excessive consumption of any single thing is a problem. OK, it's not statutory at the moment to say on any packaging about added sugars. Yeah. Well, one of the issues there is do people understand it? I mean, we've spent 80 years in this country educating people on the notion of calories and they've just about got it. If you start mucking about with the way you express these things, I think you put a barrier to people's understanding. Is it possible that businesses that need to make a profit can self-regulate successfully? Yeah. These businesses are responsible businesses. So yes, it is possible to do that. Our argument would be that the consumer's choice is the best way to go because government interventions simply don't work. Look, I get it, I run a business. Businesses need to make profit to exist, of course. But I always think that public health comes first, for sure. And self-regulation and personal responsibility isn't working. It's not working. And the fact is that it's not working because kids are getting sicker. That's why I think now is the time for the British government to step up and just get tougher on the industry's ass. One country where the government have been forced to take action on sugar is Mexico. It has some of the worst problems in the world, but could also offer some solutions. Thirty-five years ago, a third of people here were obese or overweight. Today, that figure has almost doubled, making them one of the fattest populations in the world. Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of death, with an estimated 8 million people affected. In 1994, a trade agreement with the USA allowed increasing levels of processed food and sugary drinks to flood local economies. Local Mexican diets rapidly shifted towards high-calorie, processed foods and sugary sweetened drinks. I'm meeting the man leading the charge against sugary brands in Mexico, prominent campaigner Alejandro Calvillo. Thank you so much for meeting me. You are in the country with the highest level of soda consumption in the world, one of the highest levels of diabetes, obesity, overweight, and a lot of sickness related with the junk food consumption. You know, the people here in the little communities in the mountains, in the rural areas, drink a lot, a lot of coke. The communities don't have water to drink of quality, but they have coke. Right, so you've got a problem then. And the health system is collapsing at this moment, because we have a lot of people with diabetes, with amputation, blindness related with diabetes. It's a human drama that we are living here. I want to see for myself how bad it really is. So I've asked Alejandro to show me how sugary products are being marketed in some of the poorer and more remote indigenous areas. Before we even reach the first town, we're greeted with some familiar branding. You are at the entrance of Sinacantan, one of the most important indigenous communities here in Chiapas. And you find this billboard that says, \\"Welcome to Sinacantan.\\" You see the coke bottle with the traditional dress of the woman here. The same as the girls behind me? Yes. This actual advertising is not just specific to the area, it's specific to this village. It's to this village. I mean, don't get me wrong, marketing is supposed to be efficient. Yes. This is very efficient. The problem is when your product is creating a health problem, you need to stop it. They cannot deal with the health impact of this level of soda consumption. These huge village-specific Coca-Cola billboards are the welcome signs to several indigenous villages in the Chiapas. The Coca-Cola bottling plant just 15 minutes down the road means that trucks here are often Coca-Cola red. Okay, so what are we looking at? Of the marketing and the promotion of soda consumption. You have all the soda there. Branding in the church, this is PepsiCo. I must say, it is kind of an ambush on the whole town. Next, Alejandro takes me to the Mayan village of San Juan de Mula. Communities here drink a lot of soda, over two litres per person per day. Too many sugary drinks can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and Alejandro is very concerned about the levels of the disease here. Why is it different here than the rest of Mexico then? Because the introduction of the soda consumption is so strong that it's part of the culture. They receive the Coke in the baby bottle. The kids receive all the time. Do the people in here today know about the scale of complexities and amputations? How many amputations do you have in Mexico? It's around, in 2013, 75,000 amputations. 75,000? Related with diabetes. So you're about twice the size of Britain, with like 10 times the problem. The problem is the health system. We don't have the capacity to deal with the... Saving lives. Yeah. Alejandro's concern is that soda, and in particular Coke, has become an intrinsic part of culture. I'm off to a family gathering in Romarillo to see this for myself. How you doing, man? Good. Thanks for having me. So this is the father-in-law's altar. So now we're going to the little ceremony. So how important is having fizzy drinks for this offering? It shows that we're thankful to the saints and to offer them the drink too. The tradition is that they are thirsty. This is very traditional amongst all of the community. Yeah. Coke will be offered up. Yeah. Every party. Every party, every... And if you didn't, it would simply not be right. Yeah. So the Coke's been embraced as a kind of spiritual, sort of authentic part of the experience. Yeah. Just looking around me now, there's all these lovely people, your family. Every one of them's got a massive big old bottle of Coke. I mean, how many of these will they be drinking a day, average? Average, they would be drinking like three or four bottles. Yeah. And then the little one here? We usually serve the little one too. Yeah. All the ages. So even... Because I noticed she was just breastfeeding a minute ago. Yeah. But she's straight on the soda as well. So you mix them both up. Yeah. Do most mothers feed their babies Coke and breastfeed at the same time? Yeah, mostly everyone. So this drink is really the modern holy water? Yeah. So, Vin Santo. Vin Coco. Vin Coco. Okay. Coke, successfully offered to the saints, time to cook up a feast. She's making mole, which is like the absolute classic dish. It's really, really good. This is like my idea of heaven. But this absolutely beautiful traditional dish seems completely at odds with the drink it's being served up with. It's interesting seeing the modern day place for soda so central to everything. Just the sheer quantity of Coke getting knocked back by three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 80 year olds. I haven't seen one kid drink a glass of water. It's all soda. So what did Coke have to say for themselves? We ensure our brands are marketed responsibly and never to children under 12. We offer low and no sugar options. We provide consumers with the information they need to make informed choices about our drinks. I'm shocked by what I've seen here, but the campaigners have been fighting back hard. A huge step forward in tackling the problem was the introduction of a soda tax in 2014. I'm keen to ask Alejandro how it's worked so far. And I wonder if it could provide part of the solution to our problems back home. So you've achieved a soda tax of 10%. What is it? The soda tax applies only for the drinks that have sugar added. And how much? It's one peso per litre. That is like 10% of the price. Right. OK. And how much money is that raising a year? In 2014, the revenue was 1.2 billion. That's good. New money. And did you see any drop off in consumption? In the first quarter, we have the only independent research. We have a reduction of 10% of the soda consumption and increase in water consumption and increase in milk also. Wow. That's the story for Britain that I want to read. So what about the general public? Do they understand the logic between you take from Peter to pay Paul? Yes. You say to people, do you support the soda taxes? This money go to water fountain size schools? They say yes. 80% say yes. And now in Mexico, more than 80% make a very clear relation between soda consumption and diabetes. OK. Thank you. Because everything that you guys have been doing here kind of gives me hope. Now, you'll hear critics of these taxes saying it costs jobs and won't reduce how many sugary drinks people have. But the latest figures for Mexico's soda tax show that there's been a reduction in soda consumption of 6% and it's early days. There's definitely a long way to go in addressing the health crisis in Mexico. But I feel really inspired by Alejandro's victory. I reckon we should be doing the same here in Britain. Campaigners say a 20 pence per litre sugary drinks tax in the UK could raise up to a billion pounds a year, reduce obesity by around 200,000 people and save the NHS around 15 million pounds a year. You'll hear people argue that a tax like this is unfair on those who drink in moderation. But for me, we just need to take action. So would and could the British government impose their very own sugary drinks tax? I don't know and I'm definitely not going to hang around and wait to find out. But what I will do is put my neck on the line because I want to show them that it can work, it will work and that the money raised can go to places that will really make a difference in health. So I'm going to impose my very own sugary drinks tax in my restaurants. I'm introducing a sugary drinks tax in my own UK restaurants to show the government how it's done. I reckon I could raise around ??80,000 a year and I want to spend that cash on children's food education. Just imagine what we could achieve if we had a tax on a national scale and use that cash to help schools and inspire children to make better choices. This was one of my schools 10 years ago in school dinners campaign. This is Charlemanor and if we're going to tax sugary drinks, seven pence on a can, then there's a billion pounds a year raised through that. And I think a massive chunk of that should go into primary schools across Britain to support teachers and support learning. And if you want to know what a school looks like when they put food at the heart of it, come and have a look at this. Let's have a look. OK, here we go. Head teacher Tim Baker has put food and cooking at the very centre of his school and the lessons. Hello. And the school and pupils are reaping the rewards in great results. What we're teaching is cooking skills. We know English and maths are essential life skills, but actually cooking skills are life's necessities. What are you cooking with today? Beetroot. Hands up if you like beetroot. Me! Me! Me! It's not very often you get an army of kids saying they love beetroot. Where do you get your beetroot from? Here. So who's going to take me there to get some? Me! Me! Me! The kids even have their own garden where they grow all kinds of food for cooking and learning. Oh, wow. So who's going to pull the beetroot out for me? Me! That's it, go on. Whee! These are lovely beetroots. Well, good luck with the cake baking. Is it going to taste nice? It's going to be yummy. It has honey. Honey from the bees. But you haven't got bees here, though. We do have bees. Have you? Bees? Look, bee honey. The responsibility for primary schools is to enable the children to learn and to be successful. And so we have a responsibility to ensure they are eating healthily and understand why it's important to eat healthily. If you're going to get taxed seven pence on a can of Coke and a proportion of that is going to be given to head teachers in primary schools across the country, is that money well spent or not? Incredibly well spent. What we've got to make sure is that we educate these children. And to educate those children, we need that new money. The benefits of Tim's personal mission to teach kids about food are clear. You guys are 11, right? Yes. So how many of you can cook? Me. That's all of them. Hello. This is quite a big deal for me because ten years ago when I came here, the food was terrible. And this is beautiful. You know, everything that Tim's doing here is about raising kids who are more likely to lead healthier, longer, more productive lives. For a nationwide sugary drinks tax to work, the money raised must be ring-fenced to help fight the problem. I want to show the government how it's done. I've committed to a tax in my restaurants, but can I get others to join me? It's going to take some convincing, so I've called in some leading experts to help me. These guys are all CEOs, directors and founders of some of the biggest and brightest restaurant groups in the UK. I'm really excited that we've got some amazing businesses from the restaurant industry in the room. If I can do just some broad strokes about where Britain is right now with public health. We have some of the most unhealthy kids in Europe. The single biggest reason for a child being put under general anaesthetic is actually to have multiple teeth extractions. So here we've got a pile of 130 legs and this represents the expected amount of amputations every single week in Britain just from diabetes. 7,000 a year. And it's just not acceptable. Doing nothing I think is unforgivable. What I'm kind of heading for is a kind of self-inflicted tax on sugary drinks. I don't think I'm mad. I know it's important. Graham, why sugar? Well sugar is a completely unnecessary source of calories. We have this crisis of obesity and absolutely nothing has happened in the last five years and that is a scandal. We're just allowing our children to become obese, everyone else to get obese and they're dying of it completely unnecessarily. We need to change. One way of changing this is to have a tax. In terms of implementing something like this in the restaurant, I wonder whether there is another way for us particularly that might implement something where you actually steer people towards something that's better. Trying to persuade people to do something has not worked in terms of obesity or many of the other nutrition related diseases. You know I think there are other ways that one can potentially attack the problem. Putting this tax on it would firstly discourage people from drinking sugary drinks and also raising the money for education in schools and for the health service would be a really fantastic thing as well because we do need money to address the obesity crisis. Tim, what difference would that money make? Most essentially what it would fund is a healthier outcome for the school children of, you know, across Britain. Does it have the power to help curb kids leaving primary school overweight or obese? I challenge anyone here to come to my school and find three children that will be leaving my school obese. We are proof that it works. This kind of levy should kickstart the government and say what the hell are we doing sitting in Whitehall not producing any kind of strategy and here are these guys who are taking it on their own to do something. I would be 100% behind you in what you're trying to do. Thank you, Tam. There is precedent. Mexico are doing it, seeing the benefits of lower consumption and money raised. I think the restaurant industry absolutely has the power and the kind of verve and excitement and access to the public to do it beautifully. That was intense. Time to find out if anyone's up for it. It's a huge opportunity and it's a journey that we're on. I think we need to mull it over. How is this right for our business? What is it for Costa and then Whitbread and all the board names? I think it's something we may well be interested in as a business but it's that big stack of legs that really confessed me. I didn't really realise quite how dramatic the problem was. We'll look at how we can get involved. I'd like to try and help. Any kind of tax is a tough sell but I believe this is different and I'm determined to get this off the ground. My biggest worry is the urgency, the urgency in which change is needed. And I know personally that I hate doing nothing. So definitely a rocket up the arse of the government is a really positive thing. We want them briefed and working hard for us and it's going to be really interesting to see if an industry that's connected to food can come together as a unified voice. The tax will roll out in my UK restaurants this autumn. I hope some of the other restaurants will decide to join me but what I really want is for the government to start listening. This is what's at stake. The kids of Britain, right? Their health, their wellbeing. Where will they be in 10, 15, 20 years? Where will their kids be? I believe we can make change happen but I need your help because this really matters and I want us to make a whole load of noise about it. If you think we should introduce a national sugary drinks tax then please, please get online and show your support now. Go to channel4.com/sugarrush and sign. It's that simple and the more people that sign up, the more voices get heard and the more pressure it puts on the government to change their strategy. We need a sugary drinks tax and that billion pounds we can raise a year, that can be spent in schools all across Britain, in hospitals all across Britain, in nurseries. That's what we need and this, this is what it's all about. 將以上文章翻譯成繁體中文","completion":"在過去的十年中，我一直在為我們孩子們爭取更好的食物。 從學校的午餐到加工食品，這些垃圾食品。 但現在我將進行我有史以來最大的戰鬥。 這次我要對抗的是糖。 糖無處不在。 它在你的食物裡。 沒有人會懷疑那小罐子裡竟然有近20茶匙的糖。 在你的飲料中。 大多數母親在孩子吃奶的同時會餵嬰兒喝可樂嗎？ 是的，大多數人都會。 而且英國新聞上也到處都是。 隨著健康專家越來越多地呼籲減少飲食中的糖分，我們越來越多地聽到這樣的呼聲。 我們只是讓孩子們隨意吃這些，這是一場醜聞。 當談到關於糖和我們健康的警告時，情況達到了高潮。 我們正處於紅燈閃爍、探照燈、警報、警報響起的狀態。 我厭倦了所有的談話，等待有人做點事情，而越來越多的人生病。 Becky這個年紀的孩子不應該有2型糖尿病。 健康系統正在崩潰。 所以我決定要對此採取行動。 事情很快就會變得有趣，我想。 但我不認為我們真正明白這意味著什麼。 我在倫敦的聖喬治醫院，試圖弄清楚它的頭腦。 這是恢復室。 這是通往看Mario的路。 這裡發生的事情與超重或肥胖無關。 嘿，兄弟。 嗨。 這是Mario。 這些都是我們為Mario拍攝的X光片。 看看前面的牙齒。 幾乎全部腐爛。 就是一個外殼。 那只是一塊大的細菌。 那是空的。 好的，我們是這樣的吹氣。 非常好。 這樣。 好的。 現在6歲的Mario是一個健康的男孩，經常刷牙。 但他非常喜歡含糖飲料。 這可能有點難看，但很重要看。 他現在自己呼吸嗎？ 所以現在你是在為他呼吸。 機器已經接管了。 這非常快速且絕對殘酷。 唯一能拔牙的方法就是狠狠地拔掉它們。 在我腦中，這個環境很昂貴，充滿了關懷，你在得了癌症等情況下可以理解，還有不幸患上白血病的孩子等。 這只是蛀牙嗎？ 是的。 從糖份中來？ 從糖份來。 這非常快速，令人精疲力盡的工作，而且他們今早上還有其他五個孩子要照顧。 現在Mario要去康復室，跟他的父母團聚。 肯定的是，要看到一個孩子接受這種手術，真的很讓人緊張。 Mario會沒事，但這很難看。 他沒事。 我們找到媽媽了嗎？ 是的，我們叫媽媽出來吧？ 這很困難，手術很大，完全可以避免的。 問題有多大？ 巨大。 哦，我的天。 這只是蛀牙。 蛀牙穿透了整顆牙齒，穿過琺瑯質，穿進牙齒的中間，進入神經，所以它們只是腐爛的。 如果他們有20顆牙齒，這是一套完整的孩子牙齒，而且他們都需要拔掉。 20顆牙齒？ 20顆牙齒，這是例行公事。 這不是特例或罕見，這是經常發生的。 如果蛀牙繼續進入恆牙，而這些恆牙需要清除。 這經常發生，我們經常看到。 我們經常會用假牙代替它們。 假牙？ 假牙。 所以糖分幾乎完全導致了大部分這樣的情況？ 不是幾乎完全。 不管你刷牙多麼勤快，如果你整天不停地喝糖或吃糖，你完全可以壓倒任何預防措施。 所以你一整天都刷牙也沒有用。 這不僅僅是Mario。 每年有26,000名小學年齡的孩子因為爛牙而去醫院就診。 給孩子拔牙每年要花費NHS約3000萬英鎊。 在英國，糖分是導致兒童被送醫院的最大原因。 這些數字是巨大的，它們是可怕的，這是我們面臨的最大、最緊迫的問題。 我們正處於紅燈閃爍、探照燈、警報、警報響起的狀態。 我們正處於紅燈閃爍的狀態。 今天肯定是讓我震驚了。 當你走出大樓，看到這家名為醫院的機構時，我們有些輕視它。 我們讓它承受著巨大的壓力。 你知道，事情變得非常荒謬。 我們需要幫助這些家伙完成工作，專注於真正重要的事情，而不是因為環境中含糖的垃圾太多而拔掉牙齒。 我肯定感到被激怒了，絕對準備好了一場爭鬥。 這不僅僅是我們的孩子被困在了太多的糖中。 世界衛生組織對此非常擔憂，他們告訴我們我們都需要節制。 這裡的專家也同意，現在已經建議成年人每天的糖攝入量不得超過七茶匙。 相當可怕的是，許多英國人每天卻攝入超過40茶匙。 專家們擔心的是所謂的自由糖。 所以這是添加到食品和飲料中的任何額外糖分，加上蜂蜜和糖漿中的糖分，甚至是水果汁中的天然糖分。 我請我的朋友Lucy來幫忙，讓我看看糖是如何無形中進入我們日常飲食中的。 所以這是一塊蛋糕。 我們知道我們不應該每天都吃它，但它並不完全是關於蛋糕的。 不全是關於蛋糕。 讓你最擔心的部分是什麼？ 我們沒有意識到攝入多少糖分，而不是在這些明顯的部分。 所以什麼是我們不認為有糖的日常食物中隱藏的東西。 可以我們從一些典型的一天的餐點選擇開始，我可以更好地向你解釋。 那我們從哪裡開始？ 早餐。 你能倒一些普通早餐份的玉米片嗎？ 我是說那是一個男性的份量。 我把一些牛奶、一些低脂檸檬優格和漿果加到我的玉米片中。 Lucy選擇了我們認為健康的產品，並選擇了含糖含量最高的品牌。 你能猜出你美味早餐中有多少自由糖嗎？ 我一無所知。 56.4克。 聽起來不是很好。 這就是14.1茶匙。 哦，糟糕到家。 我們怎麼會有那麼多？ 好的，讓我們用茶匙來做，這是4克。 我的男子氣慨份玉米片中有大約5茶匙的添加糖。 我的一份優格中有近3茶匙的糖，我的橙汁中有超過6茶匙的自由糖。 如果專家們說我們每天應該攝入的自由糖不應超過7茶匙，那麼僅僅這頓早餐就是兩倍。 我們來看看午餐吧。 番茄湯和麵包。 你會認為這兩樣中有一個含有大量糖分嗎？ 你知道番茄中會有天然糖分，我不知道他們有沒有甜麵包，但它看起來相當品牌化，所以我想這裡可能有一些添加糖。 讓我們來看看。 不同品牌的糖含量不同，所以你需要檢查標籤。 可悲的是標籤並不列出添加糖的值，但比較相似產品中的總糖含量可以幫助我們估計。 一些全麥麵包的糖含量幾乎是其他品牌的兩倍，這罐奶油番茄湯比其他一些品牌多大約2茶匙的糖。 所以這看起來健康的午餐會讓你一天中再增加大約3茶匙的自由糖。 接下來是下午茶和一杯飲料。 所以大多數人會覺得這是一個相當健康的小吃，這不是令人過於擔憂的東西。 在這半瓶水中有三又半茶匙糖。 我以為這是水。 哦，這是有香味的水。 在一瓶水裡，大多救我們會喝掉的水中有7茶匙糖。 這很甜，好吧。 在這條麥片中，我們不多少人會想到實際上有2茶匙的糖。 所以在一個看起來健康的小吃中，總共有9茶匙的糖。 接下來是什麼？ 我要讓你高興起來，我要讓你去晚餐煮飯。 接下來，Lucy想讓我快速炒一盤好吃的東西。 現在我沒有欺騙你，我們有一個檸檬和薑飯炒醬。 所以我只是想讓你加進去。 這是兩個人的份量。 所以加進那個醬後，你就每人增加了將近10茶匙的糖。 每人！ 即便我要做一道糖醋菜，我知道糖有令人驚艷的能力可以平衡酸味，甚至平衡苦味。 我永遠不會每人加10茶匙。 這正是隱藏糖的典範，因為沒有人會懷疑那小罐子裡會有將近20茶匙的糖。 那太瘋狂了。 而且一旦你把你的早餐、午餐、點心和晚餐加起來，你實際上大概有36茶匙的糖。 這太多了。 無論何時你購買包裝在包裹或瓶子中的東西，請閱讀標籤，因為你無法判斷是否有添加糖，直到你查看它。 即使這樣，你也無法清楚總糖和添加糖的區別。 這是健康看起來的一天的食物。 這裡沒有巧克力棒，然而實際上是每天攝入5倍以上英國專家現在說我們應該攝入的自由糖量。 36茶匙，當我們應該只要少於7茶匙。 我們需要對此採取緊急行動。 你知道的，我對食物和飲"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:_},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function q(i,e,l,m,n,s){const p=y("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",z,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(w,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
