The discriminant is given by the formula Delta = b^{2} - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x^{2}, x, and the constant term, respectively. For our equation, a=2, b=m+2, and c=m. Calculating the discriminant: [ Delta = (m+2)^{2} - 4 cdot 2 cdot m = m^{2} + 4m + 4 - 8m = m^{2} - 4m + 4 = (m-2)^{2} ] Since the square of any real number is always non-negative, we have: [ (m-2)^{2} geqslant 0 ] This implies that Delta geqslant 0 for any real number m.

(IMO 19 preliminary problem)","completion":"To prove the given statement, we will use Lagrange interpolation polynomial and properties of polynomial coefficients. Specifically, we want to show that for a polynomial (P(x) = x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + cdots + a_n) evaluated at distinct integers (x_0, x_1, ldots, x_n), there is at least one value among the evaluations (P(x_0), P(x_1), ldots, P(x_n)) whose absolute value is not less than (frac{n!}{2^n}). 1. **Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial**: Recall the Lagrange interpolation formula for a polynomial (P(x)) that passes through ( (x_0, P(x_0)), (x_1, P(x_1)), ldots, (x_n, P(x_n)) ) is given by: [ P(x) = sum_{j=0}^{n} left( prod_{substack{i neq j 0 leqslant i leqslant n}} frac{x - x_i}{x_j - x_i} right) P(x_j). ] 2. **Assumption**: Assume, for contradiction, that ( left|P(x_j)right| < frac{n!}{2^n} ) for all ( j = 0, 1, ldots, n ). 3. **First Coefficient Calculation**: The leading coefficient of the polynomial (P(x)) is 1 by given, and it should match the corresponding term from the Lagrange interpolation polynomial. 4. **Expression for First Coefficient**: From Lagrange interpolation, the coefficient of (x^n) in the polynomial (P(x)) can be written as: [ sum_{j=0}^{n} P(x_j) prod_{substack{i neq j 0 leqslant i leqslant n}} frac{1}{x_j - x_i} ] Given our assumption: [ left|P(x_j)right| < frac{n!}{2^n} ] Substituting this boundary condition, we obtain: [ left| sum_{j=0}^{n} P(x_j) prod_{substack{i neq j 0 leqslant i leqslant n}} frac{1}{x_j - x_i} right| < sum_{j=0}^{n} frac{n!}{2^n} prod_{substack{i neq j 0 leqslant i leqslant n}} frac{1}{|x_j - x_i|}. ] 5. **Inequality Simplification**: Note that ( x_j ) are distinct integers, ensuring ( |x_j - x_i| geq 1 ). Evaluating the entire product: [ prod_{substack{i neq j 0 leqslant i leqslant n}} |x_j - x_i| geq 1. ] Hence: [ sum_{j=0}^{n} frac{n!}{2^n} prod_{substack{i neq j 0 leqslant i leqslant n}} frac{1}{|x_j - x_i|} leq sum_{j=0}^{n} frac{n!}{2^n}. ] 6. **Summation of Binomial Coefficient**: We recognize the binomial expansion: [ sum_{j=0}^{n} frac{n!}{j!(n-j)!} = 2^n. ] Therefore: [ sum_{j=0}^{n} frac{n!}{2^n} = frac{1}{2^n} cdot 2^n = 1. ] 7. **Contradiction**: The resulting leading coefficient from the interpolation would be strictly less than 1, but the leading coefficient of the polynomial (P(x)) is 1. This contradiction implies that our assumption was false. # Conclusion: Thus, there must be at least one value of (j), for (0 leq j leq n), such that: [ left|P(x_j)right| geq frac{n!}{2^n}. ] boxed{}"},{"prompt":"x > 1 is a ( ) for x > 2.

We denote these points as ( A_1 ), ( B_1 ), and ( C_1 ). 2. First, we need to find the ratios of the segments created by these intersections. We use the following properties of the Nagel point and the triangle's semiperimeter ( p = frac{a+b+c}{2} ): [ frac{AB_1}{B_1C} = frac{p - c}{p - a}, quad frac{CA_1}{A_1B} = frac{p - b}{p - c}, quad frac{BC_1}{C_1A} = frac{p - a}{p - b} ] These ratios are derived from the properties of the triangle’s semiperimeter and the segments created by the cevians. 3.

Using the values of ( xi ) and ( eta ), two equations of the tangents ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ) passing through ( P(x_0, y_0) ) are obtained by substituting ( xi_1, eta_1 ) and ( xi_2, eta_2 ) in the tangent line equation respectively: [ t_1 equiv y = -frac{r x_0 + y_0 sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - r^2}}{r y_0 + x_0 sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - r^2}} x + frac{r(x_0^2 + y_0)}{r y_0 + x_0 sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - r^2}} ] [ t_2 equiv y = -frac{r x_0 - y_0 sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - r^2}}{r y_0 - x_0 sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - r^2}} x + frac{r(x_0^2 + y_0)}{r y_0 - x_0 sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - r^2}} ] 7. For the tangents ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ) to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must equal (-1). Thus, [ left( frac{r x_0 + y_0 sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - r^2}}{r y_0 + x_0 sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - r^2}} right) cdot left( frac{r x_0 - y_0 sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - r^2}}{r y_0 - x_0 sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - r^2}} right) = -1 ] 8. Simplifying the above product: [ left( x_0^2 + y_0^2 right) left( x_0^2 + y_0^2 - 2r^2 right) = 0 ] 9. Assuming ( P neq text{origin} ), it follows that ( x_0^2 + y_0^2 neq 0 ).

For the given problem, where ( r^2 = 32 ), we find the radius: [ r = sqrt{32} ] Thus, the radius of the concentric circle is: [ R = sqrt{32} sqrt{2} = sqrt{64} = 8 ] Hence, the equation of the geometric locus is: [ x^2 + y^2 = R^2 = 64 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 64} ]"},{"prompt":"Suppose you have two standard decks of cards, each containing 52 cards divided into 4 suits, with each suit having 13 cards—resulting in a total of 104 cards.

By the finite intersection property of nested compact sets, there exists at least one point P that lies in the intersection of all these triangles. 3. **Uniqueness of the intersection point:** We need to show that the intersection of all triangles A_nB_nC_n is a single point. Assume for contradiction that the intersection contains more than one point. Then there exist subsequences of A_n, B_n, and C_n (denoted again by A_n, B_n, and C_n for simplicity) that converge to distinct points A, B, and C, respectively. 4. **Case 1: A, B, and C are distinct:** Without loss of generality, assume angle BAC leq 60^circ. For sufficiently large n, the points A_n, B_n, and C_n are close to A, B, and C, respectively. Consider the next triangle A_{n+1}B_{n+1}C_{n+1}. The side B_{n+1}C_{n+1} is far from A, implying that A is outside triangle A_{n+1}B_{n+1}C_{n+1}. This contradicts the assumption that A is a limit point of the sequence A_n. 5. **Case 2: B = C neq A:** In this case, angle B_nA_nC_n < 60^circ (it tends to 0 as n to infty). Applying the same argument as in Case 1, we find that A cannot be a limit point of the sequence A_n, leading to a contradiction. 6. **Conclusion of uniqueness:** Since both cases lead to contradictions, the points A_n, B_n, and C_n must converge to a common point P. Therefore, there is a unique point P that lies in the intersection of all triangles A_nB_nC_n. 7. **Interior of the triangles:** Finally, we need to show that P lies in the interior of all triangles A_nB_nC_n. Assume for contradiction that P lies on some side, say A_nB_n, for some n. Then P would be outside triangle A_{n+2}B_{n+2}C_{n+2}, which contradicts the fact that P is in the intersection of all triangles. Hence, P must lie in the interior of all triangles A_nB_nC_n. 8. **Generalization:** The proof remains valid if we only require that A_{n+1}, B_{n+1}, and C_{n+1} are on the sides B_nC_n, A_nC_n, and A_nB_n, respectively, and not too close to the vertices A_n, B_n, C_n.

The general solution is: [ d'(x) = frac{C}{(x-r)^{2k}} ] where C is a constant. Integrating both sides, we get: [ d(x) = int frac{C}{(x-r)^{2k}} , dx ] This implies that d(x) has a singularity at x = r unless C = 0. Therefore, d(x) must be a constant polynomial, which contradicts the assumption that P(x) has a root with multiplicity greater than one. 11. **Conclusion:** Since P(x) cannot have a root with multiplicity greater than one, all roots of P(x) must be distinct.

For n = 1, nC2 = 0 (since we can't form a pair with just one color), so total combinations = 1 + 0 = 1, which is not enough. For n = 2, nC2 = 2! / (2! * (2 - 2)!) = 1, so total combinations = 2 + 1 = 3, which is not enough. For n = 3, nC2 = 3! / (2! * (3 - 2)!) = 3, so total combinations = 3 + 3 = 6, which is not enough.

The cost price of each shirt is 80 yuan, and the supermarket stipulates that the selling price of each shirt must not be less than 90 yuan.

It was found that for every 1 yuan increase in the selling price of a shirt, 10 fewer shirts are sold each week. (1) Find the function expression between the weekly sales volume y (in units) and the selling price per unit x yuan. (No need to specify the range of the independent variable) (2) The clothing supermarket wants to make a profit of 8250 yuan from the sales of this Tshirt each week, while also providing customers with the best value. How should the selling price of this Tshirt be set? (3) The supermarket management department requires that the selling price of this Tshirt must not exceed 110 yuan. Then, at what price per unit should the Tshirt be set so that the weekly sales profit is maximized? What is the maximum profit?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Function Expression Given that when the selling price is 90 yuan, 600 shirts can be sold each week, and for every 1 yuan increase in the selling price, 10 fewer shirts are sold. We can express the weekly sales volume y as a function of the selling price per unit x (in yuan) as follows: 1. Let the increase in price from 90 yuan be (x - 90) yuan. 2. For every 1 yuan increase, the number of shirts sold decreases by 10. Therefore, the decrease in the number of shirts sold is 10 times (x - 90). 3. The initial number of shirts sold at 90 yuan is 600. So, the expression becomes y = 600 - 10 times (x - 90). Simplifying the expression: y = 600 - 10x + 900 y = -10x + 1500 Therefore, the function expression between the weekly sales volume y and the selling price per unit x yuan is boxed{y = -10x + 1500}. Part 2: Setting the Selling Price for a Weekly Profit of 8250 Yuan To achieve a weekly profit of 8250 yuan, we set up the equation based on the profit formula: text{Profit} = (text{Selling Price} - text{Cost Price}) times text{Number of Shirts Sold} Given that the cost price is 80 yuan, we have: (x - 80)(-10x + 1500) = 8250 Solving this equation: 1. Expand and rearrange the equation to find the values of x. 2. After solving, we find two possible values for x: x_1 = 95 and x_2 = 135. 3. Since x_2 = 135 is not feasible (the selling price must not be less than 90 yuan and should be realistic), we discard it. Therefore, the selling price should be set at boxed{95} yuan to make a weekly profit of 8250 yuan. Part 3: Maximizing Weekly Sales Profit Without Exceeding 110 Yuan To maximize the weekly sales profit without exceeding a selling price of 110 yuan, we express the profit w as: w = (x - 80)(-10x + 1500) Rearranging and completing the square gives us: w = -10(x - 115)^2 + 12250 Since the coefficient of the squared term is negative (-10 < 0), the profit function opens downwards, indicating a maximum point at x = 115. However, the selling price must not exceed 110 yuan. Therefore, at the maximum allowed selling price of 110 yuan: w_{text{max}} = -10(110 - 115)^2 + 12250 = 12000 So, when the selling price is set at boxed{110} yuan, the supermarket makes the maximum weekly profit of boxed{12000} yuan."},{"prompt":"Twofifths of the seats in an auditorium that holds 500 people are currently taken.

Next, let's find out how many seats are broken. Since 1/10 of the seats are broken, we can calculate this as follows: 1/10 * 500 = 50 So, 50 seats are broken. To find out how many seats are still available, we need to subtract the number of seats that are taken and the number of seats that are broken from the total number of seats in the auditorium: 500 (total seats) - 200 (taken seats) - 50 (broken seats) = 250 Therefore, there are boxed{250} seats still available in the auditorium."},{"prompt":"Amy bought a 15foot spool of string to cut up into wicks for making candles.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so a 15-foot spool of string is: 15 feet * 12 inches/foot = 180 inches Now, let's denote the number of 6-inch wicks as x and the number of 12-inch wicks as y. We know that the total length of the wicks must add up to 180 inches, so we can write the equation: 6x + 12y = 180 Since we want an equal number of 6-inch and 12-inch wicks, we can set x = y. Let's substitute y for x in the equation: 6x + 12x = 180 Combine like terms: 18x = 180 Now, divide both sides by 18 to solve for x: x = 180 / 18 x = 10 Since x = y, we have 10 of each type of wick.

For (n = 2^k cdot sqrt{2}), this means: [ left[ 2^k cdot sqrt{2} right] = leftlfloor 2^{k + 1/2} rightrfloor ] 3. **Approximation by Integer Sequence**: Note that (2^{k + 1/2}) is irrational because it is a product of an integer power of 2 and the irrational number (sqrt{2}). As (k) increases, this expression will approximate all real numbers in a denser distribution, making the floor values closely packed integers. 4. **Composite Number Sequence**: Now, we want to show that the floor values hit infinitely many composite numbers. Considering the sequence (leftlfloor 2^{k + 1/2} rightrfloor), we can state the following: - As (k) increases, (leftlfloor 2^{k + 1/2} rightrfloor) will cover larger and larger integers. - By the prime number theorem, the density of prime numbers decreases as we go to larger numbers, meaning that the probability of hitting a composite number increases with larger (k). 5. **Density of Composites**: Since composite numbers outgrow primes in density as we consider larger sets of integers, infinite already guarantees that there are infinitely many composite numbers. Hence, as (leftlfloor 2^{k + 1/2} rightrfloor) spans the range of integers, it must hit infinitely many of these composites. 6. **Rigor in Conclusion**: Explicitly, consider that for any sufficiently large integer (N), there is a (k) such that: [ 2^{k + 1/2} > N ] And the set of integers from (N) to (2^{k + 1/2}) will contain more composites as (k) continues to grow. # Conclusion: Therefore, there are infinitely many composite numbers among the numbers of the form (left[2^k cdot sqrt{2}right]).

Substituting f(1) = 5 and f'(1) = 0: [ y - 5 = 0(x - 1) implies y = 5. ] Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is boxed{y = 5}. Part (Ⅱ): Monotonic Intervals and Maximum Value 1. The derivative f'(x) = 9x^2 - 9 = 9(x^2 - 1). 2. To find where f(x) is increasing or decreasing, set f'(x) > 0 or f'(x) < 0: - For f'(x) > 0, we have x^2 - 1 > 0, which gives x < -1 or x > 1. - For f'(x) < 0, we have x^2 - 1 < 0, which gives -1 < x < 1. 3. Therefore, the function f(x) is increasing on the intervals left(-infty, -1right) and left(1, +inftyright), and decreasing on the interval left[-1, 1right]. 4. To find the maximum value of f(x) on the interval left[-1, 1right], evaluate f(-1) and f(1): - f(-1) = 3(-1)^3 - 9(-1) + 11 = -3 + 9 + 11 = 17. - f(1) = 3(1)^3 - 9(1) + 11 = 3 - 9 + 11 = 5. 5. Since the function is decreasing on left[-1, 1right], the maximum value occurs at x = -1, which is f(-1) = 17. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) on the interval left[-1, 1right] is boxed{17}."},{"prompt":"The graph below shows a portion of the curve defined by the quartic polynomial Q(x)=x^4 + 2x^3 x^2 + 4x + 6.

Let's denote each cell as (i, k) which signifies the textit{i}-th row and textit{k}-th column. - Suppose there's a mapping function ( F(i, k) ) indicating the new placement of the pawn initially placed at (( i, k )). - Note that corner cells differ in adjacency properties compared to edge and internal cells. - A critical observation is that the total number of adjacent cells decreases from internal to edge, and from edge to corner cells. 2. **Conditions and Inferences**: - Initial conditions are given: ( F(1,1) = (1,1) ) and ( F(n, 1) = (n, 1) ). - Since adjacency must be maintained, transition from one cell to another should collectively preserve adjacency for edge, internal, and corner cells according to their unique properties. 3. **Sequence Adjacency**: - Particularly, if (F) preserves adjacency and keeps the left corner positions intact, we specifically trace preserving these properties for cells in one row or column. - For example, examining sequence (1,1), (2,1), ldots, (n,1) shows that incomplete or incorrect adjacency transformations indicate preserving adjacency constraints within starting bounds. 4. **Concrete Adjacency Check for First Column**: - Consider the sequence transformation of cells in the first column: [ F(i, 1)= (i, 1) ] for each (i) from (1) to (n), reflects correctness within initial conditions, implying no change for ((i, 1)). 5. **Induction for Next Columns**: - By induction, where transformations preserving adjacency on one consistent column (or row) encourage the result to hold for subsequent columns (or rows).

From the left-most column, since there is a carry from the previous columns (maximum possible value of the sum is 2M + N < 3b), the sum translates to M equiv M pmod{b}, which is always true. Let's assign M = 1 (minimal non-zero digit in any base b > 2), then b = 2, which is too small to accommodate all distinct digits. Hence, let's increase the base. Trying M = 5, we get b = 10, and now substitute into equations: - If M = 5 and b=10, then 2I = N or 2I + 1 = N with no carry. Assuming I = 4, then N = 8 or N=9. - A must be small enough to avoid the carry into the M column since 2M = 10 and any carry from the sum 10 + N < 20 must give M = 10 which is not possible.

How many ways are there to partition the twelve edges into two Hamiltonian cycles?","completion":"Solution: We begin by understanding the structure of the Hamiltonian cycles in a regular octahedron. An octahedron has twelve edges and eight faces. We need to partition these twelve edges into two Hamiltonian cycles, each consisting of six edges. To count the number of Hamiltonian cycles in an octahedron, we need to observe the vertices and ensure that no pair of opposite vertices is listed consecutively or at the start and end. 1. **Label the vertices**: We label the vertices of the octahedron as ( A, B, C, D, E, F ), where ( A, B, C ) are opposite ( D, E, F ), respectively. 2. **Count initial segment choices**: We start with a segment (AB). The next vertex cannot be one of the vertices opposite ( A ) or ( B ) (i.e., (D) or (E)), so it can be either (C) or (F). 3. **Extend segments to form cycles**: - If the third vertex is (D), list the remaining three vertices (C, E, F) or (F, E, C). - If the third vertex is (C) or (F), derive three possible formations for the remaining vertices. Let's consider the enumeration in more detail: - For a starting segment (ABC), the remaining options are (DEF, DFE). - For a starting segment (ABF), the remaining options are (DEC, DCE). This results in: [ 4 , (textit{choices for second vertex}) cdot 6 , (textit{ways to permute remaining vertices}) = 24 , textit{cycles}.] However, each Hamiltonian path can be traversed in 12 distinct ways (6 directions × 2 orientations).

Then Q, A, D, B are concyclic, implying angle QDR = 90^circ. 3. **Midpoints and isosceles right triangles:** - Let M, N, L be the midpoints of BC, CA, AB respectively. - Since MC_1 and MB_1 are the B- and C-midlines of triangle BCQ and triangle CBR, and from the cyclic property, triangle MC_1B_1 is isosceles right at M. - Similarly, the midpoint of RQ and B_1, C_1 form another isosceles right triangle, implying A_2 is the midpoint of QR. 4. **Reflection and Vecten triangles:** - M is the reflection of A_2 about B_1C_1. - Similarly, N and L are the reflections of B_2 and C_2 about C_1A_1 and A_1B_1 respectively. - Thus, triangle A_2B_2C_2 and the medial triangle MNL of triangle ABC become the outer and inner Vecten triangles of triangle A_1B_1C_1. 5. **Area relationship using Vecten triangles:** - The area of any triangle is the arithmetic mean between the areas of its outer and inner Vecten triangles. - Therefore, 2|triangle A_1B_1C_1| = |triangle A_2B_2C_2| + |triangle MNL|. - Since triangle MNL is the medial triangle of triangle ABC, its area is frac{1}{4} of the area of triangle ABC. - Hence, 2S_1 = S_2 + frac{1}{4}S. 6. **Solving for S:** - Rearrange the equation to solve for S: [ 2S_1 = S_2 + frac{1}{4}S ] [ 8S_1 = 4S_2 + S ] [ S = 8S_1 - 4S_2 ] The final answer is boxed{S = 8S_1 - 4S_2}."},{"prompt":"There are 997 points in the plane.

For angles greater than 90^circ, the inequality for sine function holds as sin(2A) < sin(2B). - Considering B + C > 90^circ, we get B > 90^circ - C > 45^circ. Hence: [ sin(2B) < sin(2(90^circ - C)) = sin(2C) ] Thus, sin(2A) < sin(2B) < sin(2C). 3. **Conclusion**: - Since in both cases (C geq 45^circ and C < 45^circ), the inequality sin(2A) < sin(2B) < sin(2C) holds given A > B > C, condition 甲 implies condition 乙. - Conversely, the inequality sin(2A) < sin(2B) < sin(2C) means that A > B > C must hold true.

Since f(x) is an increasing function on the interval [0, 1], it follows that f(sinalpha) > f(cosbeta). Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{A}}. By understanding that the even function f(x) satisfies f(2-x) = f(x), which implies the function has a period of 2, and then using the function's periodicity and evenness to determine the monotonicity of f(x) on the interval [0, 1], we can deduce the answer.

For each ( n ), how many full sequences are there?","completion":"1. **Claim**: We claim that there are n! full sequences for any positive integer n. 2. **Understanding Full Sequences**: A sequence left(a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}right) is called full if for every positive integer k geq 2, if k appears in the sequence, then k-1 also appears in the sequence. Moreover, the first occurrence of k-1 must come before the last occurrence of k. 3. **Partitioning the Sequence**: Let S_k be the set of indices i where a_i = k. Note that S_1, S_2, ..., S_m form a partition of the set {1, 2, ..., n}, where m is the maximum value within the sequence. 4. **Constructing Permutations**: Define a function to map these sequences to permutations of {1, 2, ..., n}. Write down the indices in S_1 in descending order first, followed by the indices in S_2 in descending order, and so on until S_m. This ordered arrangement forms a unique permutation of {1, 2, ..., n}. 5. **Reversing the Construction**: To show that this map is bijective, consider any permutation of {1, 2, ..., n} written as a sequence b = {b_1, b_2, ..., b_n}. We can break this sequence into non-increasing subsequences S_1', S_2', ..., S_m' such that max S_i' > min S_{i-1}' and correspondingly map it back to a full sequence of left(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_nright). 6. **Second Method - Recursive Counting**: - Consider a full sequence of length n. If we remove the first occurrence of the highest number in this sequence, the remaining sequence must still be full and of length n-1. - Conversely, each full sequence of length n-1 can be extended back to a full sequence of length n by inserting the highest number back in exactly n different positions. - This relationship gives the recurrence: x_n = n x_{n-1}, starting with x_1 = 1, which implies x_n = n! by induction. # Conclusion: Both methods, bijection with permutations and the recursive counting argument, establish that the number of full sequences of length n is given by the factorial n!.

Once a vertex is chosen, to satisfy the condition of both vertices being on the same face, the next vertex must be one of the remaining 3 vertices of the chosen vertex's face. 3. Each vertex in a cube is part of 3 different faces (since 3 faces meet at a vertex in a cube), so initially, selecting the first vertex gives us 3 possible faces (each with 3 other vertices that we can choose as the second vertex). Thus, for each of the chosen first vertex, there are 3 faces available and each face contributes 3 valid vertices for choosing as the second vertex, thereby providing 9 valid vertex choices for the second pick. The total number of ways to select any two vertices from the cube without restrictions is binom{8}{2} = 28. The number of favorable outcomes where both vertices share the same face is 8 times 9 = 72 (first vertex has 8 ways and for each such choice, there are 9 ways to choose the second vertex such that it shares a face with the first).

This means his new daily productivity is ( 120 + frac{25}{100} times 120 = 120 + 30 = 150 ) hectares a day. Let's assume that the farmer initially planned to finish the work in ( x ) days. So, the total area of the field according to the initial plan would be ( A = 120x ). However, since he finished two days ahead of schedule, he actually took ( x - 2 ) days to complete the work. In these ( x - 2 ) days, he worked for two days at 120 hectares per day and ( x - 4 ) days at 150 hectares per day. So, the total area of the field based on his actual work is: [ A = 240 + 150(x - 4) ] Since the total area of the field doesn't change, we can set the two equations for ( A ) equal to each other: [ 120x = 240 + 150(x - 4) ] Now, let's solve for ( x ): [ 120x = 240 + 150x - 600 ] [ 120x - 150x = 240 - 600 ] [ -30x = -360 ] [ x = frac{-360}{-30} ] [ x = 12 ] So, the farmer initially planned to finish the work in 12 days.

Since the digits are in strictly increasing order and we are dealing with three-digit even integers, there are specific constraints on a, b, and c: 1. **No digit can be zero**: Since we are dealing with three-digit numbers, a cannot be zero, and since the digits are strictly increasing, b and c also cannot be zero. 2. **c must be even**: Since the integer is even, the last digit, c, must be 2, 4, 6, or 8. However, c cannot be 2 because a and b would have to be less than 2, leaving no room for strictly increasing digits. Let's examine the possibilities for c: - **If c=4**, then a and b must be chosen from the digits 1, 2, and 3, because they must be less than 4 and strictly increasing.

Since each print roll sold for 6.00 and they sold 210 of them, the total amount collected from print rolls would be: 210 rolls * 6.00/roll = 1260 Now, we need to find out how many solid color rolls were sold. We know the total number of rolls sold was 480, and out of those, 210 were print rolls. So the number of solid color rolls sold would be: 480 total rolls - 210 print rolls = 270 solid color rolls Each solid color roll sold for 4.00, so the total amount collected from solid color rolls would be: 270 rolls * 4.00/roll = 1080 Finally, to find the total amount of money collected from both types of rolls, we add the amounts collected from each type: 1260 (from print rolls) + 1080 (from solid color rolls) = 2340 So, the total amount of money collected from the sale of all the gift wrap rolls was boxed{2340} ."},{"prompt":"The square root of 3x is greater than 4 and less than 5.

Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Irreducibility of the Polynomial:** First, we need to check if the polynomial ( f(x) = x^5 - x^4 - 4x^3 + 4x^2 + 2 ) is irreducible over (mathbb{Q}). One way to do this is to use Eisenstein's criterion or other methods of checking irreducibility. For simplicity, let's assume it is irreducible (this can be verified separately). 2. **Degree and Roots:** The polynomial ( f(x) ) is of degree 5, which is a prime number. According to the problem, it has precisely two non-real roots in the complex numbers. This implies that the remaining three roots must be real. 3. **Galois Group:** Since ( f(x) ) is irreducible over (mathbb{Q}) and has degree 5, and it has exactly two non-real roots, the Galois group of ( f(x) ) over (mathbb{Q}) is ( S_5 ). This follows from a known result in Galois theory: if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree ( p ) has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is ( S_p ). 4. **Solvability and ( S_5 ):** The symmetric group ( S_5 ) is not solvable. This is a classical result in group theory: for ( n > 4 ), the symmetric group ( S_n ) is not solvable. 5. **Roots and Rational ( n )-th Roots:** If ( alpha ) were an ( n )-th root of a rational number, say ( alpha = sqrt[n]{q} ) for some rational ( q ), then ( alpha ) would lie in a radical extension of (mathbb{Q}). However, since the Galois group ( S_5 ) is not solvable, the splitting field of ( f(x) ) cannot be a radical extension of (mathbb{Q}). Therefore, ( alpha ) cannot be an ( n )-th root of a rational number. 6. **Conclusion:** Since the Galois group ( S_5 ) is not solvable, no ( n )-th root of a rational number can be a root of the polynomial ( x^5 - x^4 - 4x^3 + 4x^2 + 2 ).

Step 4: Calculate the average of the set. - The sum of the numbers in the set is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + x. - There are 6 numbers in total. - The average is therefore frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + x}{6}. Step 5: Set the average equal to the mode (x) and solve for x.

(A cashier may have multiple keys, and multiple cashiers may have keys to the same lock.) It is known that any group of ( k ) cashiers together can always open the safe, but ( k-1 ) cashiers can never open it. What is the minimum number of locks on the safe? 1. **Identify the problem's conditions:** Any group of ( k ) cashiers can open the safe, but no group of ( k-1 ) cashiers can. 2. **Understand the implications:** This implies that for any subset of ( k-1 ) cashiers, there is at least one lock for which none of them have the key. Thus, the remaining ( n - (k-1) = n - k + 1 ) cashiers must necessarily have the key to that lock. 3. **Formulate the requirement:** For each subset of ( k-1 ) cashiers, there needs to be a distinct lock. The number of distinct subsets of ( k-1 ) cashiers can be computed as the combinations of ( n ) items taken ( k-1 ) at a time: [ binom{n}{k-1} ] 4. **Minimum number of locks:** Therefore, there must be at least ( binom{n}{k-1} ) locks to ensure that every group of ( k-1 ) cashiers can't open the safe while any group of ( k ) cashiers can. 5. **Construct a distribution of keys:** - Assign keys to ( binom{n}{k-1} ) locks.

Here, the ratio of the heights of the statues is frac{2 text{ ft}}{8 text{ ft}} = frac{1}{4}. 3. **Calculating the Surface Area Ratio**: The surface area ratio is the square of the linear dimension ratio: [ left(frac{1}{4}right)^2 = frac{1}{16} ] This means that each 2 ft. high statue has frac{1}{16} the surface area of the 8 ft. high statue. 4. **Paint Required for One Small Statue**: Since 2 pints of paint covers the 8 ft. statue, a 2 ft. statue (with frac{1}{16} the surface area) requires frac{2}{16} = frac{1}{8} pints of paint. 5. **Total Paint Required for 360 Small Statues**: Multiply the paint required for one small statue by the number of such statues: [ 360 times frac{1}{8} = 45 ] 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total amount of paint required to paint 360 statues, each 2 ft. high, is 45 pints.

Construct the hexagon.","completion":"1. First, recognize that in a regular hexagon (ABCDEFG), any two opposite vertices (like (A) and (C)) form a straight line through the center of the hexagon. The distance (overline{AC}) is called the diagonal of the hexagon. 2. In a regular hexagon, the ratio of the length of the diagonal to the side length ((a)) can be derived using geometry. The length of (overline{AC}), the diagonal of the hexagon, is: [ overline{AC} = 2a ] This is because the distance between two opposite corners of a regular hexagon is twice the length of one side. 3. Given the length of (overline{AC}), which we'll denote as (d), we can calculate the side length (a) of the hexagon: [ a = frac{d}{2} ] 4. To construct the hexagon, begin by constructing an equilateral triangle with a height of (frac{d}{2}). The reason for constructing such a triangle is that each angle in a regular hexagon is 120°, and we want to use the properties of equilateral triangles to build our hexagon. The height (h) in an equilateral triangle relates to the side length (a) by: [ h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a ] 5. Given (h = frac{d}{2}), we can find (a) as follows: [ frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a = frac{d}{2} ] [ a = frac{d}{sqrt{3}} ] 6. Once we have identified the length (a), construct a circle with radius (a) centered at point (C). This allows the drawing of the other vertices at an equal distance (a) from (C). 7. However, since point (D) must lie on a specified plane (S) perpendicular to (overline{AC}) (implying that (CD perp AC)), construct a perpendicular bisector to (overline{AC}) that intersects (S). 8. Draw circle (k) centered at point (C) with radius (a). The intersection of this circle with plane (S) would give us points (D) (and potentially more, depending on the orientation and distance of plane (S)). 9. The intersections of the circle (k) and the plane (S) yield the valid positions for point (D). This process may give us two points (when the plane (S) actually intersects circle (k), implying two valid positions of (D)), one point (if (S) is tangent to circle (k)), or no point if (S) does not intersect circle (k). 10. After identifying point (D), you can proceed with constructing the hexagon by identifying the other vertices using geometric properties of the hexagon, ensuring all sides measure (a).

By grouping terms according to a and b, the equation always holds true, and the coefficients of a and b are simultaneously zero, from which the values of x and y can be determined, i.e., the coordinates of the fixed point. Proof: Treat a and b as unknowns, then the original equation becomes: (2x+y+1)a+(x+y-1)b=0. Clearly, if the coefficients of a and b are simultaneously zero, then no matter what real numbers a and b are, the equation always holds true! At this point: 2x+y+1=0 and x+y-1=0. Solving these, we get x=-2; y=3.

Thus, in any set ( M ), there are at least three pairwise coprime numbers. This implies the existence of ( f(n) ) and ( f(n) leq n ). 3. **Lower Bound Concept**: Define ( T_{n} = {t mid t leqslant n+1 text{ and } (2 mid t text{ or } 3 mid t)} ), then ( T_{n} ) is a subset of ( {2, 3, ldots, n+1} ).

For ( 1 leqslant i < j leqslant 3 ), (|x_i - x_j| in {2, 4}), so at most one of ( x_1, x_2, x_3 ) might be divisible by 3 and at most one by 5.

Simplifying this equation, we get: 2a_1 + 2a_2 + 2a_3 = 8a_1 + 3a_2, which leads to: 6a_1 + a_2 = 2a_3. Applying the property of geometric sequences, where a_2 = a_1q and a_3 = a_1q^2, we can write: a_1(6 + q) = 2a_1q^2. Dividing by a_1 (since it is positive and not zero), we obtain the quadratic equation: 2q^2 - q - 6 = 0. Solving this equation for q, we find q = 2 as the positive solution. Given that a_4 = 16 and using the general term formula a_n = a_1q^{n-1}, we have: a_4 = a_1 cdot 2^3 = 16. From this, we find that a_1 = 2.

Determine the number of ideal subsets of {0, 1, 2, ldots }.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to determine the number of ideal subsets ( S ) of ( {0, 1, 2, ldots } ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are relatively prime positive integers. An ideal subset ( S ) must include 0 and for each ( n in S ), both ( n + p ) and ( n + q ) must also be in ( S ). 2. **Lattice Point Representation:** We represent the problem using lattice points ((x, y)) where ( 0 leq x leq p ) and ( y geq 0 ). We label each lattice point ((x, y)) with the number ( py - qx ). 3. **Achieving Nonnegative Labels:** Since ( p ) and ( q ) are relatively prime, for every nonnegative integer ( n ), there exist integers ( x' ) and ( y' ) such that ( py' - qx' = n ). This is guaranteed by the fact that ( p ) and ( q ) are relatively prime (Bézout's identity). 4. **Constructing Ideal Sets:** For any ideal set ( S ), let ( A ) be the set of lattice points with labels in ( S ). If ((x, y) in A), then ((x - a, y + b) in A) for all nonnegative integers ( a ) and ( b ). Since ( 0 in S ), ((0, 0) in A) and thus ((p, q) in A).

The points of ( A ) in this region are exactly the points above some path that only goes up and to the right from ((0, 0)) to ((p, q)), staying above the line ( py - qx = 0 ). 7. **Counting Valid Paths:** The number of ideal sets is the number of lattice paths from ((0, 0)) to ((p, q)) that always stay in the region ( py - qx geq 0 ). The path consists of ( p + q ) steps, denoted as ( w_1, ldots, w_{p+q} in {p, -q} ). Here, ( w_i = p ) corresponds to going up one unit, and ( w_i = -q ) corresponds to going right one unit. 8. **Cyclic Shifts and Valid Sequences:** We need to count the number of sequences that satisfy ( w_1 + cdots + w_{p+q} = 0 ) and ( sigma_n := w_1 + cdots + w_n geq 0 ) for all ( n in [0, p+q-1] ).

We are given that for any player ( i ), the sum of the number of winning cards of player ( i ) and his two neighbors (i.e., ( a_{i-1} + a_i + a_{i+1} )) is odd. This can be written as: [ a_{i-1} + a_i + a_{i+1} equiv 1 pmod{2} ] 2. **Consider the parity of ( a_i ):** Since the sum ( a_{i-1} + a_i + a_{i+1} ) is odd, it implies that the number of odd terms among ( a_{i-1}, a_i, a_{i+1} ) must be odd (either 1 or 3). 3. **Assume a player has zero winning cards:** Suppose ( a_i = 0 ) for some player ( i ). Then, the equation ( a_{i-1} + a_i + a_{i+1} equiv 1 pmod{2} ) simplifies to: [ a_{i-1} + a_{i+1} equiv 1 pmod{2} ] This means that ( a_{i-1} ) and ( a_{i+1} ) must have different parities (one is odd, the other is even). 4. **Propagate the assumption:** If ( a_i = 0 ) and ( a_{i-1} ) is odd, then ( a_{i-2} ) must be even (since ( a_{i-2} + a_{i-1} + a_i equiv 1 pmod{2} )). Similarly, if ( a_{i+1} ) is even, then ( a_{i+2} ) must be odd (since ( a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} equiv 1 pmod{2} )). 5. **Check the consistency:** Continue this process around the table. If we start with ( a_i = 0 ), we will find that the pattern of odd and even numbers must repeat every three players. However, since there are 8 players, this pattern cannot be consistent because 8 is not divisible by 3. 6. **Conclude the contradiction:** Since assuming ( a_i = 0 ) leads to an inconsistency, it must be that no player can have zero winning cards.

Can he always find a finite sequence of steps so the final polynomial on the board has exactly 2020 real roots? What about 2021 ? *~Sutanay Bhattacharya*","completion":"1. **Lemma**: If ( f(x) ) is a non-constant polynomial with even degree and positive leading coefficient, and ( N ) is a positive real number, one can find ( C > 0 ) such that for all ( c > C ), the equation ( f(x) = c ) has exactly two roots, and the difference between those roots is at least ( N ). **Proof**: Suppose ( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_0 ) for ( n ) even. We choose a large ( x_0 ) and take [ C_1 = a_n x_0^n + |a_{n-1}| x_0^{n-1} + cdots + |a_1| x_0 + |a_0| ge f(x_0). ] Now for ( c > C_1 ), ( f(x) = c ) has at least one positive root, since ( f(0) < f(x_0) < c ) (this can be ensured for large enough ( x_0 )) and ( f(x) to infty ) as ( x to infty ). Also, any such root must be at least ( x_0 ); indeed, if ( 0 le x_1 < x_0 ), then [ f(x_1) le a_n x_1^n + |a_{n-1}| x_1^{n-1} + cdots + |a_0| le a_n x_0^n + |a_{n-1}| x_0^{n-1} + cdots + |a_1| x_0 + |a_0| le C_1 < c, ] so ( x_1 ) cannot be a root. Now if there are two positive roots ( x_1 > x_2 ), then ( x_1, x_2 ge x_0 ). So now [ 0 = f(x_1) - f(x_2) = (x_1 - x_2) left( a_n frac{x_1^n - x_2^n}{x_1 - x_2} + cdots + a_1 frac{x_1 - x_2}{x_1 - x_2} right). ] Notice that [ j x_2^{j-1} < frac{x_1^j - x_2^j}{x_1 - x_2} < j x_1^{j-1}, quad frac{x_1^n - x_2^n}{x_1 - x_2} > x_1^{n-1}. ] Thus the second factor can be bounded as [ left( a_n frac{x_1^n - x_2^n}{x_1 - x_2} + cdots + a_1 frac{x_1 - x_2}{x_1 - x_2} right) > a_n x_1^{n-1} - |a_{n-1}| (n-1) x_1^{n-2} - cdots - |a_1|. ] The last expression is a polynomial in ( x_1 ) with positive leading coefficient, so if ( x_0 ) is large enough, this will be positive for ( x_1 > x_0 ). This means ( x_1 - x_2 ) cannot hold. Thus there is exactly one positive root, and it is at least ( x_0 ). Using the same argument on ( f(-x) ), one can find ( -x_0' ) and ( C_2 ) so that ( f(x) = c ) has exactly one negative root, which is smaller than ( -x_0' ). Taking ( C = max{C_1, C_2} ) now gives us the required ( C ). 2. For the main problem, first suppose ( P ) has a positive leading coefficient. By the lemma, we can find ( c ) so that ( P(x) - c ) has exactly 2 real roots, so the base case ( k = 2 ) is true. Now suppose Bob has constructed a polynomial ( f ) with ( k ) real roots. Clearly, this has even degree and positive leading coefficient, so suppose ( C_f ) is a number so that ( f(x) - c ) has exactly two roots for all ( c > C_f ). By the lemma, we can find ( c ) so that ( P(x) = c ) has exactly two roots, ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ), and ( a_1 - a_2 > C_f ). Now let Bob modify ( f(x) ) into ( P(f(x) + a_2) - c ). If ( x ) is a root of this, then either ( f(x) + a_2 = a_2 ), which gives ( k ) values for ( x ), or ( f(x) + a_2 = a_1 implies f(x) = a_1 - a_2 ), which has exactly two roots by assumption. This gives exactly ( k + 2 ) roots, as desired. 3. For 2021, we claim that Bob cannot always succeed. Indeed, let [ P(x) = x^2 (x^2 - 1^2) (x^2 - 2^2) cdots (x^2 - 1011^2). ] Note that ( P(x) = P(-x) ) for all ( x ), and it has 2023 roots, including 0. Suppose after a finite sequence of moves, the polynomial on the board is ( f(P(x)) ) and this has exactly 2021 real roots. Since ( x ) is a root of this if and only if ( -x ) is, for this to have an odd number of roots, ( x = 0 ) needs to be a root. Thus ( f(P(0)) = f(0) = 0 ). But then each of the 2023 roots of ( P ) is a root, contradiction.

We can rewrite the equation as: [2 - a = ln a] This simplifies to: [2 - a - ln a = 0] 2. **For the equation b(ln b - 1) = e^{3}:** Given b(ln b - 1) = e^{3}, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides to find a relationship involving ln b. However, to simplify the process, we observe that this equation can be rearranged to find a similar form to the first equation. By dividing both sides by b and then taking the natural logarithm, we get: [ln b + ln(ln b - 1) = 3] Rearranging gives us: [2 - (ln b - 1) - ln(ln b - 1) = 0] 3. **Analyzing the function f(x) = 2 - x - ln x:** Let's define a function f(x) = 2 - x - ln x for x > 0. We find that f(a) = 0 and f(ln b - 1) = 0. To understand the behavior of f(x), we look at its derivative: [f'(x) = -1 - frac{1}{x} = -frac{x + 1}{x}] Since x > 0, the denominator is always positive, and thus f'(x) < 0 for all x > 0. This means f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty). 4. **Concluding that a = ln b - 1:** Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing and f(a) = f(ln b - 1) = 0, it must be that a = ln b - 1. This implies: [a + 1 = ln b] 5. **Finding the value of ab:** Given 2 - a = ln a, we can add a + 1 = ln b to both sides to get: [3 = ln a + ln b = ln(ab)] Exponentiating both sides gives us: [ab = e^{3}] Therefore, the value of ab is boxed{e^{3}}."},{"prompt":"a triangle, the area is numerically equal to the perimeter.

Now, let's calculate the value of f(x) at the critical points given in the options: 1. For x=2, we have f(2) = frac{3}{2} + log_{frac{1}{2}}2 = frac{3}{2} - 1 = frac{1}{2} > 0. 2.

The change in the sign of f(x) between x=2 and x=3 implies f(2)f(3) < 0. According to the Intermediate Value Theorem, if a continuous function changes signs over an interval, then there exists at least one root (zero) in that interval.

The LCM of 3, 5, and 7 is the smallest number that is divisible by all three of these numbers. The prime factorization of 3 is 3. The prime factorization of 5 is 5. The prime factorization of 7 is 7.

What is the probability?","completion":"The numbers from 1 to 99 include both prime and composite numbers. However, there is one number that is neither prime nor composite, and that is the number 1. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is a number that has more than two positive divisors. The number 1 is not considered prime because it has only one positive divisor (itself), and it is not considered composite because it does not have more than two positive divisors. Since there are 99 pieces of paper and only one of them has a number that is neither prime nor composite, the probability of drawing that number (which is 1) is 1 out of 99.

Each operation allowed by the condition involves increasing the numbers at all vertices of a regular ( k )-gon (inscribed in the given ( n )-gon) by 1.

Observe that after any operation, the scalar multiples ( a_i ) of the vectors ( overrightarrow{OA_i} ) are modified, but the vector sum ( vec{S} ) (which is the sum of these scalar products) remains unchanged because the transformation doesn't change the spatial positions of the vertices. 5.

If the number of pieces on each vertex is less than the number of adjacent vertices, you cannot perform any operation. Find the minimum value of ( m ) (the total number of pieces) such that there is an initial placement of pieces which allows you to perform an infinite number of operations.","completion":"To determine the minimum value of m for which there exists an initial placement of m pieces such that we can perform infinite moves, let us analyze and prove the given problem in a structured manner. 1. **Notation and Definitions:** Let G be a connected simple graph with n vertices and e edges. Denote the vertex set by (V = {v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n}) and let d_i be the degree of vertex (v_i). 2. **Process of Operation:** Consider the operation on a vertex v_i where we move d_i pieces from v_i and distribute them to its neighbors. For the starting configuration to allow infinite operations, each vertex must at times get enough pieces to continue the process. 3. **Proof:** Let's assume there is an initial configuration with m pieces that allows infinite operations. - Suppose we have an infinite sequence of operations (S = (v_{t_1}, v_{t_2}, v_{t_3}, ldots)). Each (v_i) denotes an operation on vertex (v_i). - We need to show that each vertex (v_i) appears infinitely often in the sequence (S). If not, let (A = {v_i mid v_i) appears finitely often in (S}) and (B = V setminus A). 4. **Contradiction Argument:** By the connectivity of (G), there exists (v_j in A) and (v_k in B) such that ( (v_j, v_k) ) is an edge in (G). - There exists a number (N) such that for all (i > N), (v_{t_i} notin A). After (N) operations, pieces on vertices in (A) do not change. - Since (v_k) is operated infinitely often, it will receive pieces from (v_j), leading to a contradiction (pieces on vertices in (A) should increase infinitely, which was assumed to be finite). 5. **Conclusion:** Thus, each (v_i = 1, 2, ldots, n) must appear infinitely often in the sequence (S). Hence, to have pieces distributed perpetually, pieces must be available across edges indefinitely. It further means that initially, there must be a piece count that corresponds to all edges (i.e., at least one piece per edge). 6. **Construction:** To find the explicit placement: - Assign a sequence such that every piece is aligned initially across the vertices in a pattern (from some vertex (v_{t_1}) to subsequent vertices based on their adjacency relations). - For each vertex (v) initially, if placed correctly, it ensures each vertex operation corresponds to a piece movement across edges, providing infinite operation capacity. **Minimum Value:** Thus, by ensuring every edge has an associated piece movement path, the minimum required pieces will be equivalent to the number of edges (e).

Together, x and y's work rate per day is: (1/15) + (1/10) = (2/30) + (3/30) = 5/30 = 1/6 of the work per day. Now, let's find out how much work z contributes. Since x, y, and z together finish the work in 5 days, their combined work rate is 1/5 of the work per day. So, z's work rate per day is: 1/5 - 1/6 = (6/30) - (5/30) = 1/30 of the work per day. This means z does 1/30 of the work in one day, and since the work was completed in 5 days, z's total contribution to the work is: 5 * (1/30) = 1/6 of the work.

This can be visualized as follows: - The rack is a larger triangle with 5 rows. - Each smaller triangle is formed by selecting 3 balls that are adjacent to each other. 3. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:** - There are 6 smaller triangular sections. - Each section contains 3 balls. - Since there are 15 balls in total, and 7 of them are striped, we need to distribute these 7 striped balls among the 6 sections. 4. **Counting the Distribution:** - If we place the 7 striped balls into the 6 sections, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one section must contain at least 2 striped balls. This is because if each section had at most 1 striped ball, we would only account for 6 striped balls, but we have 7. 5. **Conclusion:** - Since each section is a triangle of 3 balls, having at least 2 striped balls in one section means that these 2 striped balls must be adjacent (as all balls in a triangular section are adjacent to each other). Thus, no matter how the 15 balls are arranged, there will always be at least one pair of adjacent striped balls. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A hotel had operations expenses totaling 100.

For the prime number 2, the nearest multiple of 3 greater than 7 is 9, so we need to multiply by ( 2^2 ) to get ( 2^9 ). For the prime number 3, the nearest multiple of 3 greater than 2 is 3, so we need to multiply by ( 3^1 ) to get ( 3^3 ). Therefore, ( x ) must be ( 2^2 times 3^1 = 4 times 3 = 12 ). Now, let's check if ( 1152 times 12 ) is indeed a perfect cube: [ 1152 times 12 = 2^7 times 3^2 times 2^2 times 3^1 = 2^9 times 3^3 ] This can be written as: [ (2^3)^3 times (3^1)^3 = (2^3 times 3^1)^3 = (8 times 3)^3 = 24^3 ] So, ( 1152 times 12 ) is indeed a perfect cube, and the smallest positive integer ( x ) that satisfies the condition is ( x = boxed{12} )."},{"prompt":"The diagonals of the axial crosssection of a truncated cone are divided by their intersection point in the ratio 2:1.

Prove that there are at least two balance lines.","completion":"To solve this problem, we will first focus on the concept of a \\"balanced line\\" based on the given points and their colors. Let's denote the 2n points as R_1, R_2, ..., R_n representing the red points and B_1, B_2, ..., B_n representing the blue points. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Convex Hull and Vertices:** - Consider the convex hull formed by the given 2n points. Let R be a red point on the convex hull. Without loss of generality, let R be one of the vertices of the convex hull. 2. **Introduction of Line l:** - There exists a line l passing through R such that all other points lie on one side of this line. - As line l is rotated around point R in a clockwise direction, the line will sequentially pass through each of the blue points B_1, B_2, ..., B_n. 3. **Calculation of Blue and Red Points:** - Let the number of blue points and red points on one side of line l when it passes through B_i be denoted as b_i and r_i respectively. Clearly, b_i = i-1 for i=1, 2, ..., n as we are rotating from B_1 to B_n. Hence, b_i increases by 1 for each successive blue point B_i. 4. **Define Displacement Values d_i:** - Define ( d_i = r_i - b_i ). This results in: - ( d_1 = r_1 geq 0 ) because there are initially no blue points on one side. - ( d_n = r_n - (n-1) leq 0 ) because ultimately there will be n-1 blue points. 5. **Monotonic Sequence and Intermediate Values:** - As i increases, r_i (number of red points on one side) does not decrease, meaning ( r_i ) is non-decreasing. Since b_i increases by one with each successive ( B_i ), it implies: [ d_{i} = r_{i} - b_{i} ] - Given ( 0 leq r_i leq n-1 ), it follows that ( d_i geq d_{i+1} - 1 ). Hence, numbers d_i change at most by 1 between consecutive i. - This indicates the sequence d_i = r_i - b_i starts non-negative and ends non-positive, meaning there must be an instance where ( d_i = 0 ). 6. **Existence of a Balanced Line:** - The condition ( d_i = 0 ) implies that ( r_i = b_i ). Therefore, for some i, line RB_i satisfies the balance condition, making RB_i a balanced line. 7. **Multiple Convex Hull Vertices:** - At least three vertices of the convex hull form from the 2n given points (since n ge 2). At least one vertex will be a blue point if the convex hull contains more than one shaded point. - Apply the same logic to the blue vertices, repeating the balance line detection process. Therefore, another balanced line exists. Thus, the existence of at least two distinct balanced lines is guaranteed.

This means the two triangles have the same size and shape, thus they are congruent. - **Statement B**: Angles are symmetric figures. This statement is correct because an angle can be bisected by a line (the angle bisector), and each side of the bisector is a mirror image of the other. Therefore, angles inherently possess symmetry about their bisectors. - **Statement C**: An equilateral triangle has 3 axes of symmetry. This statement is correct because each axis of symmetry is an angle bisector that also bisects the opposite side, dividing the equilateral triangle into two congruent right triangles. Since an equilateral triangle has three angles, it naturally has three axes of symmetry corresponding to the bisectors of its angles. - **Statement D**: In an isosceles triangle, the altitude, median on one side, and angle bisector of the angle opposite that side coincide.

This is because within the 8 times 8 layout, it's not possible to assure two connected neighbors for fewer cells scattered over the board. - Given that there are 64 cells in total and each color must occupy at least 4 cells to ensure the two-adjacent rule, the maximum number of different colors thus becomes frac{64}{4} = 16. 4. **Optimizing the Coloring:** - By ensuring each of the 16 2 times 2 blocks is colored individually and assigned a unique color, each cell within those blocks will have at least two sides in common with cells of the same color.

Consider the statements made by each child: - Оля: Everyone took odd places boys. - Олег: He and Оля took two adjacent places. - Паша: All people who took odd places have names starting with O. 2. According to the problem, only one child told the truth; the rest lied. Each child also claimed to have taken the first place, which means only one of them can be truthful about this statement. 3. Let's start by testing the possibilities where each child might be telling the truth. 4. Suppose Олег is telling the truth: - If Олег is truthful, then: - Олег must be in first place (as he claimed) - He and Оля are adjacent positions, so Оля must be in second place 5. Check the truthfulness of others under this assumption: - Оля's Claim: All odd places are taken by boys. If Олег is first and Оля is second, 1st place is a boy, but 3rd place could be a girl (not necessarily contradicting here, but let's keep it). Therefore, Оля's statement could be a lie. - Паша's Claim: Names starting with 'O' are in odd places. Given 1st is Oлег and 2nd is Оля, the next odd place (3rd) should have a name starting with O, but if Паша is not telling the truth, this does not have to hold. Thus, Паша is likely lying too. 6. Given that Oлег is truthful: - Олег is 1st, - Оля is adjacent, so Оля is 2nd, - Since Оля was assumed to lie, the boy positions rule she stated is false. Thus, - 3rd can be Поля (a girl) - 4th would be Паша 7. Verification: - Олег: 1st place (truthful, as he claimed). - Оля: Is second and lies, which fits her other claim being false. - Поля: If she left right away, her position in 3rd place is also fitting, as no further claims affect her. - Паша: His odd-named rule fails since not all odd placers have names starting with O, hence he lied. And we placed him last (4th). Thus, the final positions are: 1. Олег 2. Оля 3. Поля 4.

The segment A B of variable length is positioned on the line e such that the product A M cdot M B is constant. The midpoint F of the segment A B moves on a circle passing through M, and A M < B M. What is the locus of the points A and B?","completion":"\`\`\`markdown Let's analyze the problem step-by-step with detailed explanations and references: 1. **Given Data and Interpretation:** We are given that a line ( e ) rotates around a point ( M ). A segment ( AB ) lies on this line such that the product ( AM cdot MB ) is constant, denoted as ( c^2 ). The midpoint ( F ) of the segment ( AB ) traces a circle passing through ( M ), and we are given ( AM < BM ). 2. **Assessment for ( AM cdot MB = c^2 ):** Since ( AM cdot MB = c^2 ) is constant, both points ( A ) and ( B ) vary in such a way that their geometric mean remains the same. We consider a condition ( c > 0 ) because ( c = 0 ) implies that ( A ) is always at ( M ) and hence, ( B ) is a mirror image of ( A ) with respect to ( F ). 3. **Relationship Between Points:** With ( AM < BM ), point ( M ) separates points ( A ) and ( F ) from point ( B ). In every position of line ( e ), point ( F ) is one of the intersection points of ( e ) with circle ( k ) that is different from ( M ). 4. **Geometric Construction and Derivation:** Let us construct ( e ) perpendicularly at ( M ) and measure the segment ( MN = c ). Then, by drawing a circle centered at ( F ) with radius ( FN ), we intersect ( e ) again to get points ( A ) and ( B ). According to Thales' theorem, triangle ( ABN ) forms a right triangle with the right angle at ( N ). 5. **Mathematical Calculation:** Let ( FM = f ) and ( AM = x ) where ( x > 0 ). Then, ( MB = MF + FB = MF + AF = AM + 2 MF = x + 2f ). Using the condition ( x(x + 2f) = c^2 ), we derive the quadratic equation: [ x^2 + 2fx - c^2 = 0 ] Solving this, we get: [ x = sqrt{f^2 + c^2} - f ] 6. **Special Cases of ( e ):** The perpendicular position ( e^* ) to ( k ) does not apply here where ( F^* ) coincides with ( M ), and by our elimination, ( A^* ) and ( B^* ) meet at ( A^*M = MB^* = c ). 7. **Further Geometric Analysis:** We observe that for several positions of ( e ), points ( A ) and ( B ) form circles with the center as ( M )'s opposing point in ( k ), denoted as ( F_0 ). The radius follows: [ F_0 A_0^2 = F_0 B_0^2 = F_0 N_0^2 = F_0 M^2 + MN_0^2 = d^2 + c^2 ] where ( d ) is the diameter of circle ( k ). 8. **Calculation Validation:** Given ( F_0A = F_0B ) constant for any allowed positions of ( e ), simplifying further: [ F_0 B^2 = F_0 F^2 + FB^2 = F_0 F^2 + (MB - MF)^2 ] Using: [ MB - MF = FB - MF = AF - MF = AM ] leading to: [ F_0 B^2 = d^2 + MB cdot AM = d^2 + c^2 = F_0 A_0^2 ] 9. **Expression of Points Geometry:** We conclude that ( A ) and ( B ) trace specific segments of a circle determined by ( F_0 ) where: - The smaller arc ( i_a ) and the larger arc ( i_b ) where ( A ) and ( B ) always lie on opposite sections, respectively. 10. **Conclusion:** The geometric locus of points ( A ) and ( B ) define segments of a circle. The constants involved ( c ) and the circle ( k ) under the given constraints point towards a systematic geometric solution where ( A ) and ( B ) lie on arcs of a circle centered around an opposing point to ( M ) on circle ( k ).

Let’s call this initial set of ( k ) black cells as ( A_0 ). For instance, for ( k = 3 ), we would have a scenario like this: [ begin{array}{cccc} circ & circ & circ & cdots circ & bullet & circ & cdots circ & circ & bullet & cdots circ & circ & circ & bullet vdots & vdots & vdots & vdots end{array} ] 2. **Step 2: Shift and Duplicate** Next, shift this pattern diagonally right-up by ( k ), ( 2k ), ( 3k ), ldots, ( (k-1)k ) cells.
