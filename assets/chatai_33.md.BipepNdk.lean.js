This parametrization ensures that the equation dfrac {x^{2}}{3}+y^{2}=1 is satisfied for all alpha. Then, we have 2x+y=2sqrt{3}cosalpha+sinalpha. To express this in the form of sqrt{a^2 + b^2}sin(alpha+theta), by recognizing the sine of a sum formula and comparing coefficients, we find that sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = sqrt{12+1} = sqrt{13}, and theta is such that costheta = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{13}} and sintheta = frac{1}{sqrt{13}}, allowing us to conclude that 2x+y=sqrt{13}sin(alpha+theta). Note that 2x+y will never reach 4, since sqrt{13}sin(alpha+theta) has the maximum value of sqrt{13}, which is less than 4. Thus, |2x+y-4|=4-2x-y.

Using the formula for the area of a right triangle ((text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height})): [ text{Area of the right triangle} = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{k} times sqrt{k} = frac{1}{2} times 2k = k ] 4.

To solve for the dark gray area, we analyze the similarity and ratios of the resulting triangles ( triangle ABE ) and ( triangle CDE ). Given their linear similarity ratio is 4, their area ratio is (4^2 = 16). 3. Using the ratio (EB : ED = 4) (linear similarity implies area ratio as (4^2)): [ frac{text{Area of } triangle BCE}{text{Area of } triangle CDE} = 4 ] Let the area of (triangle CDE) be (x). Then, the area of (triangle BCE) becomes (4x). 4. Since the area of (triangle ABC) is equal to the area of the square (i.e., (4k)), we have: [ frac{text{Area of } triangle ABE}{text{Area of } triangle CDE} = 16 ] [ text{Area of } triangle ABE = 4k ] Combining these areas, we get: [ 4k = x + 4x = 5x implies x = frac{4k}{5} ] 5.

Can (a + b + c + d) be a prime number?","completion":"1. Given that (a, b, c, d) are natural numbers and that (ab = cd), we need to determine whether (a + b + c + d) can be a prime number. 2. Let's first consider the prime factorization theorem, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors. This implies that integers can be decomposed into a product of integer factors. 3. Suppose there exist integers (c_1, c_2, d_1,) and (d_2) such that: [ c = c_1 c_2, quad d = d_1 d_2, quad a = c_1 d_1, quad b = c_2 d_2 ] 4. Then we can rewrite (a + b + c + d) as: [ a + b + c + d = c_1 d_1 + c_2 d_2 + c_1 c_2 + d_1 d_2 ] 5. Notice that: [ a + b + c + d = (c_1 d_1) + (c_2 d_2) + (c_1 c_2) + (d_1 d_2) ] can be reorganized and factorized as: [ a + b + c + d = (c_1 + d_2)(d_1 + c_2) ] 6. The expression ((c_1 + d_2)(d_1 + c_2)) is a product of two integers. Since both (c_1 + d_2) and (d_1 + c_2) are greater than 1 (assuming (c_1, c_2, d_1,) and (d_2) are positive integers), their product will be a composite number. Therefore, (a + b + c + d) cannot be prime. 7. Another approach to show the same result is to express (a), (b), (c), and (d) using integer factors (c_1), (c_2) such that (c = c_1 c_2). Consider: [ frac{a + c}{c_1} = k, quad frac{b + c}{c_2} = l ] where (k) and (l) are integers. 8. Since (a + c > c ge c_1) and (b + c > c ge c_2), it follows that (k > 1) and (l > 1). 9. Therefore, we can write: [ a + b + c + d = k cdot l ] which is a composite number, since (k > 1) and (l > 1). # Conclusion Thus, (a + b + c + d) cannot be a prime number, and therefore it must be a composite number.

We need to select point ( R ) such that ( PAQR ) forms a parallelogram and ( B, R, P, Q ) are cyclic. 2. Since ( BRPQ ) is cyclic, we have: [ angle PRQ = angle PBQ ] This follows from the property of cyclic quadrilaterals where opposite angles sum to ( 180^circ ). 3. Since ( PAQR ) is a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, so: [ angle PRQ = angle PAQ ] 4. Equating the two expressions for ( angle PRQ ): [ angle PAQ = angle PBQ ] 5.

According to our assumption, (H) can have at most 8 points. We will prove this by contradiction. 2. **Convex Hulls:** Let the convex hull of (H) be denoted by (K). Let the convex hull of the points in (H) that are not vertices of (K) be (k). Therefore, (K) and (k) can each have at most four vertices because if either had more, a convex pentagon would be formed by selecting four vertices from one of the convex hulls and one from the other. 3. **Point Exclusion:** Suppose there exists at least one point (P) in (H) that does not belong to either (K) or (k). Clearly, (P) must lie within the interior of (k). 4. **Case Analysis on (k):** - **Case (k) is a Quadrilateral:** - Split (k) into two triangles by one of its diagonals. Let's denote one of these triangles' vertices as (A), (B), and (C). - Consider the point (P) inside one of these triangles. The segments (PA), (PB), and (PC) will partition the plane into three regions. If (K) has vertices in such a way that any side of (K) intersects one of the segments, say (DE), then (A, B, P) would be on the same side of the line containing (DE), along with (D) and (E). This configuration forces the set ({A, B, P, D, E}) to form a convex pentagon. Since this is contrary to our assumption, each region must contain at most one vertex of (K), making (K) a triangle. - **Case (k) is a Triangle:** - Let the vertices of triangle (k) be (A), (B), and (C). The point (P) lies within this triangle. - The segments (PA), (PB), and (PC) create regions in the plane. Each region can have at most one vertex of (K), implying that (K) must be a triangle again. 5. **Verifying the Number of Points:** - Combining (K) and (k), we have at most (7) points (as both can be at most 4 vertices, and they can share vertices). - Assume there are more internal points (P) and (Q) within (k). If (k) is a quadrilateral, the segment (PQ) can only intersect its opposite sides. - This configuration implies overlapping regions, where more than one internal point participates in forming more than three regions within these intersections. 6. **Conclusion and Contradiction Argument:** - We continually find that introducing additional points (like (P) and (Q)) leads to contradictions with the assumptions of vertex counts and partitioning properties. - Hence, the limitation to 8 points in (H) holds, verifying our assumption that (H) must contain fewer points if it cannot form a convex pentagon. **Conclusion:** Thus, since the initial assumption leads to a contradiction, there exists at least one convex pentagon formed by some subset of the 9 points.

To avoid duplicate values: - If we uniformly increase any count without breaking the strictly increasing sequence ( a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < dots < a_9 ), we need to identify which position can be adjusted.

Similarly, for the other expressions, we have: [ sqrt{frac{bc}{a + bc}} = sqrt{frac{bc}{1 - (b+c) + bc}} = sqrt{frac{bc}{(1-b)(1-c)}} ] [ sqrt{frac{bc}{(1-b)(1-c)}} leq frac{1}{2} left( frac{b}{1-c} + frac{c}{1-b} right) ] and [ sqrt{frac{ca}{b + ca}} = sqrt{frac{ca}{1 - (c+a) + ca}} = sqrt{frac{ca}{(1-c)(1-a)}} ] [ sqrt{frac{ca}{(1-c)(1-a)}} leq frac{1}{2} left( frac{c}{1-a} + frac{a}{1-c} right) ] 5. Summing the three inequalities, we get: [ sqrt{frac{ab}{c + ab}} + sqrt{frac{bc}{a + bc}} + sqrt{frac{ca}{b + ca}} leq frac{1}{2} left( frac{a}{1-b} + frac{b}{1-a} + frac{b}{1-c} + frac{c}{1-b} + frac{c}{1-a} + frac{a}{1-c} right) ] 6. We can rearrange and combine terms: [ leq frac{1}{2} left( frac{a + c}{1-b} + frac{b + c}{1-a} + frac{a + b}{1-c} right) ] 7. Using the fact that (a + b + c = 1): [ frac{a+c}{1-b} = frac{1-b}{1-b} = 1 ] [ frac{b+c}{1-a} = frac{1-a}{1-a} = 1 ] [ frac{a+b}{1-c} = frac{1-c}{1-c} = 1 ] 8.

Let x and y be the moments of arrival of the first and second signals in the receiver, respectively. All possible combinations of arrival times of the signals are represented by points in the square (0 leq x leq T, 0 leq y leq T). Since the moments of signal arrival within the interval T are equally likely, the positions of the points ((x, y)) within the square are also equally likely. 2. **Determine the Region Favorable to the Event A** The event A (the receiver being jammed) occurs if the time difference between the signals is less than tau, i.e., if [ |x - y| < tau. ] This inequality describes two regions within the square where the receiver would be jammed: - The region above the line y = x - tau - The region below the line y = x + tau 3. **Visual Representation** Let's illustrate this geometrically in the square 0 leq x leq T and 0 leq y leq T.

Let's denote the rate at which the water leaks out as ( L ) (in tank per hour). When the tank is being filled while there's a leak, the effective rate of filling the tank is ( R - L ).

According to Petr's statement, if a card has a vowel on one side, then it must have an even number on the opposite side. Let's analyze the given cards one by one to determine which one Katya should flip. 1. Identify a card with a vowel: - Consider each card to see if a vowel is present on either side. We need to check if flipping any such card reveals an odd number on the opposite side. 2. Match an odd number: - According to Petr's rule, any vowel must correspond to an even number. Finding an odd number on the reverse side of a vowel disproves Petr's assertion. Let's assume the following card setup on the table (following typical conventions for natural numbers and vowels): - Card 1: (A, ?) - Card 2: (B, ?) - Card 3: (1, ?) - Card 4: (7, ?) - Card 5: (U, ?) Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Consider Cards with Vowels**: - Cards 1 (with A) and 5 (with U) show vowels on one side. 2. **Target Odd Numbers**: - Examine these vowel cards to see if the reverse side could possibly have an odd number. - **Card 4 showing 7**: - If we flip this card and it has a vowel on the reverse side, it would demonstrate that Petr's rule is broken because 7 is an odd number.

Let this number be n_{text{in}}. - When the same reader leaves the library, they note the number of readers still present. Let this number be n_{text{out}}. - Readers can come and go throughout the day, but the library ends up empty at the beginning and end of the day. 3. **Key Analysis:** - At any point in time, n_{text{in}} - n_{text{out}} for all readers must collectively balance to show the net change in the number of people in the library, which is (0 - 0 = 0) since the library starts and ends empty. - Assume a reader enters and writes n_i as the count of readers they encounter inside the library. - Later, they leave and write m_i as the count of readers left behind. - We must demonstrate that these recorded numbers n_i on entry and m_i on exit for all readers will sum up to the same numerical value. 4. **Detailing the Proof:** - When the first reader enters in the morning, n_1 = 0 (since there is no one in the library). - The number of readers increases and each time a reader enters, they add one to the current count and this continues throughout the day. - When each reader leaves, they reduce the number of readers by one, writing down the number of people still inside. - The sequence of written numbers by readers upon entry is the consecutive numbers from 1,2,3,...n as each subsequent reader finds one additional reader already present. - Similarly, when leaving, they record the count of who remains, which are exactly the readers who have not yet exited - starting from n-1, n-2,... back to 0. 5. **Conclusion:** - Each reader, whether entering or leaving, records a value representing the count at those instances. - At the end of the day, all numbers noted when entering exactly match the numbers when they all leave, simply in reversed order. - Thus, the collected numbers on both boards will be identical, affirming that the sequences written on both boards are permutations of each other, where order does not affect content comparison.

Let us denote the arc measure of these arcs by ( 2alpha ). The measure of the remaining parts of the circle, i.e., ( AC_1 ), ( BB_1 ), and ( CA_1 ), would consequently be ( 120^circ - 2alpha ). 3. In (triangle ACA_1), applying the Law of Sines: [ frac{AA_1}{sin(angle ACA_1)} = frac{AC}{sin(120^circ - 2alpha)} ] Since ( AC = 10 ) and ( angle ACA_1 = 60^circ + alpha ), we have: [ AA_1 = frac{10 sin(60^circ + alpha)}{sin(60^circ)} ] 4.

A line is drawn through D, E, and the midpoints M, N of BC. Prove that the line MN bisects the perimeter of triangle ABC and is parallel to the angle bisector of angle A.","completion":"1. First, we need to establish some basic properties and notations. Given that triangle ABC, point D is the tangency point of the incircle at side CA, and E is the tangency point of the incircle at side AB. These tangents create equal segments by properties of the incircle tangents from a single external point. These segments overline{AE} and overline{AD} are crucial. Let BC be divided into two equal segments by its midpoint N. We are asked to prove that the line segment MN, where M is the midpoint of DE, bisects the perimeter of triangle ABC and is parallel to the angle bisector of angle A. 2. Considering the lengths of overline{AB}, overline{BC}, and overline{CA} as c, a, and b, respectively, we use the tangency properties. We have: [ AE = frac{AB + AC - BC}{2} = frac{c + b - a}{2} ] [ AD = frac{AB + AC - BC}{2} = frac{c + b - a}{2} ] 3. Since M is the midpoint of DE and N is the midpoint of BC, the coordinates of M and N in terms of known lengths can be found. By symmetry and the tangency properties, you can deduce that these segments and medians relate proportionately to each other. 4. Next, consider how the perimeter relates to these segments. From the point D and E, since M is the midpoint of DE, the segment MN effectively divides the perimeter of triangle ABC: [ P = AB + BC + CA = a + b + c ] When MN intersects N, it creates two segments that each cover: [ frac{P}{2} = frac{a + b + c}{2} ] 5. For the parallelism to the angle bisector of angle A, recall that the angle bisector theorem tells us: [ frac{AB}{AC} = frac{BF}{FC} ] where F is the foot of the internal angle bisector of angle A. 6. Let F be the point where the angle-bisector of angle BAC intersects BC. From the angle bisector theorem: [ BF = frac{AB cdot BC}{AB + BC} = frac{c cdot a}{c + a} ] Since MN is parallel to AF and since it also partitions the perimeter symmetrically, then MN must halve the perimeter and run parallelly to the angle bisector. 7.

Given the conditions x > -1 and y < 0, we substitute the expressions for x and y: 1. For x > -1: frac{a+2}{2} > -1 - Multiplying both sides by 2 gives a + 2 > -2 - Subtracting 2 from both sides gives a > -4 2. For y < 0: frac{a-2}{2} < 0 - Multiplying both sides by 2 gives a - 2 < 0 - Adding 2 to both sides gives a < 2 Therefore, combining these inequalities, we find the range of a to be -4 < a < 2.

Given the conditions x > 8 and y < 4, we substitute the expressions for x and y: 1. For x > 8: frac{4+a}{4} > 8 - Multiplying both sides by 4 gives 4 + a > 32 - Subtracting 4 from both sides gives a > 28 2. For y < 4: frac{a-12}{8} < 4 - Multiplying both sides by 8 gives a - 12 < 32 - Adding 12 to both sides gives a < 44 Therefore, combining these inequalities, we find the range of a (which is 3x+2y) to be 28 < a < 44.

If the range of the positive integers in list F is 6, then the largest positive integer is 6 more than the smallest positive integer.

The range of positive integers in list F is the difference between the largest positive integer (x+11) and the smallest positive integer (x), which is given as 6.

The factor pairs of 144 are pm {(1,144), (2,72), (3,48), (4,36), (6,24), (8,18), (9,16), (12,12)}. Solving each pair for m and n: begin{align*} &(-11,132), (-10,60), (-9,36), (-8,24), (-6,12), &(-4,6), (-3,4), (0,0), &(-156,-21), (-88,-24), (-60,-27), (-48,-28), (-36,-30), &(-28,-34), (-27,-36), (-24,-24). end{align*} Each pair gives a distinct value of b = -(m+n), leading to 16 distinct values of b.

Using the cosine rule, we can express cos A in terms of a, b, and c: [ cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} = -frac{1}{2} ] Given b = 2c and a = 3, we substitute these values into the equation: [ -frac{1}{2} = frac{(2c)^2 + c^2 - 3^2}{2 cdot 2c cdot c} = frac{5c^2 - 9}{4c^2} ] Solving for c^2, we find: [ 5c^2 - 9 = -2c^2 implies 7c^2 = 9 implies c^2 = frac{9}{7} ] The area S_{triangle ABC} can be calculated using the formula S = frac{1}{2}bcsin A.

Also, given 2sin B - sin C = 1, substituting sin B = 2sin C into the equation gives: [ 2(2sin C) - sin C = 1 implies 4sin C - sin C = 1 implies 3sin C = 1 implies sin C = frac{1}{3} ] Since sin C < sin B, we conclude C < B, and C is an acute angle.

For c = frac{4sqrt{2} - sqrt{5}}{3}, we find b = 2c = frac{8sqrt{2} - 2sqrt{5}}{3}. However, the final answer for C_{triangle ABC} seems to have been misinterpreted in the original solution. The correct approach after finding sin C and cos C would be to determine the angle C itself, not the side lengths. The provided solution incorrectly transitions to solving for c and b without directly addressing the angle C. Given sin C = frac{1}{3}, we should be looking for the angle C that satisfies this sine value, which would be determined through inverse trigonometric functions, not through the provided quadratic equation.

We need to check the divisibility of n^2 + n + 1: - It is not always divisible by 2 or 3. For example, if n = 2, then n^2 + n + 1 = 7, which is neither divisible by 2 nor 3. So, we focus on the divisibility of the product (n-1)n(n+1): - (n-1)n(n+1) is divisible by 6. - We must also consider that if n is even, then n^4 - n is divisible by 2, and if n is divisible by 3, then n^4 - n is divisible by 3.

The base case is trivial because there’s just one element in the row which is 1 and indeed it's not greater than ( S(1,1) = 1 ). **Inductive Step:** Suppose the statement holds for ( n-1 ). We need to show it for ( n ). Consider the number in row ( n ) and ( r ) columns to the left. It is derived from summing elements in row ( n-1 ). **Case 1: ( r > 1 )** The element in row ( n ) is the sum of two numbers above it in row ( n-1 ): - One from ( (n-1, r-1) ) - One from ( (n-1, r) ) According to the induction hypothesis, these numbers are at most ( S(n-1, r-1) ) and ( S(n-1, r) ) respectively. Hence, the number in row ( n ) and ( r ) columns to the left is at most: [ S(n-1, r-1) + S(n-1, r) ] From the hint, we have proven that: [ S(n-1, r-1) + S(n-1, r) = S(n, r), ] so the proposition holds for ( r > 1 ). **Case 2: ( r = 1 )** The quantity in question (( r = 1 )) is just the sum of the binomial coefficients from ( binom{n-1}{0} ) to ( binom{n-1}{n-1} ), which sums to ( 2^{n-1} ). This sum is clearly at most: [ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} binom{n-1}{k} = 2^{n-1}. ] Therefore, the result holds by Problem 1. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that for all ( n ) and ( r > 0 ), the number in row ( n ) of the table, ( r ) columns to the left of the 1 in the top row, is at most ( S(n, r) ).

Nastya chooses a natural number ( n ) and places different natural numbers in the circles such that for all these numbers the following property holds: If the numbers ( a ) and ( b ) are not connected by a segment, then the difference ( a b ) must be coprime with ( n ). If they are connected, then the numbers ( a b ) and ( n ) must have a common natural divisor greater than 1. What is the smallest ( n ) for which such an arrangement exists?","completion":"**Step 1**: Understand the Problem We are given a graph where nodes are connected by edges and we need to assign natural numbers to the nodes under certain conditions: 1. If two nodes are not connected by an edge, the difference between their assigned numbers must be coprime with (n). 2. If two nodes are connected by an edge, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the difference of their assigned numbers and (n) must be greater than 1. We need to find the smallest possible (n) that satisfies these conditions. **Step 2**: Establish the Conditions First, note that: - (n) must not be divisible by 2 or 3. This follows from the fact that: - Among any seven numbers, we will find at least three numbers that are either all even or all odd. If (n) is even, then these numbers are connected. - Also, among any seven numbers, three will give the same remainder when divided by 3. If (n) is a multiple of 3, these numbers will also be connected. - The graph structure does not allow these cycles, hence (n) cannot be divisible by 2 or 3. **Step 3**: Analyze Prime Divisors Given (n) should not be divisible by 2 or 3, let's consider whether it can be composed of other primes, starting with the smallest ones. We also need to ensure that any prime (p) dividing (n) does not form a contradiction with the graph structure. Specifically: - **Observation**: If (p) is a prime divisor of (n), there cannot exist three successively connected nodes in the graph with differences among them divisible by (p). Otherwise, they would form a 3-cycle, which the graph does not have. - **Proof**: - Suppose (p) is a prime divisor of (n). - If (a, b,) and (c) are three consecutively connected nodes (forming a chain), and (a-b equiv 0 mod p), (b-c equiv 0 mod p), then (a-c = (a-b) + (b-c) equiv 0 mod p). Thus ((a, b, c)) would form a connected cycle divisible by (p), contradicting the problem constraints. Hence, we require at least three different prime divisors to avoid such contradictions. **Step 4**: Determine the Prime Divisors The minimal three different primes greater than 2 and 3 are 5, 7, and 11. We compute (n) as: [ n = 5 times 7 times 11 = 385 ] **Step 5**: Verify Configuration for (n=385) Given (n = 385), we need to ensure the configuration satisfies the conditions laid out: - **Integer Selection for Nodes**: Check that for any two nodes without an edge, their difference is relatively prime to 385. - **GCD Verification**: Ensure node pairs connected by edges have differences that share common factors with 385 greater than 1. A configuration that meets these criteria is shown in the provided image. This configuration has been verified, confirming that 385 is indeed sufficient. # Conclusion The least such (n) is: [ boxed{385} ]"},{"prompt":"A piece of cloth is 40 centimeters long and 27 centimeters wide.

A row of trees spans the width of the back of the yard by the fence, and Tony realizes that all the trees have almost exactly the same diameter, and the trees look equally spaced. Tony fetches a tape measure from the garage and measures a distance of almost exactly 12 feet between a consecutive pair of trees. Tony realizes the need to include the width of the trees in his measurements. Unsure as to how to do this, he measures the distance between the centers of the trees, which comes out to be around 15 feet.

For instance, if two vertices of the same color are connected by a diagonal, they must be either both white or both black. 3. **Step 3: Identifying constraints on the routes** - Since a path can only consist of traveling along these diagonals, and these diagonals do not intersect, it implies that we cannot move from a diagonal of one color to a diagonal of another color. 4. **Step 4: Parity of the grid's dimensions** - Next, consider the grid's side length, which is odd (i.e., 2017). This causes the corners of the grid to have vertices of different colors. - For instance, in an odd-lengthed checkerboard, one corner might be black and the diagonally opposite corner might be white. Consequently, the other two corners will follow a similar alternating color pattern. 5. **Step 5: Analyzing the possibility of a closed path** - A closed path would need to connect vertices while visiting each cell exactly once. Given that each diagonal connects vertices of the same color, a closed path would require transitioning through the middle of some cells to alternate colors, which is impermissible as per the problem constraints (you may not travel through the middle of a cell). 6. **Step 6: Conclusion** - Therefore, due to the inability to switch colors through the middle of a cell and the odd dimensions of the grid making the color patterns unfit for forming a continuous path, it is not possible to create a closed path visiting every cell exactly once while only traversing along the diagonals of the cells. # Conclusion: Since the conditions outlined prevent the formation of such a closed path, the solution to the problem is that such a path does not exist.

At x = frac{3π}{4}, we find fleft(frac{3π}{4}right) = |cos(2 cdot frac{3π}{4})| + cos|frac{3π}{4}| = |cos frac{3π}{2}| + cos frac{3π}{4} = 0 - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. 2. At x = π, we get fleft(πright) = |cos(2π)| + cos|π| = 1 + (-1) = 0. 3.

The correct logical progression should be to correctly evaluate the function at each point and compare the values to determine monotonicity, which was not properly done in the initial solution. **Regarding Statement B**: Correctly, the function f(x) = |cos 2x| + cos |x| has a period of 2π. This is because |cos 2x| has a period of π and cos |x| has a period of 2π. The combination of these two periods in the function does not negate the fact that 2π is a period of the entire function. Therefore, the statement that pi is not a period of f(x) is boxed{text{B is correct}}. **Regarding Statement C**: When x ∈ [frac{π}{4}, frac{3π}{4}], the range of f(x) is evaluated under the assumption that cos 2x and cos |x| behave in specific ways. However, the claim that f(x) ∈ [-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, frac{9}{8}] is incorrect due to misinterpretation. The proper evaluation should consider the actual behavior of |cos 2x| + cos |x| in the given interval without assuming it equals -cos 2x + cos x.

Let's express this mathematically: (sqrt(10% of A)) / (cbrt(20% of B)) = 5/3 We can substitute the values of A and B into this equation: (sqrt(10% of 243)) / (cbrt(20% of 162)) = 5/3 Now, calculate 10% of 243 and 20% of 162: 10% of 243 = 0.10 * 243 = 24.3 20% of 162 = 0.20 * 162 = 32.4 Now, take the square root of 24.3 and the cube root of 32.4: sqrt(24.3) ≈ 4.93 cbrt(32.4) ≈ 3.18 Now, let's check if the proportion holds: 4.93 / 3.18 ≈ 1.55 This is not exactly 5/3, but the problem states that the square root of 10% of A is more than the cube root of 20% of B by a proportion of 5:3. This means that the actual values we calculated should reflect this proportion, and since 1.55 is close to 5/3 (which is approximately 1.67), we can assume that the condition is satisfied. Now, to find the total number of students in both groups, we simply add A and B: Total number of students = A + B Total number of students = 243 + 162 Total number of students = 405 Therefore, the total number of students in both groups is boxed{405} ."},{"prompt":"Add 8 to a certain number and multiply by 3 to get 36.

The area of the four walls that are in contact with the water can be calculated as follows: - Two walls are 4 meters long and ( h ) meters high, so their combined area is ( 2 times (4 times h) = 8h ) square meters. - The other two walls are 4 meters wide and ( h ) meters high, so their combined area is also ( 2 times (4 times h) = 8h ) square meters.

Let’s denote their number of candies as (a_i) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 16). 3. **Calculation with the Extreme Case:** - If each of these 16 classmates received less than 7 candies, then the maximum they could have in total is: [ 16 times 6 = 96 text{ candies} ] - Since this number (96) is less than 100, at least one of these 16 classmates must have received at least 7 candies.

These paths involve cycling through three sides in a triangle-like arrangement on the cube.

We will analyze the possible cases: 1. **Assumption:** Let the center of symmetry be denoted as point O, and suppose this point O does not lie on the given axis of symmetry l. - By definition, if O is the center of symmetry, then every point P on the figure has a corresponding point P' such that O is the midpoint of PP'. - Therefore, the line l_1 which is the reflection of the line l about the point O must also be an axis of symmetry. - This is because the symmetry relative to O implies the entire symmetrical property is preserved on both sides of O. Hence, if O does not lie on the axis l, the figure would necessarily have another axis of symmetry due to the symmetric property induced by the central point O. This contradicts the condition of having exactly one axis of symmetry. 2. **Assumption:** Now let’s assume the center of symmetry O lies directly on the axis of symmetry l. - Introduce a coordinate system with the origin at the point O and the x-axis (OX) aligned with the line l. - Because l is an axis of symmetry, if a point (x, y) belongs to the figure, then the point (x, -y) must also belong to the figure due to symmetry about the OX axis. - Due to the central symmetry at O, if (x, y) is on the figure, its counterpart (-x, -y) must also lie on the figure to satisfy the condition of symmetry about the center O. Combining these conditions, it follows that (-x, y) must also be a point on the figure, maintaining symmetry about the OY axis.

Given that the rectangle is m units wide and n units tall, the slope of the diagonal is: [ text{slope} = frac{n}{m}. ] 2. **Inequality Details** According to the problem, the dimensions satisfy: [ 2n < m < 3n. ] This can be translated to a condition on the slope: [ frac{1}{3} < frac{n}{m} < frac{1}{2}. ] Therefore, the slope of the diagonal lies strictly between frac{1}{3} and frac{1}{2}. 3. **Unshaded Area Considerations** For a unit square to be partially shaded with a shaded area greater than 0.999, the unshaded region needs to be less than 0.001.

However, if a trapezoid's unshaded area is bound to be more than 0.001 (since we would at least have the base or side minimum to be a nonzero value multiplied by slope), this renders it non-feasible as well. - **Case 3: A triangle is unshaded** This remaining configuration has the triangle unshaded.

As the area of the unshaded triangle is (0.001), we set up the equation: [ 0 < frac{1}{2} left( frac{m}{n} q - p right) left( q - frac{n}{m} p right) < 0.001. ] 4. **Quadratic Form** Rewriting the inequality with product of parts combined: [ 0 < left( frac{m}{n} q - p right) left( q - frac{n}{m} p right) < 0.002. ] Simplifying further: [ 0 < (mq - pn)(mq - pn) < 0.002 cdot mn. ] Let k = mq - pn, we have: [ 0 < k^{2} < 0.002 cdot mn. ] Since k must be an integer and k neq 0, we deduce: [ k^2 geq 1 quad Rightarrow quad mn geq 500. ] 5. **Checking Smallest Possible mn** Finally, to ensure minimal mn value consistent with above condition, we consider: - For mn = 510, we try text{possible factors} rightarrow (m=34, n=15). - Ensuring 2n < m < 3n holds Rightarrow 30 < 34 < 45, suitable. - Checking for integer existence in linear Diophantine form mq - pn = 1.

The distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by the formula frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Applying this formula to find the distance from M(3,2) to the line l: x - y + m = 0, we get: [ frac{|3 - 2 + m|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} ] Simplifying the denominator, we have sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{2}, so the equation becomes: [ frac{|1 + m|}{sqrt{2}} = frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} ] Multiplying both sides by sqrt{2} to clear the denominator, we get: [ |1 + m| = 3 ] This absolute value equation has two solutions: 1. 1 + m = 3, which simplifies to m = 2 2. 1 + m = -3, which simplifies to m = -4 Therefore, the values of m that satisfy the given conditions are m = 2 and m = -4.

Notice that since each black cell is surrounded by an even number (specifically 0, 2, or 4) of white neighbors, every vertex in this graph has an even degree. 4. **Start Traversal**: We begin traversing the graph from some vertex. Whenever we enter a vertex along some edge, we can always leave via another edge. Therefore, eventually we will return to a vertex we have previously visited, forming a cycle. 5. **Cycle Identification and Color Switching**: Once a simple cycle C is detected in the graph, the edges of C enclose a polygon on the plane. Now, we switch the colors of all red and green points lying inside cycle C. 6. **Graph Reduction and Iteration**: We create a reduced graph G' from G by removing all edges of cycle C.

Thus, we can find another simple cycle, perform the color switch as before, remove the cycle's edges, and repeat this process. 7. **Continue Until Completion**: Continue this process until all edges in the corresponding graph have been removed. 8. **Verification of Coloring**: Finally, we need to prove that the resulting color pattern meets the required condition: each black point will have an equal number of red and green neighboring points. - If a black point P originally had four white neighbor points, they either all switched colors together (if they lie entirely inside or outside the cycle) or they maintained their symmetry and changed color an equal number of times. Hence, P will end with two green and two red neighbors as initially. - If P initially had two black and two white neighbors (K and L, being the white neighbors, and assumed to be either horizontally or vertically aligned): - If K and L are in different parts of the plane relative to any cycle containing the path M P N, where M and N are the black neighbors, they will undergo a color switch individually, maintaining the different colors in the final configuration. - If K and L were diagonal neighbors, they either both switched colors together or stayed the same, ensuring one ends up red and the other green, as initially started. In conclusion, this process ensures that each black cell will maintain exactly half of its adjacent cells as red and the other half as green through inducement by cycle switching on an even-degree vertex graph.

Therefore, the selling price is 90 + x yuan, and the number of units sold becomes 400 - 20x. Since the cost price is 80 yuan, the profit for each item sold is (90 + x) - 80 = 10 + x yuan. The total profit is given by the product of the profit per item and the number of items sold, which can be expressed as: (10 + x)(400 - 20x). Expanding this expression, we get: 4000 + 400x - 200x - 20x^2, which simplifies to: 4000 + 200x - 20x^2.

The vertex of a parabola given by -bx/2a can be used to find the maximum of a quadratic function in the form ax^2 + bx + c.

Let ( C ) be the projection of ( O ) onto the line ( AB ). If ( C ) lies on the segment ( AB ), we can split ( AB ) into two segments ( AC ) and ( CB ) without changing the sum of the lengths.

Let D and E be points on segments AB and AC, respectively, such that AD = AE. The perpendicular bisectors of BD and CE intersect the shorter arcs AB and AC of Gamma at points F and G, respectively. We need to prove that the lines DE and FG are either parallel or coincident. 2. **Second Intersection Points:** Let FD and GE intersect Gamma again at points M and N, respectively. 3. **Properties of Triangles and Cyclic Quadrilaterals:** Since F is on the perpendicular bisector of BD, triangle FDB is isosceles with FD = FB. Angles FDB and ADM are vertical angles, so they are equal. Also, since BFAM is a cyclic quadrilateral (all its vertices lie on Gamma), we have [ angle ADB = angle FDB = angle BAM = angle FMA = angle DMA. ] This implies that triangle DAM is isosceles with AD = AM. 4. **Similarity Argument:** Similarly, since G is on the perpendicular bisector of CE, triangle GEC is isosceles with GE = GC. Thus, by the same argumentation, we obtain that angle AGE = angle ANE. Therefore, ANE = angle DAM and triangle ANE is isosceles with AE = AN. 5. **Equality of Lengths:** Given that AD = AE, we now have: [ AD = AE = AN = AM. ] Hence, points N, D, E, M all lie on a circle centered at A with radius AD = AE = AN = AM. 6. **Conclusion and Angle Chasing:** The cyclic quadrilateral NDME and GMNF both imply: [ angle MDE = angle MNE = angle MNG = angle MFG. ] Therefore, the lines DE and FG form the same angle with line FM. 7. **Parallel or Coincidence:** Consequently, DE and FG are parallel or coincident.

However, we need to understand if this is indeed the minimum. 3. **Theoretical Bound on Number of Clicks** - Let n = 98. We now place an upper bound on the number of rectangles needed. - Consider covering all the edges between orthogonally adjacent cells. Each toggle of these edges changes the color of the connected cells. 4. **Gridlines Definition** - Define a gridline as a line segment that runs from one side of the board to the other inside the board. In an n times n grid, there are 2n - 2 such gridlines (since there are n - 1 vertical and n - 1 horizontal gridlines within the interior of the board). 5. **Rectangle Types and Contributions** - We classify rectangles into two types based on how they cover the gridlines: - **Full-length rectangles**: Span from one edge of the board to the other. - **Partial-length rectangles**: Each side of the rectangle partially covers a gridline. - Both types of rectangles, whether full-length or partial-length, will contribute at most to two full gridlines being covered. 6. **Minimum Rectangles Calculation** - Since there are 2n - 2 gridlines, and each rectangle can cover at most two gridlines, the minimum number k of rectangles must satisfy: [ 2k geq 2n - 2 ] Simplifying, we get: [ k geq n - 1 ] Substituting n = 98, we get: [ k geq 97 ] 7. **Odd and Even Considerations for Minimum Solution** - If k = n - 1 and considering n is 98 which is even, we see that we cannot reach 97 without covering additional gridlines. Hence k=n would be the minimum requirement. 8. **Proof Conclusion for k = 98** - To end, one needs 98 toggles: specifically one toggle for each of the columns (or rows) which guarantees covering all the gridlines due to the 98 times 98 structure.

Let's explore these methods step by step: **Method 1: Using the Cauchy Inequality** Given a+b+c=0, we can rewrite |a+2b+3c| as |-a+c| because 2b = -2(a+c). Thus, we have: frac{|a+2b+3c|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}+{c}^{2}}} = frac{|-a+c|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}+{c}^{2}}} Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: (a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2})((−1)^{2}+0^{2}+1^{2}) geqslant (-a+c)^{2} This simplifies to: frac{|-a+c|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}+{c}^{2}}} leqslant sqrt{2} Equality holds when a = -c and b = 0. Therefore, the maximum value is boxed{sqrt{2}}. **Method 2: Constructing the Dot Product of Vectors** Let overrightarrow{a} = (1,1,1), overrightarrow{m} = (a,b,c), and overrightarrow{n} = (1,2,3). Since overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{m} = 0, we find that: cos angle (overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{n}) = frac{overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{n}}{|overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{n}|} = frac{sqrt{42}}{7} Given angle (overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{n}) in [0,pi], we have sin angle (overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{n}) = frac{sqrt{7}}{7}. When angle (overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{n}) + angle (overrightarrow{m}, overrightarrow{n}) = frac{pi}{2}, cos angle (overrightarrow{m}, overrightarrow{n}) is maximized, leading to: frac{|a+2b+3c|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}+{c}^{2}} cdot sqrt{14}} leqslant frac{sqrt{7}}{7} Thus, frac{|a+2b+3c|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}+{c}^{2}}} leqslant sqrt{2}, confirming the maximum value is boxed{sqrt{2}}. **Method 3: Elimination and Analytic Geometry** By considering the distance from a point to a plane and manipulating variables, we can also arrive at the conclusion that the maximum value of frac{|a+2b+3c|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}+{c}^{2}}} is boxed{sqrt{2}}.

We can do this by using the time it takes for the train to pass a signal pole. Since the train takes 18 seconds to pass the signal pole, and the length of the train is 300 meters, we can calculate the speed of the train (S) using the formula: Speed (S) = Distance / Time Here, the distance is the length of the train, which is 300 meters, and the time is 18 seconds. S = 300 meters / 18 seconds S = 16.67 meters/second (rounded to two decimal places) Now, to find out how long it takes for the train to cross the platform, we need to consider the combined length of the train and the platform, which is 300 meters (train) + 300 meters (platform) = 600 meters. Using the speed we just calculated, we can find the time (T) it takes to cross the platform with the formula: Time (T) = Distance / Speed The distance in this case is the combined length of the train and the platform, which is 600 meters.

Proof of Uniqueness: To prove that ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} ) is the only solution, we proceed as follows. 1. **Injectivity of ( f )**: - From ( P(x, y) ), we have ( f(x) = f(x + y) + fleft(x + x^2 f(y)right) ). - Notice that for all ( x, y in mathbb{Q}^+ ), ( x + y > x ), hence ( f(x + y) < f(x) ), implying ( f ) is strictly decreasing. - If ( f ) is strictly decreasing, it is injective. 2. **Functional Equation Analysis**: Let's analyze the equation: [ f(x) = f(x+y) + fleft(x + x^2 f(y)right) ] alongside: [ f(x) = fleft(x + x^2 f(y)right) + fleft(x + x^2 fleft(x^2 f(y)right)right) ] Setting these equal: [ fleft(x + x^2 fleft(x^2 f(y)right)right) = f(x + y) ] This implies: [ x + x^2 fleft(x^2 f(y)right) = x + y ] Simplifying, we obtain: [ x^2 fleft(x^2 f(y)right) = y implies fleft(x^2 f(y)right) = frac{y}{x^2} ] Particularly for ( x = 1 ): [ f(f(y)) = y ] 3. **Determining the form of ( f )**: Substituting ( f(y) ) back, we get: [ fleft(x^2 yright) = frac{f(y)}{x^2} ] 4. **Conclusion through Algebraic Manipulation**: Let's finish using two approaches: - **Approach 1**: - From ( f(f(y)) = y ) and ( f(x^2 y) = frac{f(y)}{x^2} ), we derive: [ fleft(x^2right) = frac{f(1)}{x^2} ] Since ( { x^2 mid x in mathbb{Q}^+ } ) is dense in ( mathbb{Q}^+ ) and ( f ) is strictly decreasing: [ f(x) = frac{c}{x} ] Plugging back, we find ( c = 1 ), hence: [ f(x) = frac{1}{x} ] - **Approach 2**: - Using ( P(x, frac{9x}{16}) ): [ f(x) = fleft(frac{25x}{16}right) + fleft(x + frac{16x^2 f(x)}{9} right) ] Simplify: [ fleft(frac{25x}{9}right) = frac{9 f(x)}{25} ] Solving: [ x + frac{16x^2 f(x)}{9} = frac{25x}{9} ] gives us: [ f(x) = frac{1}{x} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{f(x) = frac{1}{x}} ]"},{"prompt":"Which of the following functions are power functions? ①y=x<sup>2</sup>+1；②y=2<sup>x</sup>；③y= frac {1}{x^{2}}；④y=(x1)<sup>2</sup>； ⑤y=x<sup>5</sup>；⑥y=x<sup>x+1</sup>． A: ①③⑤ B: ①②⑤ C: ③⑤ D: ④⑤⑥","completion":"According to the definition of power functions y=x^{alpha}, where alpha in mathbb{R}, we know that: ① y=x^{2}+1 is not a power function, ② y=2^{x} is not a power function, ③ y= frac {1}{x^{2}} = x^{-2} is a power function, ④ y=(x-1)^{2} is not a power function, ⑤ y=x^{5} is a power function, ⑥ y=x^{x+1} is not a power function; Therefore, the functions that are power functions are ③ and ⑤.

We know Eliot got 160 votes, so: 2S = 160 To find the number of votes Shaun got (S), we divide both sides of the equation by 2: S = 160 / 2 S = 80 Shaun got 80 votes.

The set of whole numbers can be divided into four residue classes modulo 4: ({4t}, {4t+1}, {4t+2}, {4t+3}). - **Case 1: At least two of (a, b, c, d) are in the same residue class modulo 4.** If at least two of (a, b, c, d) belong to the same residue class modulo 4, say (a) and (b), then (a - b equiv 0 pmod{4}). This implies that (a - b) is divisible by 4. Hence, the product (A) itself will be divisible by 4, because there is a factor that is a multiple of 4. - **Case 2: All four numbers (a, b, c, d) belong to different residue classes modulo 4.** If no two of (a, b, c, d) belong to the same residue class modulo 4, then among (a, b, c, d), there will be exactly two even numbers and exactly two odd numbers, because there are only two even residue classes (({4t}, {4t+2})) and two odd residue classes (({4t+1}, {4t+3})). In this scenario, the difference between any two even numbers or any two odd numbers is an even number (divisible by 2). Therefore, (A) will contain exactly three factors (differences between numbers) that are even (i.e., divisible by 2). Hence, the product (A) will be divisible by (2^3 = 8), which includes 4. 2. **Analyze Divisibility by 3** We next consider the problem of proving that the product (A) is divisible by 3. Any four integers (a, b, c, d) will form residue classes modulo 3. By the pigeonhole principle, among any four integers, at least two must have the same residue modulo 3. This is analogous to the birthday problem in combinatorics but applied to modulo residue classes. Suppose (a) and (b) have the same residue modulo 3, then (a - b equiv 0 pmod{3}). This implies that (a-b) is divisible by 3, and hence, the product (A) will certainly be divisible by 3 as it includes this factor.

We need the lengths of (OX) and (OY) to be in the given ratio (m:n). 2. **Parallel Line Concept:** Any line parallel to a given line that intersects the sides of an angle will create segments with the same ratio. Therefore, we seek a pair of parallel lines intersecting (OA) and (OB) at points (P) and (Q), such that (OP/OQ = m/n). 3. **Construct Points (P) and (Q):** - On line (OA), measure and mark a segment (OP) such that (OP = m). - On line (OB), measure and mark a segment (OQ) such that (OQ = n). 4. **Draw Line (PQ):** Connect points (P) and (Q) with a straight line. This line (PQ) now serves as a reference. 5. **Draw the Required Line:** Through point (M), draw a line parallel to (PQ). Use the compass to transfer the angle between (PQ) and a perpendicular line through (M). This new line will be our required line (XY). 6. **Verify the Construction:** Since (XY || PQ) and (PQ) was constructed such that (OP/OQ = m/n), it follows by similarity of triangles (OPQ) and (OXY) that (OX/OY = m/n). Thus, the line (XY) satisfies the given condition. Conclusion: By ensuring (XY) is parallel to (PQ) and using similarity of triangles, we have constructed the required line which cuts off segments in the ratio (m:n).

The calories from the broccoli can be calculated as 17B, where B is the amount of broccoli in pounds. The total calories from both vegetables is the sum of the calories from the carrots and the broccoli, which can be expressed as: 51 (from the carrots) + 17B (from the broccoli) = 85 Now, let's solve for B: 17B = 85 - 51 17B = 34 Divide both sides by 17 to find B: B = 34 / 17 B = 2 So, Tom ate 2 pounds of broccoli. Now, we need to find the ratio of the amount of broccoli he ate to the amount of carrots he ate.

For any number k, when a diameter is drawn through the point marked k, it is stated that the numbers less than k are evenly distributed on both sides of this diameter.

Next, assume ( (x, y) ) is a solution such that ( x leq y ). We examine a new pair ( (x_1, y) ), where ( y^2 + m = x cdot x_1 ). Since ( x_1 = frac{y^2 + m}{x} ), we need to show that ( (x_1, y) ) also satisfy the conditions. By Condition (1): ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ), so ( gcd(x_1, y) ) equals 1.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the solution: 1. **Basic Constraint and Initial Setup:** - There are 20 bills, each with 7 cells to be filled with numbers. - Basilio can only use the digits \\"1\\" and \\"2\\". - Therefore, the potential combinations for any single bill number must be different to maximize Basilio's take. 2. **Key Insight:** - Note that in any configuration, if Basilio controls the last digit filling position each time, he can ensure that at least two bills have different numbers by adjusting the last digit appropriately. 3. **Bill Matrix Formation:** - Imagine arranging the 20 bills in a manner where all the cells form a 20x7 matrix. - Basilio names a digit (either \\"1\\" or \\"2\\"), and Alice fills that digit in the next available cell for any of the bills. 4. **Ensuring Limited Unique Numbers:** - Alice can manage the distribution such that the composition of \\"1\\"s and \\"2\\"s are controlled. 5. **Detailed Filling Strategy:** - When the digit \\"1\\" is named: - Alice places it in the most leftmost available cell across different rows where a \\"1\\" hasn’t been placed yet. - When the digit \\"2\\" is named: - Alice places the \\"2\\" in the most rightmost available cell across different rows where a \\"2\\" hasn’t been placed yet. 6. **Collapsing Different Columns:** - If at any point, a column begins to have both \\"1\\"s and \\"2\\"s, it means that Alice has effectively forced the other columns to be filled either purely by \\"1\\"s on the left or \\"2\\"s on the right. - This minimizes the scope of different combinations to just two different sequence configurations in maximal cases. # Conclusion: Basilio can always ensure to get two bills with different numbers by controlling one key digit placement.

Objective: Determine the largest possible value of ( N ). 1. **Existence of 42 lines:** - Let's construct three lines such that the angle between any two of them is ( 60^circ ). For instance, if we draw three lines forming an equilateral triangle, the internal angles between the lines are ( 60^circ ). - Now, take 14 such sets of triplets with each set not interfering with each other and forming distinct angles compared to the other sets. - These sets give us ( 3 times 14 = 42 ) lines. 2. **Verification:** - Any selection of 15 lines from these constructed 42 lines must contain at least one set of such a triplet. - Given that any 15 lines have to contain at least one triplet among the sets, at least two lines in each selection must form an angle of ( 60^circ ). Hence, it is possible to have 42 lines under the given conditions. 3. **Maximum number proof:** - Suppose there are ( 43 ) or more lines available. Let's examine 43 lines. - Consider any point ( O ) on the plane. For simplifying, we can move each line parallel to itself to pass through ( O ) without changing the angles between them. - Draw a supplementary line (not among previous ones) through ( O ) which does not form an angle of ( 60^circ ) with any other line. 4. **Divide the plane:** - Resolve the plane into three sectors of ( 60^circ ) each, starting from this supplementary line. - Now, each line must fall into one of these three ( 60^circ ) sectors. 5. **Pigeonhole Principle:** - As there are 43 lines, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these sectors must contain (lceil frac{43}{3} rceil = 15) lines. - Hence, within this sector, the maximum possible angular separation is less than ( 60^circ ) (since each sector is exactly ( 60^circ )).

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Define Points P and Q**: Let the coordinates of points P and Q be (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), respectively. These points satisfy the equation 41x + y = 2009 due to their positions in the plane. 2. **Calculate the Area of the Parallelogram**: The area of the parallelogram formed by points O, P, and Q can be calculated using the determinant of the matrix formed by the coordinates of P and Q. This is derived from the shoelace theorem. The determinant is given by: [ det left(begin{array}{cc}x_1 & y_1x_2 & y_2end{array}right) = (x_1)(y_2) - (x_2)(y_1) ] 3. **Relate to the Given Equation**: Since y_1 = 2009 - 41x_1 and y_2 = 2009 - 41x_2, we substitute these into the determinant formula to get: [ (x_1)(2009-41(x_2))-(x_2)(2009-41(x_1)) = 2009(x_1 - x_2) ] 4. **Condition for Integer Area**: The area of triangle OPQ is half the area of the parallelogram. For the area of the triangle to be an integer, the determinant (which is twice the area of the triangle) must be even. From the calculation, we see that the determinant is 2009(x_1 - x_2). Since 2009 is odd, for the product to be even, (x_1 - x_2) must be even, implying x_1 and x_2 must have the same parity (both even or both odd). 5. **Counting the Number of Triangles**: Given the constraint 41x + y = 2009, the maximum value for x is 49 (when y=0), and the minimum is 0 (when x=0). This gives us 50 possible x values, split evenly between 25 even and 25 odd values. To form a triangle with an integer area, we can choose any two distinct x values of the same parity. The number of ways to choose two even x values is _{25}C_2, and the same goes for choosing two odd x values. Therefore, the total number of distinct triangles is: [ (_{25}C_2) + (_{25}C_2) = 25 times frac{24}{2} + 25 times frac{24}{2} = 600 ] Thus, the number of distinct triangles OPQ with positive integer area is boxed{600}."},{"prompt":"Andrew has two containers for carrying water, both in the shape of opentop cubes with base areas of (4 text{ dm}^2) and (36 text{ dm}^2) respectively.

Solution: To solve this problem, let's determine how many ways we can partition a number ( n ) into three summands, where the order of the summands matters. 1. **First Summand is 1:** - Let's consider partitions of ( n ) of the form ( 1 + a + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are integers such that ( 1 + a + b = n ). - Therefore, we have ( a + b = n - 1 ). - The number of integer partitions of ( n - 1 ) into two parts ( a ) and ( b ) where order matters is equal to ( n - 2 ) (from problem 52). 2. **First Summand is 2:** - Next, let's consider partitions of ( n ) of the form ( 2 + a + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are integers such that ( 2 + a + b = n ). - Therefore, we have ( a + b = n - 2 ). - The number of integer partitions of ( n - 2 ) into two parts ( a ) and ( b ) where order matters is ( n - 3 ) (from problem 52). 3. **First Summand is ( n-2 ):** - Finally, we are left with partitions of ( n ) of the form ( (n-2) + a + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are integers such that ( n-2 + a + b = n ). - Therefore, we have ( a + b = 2 ). - The number of integer partitions of 2 into two parts ( a ) and ( b ) where order matters is 1. 4. **Generalizing the Pattern:** - As observed, the number of ways to partition ( n ) into three summands with the first summand ranging from 1 to ( n-2 ): - Number of partitions where the first summand is ( k ) equals ( n - k - 1 ). - Summing these gives the total number of ordered partitions: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-2} (n - k - 1) = sum_{k=1}^{n-2} (n - 1 - k). ] 5. **Summing an Arithmetic Series:** - The sum of terms in an arithmetic series: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-2} (n - 1 - k) = sum_{k=1}^{n-2} (n - 1) - sum_{k=1}^{n-2} k. ] - Since (sum_{k=1}^{n-2} k) is the sum of the first ( n - 2 ) natural numbers: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-2} k = frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)}{2}. ] - Thus, the total number of partition will be: [ (n - 1)(n - 2) - frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)}{2} = frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)}{2}. ] 6. **Calculating the Sum of the Series:** - The total number of partitions is computed as: [ frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)}{2}. ] Conclusion: Therefore, the number of ways to partition ( n ) into three ordered summands is: [ boxed{frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function ( f(x) = sqrt{1 + x sqrt{1 + (x+1) sqrt{1 + (x+2) sqrt{1 + (x+3) sqrt{cdots}}}}} ) for ( x > 1 ), ( x in mathbf{N}^{*} ), find ( f(2008) ).","completion":"Given the function: f(x) = sqrt{1 + x sqrt{1 + (x+1) sqrt{1 + (x+2) sqrt{1 + (x+3) sqrt{cdots}}}}}, quad x > 1, quad x in mathbb{N}^* 1.

If each segment of the broken line intersects at most once at any of these intersection points, there would be only 29 intersection points, including the initial and terminal points of the broken line (i.e., the vertices that are not intersection points of the lines): [ 28 text{ (intersections)} + 1 text{ (initial point)} + 1 text{ (terminal point)} = 30 text{ points, but only 29 segments are assumed}. ] 4. **Review of the Example with 9 Lines:** A visual example, shown in the problem, indicates that with 9 lines, the arrangement can indeed yield the required number of segments. 5. **Verification with 9 Lines:** The number of intersection points formed by any two lines among 9 lines is: [ binom{9}{2} = frac{9 cdot 8}{2} = 36. ] Including the initial and terminal points of the broken line, there would be: [ 36 text{ (intersections)} + 1 text{ (initial point)} + 1 text{ (terminal point)} = 38. ] This count accommodates the 37 segments of the broken line. # Conclusion: - Although 8 lines could yield only 28 intersection points, a setup of 9 lines allows for at least 36 intersection points, fitting the creation of 37 segments much better.

If we choose a positive value for x (e.g., x = 2), then y = x - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1, which is also positive. Thus, the line passes through the first quadrant. - For the line to pass through the third quadrant, both x and y must be negative. If we choose a negative value for x (e.g., x = -2), then y = x - 1 = -2 - 1 = -3, which is also negative. Thus, the line passes through the third quadrant. 2. **Second and Fourth Quadrants Analysis**: - The line y = x - 1 intersects the y-axis at the point (0, -1). This point is in the fourth quadrant because it is below the x-axis. This implies that the line must pass through the fourth quadrant as it moves from the third quadrant (where both x and y are negative) to the first quadrant (where both x and y are positive). - Since the line continuously moves from the third quadrant to the first quadrant and intersects the y-axis in the fourth quadrant, it does not pass through the second quadrant.

We aim to show that ( n^p ) can always be decomposed into the sum of ( n ) consecutive odd numbers. First Solution: 1. **Arithmetic Sequence Setup**: - Consider an arithmetic sequence with ( n ) terms, first term ( a_1 = 2k + 1 ) (an odd number), and a common difference ( d = 2 ). - The ( n )-th term in this sequence is: [ a_n = 2k + 1 + 2(n - 1) = 2(k + n) - 1 ] 2. **Sum of the Sequence**: - The sum of ( n ) terms in the arithmetic sequence can be given by: [ sum_{i=1}^n a_i = frac{n}{2} left( a_1 + a_n right) ] Substituting ( a_1 ) and ( a_n ), we obtain: [ sum_{i=1}^n a_i = frac{n}{2} left( 2k + 1 + 2(k+n) - 1 right) = frac{n}{2} left( 4k + 2n right) = n(2k + n) ] 3. **Establish ( n^p ) as the Sum**: - We need ( n(2k + n) = n^p ).

This is because each angle bisector divides the angle into two equal parts, and by definition, they must lie within the triangle to reach the opposite side. Thus, statement A is correct. - **Statement B**: The centroid of a triangle is known to be the point where its three medians intersect.

While it is true that the altitudes (perpendicular lines from a vertex to the opposite side) of an acute triangle are inside the triangle, this is not always the case for all types of triangles. For example, in an obtuse triangle, at least one altitude will be outside the triangle because the perpendicular from the obtuse angle vertex to the opposite side will lie outside the triangle.

The divisors of 1959 are ( pm 1, pm 3, pm 653, pm 1959 ). 3. To maximize ( kn ), we need to find the maximum number of distinct ( x_i ) and ( y_j ) such that the product ( prod_{i=1}^k (y_j - x_i) ) is a divisor of 1959 for each ( y_j ). 4. Since ( 1959 ) can be factored into at most 4 distinct integers, we have ( k leq 4 ) and ( n leq 4 ). We need to check the possible values of ( k ) and ( n ) to maximize ( kn ). 5. Consider ( k = 3 ) and ( n = 2 ): - We can construct a polynomial ( P(x) ) such that: [ P(x) = 54 - 653x(x-2)^2(x-4) ] with ( {x_i} = {0, 2, 4} ) and ( {y_j} = {1, 3} ). - This satisfies the conditions ( P(x_1) = P(x_2) = P(x_3) = 54 ) and ( P(y_1) = P(y_2) = 2013 ). 6. If ( k = 4 ) and ( n geq 2 ), we need to check the possible values of ( y_2 - y_1 ): - Let ( y_1 < y_2 ). Then ( y_2 - y_1 ) must be one of the differences between the divisors of 1959. - The possible differences are ( 2 ) and ( 1306 ). 7. If ( k = 4 ) and ( n = 2 ), we need to check if there are valid pairs: - For ( k = 4 ), we need to find 4 distinct ( x_i ) such that ( y_2 - y_1 ) is consistent for all pairs. - However, no such pairs exist that satisfy the conditions for ( k = 4 ). 8. Therefore, the maximum value of ( kn ) is achieved with ( k = 3 ) and ( n = 2 ), giving: [ kn = 3 times 2 = 6 ] The final answer is ( boxed{6} )."},{"prompt":"A given triangle is an acuteangled scalene triangle. One allowed action is to cut one of the existing triangles along its median into two triangles. Can all the triangles become isosceles after several actions?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Definitions**: - We begin with an acutely angled scalene triangle (a triangle with all angles less than 90 degrees and all sides of different lengths). Specifically, this implies that no two sides or angles are the same. 2. **Allowed Operation**: - Each operation allows us to cut one of the existing triangles along its median, creating two new triangles. 3. **Key Observation**: - Since the triangle is scalene, the medians do not coincide with the altitudes, and the angles and sides divided in this manner will yield two new triangles that themselves are acutely angled but not necessarily isosceles or scalene. 4. **Cutting Process**: - Let's consider the operation of cutting an existing scalene acutely angled triangle along one of its medians: - By definition, splitting a scalene triangle along its median will result in two smaller triangles. 5. **Properties of Resulting Triangles**: - The two resulting triangles will inherit the acutely angled property, as cutting an acute triangle along its median does not result in right or obtuse triangles. - The resulting triangles are not necessarily isosceles as the two sides of the resulting triangles derived from the median cut can be of different lengths. 6. **Induction Argument**: - Suppose every time we cut a scalene triangle along its median, one of the resulting triangles remains scalene: - Initially, the given triangle is scalene. - Upon cutting the triangle along a median, the two resulting triangles remain acutely angled and non-isosceles, perpetuating and guaranteeing that at least one of the resulting triangles after every operation will be scalene and acutely angled. 7. **Conclusion**: - Hence, no matter how many operations are performed, there will always exist at least one triangle which is not isosceles and remains acutely angled. Therefore, it is impossible through any finite number of operations to transform all triangles into isosceles triangles. 8. **Final Answer**: - Thus, it is not possible through a finite number of median cuts for all resulting triangles to become isosceles.

For an ellipse in the form frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, the distance between the center and each focus along the major axis is sqrt{a^2 - b^2}. Here, a^2 = 3 and b^2 = 1, so the distance from the center to each focus is sqrt{3 - 1} = sqrt{2}. Therefore, the foci are at F_1(-sqrt{2}, 0) and F_2(sqrt{2}, 0). **Step 2: Relate the areas of the triangles to the distances from the foci to point M.** The line y = x + m intersects the x-axis at point M(-m, 0). Given that the area of triangle F_1AB is twice the area of triangle F_2AB, we have the relation |F_1M| = 2|F_2M|. **Step 3: Calculate the distances and solve for m.** The distance from F_1 to M is |-sqrt{2} - (-m)| = |sqrt{2} + m|, and the distance from F_2 to M is |sqrt{2} - (-m)| = |sqrt{2} + m|. Setting |F_1M| = 2|F_2M|, we get |sqrt{2} + m| = 2|sqrt{2} + m|, leading to m = -frac{sqrt{2}}{3} or m = -3sqrt{2} after solving for m. **Step 4: Verify the solution with the discriminant condition.** Substituting y = x + m into the ellipse equation, we get a quadratic equation in x: 4x^2 + 6mx + 3m^2 - 3 = 0. For this line to intersect the ellipse, the discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation must be greater than 0. This implies m^2 < 4.

Therefore, the correct value of m is boxed{-frac{sqrt{2}}{3}}, which corresponds to choice C."},{"prompt":"A rectangle is divided into smaller rectangles, with the length of one side of each of these smaller rectangles being an integer.

This can be observed from the symmetry along the middle line of the rectangle, where black sections turn into white sections and vice versa. 5. **Reduction to Simple Case Analysis:** For rectangles with integer side lengths, the same argument holds true, as the rectangle can be dissected into smaller rectangles, each with one side of length 1. 6. **Equal Sums of Black and White Areas:** We now need to prove that if the sums of the areas of the black and white sections are equal, then one of the sides of the rectangle must be an integer. 7. **Assume No Integer Side Lengths:** Suppose neither side of the original rectangle is an integer. The lines ( x = m ) and ( y = n ) dissect it into smaller rectangles with one side of length ( 1 ), and a rectangle with both sides less than ( 1 ). 8. **Contradiction Proof:** It is easy to verify that in the last rectangle where both sides are less than 1, the sums of the areas of the black and white sections cannot be equal. This is because: - Any small square formed within this smaller rectangle will either be completely inside one color or split into unequal areas of both colors. - It is impossible for sub-rectangles less than unit lengths to perfectly balance black and white areas in the checkerboard pattern. 9. **Conclusion:** Therefore, if the sums of the areas of the black and white sections are equal, one of the sides of the original rectangle must indeed be an integer.

This can be calculated using the binomial coefficient binom{2n}{n}. - Similarly, select n positions out of the remaining 2n to place the up (U) steps, which also corresponds to binom{2n}{n}. 5. **Account for Both Dimensions**: - Since the numbers from the \`R\` and \`L\` steps are independently chosen and likewise for the \`U\` and \`D\` steps, we compute the product of the two sets of combinations. - Therefore, the number of such combinations is given by: [ left( binom{2n}{n} right)^2 ] 6. **Conclusion**: - By combining these factors, the total number of distinct paths the snail can take is: [ boxed{left( binom{2n}{n} right)^2} ] In summary, the proof demonstrates that for each valid sequence of horizontal moves, there exists a corresponding valid sequence of vertical moves, and each combination of these sequences ensures a closed path of length 2n.

We need to understand that if ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{p-1} ) satisfies the condition, then: [ a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{p-1} ] in the context of modulo ( p ) will also satisfy the condition: [ k a_1, k a_2, cdots, k a_{p-1} ~(1 leq k leq p-1) ] Thus ( (p-1) mid K ). 2.

Two circular permutations ( (b_1, b_2, cdots, b_p) ) and ( (c_1, c_2, cdots, c_p) ) are the same if there exists ( k ) such that ( b_i = c_{i+k} mod p ) for all ( i ). 3.

The condition ( p mid sum_{i=1}^p b_i b_{i+1} ) will need to be satisfied for the cyclic permutations. For such a permutation, the number of permutations that satisfy the original requirement is also ( K ). 5. Use graphical reasoning to find that each ( b_i ) for some permutation sequence can be constructed by incrementing other sequences cyclically and the edge graph shows certain conditions such as ( b_i + 1 equiv b_i mod p ), etc., ensuring they could also satisfy ( p mid sum_{i=1}^n b_i b_{i+k} ). 6.

Kay can clean her room in 12 hours, so her work rate is 1 room per 12 hours, or 1/12 of the room per hour. When they work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: Lisa's rate + Kay's rate = Combined rate 1/8 + 1/12 = Combined rate To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 24 in this case: (1/8 * 3/3) + (1/12 * 2/2) = Combined rate 3/24 + 2/24 = Combined rate 5/24 = Combined rate This means that together, Lisa and Kay can clean 5/24 of the room per hour.

To do this, we will consider the different cases for a: 1. **Case for ( a > 1 ):** - If ( a^x > x ), then ( x > log_a x ). - If ( a^x < x ), then ( x < log_a x ). - If ( a^x = x ), then ( x = log_a x ). Therefore, the number of solutions of the equation ( a^x = log_a x ) will be the same as the number of solutions of the equation ( a^x = x ). This aligns with the findings explored in problem 28.66. 2. **Case for ( 0 < a < 1 ):** - Define the function ( f(x) = log_a x - a^x ). As x changes from 0 to ( +infty ), the function ( f(x) ) changes from ( +infty ) to ( -infty ). If ( f'(x) < 0 ) for all ( x > 0 ), then the equation ( a^x = log_a x ) has exactly one solution. Let's calculate the derivative: [ f'(x) = frac{1}{x ln a} - a^x ln a = frac{1 - (ln a)^2 x a^x}{x ln a} ] Since ( ln a < 0 ), the sign of ( f'(x) ) matches the sign of: [ g(x) = (ln a)^2 x a^x - 1 ] Next, we compute the derivative of ( g(x) ): [ g'(x) = (ln a)^2 a^x + (ln a)^3 x a^x = a^x (ln a)^2 (1 + x ln a) ] Thus, ( g'(x) ) equals zero at ( x_0 = - frac{1}{ln a} ).

Clearly, ( varphi(x_1) = x_1^{1/x1} = a ) and ( varphi(1/e) = e^{-e} ).

The quadrilateral OADB with distances OA = AD = 6 and OB = 4 , angle OAD = 90^circ , appears. We form systematics for further clarification. 3.

We are to prove that the locus of point ( A ) is a line segment and to find its length. 1. **Establishing the Basic Setup:** Let ( O ) be the vertex of the given right angle. Hence, ( B ) and ( C ) are points that slide along the lines forming this right angle originating from ( O ). 2. **Observing Angle Relations:** Since (angle BAC = 90^circ), points ( O ) and ( A ) lie on a circle with diameter ( BC). 3. **Using Circle and Triangle Properties:** Therefore, ( angle BOC) is right since it subtends the diameter of the circle created by ( BC ) (Thales' theorem). In this case, (angle BOC) encapsulates the (angle OBC) and (angle OCB). 4. **Evaluating the Motion of ( A ):** The circle mentioned implies that as ( B ) and ( C ) slide along the axes, ( A) lies on this circle's circumference.

Prove that no matter how the clippings are done, the area of P_n is greater than frac{1}{3}, for all nge6.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Clipping Process**: When a convex n-gon is clipped, a triangle formed by the midpoints of two consecutive sides and the shared vertex is removed. This process increases the number of sides by one, transforming an n-gon into an (n+1)-gon. 2. **Area Reduction in Clipping**: The area of the triangle removed during each clipping can be calculated. If AB and BC are consecutive sides of a regular polygon, and M and N are their respective midpoints, then triangle MBN is removed. The vertices M and N divide AB and BC into segments of equal length. Since M and N are midpoints, each segment is half the length of AB or BC. 3. **Area of Triangle MBN**: In a regular polygon, all sides and angles are equal. The area of triangle MBN can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: [ text{Area of } triangle MBN = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} ] Here, the base is the distance between M and N, which is half the length of side BC, and the height is the perpendicular distance from B to line segment MN. 4. **Proportion of Area Removed**: Since M and N are midpoints, the triangle MBN is symmetrically placed and its area is exactly one-fourth of the area of parallelogram formed by AB and BC. Therefore, each clipping removes frac{1}{4} of the area of the parallelogram formed by extending AB and BC. 5. **Total Area Reduction**: Initially, the hexagon P_6 has an area of 1. Each clipping reduces the area, but the reduction is a fixed proportion of the remaining area of the polygon at each step. The area of the polygon after each clipping is given by: [ A_{n+1} = A_n - frac{1}{4} times text{(area of parallelogram formed by two consecutive sides)} ] Since the sides are getting smaller, the absolute area removed decreases, but it is always a significant fraction of the total remaining area. 6. **Bounding the Area**: The key observation is that the area of the polygon never decreases below a certain fraction of the original area. Specifically, since each clipping removes a smaller and smaller absolute area (but a consistent proportion), the area asymptotically approaches a limit but does not reach zero. The claim is that this limit is frac{1}{3} of the original area. 7. **Proof by Induction and Geometric Series**: We can use mathematical induction or analyze the geometric series formed by the areas to show that the area remains above frac{1}{3}. Each step removes less than frac{1}{4} of the current area, leading to a convergent series. 8. **Conclusion**: By understanding the geometric properties of the clipping process and the proportional reduction in area, we conclude that the area of P_n for all n geq 6 remains greater than frac{1}{3}. This conclusion is based on the geometric series convergence and the properties of regular polygons. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that a and b are both positive integers, the necessary and sufficient condition for a + b > ab to hold is ( ).

Therefore, the total weight of the people in the elevator is: [ 1500 , text{kg} + 100 , text{kg} = 1600 , text{kg} ] 2. **Determine the average weight per person**: We are given that the average weight of each person is 80 kilograms. 3. **Set up the equation to find the number of people**: Let ( n ) represent the number of people in the elevator. The total weight of the people can be expressed as: [ n times 80 , text{kg} ] 4. **Equate the expressions for total weight and solve for ( n )**: [ n times 80 , text{kg} = 1600 , text{kg} ] 5. **Solve the equation**: [ n = frac{1600 , text{kg}}{80 , text{kg/person}} ] [ n = 20 ] 6. **Conclusion**: The number of people in the elevator is: [ boxed{20} ]"},{"prompt":"On a line, ten points were placed at equal intervals, occupying a segment of length ( a ). On another line, 100 points were placed at the same intervals, occupying a segment of length ( b ). How many times greater is ( b ) than ( a )?","completion":"1. **Understand the Setup:** - On a line, place 10 points with equal intervals between them. This arrangement spans a segment of length ( a ). - On another line, place 100 points with the same intervals as the first arrangement. This spans a segment of length ( b ). 2. **Determine the Intervals:** - When placing 10 points, there are 9 intervals between them. Hence, the length ( a ) is divided into 9 intervals. - Similarly, placing 100 points would create 99 intervals between them. The length ( b ) spans 99 intervals. 3. **Calculate the Ratio:** - Since the intervals are equal for both lines, let's denote the length of each interval by ( x ). Therefore, we can write: [ a = 9x ] [ b = 99x ] - To find out how many times ( b ) is longer than ( a ), we compute the ratio: [ frac{b}{a} = frac{99x}{9x} = frac{99}{9} = 11 ] # Conclusion: - The segment ( b ) is 11 times longer than segment ( a ).

The given equation is: x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 6y + 5 = 0. Completing the squares for both x and y terms gives us: (x+1)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 5. This represents a circle centered at (-1, 3) with a radius of sqrt{5}. Since point P (1, 2) satisfies the equation of the circle, it must lie on the circle itself. The line passing through point P that is tangent to the circle must have the same slope as the radius connecting the center of the circle at (-1, 3) to the point P (1, 2). Let us calculate the slope of this radius (which is also the slope of the tangent line since they are perpendicular to the same line ax + y - 1 = 0). The slope of the line through points (-1, 3) and (1, 2) is: m_{text{radius}} = frac{2 - 3}{1 - (-1)} = frac{-1}{2}. Since the tangent line is perpendicular to the line ax + y - 1 = 0, their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. Thus, we have: m_{text{radius}} cdot m_{text{line}} = -1. We replace m_{text{radius}} with -frac{1}{2} and m_{text{line}} with -a since the slope of the line ax + y - 1 = 0 is -a. This gives us: -frac{1}{2} cdot (-a) = -1. Solving for a: a = frac{1}{2}.

Define the areas of the triangles as follows: - Let the area of triangle MAC be S_1. - Let the area of triangle NBC be S_2. - Let the area of triangle MCD be S_3. - Let the area of triangle NCE be S_4. 2. The problem provides the following equations based on the information given: [ S_1 + S_2 = 51 ] [ S_3 + S_4 = 32 ] 3. Use the information that (AB = 4), (BC = 3), (CD = 2), and (DE). Note these lengths form a sequence along a single straight line. 4. Because the triangles share a common altitude dropped from points M and N to line ABCDE, the areas of the triangles are proportional to the lengths of their bases on line ABCDE. 5. Apply the principle of proportionality to resolve the areas of interest: - For area S_3 - For area S_2 [ AB : BC : CD : DE = 4 : 3 : 2 : x ] 6. Since there is a common point on ABCDE and the heights from M and N to this line are the same, the ratios of the areas match the ratios of bases: Given that we need (S_1 + S_2 = 51), (S_3 + S_4 = 32). And we are required to determine the sum S_3 + S_2. 7. Substitute given sums into general proportionality to find unknown areas. - Thereby simplifying and identifying S_2 + S_3 using given algebraic sums: [ S_1 + S_2 = 51 ] [ S_3 + S_4 = 32 ] 8.
