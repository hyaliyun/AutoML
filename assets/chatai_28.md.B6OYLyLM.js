Let's denote the width of the original rectangle by (s) and the height by (h). 2. The area of the original rectangle is given by: [ text{Area}_{text{original}} = s cdot h ] 3. The problem states that if the width is increased by 3 cm and the height is decreased by 3 cm, the area remains unchanged. This new configuration gives us an equation: [ (s + 3)(h - 3) = s cdot h ] 4. Expanding the left-hand side of the equation yields: [ s cdot h - 3s + 3h - 9 = s cdot h ] 5. Subtracting ( s cdot h ) from both sides of the equation, we get: [ -3s + 3h - 9 = 0 ] 6. Solving for (h) in terms of (s), we obtain: [ 3(h - s) = 9 implies h - s = 3 implies h = s + 3 ] 7.

How many grids, at most, are covered by exactly one square?","completion":"1. **Initial Assumption and Contradiction:** - Assume there exists a column with ( n ) grids, such that each grid is covered by exactly one ( 2 times 2 ) square. - Since ( n ) is odd, covering ( n ) grids in pairs (each pair being part of a ( 2 times 2 ) square) is impossible because ( n ) cannot be evenly divided into pairs. This leads to a contradiction. 2. **Upper Bound Calculation:** - Since each column can contain at most ( n-1 ) grids covered by exactly one ( 2 times 2 ) square, the total number of such grids on the board is at most ( n(n-1) ). 3. **Constructive Proof for Achievability:** - For ( n = 3 ), consider a ( 3 times 3 ) chessboard. It is easy to see that we can place ( 2 times 2 ) squares such that some grids are covered exactly once. - For a general odd ( n ), consider an L-shaped block composed of two rectangles of length ( n+2 ) and width ( 2 ). Combining this L-shaped block with an ( n times n ) block results in an ( (n+2) times (n+2) ) block. - Cover the grids in the block by successively placing the ( 2 times 2 ) squares from left to right and top to bottom, ensuring that only the two squares at the turn overlap at exactly one point. - This method covers ( 8 times frac{n+1}{2} - 2 ) grids, which simplifies to ( 4n + 2 ) grids covered exactly once. 4. **Inductive Step:** - By induction, if the desired configuration can be achieved for ( n ), it can also be achieved for ( n+2 ).

We need to prove the inequality: left( sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} left| x_i - x_j right| right)^2 leq frac{2 (n^2 - 1)}{3} sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_i - x_j)^2. 2. **Normalization:** Without loss of generality (WLOG), let the sum of x_i be zero: sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} = 0. 3. **Simplification of LHS:** From the given condition, we start calculating: sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} left| x_{i} - x_{j} right| = 2 sum_{i < j} (x_j - x_i). Note that: sum_{i < j} (x_j - x_i) = sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i - n - 1)x_i. Thus: sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} left| x_i - x_j right| = 2 sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i - n - 1) x_i. 4. **Application of Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:** Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we get: left( sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} left| x_i - x_j right| right)^2 leq 4 sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i - n - 1)^2 sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2. 5. **Summing and Squaring:** Evaluating the sum inside, we find: sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i - n - 1)^2 = frac{n(n+1)(n-1)}{3}. Therefore, substituting this result back, we have: left( sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} left| x_i - x_j right| right)^2 leq frac{4 n (n+1) (n-1)}{3} sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2. 6. **Simplification of RHS:** Considering the other part of the inequality, we calculate: sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_i - x_j)^2 = n sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j + n sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j^2. Since sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 0, this simplifies to: sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_i - x_j)^2 = 2n sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2. 7. **Final Comparison:** Now we can insert this result back into the original inequality: left( sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} left| x_i - x_j right| right)^2 leq frac{2(n^2 - 1)}{3} sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_i - x_j)^2. \`\`\` Concluding: boxed{left( sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} left| x_i - x_j right| right)^2 leq frac{2(n^2 - 1)}{3} sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_i - x_j)^2.} \`\`\` 8. **Equality Condition:** The equality condition holds when we have: x_{i} = k(2i - n - 1) for some real number k. This implies that x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n} form an arithmetic progression. Conversely, if x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n} is an arithmetic sequence with common difference d, then: x_{i} = frac{d}{2} (2i - n - 1) + frac{x_1 + x_n}{2}. After subtracting frac{x_1 + x_n}{2} from each x_i: x_i = frac{d}{2} (2i - n - 1) and sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 0. The inequality achieves the equality.

Consider \\"2020\\" overlapping itself to form \\"202020\\": - If we treat \\"202020\\" as a single block and place it in the string, removing it leaves \\"011112\\": - This string has: 1 zero (0's), 4 ones (1's), and 1 two (2's). - The count of permutations for \\"011112\\" is: [ frac{6!}{1!4!1!} = frac{720}{24} = 30 ] - There are 7 possible placements for \\"202020\\" (since overlapping \\"202020\\" needs 7 positions available).

If all the digits 8 in ( N ) are deleted, can the resulting number be divisible by 3?","completion":"Let's solve the problem by breaking it down step by step. 1. **Sum of Digits Condition**: For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 3. 2. **Sum of Digits in N**: Let N be the number formed by arranging the digits from 1 to 2018 in sequence. We need to find the sum of digits of N, denoted by S(N). Note that the sum of an arithmetic series from 1 to 2018 can be computed using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: [ S(N) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 2018 = frac{2018 cdot (2018 + 1)}{2} ] Substituting the values, we get: [ S(N) = frac{2018 cdot 2019}{2} ] 3. **Modulus Calculation**: To determine whether S(N) is divisible by 3: [ frac{2018 cdot 2019}{2} equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Since one of the factors, 2019, is a multiple of 3, the entire product is divisible by 3.

As the hyperbola C shares the same focal length with the given ellipse and has an asymptote with the equation x - 2y = 0, we can set the equation of hyperbola C as frac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = lambda where lambda neq 0.

Since f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-x)=-f(x). Combining these properties, we obtain f(2-x)=-f(-x), which is equivalent to f(2+x)=-f(x). Therefore, for any x, we find that f(4+x)=f(2+(2+x))=-f(2+x)=f(x). Thus, f(x) is a periodic function with period 4. (2) Knowing the expression for f(x) when xin[0,2], we can use the properties of the function to find f(x) for xin[-2,0]. Since f(x) is odd, f(-x) = -f(x), which implies that f(-x) when -x in [0,2] is just the negative of the expression for f(x) in this interval. Therefore, f(-x) = -(2(-x)-(-x)^2) = 2x - x^2 for x in [-2, 0]. Due to the periodicity with a period of 4, f(x+4) = f(x), the expression of f(x) for xin[2,4] is the same as the expression for xin[-2,0]. Therefore, we have f(x) = 2x - x^2 for x in [2, 4]. (3) To calculate the sum f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+ldots+f(2013), we consider the periodicity and oddness of f(x). Since f(x) has a period of 4, we note that f(1)=f(5)=f(9)=ldots and similarly, f(3)=f(7)=ldots. Due to the function's oddness, f(2k)=-f(-2k) for any integer k, which will cancel out terms in pairs. Thus, the sum reduces to f(1) + f(3) + (function values that cancel out in pairs). Since the function values that occur in pairs of odd and even cancel out and the remaining terms occur in periods of 4, we only need to calculate f(1)+f(3) for one period and multiply that by the number of complete periods in 2013. For the incomplete period, we observe that 2013 is 1 more than a multiple of 4 (i.e., 2012=4times 503). Therefore, the last term f(2013) is equivalent to f(1). Since f(1)+f(3) for one period is 2-1^2 + 2(3)-3^2 = 2-1 + 6-9 = -2, the sum over one complete period is zero (the other terms not included here cancel out because of the odd function property). As a result, the sum for all the complete periods (503 of them) is 0, and we only need to consider the last term, which is f(1) from the incomplete period.

So the relative speed is: 69 km/h + 3 km/h = 72 km/h Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second (m/s) because the length of the train is given in meters. To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 m / 3600 s So, 72 km/h in m/s is: 72 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 20 m/s Now we have the relative speed in m/s and the length of the train in meters.

The radius of each circle can be calculated as follows: For circle (1), the radius is sqrt{(frac{10}{2})^2 + (frac{10}{2})^2 - 0} = sqrt{50}. For circle (2), the radius is sqrt{(-frac{6}{2})^2 + (frac{2}{2})^2 + 40} = sqrt{50}. Since both circles have the same radius, the length of the half-chord is given by sqrt{50 - 20} = sqrt{30}. Finally, the length of the common chord is given by 2sqrt{30}. Thus, boxed{text{The common chord length is } 2sqrt{30}.}"},{"prompt":"TJ ran a 10K race last Saturday.

How long did it take him to run the second half of the race?","completion":"To find out how long it took TJ to run the second half of the race, we first need to determine the total time he took to run the entire 10K race. Since the average time per kilometer was 5 minutes and a 10K race is 10 kilometers long, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the average time per kilometer by the total number of kilometers: Total time = Average time per kilometer × Total kilometers Total time = 5 minutes/kilometer × 10 kilometers Total time = 50 minutes We know that TJ ran the first half of the race in 20 minutes. Since a 10K race is 10 kilometers, the first half is 5 kilometers. Therefore, the second half is also 5 kilometers. Now, we can calculate the time it took him to run the second half by subtracting the time he took for the first half from the total time: Time for the second half = Total time - Time for the first half Time for the second half = 50 minutes - 20 minutes Time for the second half = 30 minutes So, it took TJ boxed{30} minutes to run the second half of the race."},{"prompt":"w many 1/15s are there in 82 3/5, when multiplying the result by 3 and subtracting 42 7/10?","completion":"First, let's convert 82 3/5 into an improper fraction. 82 3/5 = (82 * 5 + 3) / 5 = (410 + 3) / 5 = 413/5 Now, let's find out how many 1/15s are in 413/5.

To avoid including this black cell in the rectangle, any cell that forms the boundary of the largest such rectangle should be outside the range that includes cell (6,6). 3. Let's start by analyzing the centrality and the possible dimensions of the rectangle. - If both sides of the rectangle are at least 6 cells long, it will necessarily contain the central black cell somewhere inside it. This is because the distance from the central cell to any side of the grid is 5 cells. - Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle cannot both be at least 6. 4. Next, suppose one side of the rectangle is at most 5 cells: - Let's denote the sides of the rectangle as a times b where a and b are the lengths (in cells) of the sides. Without loss of generality, assume a leq 5. This ensures that the rectangle does not include the central black cell. - We can choose b to be as large as possible without including the central black cell. Since the maximum allowable length for b (while keeping the rectangle entirely within the 11 times 11 grid) is 11, we make b = 11. 5.

By these lemmas and the inductive hypothesis: [ m^m equiv m^k pmod{2^{k + 2}} ] Hence, [ R_k equiv (1 + 2^k) + (3 + 2^k)^3 + (5 + 2^k)^5 + ldots pmod{2^{k+2}} ] According to our induction step: [ R_k equiv S_k(1 + 2^k) pmod{2^{k+2}} ] Then for ( S_{k+1} ), [ S_{k+1} equiv S_k + 2S_k (1 + 2^{k - 1}) pmod{2^{k+2}} ] From the induction hypothesis: [ S_k ] is divisible by ( 2^k ), but not by ( 2^{k+1} ). Thus, ( S_{k+1} ) will be divisible by ( 2^{k+1} ), but not by ( 2^{k+2} ), completing the induction step. # Conclusion: Hence, for ( n > 1 ), the sum ( 1^1 + 3^3 + ldots + (2^n - 1)^{2^n - 1} ) is divisible by ( 2^n ) but not by ( 2^{n+1} ). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"At the end of year x, automobile installment credit accounted for a certain percentage of all outstanding consumer installment credit.

The total ratio is 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22 parts. Cara has 4 parts, and Janet has 5 parts, so together they have 4 + 5 = 9 parts. The total amount of money they have is 110, so each part is worth 110 / 22 = 5. Cara has 4 parts, so she has 4 * 5 = 20. Janet has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 5 = 25. Together, Cara and Janet have 20 + 25 = 45. Now, let's calculate the maximum loss they would make if they buy oranges at the most expensive price and sell them at the lowest price after paying the commission. The most expensive price for oranges is 2.00 each. With 45, they can buy 45 / 2.00 = 22.5 oranges. Since they can't buy half an orange, they buy 22 oranges. They sell the oranges at 80% of the buying price, which is 0.80 * 2.00 = 1.60 per orange. So, they sell 22 oranges for 22 * 1.60 = 35.20. They have to pay a 10% commission on their earnings, which is 0.10 * 35.20 = 3.52. Their earnings after commission are 35.20 - 3.52 = 31.68.

If n leq 2, then it's clear that k=1, because in such a small graph there can be no directed cycle. 3. Now suppose n geq 3. In this case, k geq 2, since even a directed cycle of length n requires at least two colors to avoid monochromatic cycles. We will show that k=2 colors are always sufficient. 4. Number the vertices of the graph as 1, 2, ldots, n. Color an edge directed from vertex i to vertex j red if i < j, and blue if i > j. 5. Assume that the vertices i_{1}, i_{2}, ldots, i_{t} form a monochromatic directed cycle in this ordering. - For the cycle to be red, we would need i_{1} < i_{2} < ldots < i_{t} < i_{1}, which is impossible because numbers cannot cycle back to a smaller number in natural order. - For the cycle to be blue, we would need i_{1} > i_{2} > ldots > i_{t} > i_{1}, which is again impossible for the same reason. Therefore, there is no monochromatic cycle, and thus, k = 2 colors suffice. 6. Hence, if n=1, 2, the smallest k is 1, and if n geq 3, the smallest k is 2. 7.

Let's prove by induction that for n geq 3, k = 2 is sufficient. 2. **Base Case:** For n=3, as shown above, k=2 is sufficient using the specified coloring rule. 3. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for any graph with n vertices, i.e., k=2 is sufficient. Now consider a graph with n+1 vertices. 4. **Induction Step:** Select one vertex P in an (n+1)-vertex graph. Remove P and its adjacent edges, leaving an n-vertex graph. By the induction hypothesis, this subgraph can be colored with 2 colors such that there are no monochromatic cycles. 5. Color the edges incident to P as follows: - Edges directed into P are colored red. - Edges directed out from P are colored blue. 6. Verify the coloring: - Any cycle passing through P must contain at least one red edge (into P) and one blue edge (out of P), ensuring no monochromatic cycle. 7. Thus, by inductive reasoning, k=2 colors are sufficient for any graph with n geq 3 vertices. [ boxed{k = 2} ] # Alternative Solution: 1. Start coloring edges with one color (say red) maximally, meaning no more edges can be colored red without forming a red directed cycle. 2. Color the remaining edges blue. 3.

Construct the following red-directed paths: [ (B_{1} rightarrow P rightarrow cdots rightarrow P rightarrow B_{t}), (B_{t} rightarrow P rightarrow cdots rightarrow B_{t-1}), ldots, (B_{2} rightarrow P rightarrow cdots rightarrow B_{1}) ] 5. Merging these red paths forms a red cycle, contradicting the maximally red-color condition. 6. Therefore, no blue directed cycle exists. 7.

The common difference between each day's output is d, and it's given that she weaves an additional unit of length each day, which means d > 0. Given in the problem, after four days, she has woven a total of 24 units of length. This can be represented by the sum of the first four terms of the arithmetic sequence, which is S_{4} = 24. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is S_{n} = frac{n}{2}(2a_{1} + (n-1)d), where a_{1} is the first term.

Since a_{2} = a_{1} + d, we can rewrite the equation as: [a_{7} = a_{1}(a_{1} + d)] And since a_{7} = a_{1} + 6d, we can set up the equation: [a_{1} + 6d = a_{1}(a_{1} + d)] Now, we have a system of equations: [left{begin{array}{l}4{a}_{1}+6d=24{a}_{1}+6d={a}_{1}({a}_{1}+d)end{array}right.] Solving this system, we first simplify the first equation to find the values of a_{1} and d: [4a_{1} + 6d = 24] From the first equation, we can express d in terms of a_{1}: [6d = 24 - 4a_{1}] [d = 4 - frac{2}{3}a_{1}] Substituting d into the second equation: [a_{1} + 6(4 - frac{2}{3}a_{1}) = a_{1}(a_{1} + 4 - frac{2}{3}a_{1})] Solving this equation, we find: [left{begin{array}{c}{a}_{1}=3 d=2end{array}right.] Now, to find the number of units she will weave on the tenth day, we use the formula for the n-th term of an arithmetic sequence, a_{n} = a_{1} + (n-1)d: [a_{10} = a_{1} + 9d] [a_{10} = 3 + 9(2)] [a_{10} = 3 + 18] [a_{10} = 21] Therefore, the number of units she will weave on the tenth day is boxed{21}."},{"prompt":"Find the angle of inclination (angle with the positive direction of the xaxis) of the line x+y1=0.

Linear elements refer to sides (segments) and angles within the triangle. The primary theorem regarding congruence (equality) of triangles includes: - Side-Side-Side (SSS) Congruence Theorem: If three sides of one triangle are equal to three sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. - Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Congruence Theorem: If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two sides and the included angle of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. - Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) Congruence Theorem: If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two angles and the included side of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. - Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) Congruence Theorem: If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two angles and a non-included side of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. - Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) Congruence Theorem: Applicable in right triangles, if the hypotenuse and one leg of a right triangle are equal to the corresponding hypotenuse and one leg of another right triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. 4.

Since it's unlikely that there is only 1 classroom with all 58 students or 58 classrooms with 1 student each, the reasonable number of classrooms would be either 2 or 29. Given that 29 buses are needed, it's not practical to have 29 classrooms with 2 students each because that would mean each bus is being used to transport only 2 students, which is not an efficient use of resources. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that there are 2 classrooms in the school, with each classroom having 29 students. This way, each bus can be used to transport a whole classroom of students, which is a more efficient use of the buses.

Therefore, the general formula for {b_{n}} is: b_{n} = 2 cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^{n}. Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} be d. The general formula for an arithmetic sequence is a_{n} = a_{1} + (n-1)d. Given a_{3}=5, we can substitute into the formula for {a_{n}}: a_{3} = a_{1} + 2d = 5.

Thus, the minimum value of e^{x}-x is e^{0}-0=1>0, which means e^{x}>x always holds. Therefore, f(f(x))=x has no real solution, making option B not possible. For option C, with f(x)=x^{2}+x+1, we have f(f(x))=(x^{2}+x+1)^{2}+(x^{2}+x+1)+1=x, which simplifies to (x^{2}+x+1)^{2}+x^{2}+x+2=0 having no real solution. Therefore, option C is not possible. For option D, considering the derivative of y=sin x-x is y'=cos x-1leq0, we find that the function y=sin x-x is decreasing on mathbb{R}. Since at x=0, y=sin 0-0=0, we have sin(sin 0)=sin 0=0, and since sin(sin x)-x is monotonic on mathbb{R}, f(f(x))=x has exactly one real root, 0. Therefore, option D is possible. Hence, the correct answer is boxed{D}. For option A, solving the absolute value equation yields four real solutions, which allows us to conclude; for option B, by analyzing the monotonicity of the function y=e^{x}-x, we can conclude; for option C, through equation simplification and the concept of non-negativity, we can conclude; for option D, by analyzing the monotonicity of y=sin x-x, we can conclude. This problem tests the application of the transformation idea of function equations, the application of functions' monotonicity and derivatives, and computational skills, making it a medium-level question."},{"prompt":"Two squares, (ABCD) and (BEFG), with side lengths of (8 text{ cm}) and (6 text{ cm}) respectively, are placed side by side as shown in the figure.

The line connecting DE intersects BG at P. Find the area of the shaded region APEG in the figure. Let's solve the problem step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the problem setup. - We have two squares: one larger square ABCD with side length 8text{ cm}, and a smaller square BEFG with side length 6text{ cm}, such that B is a common point for both squares, and BE is a side of both squares. Step 2: Identify the key geometric relationships. - Square ABCD has vertices A(0, 0), B(8, 0), C(8, 8), and D(0, 8). - Square BEFG has vertices B(8, 0), E(14, 0), F(14, 6), and G(8, 6). - Connect point D(0, 8) to point E(14, 0). - Connect point B(8, 0) to point G(8, 6). Step 3: Find the intersection point P. - Intersection point P is where line DE intersects line BG. - The line DE can be represented by the equation: [ frac{y - 8}{x - 0} = frac{0 - 8}{14 - 0} implies y - 8 = -frac{8}{14}x implies y = -frac{4}{7}x + 8. ] - The line BG is a vertical line at x = 8. Plugging x = 8 into the equation of DE: [ y = -frac{4}{7}(8) + 8 = -frac{32}{7} + 8 = -frac{32}{7} + frac{56}{7} = frac{24}{7}. ] - Thus, the coordinates of point P are (8, frac{24}{7}). Step 4: Determine the area of quadrilateral APEG. - To simplify matters, let's break the problem down by considering pertinent triangles. - Notice that when you shift triangle APG to triangle DPG, as shifting vertices does not change our desired area. - Given triangle DGE equiv triangle BGE, we only need the area of one of these triangles to determine the area of APEG. - Calculate the area of triangle triangle B G E: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 6 times 6 = 18. ] Conclusion: The area of the shaded region APEG is: [ boxed{18} ]"},{"prompt":"One person had a large square enclosed field with 16 oak trees.

Therefore, the average daily wheat harvest of one A harvester would be x + 2 hectares, given that an A harvester harvests 2 hectares more wheat on average per day than a B harvester. The problem states that an A harvester takes the same amount of time to harvest 15 hectares of wheat as a B harvester takes to harvest 9 hectares of wheat. This can be represented by the equation: [ frac{15}{x+2} = frac{9}{x} ] Solving this equation for x, we multiply both sides by x(x+2) to eliminate the denominators: [ 15x = 9(x + 2) ] Expanding and simplifying: [ 15x = 9x + 18 ] Subtracting 9x from both sides: [ 6x = 18 ] Dividing both sides by 6: [ x = 3 ] Thus, one B harvester harvests an average of 3 hectares of wheat per day.

This is obvious because these factorials include multiple multiples of 3. 2. **Analyze the constants added:** - For (40! + 234) and (50! + 666): - Notice that (234) and (666) are also divisible by 9. - (234): The sum of digits is (2 + 3 + 4 = 9), which is divisible by 9. - (666): The sum of digits is (6 + 6 + 6 = 18), which is also divisible by 9. - Thus, (40! + 234) and (50! + 666) are divisible by 9. 3. **Check the first pair (30! + 111):** - Let's look at (111): - The sum of its digits is (1 + 1 + 1 = 3), which is divisible by 3 but not by 9. - Consequently, (30! + 111) is divisible by 3 but **not** by 9. 4. **Determine the implications for Greatest Common Divisors (GCDs):** - The GCDs given are: - (gcd(a, b) = 30! + 111) - (gcd(b, c) = 40! + 234) - (gcd(c, a) = 50! + 666) - From our divisibility check: - (40! + 234) and (50! + 666) must be divisible by 9. - However, (30! + 111) is not divisible by 9. 5. **Conclusion:** - Since (40! + 234) and (50! + 666) are indeed divisible by 9 but (30! + 111) is not, this leads to a contradiction. - For the situation stated to be true, all these GCDs should share some common divisors, but they don’t since one of them ((30! + 111)) doesn’t meet the condition (divisibility by 9) that the others do.

The triangle AB'C is then isosceles with AB' = CA = b. 3. **Angle properties**: In triangle AB'C, since widehat{BAC} = 2beta and widehat{ABC} = beta, it follows that widehat{AB'C} = beta. Since both widehat{ABC} and widehat{AB'C} equal beta, triangle CB'B is also isosceles. 4. **Similar triangles**: The triangles AB'C and CB'B are similar.

This implies that ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are coprime integers. 2. **Parity Analysis:** To analyze the right triangle with integer sides, consider the parity of ( a ) and ( b ): - If both ( a ) and ( b ) were odd, then ( a^2 ) and ( b^2 ) would both leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. Therefore, [ a^2 + b^2 equiv 1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] However, ( c^2 ) should be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4 (as it is a square of an integer), so the case of both ( a ) and ( b ) being odd is not possible. - Therefore, one of ( a ) and ( b ) must be even and the other odd. 3. **Expressing the Even and Odd Legs:** Without loss of generality, let's assume ( a ) is even and ( b ) is odd.

This results in the following equivalent inequality: a^{3} + b^{3} + 3ab c > c^{3} 3. Recall the triangle inequality theorem which states, for the sides of a triangle a, b, c: a + b > c > 0 4.

To determine the sign of the expression in these intervals, we can test points from each interval in the inequality frac{x+3}{2x-1} lt 0. 3. Testing the interval (-infty, -3) with, say, x = -4: [ frac{-4+3}{2(-4)-1} = frac{-1}{-9} gt 0 ] This means the expression is positive in this interval. 4. Testing the interval (-3, frac{1}{2}) with, say, x = 0: [ frac{0+3}{2(0)-1} = frac{3}{-1} lt 0 ] This shows the expression is negative in this interval, which is what we are looking for. 5. Testing the interval (frac{1}{2}, +infty) with, say, x = 1: [ frac{1+3}{2(1)-1} = frac{4}{1} gt 0 ] This means the expression is positive in this interval. From this analysis, we see that the expression frac{x+3}{2x-1} lt 0 is only true for the interval (-3, frac{1}{2}).

(Rooks attack each other if they are in the same row or column and there are no other rooks between them.)","completion":"1. **Initial Setup:** Consider a standard 8 times 8 chessboard where each cell initially contains a rook. At each step, it's possible to remove a rook that attacks an odd number of other rooks. We are tasked with finding the maximum number of rooks that can be removed under these conditions. 2. **Key Insight for Corner Rooks:** Rooks placed in the corner cells (e.g., a1, a8, h1, h8) can never be removed because each such rook initially attacks exactly two others (those in the same row and column). If one of the corner rooks is removed, it starts by being attacked by precisely two rooks (an even number). Hence, no corner rook will qualify for removal. 3. **Feasibility of Leaving Only Corner Rooks:** Assuming that it is possible to remove all rooks except for the four corner ones (so effectively removing 64 - 4 = 60 rooks), consider the last rook removed before only the corner rooks remain. This last rook would have to be attacked by an odd number of other rooks. However, since it would only be surrounded by four rooks (a corner and potentially three along its row and column), it could not be attacked by an odd number of rooks. This leads to a contradiction because the rook would either be attacked by zero or two rooks (both even numbers). 4. **Existence of At Least Five Rooks:** This contradiction implies that at least one additional rook must remain besides the corner rooks. Therefore, at least five rooks will always remain on the board because it's not possible to arrange exactly four corner rooks and have removed the others without encountering a configuration that involves even attacks. 5. **Removing 59 Rooks:** We now demonstrate a specific sequence of removing 59 rooks, thereby leaving 5 rooks on the board: - Remove all rooks from the 8th rank (row) except for a8, b8, and h8. - Repeat this pattern by removing appropriate rooks from the 7th rank, then the 6th rank, and so forth until the 3rd and 1st ranks, while skipping the 2nd rank. - Now remove the rooks from the 1st file (column) from a3 to a7. - Finally, remove rooks from the h file from h3 to h7. - Remove rooks b1 and g2. - Remove rooks from b8 down to b3 and from g2 to g1. 6. **Conclusion:** By following the specific removal pattern outlined above, we conclude that it is indeed possible to remove 59 rooks from the chessboard under the given conditions, verifying that the maximum number of rooks that can be removed is 59, leaving exactly 5 rooks on the board.

It is known that the bus's speed is 3 times faster than Petya's running speed, and he can see the bus at a distance of no more than 0.8 km. Find the maximum distance between the bus stops such that irrespective of whether Petya turns back upon detecting the bus or continues running, he will be able to catch the bus at the bus stop. (Do not consider the time the bus spends at the stop) 1. **Define Variables and Relationships**: Let ( v ) be Petya's speed and ( 3v ) be the bus's speed. Petya can detect the bus at a distance of 0.8 km. 2. **Maximum Distance ( d ) Between Stops**: We need to find the maximum ( d ) such that Petya will always catch the bus regardless of his decision. 3. **Case Analysis**: Suppose Petya decides to keep running from his initial position to the next stop. - When Petya sees the bus, it will be 0.8 km away from him. - Let ( t ) be the time taken for Petya to run to the next stop which is ( d ) kilometers away. - Petya's travel time to the next stop is ( frac{d}{v} ). - The distance the bus will travel meanwhile is ( 3v cdot frac{d}{v} = 3d ). 4. **Equate the Situations**: Petya should see the bus at a distance ( 0.8 ) km and the bus should ideally meet him at the next stop, so: [ 0.8 + v cdot t = 3v cdot t = 3 cdot frac{d}{v} cdot v = 3d ] Simplifying this equation: [ 0.8 = 3d - d = 2d ] Thus, [ d = frac{0.8}{2} = 0.4 text{ km} ] 5. **Calculation Verification**: If Petya decides to turn back to the previous stop, he will have basically the same condition but he will have 0.4 km of running distance rather than the full ( d ).

Consider the general case of how many intersections ( n ) lines can form. - The number of intersections formed by ( n ) lines, where no two lines are parallel and no three lines are concurrent, is given by the combinatorial formula for choosing 2 lines out of ( n ): [ binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n - 1)}{2} ] - This formula counts the number of ways to choose 2 lines from ( n ) lines without repetition. 2. **Applying to 5 Lines:** - Calculate the intersections specifically for ( n = 5 ): [ binom{5}{2} = frac{5 times 4}{2} = 10 ] - This means that, theoretically, 5 lines can intersect at 10 distinct points. 3. **Conclusion Based on the Problem's Constraints:** - Given the condition of pairwise non-parallel lines and each pair intersecting at a unique point, the minimal number of intersection points is the total number of pairwise intersections.

For this to be rational, both (3x) and (sqrt{x^2 - 4}) must be rational. Since (sqrt{x^2 - 4}) is rational only if (x^2 - 4) is a perfect square, (x) must be such that (x^2 - 4) is a perfect square.

The orthocenter (M) of a triangle formed by points on a circle lies in relation to the circle’s center O. 5. **Homothety application:** By applying homothety with center O and scale factor -2, the center O (circumcenter of ABC) maps to the orthocenter M of ABC. The same logic applies to N for DEF. 6. **Homothety center and ratio:** Similarly, by homothety with center O and ratio -2, the point O maps to P, the orthocenter of the resultant (D, E, F). Additionally, (H), the midpoint of segment (PQ), maintains its position as the midpoint of (MN) when considering these homotheties. 7. **Midpoint consistency:** It follows from the homothety properties that H, the midpoint of segment (PQ) or (MN), is invariant regardless of how the 6 points are grouped into triangles. 8. **Conclusion:** Because the midpoint (H) does not depend on the specific grouping of the points, you need to descend to the midpoint of the segment connecting orthocenters just once to find the treasure.

This means the selling price after the 15% discount is Rs. 5 less than the original cost price: [ SP_{15%} = C - 5 ] Since ( SP_{15%} ) is 85% of the original cost price, we can equate the two expressions for ( SP_{15%} ): [ C times 0.85 = C - 5 ] Now, let's solve for ( C ): [ 0.85C = C - 5 ] [ 0.85C - C = -5 ] [ -0.15C = -5 ] [ C = frac{-5}{-0.15} ] [ C = frac{5}{0.15} ] [ C = 33.33 ] Therefore, the original cost price for one metre of cloth before any discounts was Rs. boxed{33.33} ."},{"prompt":"Find the positive real number x such that lfloor x rfloor cdot x = 72.

Step by step solution is as follows: 1. **Given Information**: The cross-section forms a triangle with sides a, b, and c. 2. **Parallel Translation**: We consider the cross-section parallel to itself until one of its vertices coincides with a corresponding vertex of the base triangle. 3. **Relationship Setup**: If the side length of the base triangle is x, then we can write the distances in terms of a, b, and c, creating the following relationship: [ sqrt{a^2 - x^2} + sqrt{b^2 - x^2} = sqrt{c^2 - x^2} ] 4. **Squaring Both Sides**: To eliminate the square roots, we square both sides of the equation: [ left(sqrt{a^2 - x^2} + sqrt{b^2 - x^2}right)^2 = (sqrt{c^2 - x^2})^2 ] which simplifies to: [ a^2 - x^2 + 2sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)(b^2 - x^2)} + b^2 - x^2 = c^2 - x^2 ] Simplifying further, [ a^2 + b^2 - 2x^2 + 2sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)(b^2 - x^2)} = c^2 - x^2 ] Isolate the square root term, [ 2sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)(b^2 - x^2)} = c^2 - x^2 - a^2 - b^2 + 2x^2 ] 5. **Another Square**: Square both sides again to remove the remaining square root: [ left(2sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)(b^2 - x^2)}right)^2 = (c^2 - a^2 - b^2 + 2x^2)^2 ] This simplifies to: [ 4(a^2 - x^2)(b^2 - x^2) = (c^2 - a^2 - b^2 + 2x^2)^2 ] 6. **Simplification**: Expand both sides, [ 4(a^2b^2 - a^2x^2 - b^2x^2 + x^4) = c^4 + a^4 + b^4 + 4x^4 - 2a^2b^2 - 2a^2c^2 - 2b^2c^2 + 4a^2x^2 + 4b^2x^2 - 4c^2x^2 ] Combining like terms, we get: [ 3x^4 - 2x^2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)^2 - 4a^2b^2 ] Recognizing a simplification, [ 3x^4 - 2x^2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 4(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2a^2) ] 7. **Solving for x^2**: By solving the quadratic equation, we find: [ x^2 = frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3} pm frac{2}{3}sqrt{left( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 right)^2 - 3left( a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2a^2 right)} ] 8. **Selecting the Correct Root**: Only the negative sign will give us the feasible x because x cannot be greater than a, b, or c. Thus, [ x = sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3} - frac{sqrt{2}}{3} sqrt{left( a^2 - b^2 right)^2 + left( b^2 - c^2 right)^2 + left( c^2 - a^2 right)^2}} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{x = sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3} - frac{sqrt{2}}{3} sqrt{left( a^2 - b^2 right)^2 + left( b^2 - c^2 right)^2 + left( c^2 - a^2 right)^2}}} ]"},{"prompt":"Calculate the result of a^{3}cdot a^{2} is ( ).

For the original function y = f(2^x), it is given that the domain is (-1, 1). As this relates to the exponent of 2^x, we know that 2^x can take on values strictly between 2^{-1} and 2^1, that is, between frac{1}{2} and 2 (excluding those endpoints). Now, consider the function y = f(log_2 x).

Therefore, by considering extreme cases, once the function ( f ) is determined for larger subsets of ( A ), it is automatically determined for smaller subsets. 3. **Estimating the Number of Functions**: To satisfy the condition, we need to calculate the number of potential values that ( f ) can take for different subsets of ( A ): [ 1^{2012} + 2^{2012} + cdots + 19^{2012}. ] For a subset ( X in S ), where ( |X| = 2011 ), there are 2012 such subsets.

This set represents a complete residue system modulo p. 3. **Properties of Squaring Elements in A:** - For any i in A, we have i^2 = (-i)^2. Furthermore, if a^2 equiv b^2 pmod{p}, it follows that: [ p mid (a^2 - b^2) = (a+b)(a-b) ] Hence, either a equiv b pmod{p} or a equiv -b pmod{p}. 4. **Counting the Distinct Squares Modulo p:** - This implies there are exactly frac{p+1}{2} distinct squares modulo p. The distinct square values are 0^2, 1^2, ldots, left(frac{p-1}{2}right)^2. 5. **Cardinality Argument:** - As x ranges over a complete residue system modulo p, the values of x^2 modulo p form a set of size frac{p+1}{2}. - Similarly, let us consider -2 - y^2 modulo p. As y ranges over a complete residue system modulo p, the values of -y^2 modulo p also form a set of size frac{p+1}{2}. The values of -2 - y^2 form a set of the same size since each of these values is simply shifted by a constant -2 modulo p. 6. **Intersection Argument:** - Note that two sets each of size frac{p+1}{2} within a set of size p must intersect, as: [ frac{p+1}{2} + frac{p+1}{2} = p + 1 > p ] 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, there exist integers x and y such that: [ x^2 equiv -2 - y^2 pmod{p} ] This implies: [ x^2 + y^2 + 2 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Thus, we have demonstrated that there are integers x and y such that x^2 + y^2 + 2 is divisible by p for any prime p. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"What is the mean value of the measures of the four interior angles of any quadrilateral?","completion":"1.

Calculating each term: [ 1 cdot 44 = 44 ] [ 2 cdot 88 = 176 ] [ 3 cdot 132 = 396 ] [ 4 cdot 176 = 704 ] [ 5 cdot 220 = 1100 ] [ 6 cdot 264 = 1584 ] [ 7 cdot 308 = 2156 ] [ 8 cdot 352 = 2816 ] [ 9 cdot 396 = 3564 ] 7. Summing these values: [ 44 + 176 + 396 + 704 + 1100 + 1584 + 2156 + 2816 + 3564 = 12540 ] 8. Taking ( 12540 mod 9 ): [ 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 0 = 12 ] [ 1 + 2 = 3 ] Therefore, ( 12540 equiv 3 pmod{9} ). 9.

This ensures that one lantern, wherever it is placed, illuminates exactly one shaded tile. 2. **Counting Shaded Tiles**: The number of shaded tiles is (frac{(m+1)(n+1)}{4}). 3. **Double Illumination Requirement**: Since every tile must be illuminated by at least 2 lanterns, the minimum number of lanterns required is (frac{(m+1)(n+1)}{2}). 4. **Placement of Lanterns**: Place a red lantern at the NE corner of each shaded tile and a green lantern at the NW corner of each shaded tile.

If sin(A+C)=frac{2S}{{b}^{2}{a}^{2}}, then the range of tan A+frac{1}{3tan(BA)} is ______.","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by analyzing the given conditions and applying trigonometric identities and theorems step by step. 1. **Given Condition and Trigonometric Identity**: In triangle ABC, we know sin(A+C) = sin B. This is because A + B + C = pi (sum of angles in a triangle), and sin(pi - B) = sin B. The area of triangle ABC is given as S = frac{1}{2}acsin B. 2. **Substituting Given Condition**: From sin(A+C) = frac{2S}{{b}^{2}-{a}^{2}}, we substitute the expression for S to get sin B = frac{acsin B}{{b}^{2}-{a}^{2}}. Since sin B neq 0, we can simplify to obtain b^{2}-a^{2} = ac. 3. **Applying the Law of Cosines**: Using the Law of Cosines, b^{2} = a^{2} + c^{2} - 2accos B, and substituting b^{2}-a^{2} = ac, we find ac = c^{2} - 2accos B. Solving for c, we get c = 2acos B + a. 4. **Applying the Law of Sines and Simplifying**: From the Law of Sines, frac{sin C}{c} = frac{sin A}{a}, we find sin C = 2sin Acos B + sin A. Simplifying further, we get sin(B-A) = sin A. 5. **Determining the Relationship Between A and B**: Since sin(B-A) = sin A, and considering the domain of A and B within (0, pi), we conclude B-A = A or B-A = pi - A. The latter is discarded because it does not fit the acute triangle condition, leading to B = 2A. 6. **Finding the Range of A**: Given the acute nature of triangle ABC, we establish the inequalities 0 < A < frac{pi}{2}, 0 < 2A < frac{pi}{2}, and 0 < pi - 3A < frac{pi}{2}. Solving these gives frac{pi}{6} < A < frac{pi}{4}, which implies frac{sqrt{3}}{3} < tan A < 1. 7. **Evaluating the Expression**: We are asked to find the range of tan A + frac{1}{3tan(B-A)} = tan A + frac{1}{3tan A}. Let t = tan A, where t in left(frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, 1right). We define y = t + frac{1}{3t}. 8. **Differentiating and Analyzing Monotonicity**: Differentiating y with respect to t, we get y' = 1 - frac{1}{3t^2} = frac{3t^2 - 1}{3t^2} = frac{(sqrt{3}t + 1)(sqrt{3}t - 1)}{3t^2}. Since t in left(frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, 1right), y' is always positive, indicating that y is monotonically increasing in this interval. 9. **Finding the Range of y**: Since y is monotonically increasing, its range in the given interval is left(frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}, frac{4}{3}right).

How many miles does the car get to the gallon before modification?","completion":"Let's denote the car's fuel efficiency before modification as x miles per gallon. After the modification, the car will use only 75% as much fuel, so its fuel efficiency will increase. This means that for every gallon of fuel, the car will be able to travel 1/(0.75) times as far, or 4/3 times as far. So, after the modification, the car's fuel efficiency will be (4/3)x miles per gallon. We know that with a full tank of 14 gallons, the car will be able to travel 126 more miles after the modification. This means that the difference in distance traveled on a full tank before and after the modification is 126 miles. Before the modification, the car could travel x miles per gallon * 14 gallons = 14x miles on a full tank. After the modification, the car can travel (4/3)x miles per gallon * 14 gallons = (4/3) * 14x miles on a full tank. The difference in distance traveled on a full tank is therefore: (4/3) * 14x - 14x = 126 miles To solve for x, we can simplify the equation: (4/3) * 14x - 14x = 14x * (4/3 - 1) = 14x * (1/3) = 126 Now, we divide both sides by (14 * 1/3) to isolate x: x = 126 / (14 * 1/3) x = 126 / (14/3) x = 126 * (3/14) x = 9 * 3 x = 27 So, the car gets boxed{27} miles to the gallon before modification."},{"prompt":"A tank has a certain capacity.

In the second minute, pipe B fills the tank with 30 liters. In the third minute, pipe C drains the tank by 20 liters. So, the net amount of water filled in the tank after one cycle of 3 minutes is: 40 liters (from A) + 30 liters (from B) - 20 liters (from C) = 50 liters Since the tank is full in 48 minutes, we can calculate the number of complete cycles that occur in 48 minutes by dividing 48 by 3: 48 minutes / 3 minutes per cycle = 16 cycles Each cycle fills the tank with 50 liters, so after 16 cycles, the amount of water filled in the tank is: 16 cycles * 50 liters per cycle = 800 liters However, we need to consider that the tank might be filled before the end of the 16th cycle. Since the tank is full exactly at 48 minutes, it means that the last action that occurred was the draining by pipe C. Therefore, the tank reached its full capacity at the end of the 47th minute, just before pipe C was opened for the last time.

From begin{cases} overset{y=kx+m}{x^{2} + 2y^{2} - 4 = 0} end{cases}, we get ((2k^{2} + 1)x^{2} + 4kmx + 2m^{2} - 4 = 0). Since M and N are on ellipse C, we have triangle = 16k^{2}m^{2} - 4(2k^{2} + 1)(2m^{2} - 4) > 0, which simplifies to 4k^{2} - m^{2} + 2 > 0. Let M(x_{1}, y_{1}) and N(x_{2}, y_{2}), then x_{1} + x_{2} = -frac{4km}{2k^{2} + 1} and x_{1}x_{2} = frac{2m^{2} - 4}{2k^{2} + 1}. Therefore, |MN| = sqrt{(k^{2} + 1)[(x_{1} + x_{2})^{2} - 4x_{1}x_{2}]} = sqrt{(k^{2} + 1)[(frac{4km}{2k^{2} + 1})^{2} - 4 times frac{2m^{2} - 4}{2k^{2} + 1}]} = 2sqrt{frac{2(k^{2} + 1)(4k^{2} - m^{2} + 2)}{(2k^{2} + 1)^{2}}}. Let the distance from point O to line MN be d, then d = frac{|m|}{sqrt{k^{2} + 1}}. Therefore, the area of triangle OMN is S_{triangle OMN} = frac{1}{2} times d times |MN| = sqrt{frac{2m^{2}(4k^{2} - m^{2} + 2)}{(2k^{2} + 1)^{2}}} ldots boxed{(1)}. Since OM || PA and ON || PB, the product of the slopes of lines OM and ON is -frac{1}{2}. Therefore, frac{y_{1}y_{2}}{x_{1}x_{2}} = frac{1}{2}.

From frac{m^{2} - 4k^{2}}{2m^{2} - 4} = -frac{1}{2}, we get 2k^{2} + 1 = m^{2} ldots boxed{(2)}.

Evaluate the integral int_{-1}^{1} sqrt{1-{x}^{2}} dx To evaluate this integral, we'll use the trigonometric substitution x = sin(theta), so dx = cos(theta) dtheta. Then, sqrt{1-{x}^{2}} = sqrt{1-sin^2(theta)} = |cos(theta)|. Since the range of theta is from -frac{pi}{2} to frac{pi}{2}, the cosine function is non-negative, so we can drop the absolute value sign. With the substitution, the limits of integration change: x=-1 implies theta = -frac{pi}{2} x=1 implies theta = frac{pi}{2} The integral becomes: int_{-frac{pi}{2}}^{frac{pi}{2}} cos^2(theta) dtheta Now, use the double-angle identity cos(2theta) = 2cos^2(theta) - 1. Then, cos^2(theta) = dfrac{cos(2theta) + 1}{2}. The integral becomes: int_{-frac{pi}{2}}^{frac{pi}{2}} dfrac{cos(2theta) + 1}{2} dtheta Split the integral into two parts and evaluate each separately: dfrac{1}{2}int_{-frac{pi}{2}}^{frac{pi}{2}} cos(2theta) dtheta + dfrac{1}{2}int_{-frac{pi}{2}}^{frac{pi}{2}} 1 dtheta Evaluating the first integral using the antiderivative of cos(2theta) gives: left[dfrac{1}{4}sin(2theta)right]_{-frac{pi}{2}}^{frac{pi}{2}} = dfrac{1}{4}(0-0) = 0 Evaluating the second integral gives: left[dfrac{1}{2}thetaright]_{-frac{pi}{2}}^{frac{pi}{2}} = dfrac{1}{2}left(dfrac{pi}{2} + dfrac{pi}{2}right) = dfrac{pi}{2} So, the value of the first integral is dfrac{pi}{2}. 2.

Using the area ratio 49:64, we know that 7k times b_1 : 8k times b_2 = 49 : 64. 3. Since (7kb_1)/(8kb_2)=49/64, we simplify it to b_1/b_2 = (49/64) cdot (8/7) = 7/8. 4. Perimeter ratio is derived from the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(l+b). So, the perimeter of the first rectangle is 2(7k + b_1) = 2(7k + 7k(b_1/b_2)), and for the second, it’s 2(8k + b_2). 5. With b_1/b_2 = 7/8, we find b_1 = 7b_2/8.

Now, let's consider two arbitrary points x_1 and x_2 in the interval (0, +infty) such that x_1 < x_2. We aim to show that y(x_1) = x_1^2 < y(x_2) = x_2^2. 1.

Let's first examine the transformation process: Starting with the quadruple (a, b, c, d), the next quadruple will be (ab, bc, cd, da). We continue transforming in this way. 2. Denote the first quadruple as (a, b, c, d). Calculate the next few quadruples: - Second quadruple: (ab, bc, cd, da). - Third quadruple: (ab cdot bc, bc cdot cd, cd cdot da, da cdot ab) = (ab^2c, b^2c^2d, c^2d^2a, d^2a^2b), and so on. 3. At each transformation step, we observe that we are dealing with products of increasing complexity, and all numbers in each subsequent quadruple are products of the original numbers raised to some power. 4. When considering the zeros: - If at any point one of the numbers in the quadruple is zero, then in at most two steps, all numbers will become zero. Thus we can ignore the case where any number is zero initially. 5. Now let's prove by contradiction: - Assume (a, b, c, d) reappears in the sequence after some steps, specifically (a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k) = (a, b, c, d) for some k. 6. Calculate the product of all terms in the quadruple at each step: - Initially: (a b c d). - After one transformation: (ab cdot bc cdot cd cdot da) = (a b c d)^2. - After two transformations: ((a b c d)^2)^2 = (a b c d)^4, continuing in this manner: - Generally, after n transformations: (a b c d)^{2^n}. 7. If the sequence comes back to the original quadruple (a, b, c, d) after k steps, we get: [ (a b c d)^{2^k} = a b c d ] This implies: [ (a b c d)^{2^k-1} = 1 ] And so: [ a b c d = 1 ] 8. Now, we know a b c d = 1. Considering quadruples where all elements are positive (and using a, b, c, d are non-zero), we examine the implications: - If all transformations maintain the product a b c d = 1, and subsequently the transformed quadruples should maintain the original product constraints. 9.

Darij","completion":"To prove that the radical axis of the incircles of triangles ( ABX ) and ( ACX ) passes through a point independent of ( X ), we will follow the steps outlined in the provided solution and fill in the missing details. 1. **Define the Incircles and Tangency Points:** - Let the incircle of ( triangle ABX ) touch ( AX ) and ( BX ) at ( S_b ) and ( T_b ) respectively. - Let the incircle of ( triangle ACX ) touch ( AX ) and ( CX ) at ( S_c ) and ( T_c ) respectively. 2. **Fixed Point for ( S_bT_b ):** - We need to show that the line ( S_bT_b ) passes through a fixed point ( P_b ) regardless of the position of ( X ) on line ( BC ). 3. **Analogous Situation for ( S_cT_c ):** - Similarly, the line ( S_cT_c ) should pass through a fixed point ( P_c ). 4. **Radical Axis and Midpoint:** - The radical axis of the two incircles is equidistant from the parallel lines ( S_bT_b ) and ( S_cT_c ). Therefore, it must pass through the midpoint of ( P_bP_c ), which is a fixed point. 5. **Proving ( P_b ) is Fixed:** - Let ( M ) be the projection of ( A ) on the angle bisector of ( angle B ). We need to show that ( P_b ) is this point ( M ). 6. **Intersection Point ( K ):** - Let ( K = AM cap BC ). Since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( AK ), if the incircle of ( triangle ABX ) touches ( AB ) at ( R_b ), then the cross-ratio ((T_bR_b, T_bM; T_bA, T_bX) = -1). 7. **Polar and Cross-Ratio:** - Let ( U = T_bR_b cap AX ). The line ( BS_b ) is the polar of ( U ) with respect to the incircle of ( triangle ABX ) and also with respect to the angle ( angle ABX ). Therefore, the cross-ratio ((T_bU, T_bS_b; T_bA, T_bX) = -1). 8. **Conclusion:** - The equality of the cross-ratios implies that ( T_bM ) and ( T_bS_b ) are the same line. Hence, ( S_bT_b ) always passes through ( M ), which is the fixed point ( P_b ). By symmetry, the same argument applies to ( triangle ACX ), and thus ( S_cT_c ) passes through a fixed point ( P_c ). The radical axis of the incircles of ( triangle ABX ) and ( triangle ACX ) passes through the midpoint of ( P_bP_c ), which is independent of ( X ).

For example, the square at row 4, column 9 is numbered 49. 2. **Color Information:** The grid squares 44 and 49 are black. 3. **Constraints:** - **Black Squares:** Each black square shares an edge with at most one other black square. - **White Squares:** Each white square shares an edge with at most one other white square. These constraints imply that there cannot be more than two adjacent squares (sharing an edge) of the same color consecutively in a row or column. 4. **Observation and Alternation Pattern:** If two adjacent squares in a row (or column) are the same color, the colors must alternate as we move down the column (or across the row). Hence: - **Example in a Row:** Suppose squares 48 and 49 are both black. Since each has at most one black neighbor: - Row 4, Column 8 (48) is black → Row 3, Column 8 (38) must be white. - Similarly for Row 4, Column 9 (49) → Row 3, Column 9 (39) must be white. - Then following this pattern downward: - Row 2, Column 8 (28) and Row 2, Column 9 (29) must be black. - Row 1, Column 8 (18) and Row 1, Column 9 (19) must be white. - This alternation holds if two adjacent squares in the columns are the same color. 5. **Application to Given Problem:** - Since squares 44 and 49 are black, at least one pair of adjacent squares among 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 must follow the alternation rule described. - This pattern implies that both columns at 4, and respectively 9, must match in coloring patterns. 6. **Contradiction Analysis:** - Assuming squares 49 and 99 are the same color: - Then, similarly, at least one pair among 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99 must have matching adjacent square rule leading to an alternation in row coloring from rows 4 downward. - If these rows alternate periodically and intersect consistently matched columns, we find an inherent contradiction that must arise from adjacent rules repeatedly not holding uniformly. Hence, squares 49 and 99 cannot both be black. Therefore, the colors must differ with one of them being white under the given constraints. **Conclusion:** Since 49 is black, the square 99 must be the contrasting white.

The center of this circle is the circumcenter of the ( n )-gon. 3. **Condition for a triangle to be acute:** A triangle inscribed in a circle is acute if and only if its circumcenter (which is the center of the circle) lies inside the triangle. This is because all angles in an acute triangle are less than ( 90^circ ), and the circumcenter of an acute triangle lies inside the triangle. 4. **Analyze the position of the circumcenter:** In a regular ( n )-gon, the circumcenter is the center of the circumcircle. For a triangle formed by vertices of the ( n )-gon to be acute, the center of the circumcircle must lie inside the triangle. 5. **Consider the diagonals and the partitioning:** When the ( n )-gon is partitioned into triangles by non-intersecting diagonals, each triangle has its vertices on the circumcircle. Since the diagonals do not intersect, they form a set of non-overlapping triangles. 6. **Impossibility of a chord passing through the center:** In a regular ( n )-gon, no diagonal (chord) can pass through the center of the circumcircle. This is because the center is equidistant from all vertices, and a chord passing through the center would imply that the ( n )-gon is not regular. 7. **Counting the acute triangles:** Since no chord can pass through the center, the only way for a triangle to be acute is if it is formed by three consecutive vertices of the ( n )-gon. This is because the center of the circumcircle will lie inside such a triangle, making it acute. 8. **Uniqueness of the acute triangle:** In a regular ( n )-gon, there is exactly one set of three consecutive vertices that form an acute triangle. This is because any other set of three vertices will either form an obtuse or right triangle, as the center of the circumcircle will not lie inside those triangles. Therefore, among the triangles formed by partitioning a regular ( n )-gon with non-intersecting diagonals, only one triangle is acute-angled.

At this minimum value, the y-coordinate of point P must be equal to that of point A because they are collinear with M which is on the vertical directrix. Hence, the y-coordinate of point P is 2.

The radius of circle C is represented as r. Given that circle C passes through the origin O, we can conclude that: 1. The distance from C to O is equal to the radius, so r = a. Considering circle C is tangent to the line 3x+4y-8=0, we apply the formula for the distance from a point to a line to get: 2. The distance from C to the line, which is also the radius r, equals frac{|3a-8|}{sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} = a. Solving the above equation for a, we find: - a = 1 or a = -4. Since the center is on the positive x-axis, a = -4 is discarded. Therefore, the center of circle C is C(1,0), and its radius is r=1. The standard equation of a circle with center (h,k) and radius r is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. Thus, for circle C: - The standard equation is (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1.

For line l to intersect circle C at two distinct points, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be greater than zero, Delta > 0: - Delta = (4k - 2)^2 - 16(k^2 + 1).

Thus, the range of values for k is boxed{(-infty, -frac{3}{4})}. ② **Proof that the sum of the slopes of lines OA and OB is a constant**: Let A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}) be the points of intersection. Using Vieta's formulas, we have: - The sum of roots: x_{1} + x_{2} = -frac{4k-2}{k^2 + 1}. - The product of roots: x_{1}x_{2} = frac{4}{k^2 + 1}. The slopes of lines OA and OB are frac{y_{1}}{x_{1}} and frac{y_{2}}{x_{2}} respectively. By substituting y_{1} = kx_{1} + 2 and y_{2} = kx_{2} + 2, we find the sum of the slopes to be: - frac{kx_{1} + 2}{x_{1}} + frac{kx_{2} + 2}{x_{2}} = frac{2(x_{1} + x_{2})}{x_{1}x_{2}} + 2k. Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get: - frac{2(-frac{4k-2}{k^2 + 1})}{frac{4}{k^2 + 1}} + 2k = 2k - 2k + 1 = 1.

Since A and B together invest 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/2 of the capital, C invests the remaining 1/2 of the capital for the whole time: C's investment = (1/2)C * T = C*T / 2 Now, let's calculate the total investment considering the time factor: Total investment = A's investment + B's investment + C's investment Total investment = (C*T / 36) + (C*T / 9) + (C*T / 2) To simplify the calculation, we can find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 36: Total investment = (C*T / 36) + (4C*T / 36) + (18C*T / 36) Total investment = (1 + 4 + 18) * (C*T / 36) Total investment = 23 * (C*T / 36) Now, we can find the ratio of A's investment to the total investment: A's ratio = A's investment / Total investment A's ratio = (C*T / 36) / (23 * (C*T / 36)) A's ratio = 1 / 23 Finally, we can calculate A's share of the total profit: A's share = A's ratio * Total profit A's share = (1 / 23) * 2300 A's share = 2300 / 23 A's share = 100 Therefore, A's share of the total profit of 2300 is boxed{100} ."},{"prompt":"f some men and 8 boys can do a piece of work in 10 days while 26 men and 48 boys can do the same in 2 days, the time taken by 15 men and 20 boys in doing the same type of work is 4 days.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the times between 5 and 6 o'clock when the hour and minute hands are exactly at a right angle (90 degrees). 2.

The minute and hour hands coincide 11 times per 12-hour period, i.e., approximately every (frac{12}{11}) hours or about 1 hour (5 frac{5}{11}) minutes. 4. First, we calculate when the minute hand is precisely 15 minutes ahead of the hour hand within the specified interval. - The minute hand completes a full cycle (360 degrees) in 60 minutes. - The hour hand completes a full cycle in 12 hours, so it moves (30) degrees per hour or (0.5) degrees per minute. 5.

First Solution: 1. **Define T Property:** - A triangle is said to have the T property if the incenter (center of the incircle) is equidistant from (at least) two midpoints of the triangle's sides. 2. **Trivially Isosceles Triangles:** - Any isosceles triangle inherently has the T property. For an isosceles triangle with equal sides, the incenter is equidistant from the midpoints of these sides due to symmetry. 3. **Counterexample with Non-Isosceles Triangle:** - Consider the well-known right triangle called the \\"Egyptian triangle,\\" with sides 3, 4, and 5 units.

Assume that O is equidistant from the midpoints A_1 and B_1 of sides BC and AC, respectively. - Let the points where the incircle touches the sides be A_0, B_0, and C_0. 2. **Right Triangles:** - Triangles OA_1A_0 and OB_1B_0 are right triangles with OA_1 = OB_1 and OA_0 = OB_0. Therefore, these triangles are congruent by the RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side) congruence criterion. 3. **Calculate distances:** - The distances A_0C = B_0C are equal and denote them as s-c, where s is the semiperimeter and c is the side opposite to C. - Distances from C to the midpoints: CA_1 = frac{a}{2} and CB_1 = frac{b}{2}. 4. **Express Segment Lengths:** - Calculate segments A_0A_1 and B_0B_1: [ A_0 A_1 = left{ begin{array}{ll} frac{a}{2} - (s - c) & text{if } CA_1 geq CA_0 (s - c) - frac{a}{2} & text{if } CA_0 > CA_1 end{array} right. ] [ B_0 B_1 = left{ begin{array}{ll} frac{b}{2} - (s - c) & text{if } CB_1 geq CB_0 (s - c) - frac{b}{2} & text{if } CB_0 > CB_1 end{array} right. ] 5. **Equidstance Equality:** - When the corresponding segments are equal, we get two possible equations: [ frac{a}{2} - (s - c) = frac{b}{2} - (s - c), ] resulting in a = b (triangle is isosceles). - Or, if: [ frac{a}{2} - (s - c) = (s - c) - frac{b}{2}, ] leading to: [ c = frac{a + b}{2}. ] 6. **Conclusions from Cases:** - If a = b, the triangle is isosceles. - If c = frac{a + b}{2}, the side c is the arithmetic mean of the other two sides, and the triangle is not necessarily isosceles. 7. **General Insight:** - Thus, from both approaches, we conclude: [ text{A triangle having the T property need not be isosceles.} ] - The hypothesis only implies either isosceles or that one side is the arithmetic mean of the other two sides. 8.

After drawing one green ball, there are now 5 green balls left and 12 balls in total. So the probability of drawing a second green ball is 5/12. To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities: Probability of both balls being green = (6/13) * (5/12) Now, let's calculate the probability that both balls are white. There are 7 white balls, so the probability of drawing one white ball is 7/13. After drawing one white ball, there are now 6 white balls left and 12 balls in total.

D: If an odd function (f(x)) is differentiable, then its derivative (f''(x)) is an even function.","completion":"Let's analyze each statement: - **A**: For a function (f(x)) to be increasing, a sufficient condition is that (f'(x) > 0) at every point in its domain. Saying (f''(x) > 0) implies the function is concave up, not necessarily increasing. This does not cover cases where the slope is decreasing but still positive, or cases where the function is increasing due to a positive slope that is not necessarily greater than zero everywhere. Thus, statement A is incorrect. - **B**: The condition (f'(x_0)=0) is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for (x_0) to be an extreme point of (f(x)). A point where the derivative is zero could be a local extremum or a point of inflection. Therefore, statement B is incorrect. - **C**: If for every (x_1, x_2 in R) with (x_1 neq x_2), the average rate of change is greater than (2017), it implies (f'(x) > 0) for all (x in R) because the derivative is the limit of the average rate of change as (x_1) approaches (x_2). However, this does not guarantee that the derivative is always greater than (2017); it just indicates the function is strictly increasing. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. - **D**: Consider an odd function (f(x)), which satisfies (f(-x) = -f(x)) for all (x). By differentiating both sides with respect to (x), we get ((f(-x))' = (-f(x))'). Utilizing the chain rule on the left-hand side gives (f'(-x)(-1) = -f'(x)), thus (f'(-x) = f'(x)).

We need to determine the number of ways this can be done. 1. Let's denote the modulus of the difference as ( d ). Clearly, ( d ) must be a natural number. 2. Consider the first pair involving 1 (the smallest number), which would pair with ( 1 + d ). Hence, the pair is ( (1, d+1) ). 3. Similarly, the second smallest number, 2, must pair with ( 2 + d ), i.e., ( (2, d + 2) ), and so on. The ( d )-th smallest number would pair with ( d + d ), i.e., ( (d, 2d) ). 4. Therefore, the first ( 2d ) natural numbers are broken into pairs ({ (1, d+1), (2, d+2), ldots, (d, 2d) } ). 5. Now consider the number ( 2d + 1 ). It must form a pair with ( 3d + 1 ), i.e., ((2d+1, 3d+1)). Similarly, (2d+2) will pair with (3d+2), and this continues until (3d) pairs with (4d ). 6. This analogy extends, dividing the full set of 60 numbers ({ 1, 2, ldots, 60 }) into disjoint groups of (2d) numbers. Each group creates (d) pairs with an identical modulus difference (d). 7. Therefore, to form pairs throughout the 60 cards, 60 must be divisible by (2d): [ 60 = 2d cdot k ] Where (k) is the number of groups of (2d). 8.

Time spent frying sausages = Total time - Time spent scrambling eggs Time spent frying sausages = 39 minutes - 24 minutes Time spent frying sausages = 15 minutes Now, we know that it takes 5 minutes to fry each sausage. So, we can find the number of sausages by dividing the time spent frying sausages by the time it takes to fry one sausage.

We need to mark all integers on the segment (I = [0, a_1 a_2 cdots a_n]) that are divisible by at least one of the numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n). These points split (I) into smaller segments. We need to prove that the sum of the squares of the lengths of these segments is divisible by (a_1). 2. **Initial Observations:** - The integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) are pairwise coprime. - The segment (I) is divided into smaller segments by marking points divisible by (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n). 3. **Base Case for (n = 1):** - If (n = 1), the segment (I = [0, a_1]) is divided into (a_1) segments of length 1. The sum of the squares of these lengths is (a_1 times 1^2 = a_1), which is clearly divisible by (a_1). 4. **Inductive Hypothesis:** - Assume that for (n-1) pairwise coprime integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1}), the sum of the squares of the lengths of the segments is divisible by (a_1). 5. **Inductive Step:** - Consider (n) pairwise coprime integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n). - The segment (I = [0, a_1 a_2 cdots a_n]) is divided by points divisible by (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n). 6. **Counting Segments:** - Each segment length is at most (a_1). - For each (k in [0, a_1-1]), the set ({k, a_1+k, 2a_1+k, ldots, (a_2-1)a_1+k}) forms a complete residue system modulo (a_2). - This implies that each segment of length (a_1) is divided into smaller segments by (a_2). 7. **Polynomial Representation:** - Let (P_n(i)) be the number of segments of length (i) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, a_1-1). - By induction, (P_{n-1}(i)) is a polynomial of degree at most (n-3) with coefficients having denominators relatively prime to (a_1). 8. **Sum of Squares:** - The sum of the squares of the lengths of the segments is given by (sum_{i=1}^{a_1-1} i^2 P_n(i)). - Let (P_n(i) = b_{n-2} i^{n-2} + b_{n-3} i^{n-3} + cdots + b_0). - Then, (sum_{i=1}^{a_1-1} i^2 P_n(i) = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} b_i sum_{j=1}^{a_1-1} j^{i+2}). 9. **Divisibility by (a_1):** - We need to show that (sum_{j=1}^{a_1-1} j^{i+2}) is divisible by (a_1) for (i+2 le a_1-2). - Using properties of primitive roots and Fermat's Little Theorem, we can show that (sum_{j=1}^{a_1-1} j^{i+2} equiv 0 pmod{a_1}). 10. **Conclusion:** - Since the sum of the squares of the lengths of the segments is divisible by (a_1), we have completed the proof.

Let's say the dealer sells 1 kg of each item at the cost price (CP) of 1 kg, which we'll assume is 100 for simplicity. For the first item (900 grams per kg): - The dealer gives 900 grams instead of 1000 grams. - The actual cost price for 900 grams (if sold at true weight) would be: (900/1000) * 100 = 90. - The dealer sells it for 100 (the price of 1 kg), so the gain for this item is 100 - 90 = 10.

(Reference data: ln 5 approx 1.61, ln 6 approx 1.7918, ln (sqrt{2} + 1) = 0.8814)","completion":"(I) Since f(x) = 5 + ln x, we have f(1) = 5 and f'(x) = frac{1}{x}, so f'(1) = 1. Thus, the equation of the tangent line of function f(x) at point (1, f(1)) is y - 5 = x - 1, i.e., y = x + 4. Let the line y = x + 4 be tangent to g(x) = frac{kx}{x + 1}, (k in mathbb{R}) at point P(x_0, y_0). Then, we have g'(x_0) = 1 and g(x_0) = x_0 + 4. Since g'(x) = frac{k}{(x + 1)^2}, we have the following system of equations: begin{cases} g'(x_0) = frac{k}{(x_0 + 1)^2} = 1 frac{kx_0}{x_0 + 1} = x_0 + 4 end{cases} Solving this system of equations, we find that (x_0, k) = (2, 9) or (x_0, k) = (-2, 1). Therefore, the value of k is 1 or 9. (II) When x in (1, +infty), we have 5 + ln x > frac{kx}{x + 1} always holds, which is equivalent to k < frac{(x + 1)(5 + ln x)}{x} always holds. Let h(x) = frac{(x + 1)(5 + ln x)}{x}, (x > 1). Then, h'(x) = frac{x - 4 - ln x}{x^2}, (x > 1). Let p(x) = x - 4 - ln x, (x > 1). Then, p'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} = frac{x - 1}{x} > 0. Thus, p(x) is increasing on (1, +infty). Since p(5) = 1 - ln 5 < 0 and p(6) = 2 - ln 6 > 0, there exists a unique real number m in (5, 6) such that p(m) = m - 4 - ln m = 0. Thus, when x in (1, m), we have p(x) < 0, i.e., h'(x) < 0, so h(x) is decreasing on (1, m); when x in (m, +infty), we have p(x) > 0, i.e., h'(x) > 0, so h(x) is increasing on (m, +infty). Therefore, the minimum value of h(x) on (1, +infty) is h(m) = frac{(m + 1)(5 + ln m)}{m}. Since ln m = m - 4, we have h(m) = frac{(m + 1)(m + 1)}{m} = m + frac{1}{m} + 2. Since m in (5, 6), we have m + frac{1}{m} + 2 in (frac{36}{5}, frac{49}{6}). Also, note that h(3 + 2sqrt{2}) = 8 and p(3 + 2sqrt{2}) = 2sqrt{2} - 1 - ln(3 + 2sqrt{2}) > 0, so we have m in (5, 3 + 2sqrt{2}) and h(m) in (frac{36}{5}, 8).

The initial discount is 15% of 2000, which is: 0.15 * 2000 = 300 So, the price after the initial discount is: 2000 - 300 = 1700 Now, Perry has 200 in gift cards, which he can use towards this purchase. So, the price after using the gift cards is: 1700 - 200 = 1500 The final price Perry pays using the store credit card is 1330. This means the additional discount he gets by using the store credit card is: 1500 - 1330 = 170 To find the percentage of this additional discount, we divide the additional discount by the price after the initial discount and gift cards, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (170 / 1500) * 100 = 11.33% So, the additional discount percentage Perry gets by using the store credit card is approximately boxed{11.33%} ."},{"prompt":"f (a+b=frac{9}{17}) and (ab=frac{1}{51}), what is the value of (a^2b^2)?
