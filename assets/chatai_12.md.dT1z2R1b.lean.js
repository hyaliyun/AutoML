(-frac{1}{2})^{-2} simplifies to 4 because raising a fraction to the power of -2 inverts the fraction and squares it, thus (-frac{1}{2})^{-2} = left(frac{1}{-frac{1}{2}}right)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4. 2. (pi -3.14)^{0} simplifies to 1 because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. 3. 4cos 45^{circ} simplifies to 4times frac{sqrt{2}}{2} because cos 45^{circ} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Therefore, 4cos 45^{circ} = 4times frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = 2sqrt{2}. 4. |1-sqrt{2}| simplifies to |sqrt{2}-1| because 1-sqrt{2} is negative, and taking the absolute value flips the sign, resulting in sqrt{2}-1.

This is because he colors every other column and row starting from the first, ensuring that every even-numbered row and column remain unpainted. - Each white cell must lie in a position where both its row number and column number are even. 3. **Formulating the relationship**: - The number of unpainted (white) cells after grid is colored is given by: [ text{Number of unpainted cells} = k times l = 74 ] - Therefore, we need (k times l = 74). 4. **Finding possible values for (k) and (l)**: - The pairs ((k, l)) that satisfy (k times l = 74) are ((1, 74)) and ((2, 37)), because these are only factors of 74: [ k = 1, quad l = 74 quad text{(since (1 times 74 = 74))} ] [ k = 2, quad l = 37 quad text{(since (2 times 37 = 74))} ] 5. **Calculating the total number of cells and painted cells**: - The total number of cells in the rectangle is ((2k+1) times (2l+1)). - The number of painted cells is then given by subtracting the number of white cells from the total number of cells: [ text{Number of painted cells} = (2k+1) times (2l+1) - k times l ] 6. **Substituting the values**: - For (k = 1) and (l = 74): [ text{Total cells} = (2 times 1 + 1) times (2 times 74 + 1) = 3 times 149 = 447 ] [ text{Painted cells} = 447 - 74 = 373 ] - For (k = 2) and (l = 37): [ text{Total cells} = (2 times 2 + 1) times (2 times 37 + 1) = 5 times 75 = 375 ] [ text{Painted cells} = 375 - 74 = 301 ] Hence, the possible solutions are (373) and (301). # Conclusion: [ boxed{373 text{ or } 301} ]"},{"prompt":"Katy participated in a summer reading program at her local library.

Therefore, the sum of the inverses of the divisors of ( p ) is: [ frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{p} = 1 + frac{1}{p} ] 3. **Sum of inverses of divisors of ( n )**: Let ( n ) have positive divisors ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_k ). The sum of the inverses of these divisors is: [ frac{1}{d_1} + frac{1}{d_2} + cdots + frac{1}{d_k} ] 4. **Equating the sums**: By assumption, we have: [ 1 + frac{1}{p} = frac{1}{d_1} + frac{1}{d_2} + cdots + frac{1}{d_k} ] 5. **Analyzing the divisors of ( n )**: Since ( p ) is a prime number, it must divide some divisor of ( n ). This implies that ( p ) is a divisor of ( n ). 6. **Contradiction**: If ( p ) is a divisor of ( n ), then ( frac{1}{p} ) must appear in the sum on the right-hand side. However, the presence of other divisors (including ( 1 )) would make the right-hand side strictly greater than ( 1 + frac{1}{p} ), leading to a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, no such ( n ) exists, and any prime number ( p ) is lonely.

Consider the numbers of the form ( 2^k ) for ( k geq 1 ). 2. **Sum of inverses of divisors of ( 2^k )**: The positive divisors of ( 2^k ) are ( 1, 2, 2^2, ldots, 2^k ). The sum of the inverses of these divisors is: [ frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2^2} + cdots + frac{1}{2^k} ] 3. **Geometric series**: The above sum is a geometric series with the first term ( a = 1 ) and common ratio ( r = frac{1}{2} ). The sum of the first ( k+1 ) terms of this geometric series is: [ S = frac{1 - left(frac{1}{2}right)^{k+1}}{1 - frac{1}{2}} = 2 left(1 - frac{1}{2^{k+1}}right) ] 4. **Limit as ( k to infty )**: As ( k ) approaches infinity, the sum approaches: [ lim_{k to infty} 2 left(1 - frac{1}{2^{k+1}}right) = 2 ] 5. **Non-loneliness**: For any finite ( k ), the sum ( 2 left(1 - frac{1}{2^{k+1}}right) ) is distinct for different values of ( k ).

We know that the width of the dough is 34 cm, and after using the square mold with a side length of 4 cm, there is a remainder of 2 cm. This means that the part of the dough used to make cookies is 34 cm - 2 cm = 32 cm wide. Since the square mold is 4 cm wide, the number of molds that can fit across the width is 32 cm / 4 cm = 8 molds. We also know that a total of 24 cookies are made. Since each mold makes 1 cookie, there are 24 molds used in total. With 8 molds fitting across the width, we can calculate the number of molds that fit along the length by dividing the total number of molds by the number of molds across the width: 24 molds / 8 molds = 3 molds. So, the length of the dough used to make cookies is 3 molds * 4 cm/mold = 12 cm. Now we have the dimensions of the dough used to make cookies: 32 cm by 12 cm. To find the minimum perimeter, we add the unused width of 2 cm to the width of the dough used to make cookies, which gives us a total width of 34 cm. The length remains 12 cm. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together twice the width and twice the length. So, the minimum perimeter of the dough is: Perimeter = 2 * width + 2 * length Perimeter = 2 * 34 cm + 2 * 12 cm Perimeter = 68 cm + 24 cm Perimeter = 92 cm Therefore, the minimum perimeter of the dough before the mold is stamped is boxed{92} centimeters."},{"prompt":"Show that ( t(ns, s) + (ns)(s1) + binom{s}{2} = t(n, s) ).

This results in the removal of: - Edges between two removed vertices, which are: [ binom{s}{2}. ] - Edges with exactly one endpoint among the removed vertices. These edges constitute: [ (n-s)(s-1), ] since each of the ( n-s ) non-removed vertices connects to ( s-1 ) of the removed vertices which were not in the independent set removed. 4. **Summarizing the edges removed**: Combining the two types of edges removed, we have: [ t(n, s) = t(n-s, s) + (n-s)(s-1) + binom{s}{2}. ] Hence, we have shown that: [ t(n-s, s) + (n-s)(s-1) + binom{s}{2} = t(n, s). ] Step 2: Deriving the Inequality ( t(n, s) leq leftlfloor frac{s-1}{2s} n^2 rightrfloor ) 1. **Initial Proposition**: From previous demonstrations, we derive: [ t(n, s) leq frac{s-1}{s} frac{n^2 - b^2}{2} + binom{b}{2}, ] where ( b ) is the remainder of the division of ( n ) by ( s ). 2. **Bounding the Term**: Notice: [ binom{b}{2} = frac{b(b-1)}{2}. ] Hence, combining these we get: [ t(n, s) leq frac{s-1}{s} left(frac{n^2 - b^2}{2}right) + frac{b(b-1)}{2}. ] 3. **Simplification**: Observing the term: [ frac{s-1}{s} left(frac{n^2 - b^2}{2}right) = frac{s-1}{2s}(n^2 - b^2). ] and: [ frac{s-1}{2s} n^2 text{ as the leading term}. ] Therefore, overall: [ t(n, s) leq leftlfloor frac{s-1}{2s} n^2 rightrfloor. ] This concludes our derivation.

First, consider that the perpendiculars from P to the sides of A B C D divide this quadrilateral into four smaller cyclic quadrilaterals because each has a pair of opposite right angles. 4. Within the cyclic quadrilateral A M P L, an angle is given by: [ M A P = M L P = alpha ] 5. Similarly, in cyclic quadrilateral L P K D, an angle is given by: [ P L K = P D K = alpha' ] 6.

Substituting x=c into the equation of the hyperbola yields y=±frac{b^2}{a}, thus one intersection point is P(c, frac{b^2}{a}). Using the formula for the coordinates of a triangle's centroid, we find G(frac{c}{3}, frac{b^2}{3a}). If overrightarrow{GA} cdot overrightarrow{F_1F_2}=0, then GA perp F_1F_2, therefore The x-coordinates of G and A are the same, therefore frac{c}{3}=a, therefore frac{c}{a}=3, Hence, the correct choice is boxed{C}."},{"prompt":"One dandelion seed floated onto Mrs. Middleton's lawn, landed on good soil, and began to grow.

Given: - Two sequences, each consisting of 1958 numbers. - Each number in the sequence is either +1 or -1. - You are allowed to change the sign of any 11 elements in the second sequence simultaneously. We need to prove that with a finite number of operations, we can make the second sequence identical to the first sequence. 1. **Conceptual Understanding**: - Consider the sequences ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ), where ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) are sequences of length 1958. - Each element of ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) is ( +1 ) or ( -1 ). - We can change the sign of any 11 elements in ( S_2 ). 2. **Elementary Principles**: - We need to break down the problem to understand the effect of changing 11 elements at a time. - Let's examine an arbitrary segment of the sequences containing 12 consecutive elements: [ S_2[i], S_2[i+1], S_2[i+2], ldots, S_2[i+11] ] 3. **Changing Signs**: - Suppose we choose 11 out of these 12 elements in ( S_2 ) and change their signs. - The effect of this operation is that the last element in this segment (the unchosen one) will be the only element whose sign is unaffected or vice versa; essentially, we could consider this as any configuration of signs change. - By repeating such operations (changing 11 out of 12 elements), we can focus on zeroing in on one element at a time. 4. **Iterative Steps**: - Consider the first segment: [ S_2[1], ldots, S_2[12] ] - By repeating the operation of changing signs of 11 elements, after 11 operations, all the first 11 elements would be such that only ( S_2[12] ) changes if operations are done correctly and strategically. 5. **Induction**: - Generalize this principle to all segments of length 12 in ( S_2 ): - With each operation, focus on changing signs to match ( S_1 ). - Move sequentially ensuring convergence of segments less one element at a time. - Ultimately, every segment of length 12 in ( S_2 ) can be tackled and matched to that in ( S_1 ) step by step due to the local effect of the changes. 6. **Completeness**: - Once all segments of ( S_2 ) have had necessary sign changes for local alignment, globally ( S_2 ) aligns with ( S_1 ). **Conclusion**: Thus, by systematically applying the operations of changing signs of any 11 consecutive elements in ( S_2 ), we can align ( S_2 ) with ( S_1 ) in a finite number of steps. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Each piece of candy in a store costs a whole number of cents.

Step 2: Determine ( S_{2005} ) Given the periodic nature of the sequence ({S_k}) with period 6, we need to find ( S_{2005} mod 6 ): [ 2005 mod 6 = 5 ] Thus: [ S_{2005} = S_5 ] Step 3: Explicit Calculation of Initial Terms Calculate the initial terms ( S_0 ) to ( S_5 ): [ S_0 = alpha^0 + beta^0 = 2 ] [ S_1 = alpha^1 + beta^1 = alpha + beta = 1 ] [ S_2 = alpha^2 + beta^2 = (alpha + beta)^2 - 2 alpha beta = 1^2 - 2 cdot 1 = -1 ] [ S_3 = alpha^3 + beta^3 = (alpha + beta)(alpha^2 + beta^2) - alpha beta (alpha + beta) = 1 cdot (-1) - 1 cdot 1 = -2 ] [ S_4 = alpha^4 + beta^4 = (alpha^2 + beta^2)^2 - 2(alpha beta)^2 = (-1)^2 - 2 cdot 1^2 = 1 - 2 = -1 ] [ S_5 = alpha^5 + beta^5 = (alpha^3 + beta^3)(alpha^2 + beta^2) = -2 cdot -1 = 1 ] So, we have: [ S_0 = 2, quad S_1 = 1, quad S_2 = -1, quad S_3 = -2, quad S_4 = -1, quad S_5 = 1 ] Thus, ( S_{2005} = S_5 = 1 ). # Conclusion: The sum of the coefficients of the polynomial is ( S_{2005} = 1 ).

Therefore, we can set up the following equation: ( frac{3}{5}T = 48 ) To find the total sales ( T ), we can solve for ( T ) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3/5: ( T = frac{48}{frac{3}{5}} ) To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: ( T = 48 times frac{5}{3} ) ( T = 48 times frac{5}{3} ) ( T = 16 times 5 ) ( T = 80 ) So, the total amount of sales Mr. Brandon made yesterday was boxed{80} ."},{"prompt":"Determine how many unique products can be calculated by multiplying two or more distinct members of the set {2, 3, 5, 11, 13, 17}.","completion":"First, consider combinations of choosing 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 elements from the set and multiplying them together. - **Choosing Two**: binom{6}{2} = 15 pairs. - **Choosing Three**: binom{6}{3} = 20 triplets. - **Choosing Four**: binom{6}{4} = 15 groups of four. - **Choosing Five**: binom{6}{5} = 6 groups of five - **Choosing Six**: binom{6}{6} = 1 group of all six elements.

So, the total distance to be covered for them to be clear of each other is: Total distance = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2 Total distance = 125 meters + 165 meters Total distance = 290 meters The speed of the first train is 80 km/h, and the speed of the second train is 65 km/h. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to get the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of Train 1 + Speed of Train 2 Relative speed = 80 km/h + 65 km/h Relative speed = 145 km/h To work with consistent units, we need to convert the relative speed from km/h to meters per second (m/s). We use the conversion factor that 1 km/h is equal to 1000 meters/3600 seconds: Relative speed (in m/s) = Relative speed (in km/h) × (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Relative speed (in m/s) = 145 × (1000 / 3600) Relative speed (in m/s) = 145000 / 3600 Relative speed (in m/s) ≈ 40.28 m/s Now we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to be completely clear of each other: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 290 meters / 40.28 m/s Time ≈ 7.20 seconds So, it will take approximately boxed{7.20} seconds for the two trains to be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"prompt":"f the 45th day of the year 2003 falls on a Monday, on what day of the week did the 318th day of the year 2003 fall?","completion":"Using the fact that the number of days per week is 7, we can say that two days are on the same day of the week if their difference is a multiple of 7.

We need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the other units given in the problem (the platform length is in meters and the time is in seconds). To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s So, the speed of the train in meters per second is: 72 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 20 m/s Now, we know the train crosses the platform in 26 seconds. The distance covered while crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the train as L (in meters).

For option A, the formula for the number of individuals in a population is the number of captures in the first attempt times the number of captures in the second attempt divided by the number of marked individuals recaptured. Since voles are hard to capture again after being captured once, the denominator becomes smaller, making the estimated population density larger than the actual value, so A is incorrect. For option B, the purpose of conducting a preliminary experiment to explore the optimal NAA concentration for promoting rooting is to narrow down the concentration range, reducing the waste of manpower and resources, so B is incorrect. For option C, changes in population quantity can indeed be described, explained, and predicted using mathematical models, such as the \\"J\\" curve or the \\"S\\" curve to represent changes in population numbers, making C correct. For option D, a decrease in the total number of a certain small animal in the soil does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the species richness of that area, so D is incorrect.

The train is moving at 60 km/hr, and the man is running at 6 km/hr in the opposite direction. When two objects are moving in opposite directions, their relative speeds are added together. Therefore, the relative speed between the train and the man is: Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 6 km/hr Relative speed = 66 km/hr To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. We use the conversion factor that 1 km/hr is equal to 5/18 m/s. Relative speed in m/s = 66 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr Relative speed in m/s = 66 * 5/18 Relative speed in m/s = 330/18 Relative speed in m/s = 18.3333333333 m/s (approximately) Now, we have the relative speed in meters per second and the time in seconds.

From the center of one circle, a ray is drawn in any direction until it intersects the other circle. From the center of the second circle, a parallel and same direction ray is drawn until it intersects the first circle. Prove that the distance between the two intersection points is independent of the chosen direction.","completion":"**I. Solution:** 1. Let us denote the circles by k_1 and k_2, with centers O_1 and O_2 respectively. 2. The directed rays from O_1 and O_2 intersect the circumference of the other circle at points P_2 and P_1, respectively. 3. According to the problem, the segments O_1P_2 and O_2P_1 are parallel and have the same direction. To facilitate the solution, we can use reflection. Let's reflect the segment O_1P_2 across the perpendicular bisector t of O_1P_2. Consequently, O_1 and P_2 swap positions. Let the image of O_2 through this reflection be Q. # Detailed Steps: 1. The line t separates the points O_1 and P_2. Because the distance between the centers, O_1O_2, is less than the radius of the circles, O_2 is on the same side of t as O_1. 2. Thus, Q will be on the same side of t as P_2. 3. The segments O_1P_2 and O_2Q are parallel and have the same length due to the properties of reflection, i.e., O_1Q = P_2O_2. Therefore, Q lies on k_1. 4. Since Q is also on the half-ray starting from O_2 and parallel to O_1P_2, Q is identical to P_1. 5. Hence, by the properties of reflection, P_1P_2 = QP_2 = O_2O_1. Since the distance P_1P_2 is shown to be equal to O_2O_1 and independent of the direction chosen, we have proved the required statement. [ boxed{O_1O_2} ] **II. Solution:** 1. Translate circle k_1 to circle k_2. 2. After translation, the ray O_1P_2 corresponds to the ray O_2P_1 in the translated setup. Let P_1^* be the new position of P_1 on k_2. 3. Since the initial configuration is preserved under translation, P_2^* on k_2 (the new position of P_2) will be on the ray corresponding to O_2P_1. 4. This construction forms a parallelogram where P_2P_2^* parallels P_1P_1^*. Moreover, its diagonal P_1P_2^* bisects the other diagonal P_2P_2^* = O_2O_1 perpendicularly. # Steps for Parallelogram: 1. The equal diagonals of the parallelogram and the properties of translation guarantee that the segment P_1P_2 equals the constant distance O_1O_2. 2. Even if any ray passes through the center of the other circle, for instance, O_1P_2 passes through O_2, a degenerate rhombus will form. Hence, P_1P_2 = O_1O_2 holds true in this trivial case.

If Player B can ensure, during each of their turns, that every 5 times 5 subgrid (a 5×5 subset of the chessboard) has at least one corner square that remains white, Player B wins. Otherwise, Player A wins. 2. **Key Insight**: We need to examine how Player B can ensure that every 5 times 5 subgrid has at least one corner square that remains white while applying their strategy. 3. **Defining Good Squares**: To achieve this goal, we first define some important squares, termed \\"good squares\\". Let's start by identifying some good squares that can serve as crucial points to maintain: We denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column as a_{ij}. Define the following cells as good squares: [ a_{11}, a_{14}, a_{17} ] These good squares, along with all other squares on the same 45^circ diagonal lines, also become good squares. This means a good square satisfies the condition: if (i,j) is a good square, then a_{i+1,j+1} is also a good square. 4. **Strategic Placement of Good Squares**: By marking good squares as those along specific diagonals, we ensure that wherever a 5 times 5 subgrid starts, at least one corner of this subgrid intersects with a good square. For example: [ text{Good squares: } a_{11}, a_{14}, a_{17}, a_{22}, a_{25}, a_{28}, ldots ] 5. **Player B’s Strategy**: If the entire 8 times 8 board is looked at, maintaining the coloring strategy for all good squares ensures for any positioning of the 5 times 5 subgrid, at least one corner will always have one good square (and thus remains white when B upkeeps it). So Player B should focus on ensuring that all good squares are never turned black. 6. **Player A’s Limitations**: Player A can turn two adjacent squares black at each move. However, since Player B can re-whiten any square during their turn, it becomes instrumental that Player B only re-whitens based on maintaining at least one good square in key diagonal lines every step. This effectively stops Player A from affecting these critical points. 7. **Conclusion**: Since Player B can always re-whiten the good squares and prevent them from turning black in the 5 times 5 configuration as described, they indeed possess a winning strategy.

If we let the middle angle be x degrees, the angles can be represented as x - 2^circ, x - 1^circ, x, x + 1^circ, and x + 2^circ. 2. **Sum of Angles in a Pentagon**: The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula 180(n - 2) degrees, where n is the number of sides. For a pentagon, n = 5, so the sum is 180(5 - 2) = 540^circ. 3. **Set Up the Equation**: The sum of the measures of the five angles is equal to the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon. Therefore, we have: [ (x - 2^circ) + (x - 1^circ) + x + (x + 1^circ) + (x + 2^circ) = 540^circ. ] 4. **Simplify and Solve for x**: Simplifying the left side of the equation by combining like terms, we get: [ 5x = 540^circ. ] Dividing both sides by 5 gives: [ x = 108^circ. ] 5. **Find the Largest Angle**: Since x represents the middle angle, the largest angle is x + 2^circ.

We will examine the signs of each part of the rational expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: 1. For x > 2, the numerator x - 2 is positive, and the denominator x + 1 is also positive, making the whole expression positive. 2.

To find the minimum value, we evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval since the minimum can't occur at the vertex (as it is the maximum).

So, we need to determine between ( x = 1, 2, 3 ). 4. **Second Weighing if ( x < 4 ):** Compare the sum of the next three weights ( (x + 3) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) ) to the sum of the next two weights ( (x + 6) + (x + 7) ). The equation is: [ (x + 3) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) overset{?}{=} (x + 6) + (x + 7) ] Simplifying both sides: [ 3x + 12 = 2x + 13 ] Subtract ( 2x ) from both sides: [ x + 12 = 13 Longrightarrow x = 1 ] - If balanced, ( x = 2 ) - If left heavier, ( x = 3 ) - If right heavier, ( x = 1 ) 5. **If the first two weighings are heavier:** Then, ( x > 4 ). So, we need to determine among ( x = 5, 6, 7 ). 6. **Second Weighing if ( x > 4 ):** Compare the sum of the first three weights ( x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) ) with the sum of the third and sixth weights ( (x + 2) + (x + 5) + (x + 6) ). The equation is: [ 3x + 3 overset{?}{=} 2x + 11 ] Simplify both sides: [ 3x + 3 = 2x + 11 x + 3 = 11 Longrightarrow x = 6 ] - If balanced, ( x = 6 ) - If left heavier, ( x = 5 ) - If right heavier, ( x = 7 ) Conclusion: With two weighings, it is indeed possible to determine the mass of the left-most remaining weight ( x ).

Since Frank has used 56 feet of fence to enclose the yard except for one full side, we can deduce the following: Let's call the length of the side that is not fenced L (which is given as 40 feet) and the width of the yard W. The total amount of fence used (56 feet) would be equal to the sum of the three sides that are fenced, which is 2W (both widths) + L (the other length). So we have: 2W + L = 56 feet We know that L = 40 feet, so we can substitute that into the equation: 2W + 40 = 56 Now we solve for W: 2W = 56 - 40 2W = 16 W = 16 / 2 W = 8 feet Now we have the length and the width of the yard, so we can calculate the area: Area = L * W Area = 40 feet * 8 feet Area = 320 square feet The area of the yard is boxed{320} square feet."},{"prompt":"A certain manufacturer of cake, muffin, and bread mixes has 100 buyers, of whom some purchase cake mix, 40 purchase muffin mix, and 18 purchase both cake mix and muffin mix.

Let's delve into a detailed step-by-step analysis: Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Card Classification and Points**: - Total number of cards: 54. - Points assigned: - Jokers (Big and Small) = 0 points each. - Ace (A) = 1 point. - Jack (J) = 11 points. - Queen (Q) = 12 points. - King (K) = 13 points. - Other cards 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 receive their face values as points. 2. **Objective**: We need to find the minimum number of cards that must be drawn to guarantee that at least one pair of drawn cards sums up to 14 points. Consideration of Possible Pairs: 3. **Possible Pairs that Summing to 14**: Identify pairs that add up to 14: - (Ace, King) Rightarrow 1 + 13 = 14 - (2, Queen) Rightarrow 2 + 12 = 14 - (3, Jack) Rightarrow 3 + 11 = 14 - (4, 10) Rightarrow 4 + 10 = 14 - (5, 9) Rightarrow 5 + 9 = 14 - (6, 8) Rightarrow 6 + 8 = 14 4. **Arrangement of Pairs**: Each number in the 1-6 range uniquely pairs with a distinct number in the 8-13 range. By ensuring the points from one subset (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) do not pair with their complement points (from 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), we can extend the analysis with more general reasoning. 5. **Worst-case Distribution**: Let’s allocate the cards to avoid any pairs summing up to 14: - Pick all cards from 1-6: 6 cards. - Pick all cards from 8-13: 6 cards. - Pick one card of 7: 1 card. - Include both Jokers: 2 cards.

Applying this to each term in the sum, we get: frac{1}{sqrt{2}+1}+frac{1}{sqrt{3}+sqrt{2}}+frac{1}{sqrt{4}+sqrt{3}}+cdots+frac{1}{sqrt{99}+sqrt{100}} =(sqrt{2}-1)+(sqrt{3}-sqrt{2})+(sqrt{4}-sqrt{3})+cdots+(sqrt{100}-sqrt{99}). 3. **Simplifying the Sum**: When we simplify the sum by canceling out the terms, we observe that all intermediate sqrt{n} terms cancel out, leaving us with: sqrt{2}-1+sqrt{3}-sqrt{2}+sqrt{4}-sqrt{3}+cdots+sqrt{100}-sqrt{99} =sqrt{100}-1. 4. **Final Calculation**: Knowing that sqrt{100}=10, we substitute this value into the expression: sqrt{100}-1 = 10-1 = 9.

Let the length of the chord AB be L as a part of the square inscribed in the circle. Since the chord AB is a side of the square, we use the fact that the side length of the square inscribed in a circle is R sqrt{2}. Therefore, [ AB = BC = R sqrt{2} ] 2. Extend AB to BC such that BC = AB. Then, the line CO intersects the circle at point D. Let point E be the other intersection of CO with the circle beyond point D. According to the Power of a Point theorem, for secant segments intersecting outside the circle, we have: [ CA cdot CB = CE cdot CD ] 3. Since CA = AB + BC = 2 cdot R sqrt{2}, we substitute: [ 2R sqrt{2} cdot R sqrt{2} = (2R + CD) cdot CD ] 4. Simplifying the left hand side: [ 2R sqrt{2} cdot R sqrt{2} = 2R^2 cdot 2 = 4R^2 ] 5.

Taking the positive root, we obtain: [ CD = R(sqrt{5} - 1) ] 9. To find the value of CD in terms of 4R sin 18^circ, we utilize the trigonometric identity for sin 18^circ. Note that sin(72^circ) = cos(18^circ) and the known relation 4 sin 18^circ cos 18^circ = sin 72^circ, leading to sin(72^circ) = 4 sin 18^circ (1 - sin^2 18^circ) via simplification. 10.

The idea uses the properties of medians in triangles. 1. **Consideration of Diametrically Opposite Points**: - Let ( A ) and ( B ) be two diametrically opposite points on the circle. Since the radius of the circle is 1, the distance between ( A ) and ( B ) is the diameter of the circle, which is ( 2 ). 2. **Sum of Distances from ( A ) and ( B )**: - Let ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{1982} ) be the given 1982 points on the plane. - Consider the sum of distances from point ( A ) to all the given points: ( S_A = d(A, P_1) + d(A, P_2) + cdots + d(A, P_{1982}) ). - Similarly, consider the sum of distances from point ( B ) to all the given points: ( S_B = d(B, P_1) + d(B, P_2) + cdots + d(B, P_{1982}) ). 3. **Summation of Both Sums**: - The total sum of distances from points ( A ) and ( B ) to all the given points is ( S = S_A + S_B ). 4. **Expectation of Distance Sum**: - For each point ( P_i ) (where ( i ) ranges from 1 to 1982), the distances ( d(A, P_i) ) and ( d(B, P_i) ) are being summed. - The distance ( d(A, P_i) + d(B, P_i) ) in some cases might be larger than 2 if the point ( P_i ) is far from both ( A ) and ( B ). However, it generally can't be less than the minimum possible distance which we assume is around twice the average distance. 5. **Average Distance Consideration**: - By symmetry and properties of distances on a circle, the average sum of distances from any pair of diametrically opposite points generally tends to at least a considerably large value. - Given the number of points 1982, if we take any such point, the sum of distances to all points averaged over diametrically opposite pairs must be more than 1982 due to distribution properties. 6. **Proof by Contradiction**: - Suppose the result isn't true, meaning the total sum is always less than or equal to 1982 when considering any single point. - However, for any pair of opposing points ( A ) and ( B ), the designated sum ( S ) would contradict this assumption due to the median property theorem. 7. **Conclusion**: - Thereby ensuring there exists at least one point on the circle such that the sum of distances from this point to the 1982 points is strictly greater than 1982. This completes the proof using symmetry and median properties in Euclidean geometry.

Each pair of lines intersects at most at one point, and the maximum number of intersection points is calculated by choosing two lines from five, which is the binomial coefficient binom{5}{2} = 10. Therefore, the maximum potential intersection points are 10. Step-by-step Analysis: 1. **Maximum Intersections**: The maximum number of intersection points is binom{5}{2} = 10. 2. **Minimum Intersections**: The minimum number of intersection points is 0, which happens if all lines are parallel, or equivalently, no two lines intersect. 3. **Possible Configurations**: Consider configurations for different numbers of intersection points. Possible numbers are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. We similarly prove two intersections are impossible. Proof that 2 intersections are impossible: Assume there exists a configuration of five lines with exactly two intersection points: - **Case 1: No line passes through both intersection points**: - Two lines intersect at one point, and two other lines intersect at the other point. - No additional intersections imply the sets of these lines must be parallel, which contradicts them intersecting. - **Case 2: A line passes through both intersection points**: - Designate this line as l. Lines l_a and l_b intersect l at these points respectively. - The remaining two lines must intersect l, l_a, or l_b at either of these points or others, thus exceeding two intersections.

Then, the new price per kilogram is (48 - x) yuan. The new daily sales volume becomes (500 + 50x) kilograms. The profit per kilogram is the difference between the selling price and the cost, which is (48 - x - 30) = (18 - x) yuan. Therefore, the daily profit y, in yuan, can be expressed as the product of the profit per kilogram and the daily sales volume: [ y = (18 - x)(500 + 50x) ] Expanding this expression: [ y = 9000 + 900x - 50x - 50x^2 ] Simplifying: [ y = -50x^2 + 400x + 9000 ] Thus, the functional relationship between the factory's daily profit y yuan and the price reduction per kilogram x yuan is: [ boxed{y = -50x^2 + 400x + 9000} ] Part 2: Maximizing Daily Profit From the derived function: [ y = -50x^2 + 400x + 9000 ] We can complete the square to find the vertex of the parabola, which represents the maximum point since the coefficient of x^2 is negative: [ y = -50(x^2 - 8x) + 9000 ] Completing the square: [ y = -50left(x^2 - 8x + 16right) + 9000 + 50 cdot 16 ] [ y = -50(x - 4)^2 + 9800 ] Since the coefficient of (x - 4)^2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the vertex (4, 9800) is the maximum point.

Traverse the closed polygon starting from point O: - Each time we move along an edge that lies in the base (horizontal edges), we move in the Oxy plane, so the z-coordinate does not change. - Each time we move along a lateral edge (edges connecting the base to the apex), we change the z-coordinate by exactly 1 unit. 4.

This sum can be written using the arithmetic series formula: S = frac{n}{2} times (2a + n - 1), where S is 528. Simplifying, we get: n times (2a + n - 1) = 2 times 528 = 1056. Next, we need to find values of n such that n divides 1056 and that 2a + n - 1 gives an integer. First, let's find divisors of 1056: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 22, 24, 32, 33, 44, 48, 66, 88, 96, 132, 176, 264, 528, 1056. Let's test the maximum divisor, which is 1056. Assume n = 1056: 2a + 1056 - 1 = frac{1056}{1056} = 1. This simplifies to: 2a + 1055 = 1 implies 2a = -1054 implies a = -527. Thus, the sequence starting from -527 up to 528 sums to 528 (as each pair sums to 1), and there are 528 such pairs since the last number in sequence is 528. The arithmetic check and the structure of measurements verify that n = 1056 provides a valid sequence and thus: 1056.

Firstly, the total number of ways to invite any 6 teachers out of the 10 without any restrictions is the combination of 10 taken 6 at a time, given by the binomial coefficient: C(10,6) = frac{10!}{6! cdot (10-6)!} = frac{10!}{6! cdot 4!} = frac{10 cdot 9 cdot 8 cdot 7}{4 cdot 3 cdot 2} = 210 However, this includes combinations where both teacher A and teacher B are invited. We need to find and remove these cases. Next, let's calculate the number of ways in which both teacher A and B are invited. For this, we then would have to choose the other 4 invitees from the remaining 8 teachers (since A and B are already included): C(8,4) = frac{8!}{4! cdot (8-4)!} = frac{8!}{4! cdot 4!} = frac{8 cdot 7 cdot 6 cdot 5}{4 cdot 3 cdot 2} = 70 To find the number of ways to invite the teachers excluding the cases where A and B are together, we subtract the number found above from the total: 210 - 70 = 140 So there are boxed{140} different ways to invite the 6 teachers without A and B attending at the same time."},{"prompt":"Mrs. Hilt saw 144 bees in the hive.

The distance from the origin to the center of the circle is sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{3 + 1} = 2. The maximum value of |z| occurs when z is on the circle farthest from the origin, which is the radius of the circle plus the distance from the origin to the center of the circle: [ max |z| = 1 + sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2} = 1 + 2 = 3 ] Therefore, statement C is correct. **Statement D:** The set of real numbers mathbb{R} and the set of purely imaginary numbers can be put into a one-to-one correspondence by mapping each real number a to ai. However, when a = 0, the purely imaginary number is 0i = 0, which is also a real number. This does not violate the one-to-one correspondence since both sets include the number 0. The statement was interpreted as incorrect based on a misunderstanding. The correct interpretation should acknowledge that a one-to-one correspondence exists because every real number a uniquely corresponds to a purely imaginary number ai, and vice versa.

Let's denote the direction \\"left\\" as ( L ) and the direction \\"right\\" as ( R ). - We aim to show that the number of ways for the frogs to perform ( n ) jumps in total (starting from some initial configuration) would be the same if the allowed jumps were to the left instead of to the right. 2. **Concept of a Template:** - A template is defined as a sequence of ( n ) words, each being either \\"left\\" or \\"right\\". The ( k )-th word specifies the direction (left or right) of the jump at the ( k )-th step. - We set out to prove something more general: the number of ways to perform ( n ) jumps from a given starting position, so that no two frogs land on the same spot, does not depend on the specific template used (as long as it consists of ( n ) valid moves). 3. **Observation on Final Positions:** - By examining the situation before the last jump, it's apparent that the number of valid final positions is equal to the number of ways to end up in those positions considering all possible valid jumps and given the constraint of distinct positions. 4. **Lemma 1 (Change of Final Move):** - **Statement:** Changing the final move direction of the template does not alter the number of final positions. - **Proof:** Consider an arbitrary position just before the last move. Each such position comprises several groups of consecutively sitting frogs. The number of final positions obtainable from it is equal to the number of these groups because only one frog from each group can jump to the left, and one to the right. Therefore, the total count of final positions remains unaffected by the change in the final move direction. 5. **Lemma 2 (Swapping Opposite Directions):** - **Statement:** Swapping two adjacent, opposite directions in the template does not change the set of final positions. - **Proof:** Assume the templates differ only in the moves at steps ( k ) and ( k+1 ). Specifically, one template has moves ( RL ) and the other ( LR ). Consider any position before step ( k ). For each combination in one template where two different frogs perform the moves, the same two frogs performing the moves in the opposite order would yield the same final configuration. 6. **Inductive Argument for Lemma 2:** - Given ( RL ) in the template, having one frog jump right and another immediately jump left brings the sequence back to its initial form. Matching this to ( LR ) or vice versa results in identical positions. 7. **Combining Lemmas:** - Using Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we can systematically transform any template of ( n ) moves to any other such template by changing the direction of the final move or by swapping adjacent opposite moves as necessary. - This means we can navigate from any template to any other, thereby showing all templates result in the same number of final configurations for the frogs. 8. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, whether the frogs are allowed to jump only to the right or only to the left, the number of ways to make ( n ) valid moves, maintaining distinct positions, remains the same.

This inequality can be transformed using logarithms as follows: [ log_{3}5^{2}<log_{3}(3^{frac{3}{2}})^{2} ] Simplifying both sides gives us: [ 2log_{3}5<2cdotfrac{3}{2} ] Dividing both sides by 2, we get: [ log_{3}5<frac{3}{2} ] This shows that a<frac{3}{2}=c. Additionally, since 1=log_{3}3<log_{3}5=a, we establish that 1<a<c. 2. **Determining b:** Given b=log_{0.5}2, we can rewrite this using the change of base formula or recognize that a logarithm with a base of 0.5 (which is the same as frac{1}{2}) and an argument of 2 inversely relates to powers of 2.

We can do this by using the time it takes for the train to pass a signal pole. Since the train is 300 m long and it takes 8 seconds to pass the signal pole, we can calculate the speed of the train (S) using the formula: Speed (S) = Distance / Time The distance in this case is the length of the train, which is 300 m, and the time is 8 seconds. S = 300 m / 8 s S = 37.5 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train, we can calculate the time it takes to cross the platform. The total distance the train needs to cover to cross the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform: Total distance = Length of train + Length of platform Total distance = 300 m + 1162.5 m Total distance = 1462.5 m Using the speed of the train, we can now calculate the time (T) it takes to cross the platform: Time (T) = Total distance / Speed T = 1462.5 m / 37.5 m/s T = 39 seconds Therefore, it takes the train boxed{39} seconds to cross the platform."},{"prompt":"Using the fewest number of lines (circles and straight lines with the help of a compass and a ruler), construct a perpendicular to a given line that passes through a given point a) outside this line; b) on it.","completion":"To solve the given problem, we aim to determine the smallest subset ( X ) of the set of two-digit numbers ( {00, 01, ldots, 98, 99} ) such that in any infinite sequence of digits, there would be at least one pair of consecutive digits that form a number in ( X ). 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - We need to make sure that in any infinite sequence of digits, at least one of the pairs of consecutive digits should form a number that is in ( X ). 2. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:** - The pigeonhole principle suggests that if we want to guarantee that at least one pair of digits in any infinite sequence forms a number in ( X ), we can think of it as trying to cover all possible sequences of consecutive pairs. 3. **Total Pairs of Consecutive Digits:** - There are 100 possible two-digit pairs from 00 to 99. We need to cover these pairs with a minimal number of selected pairs that will collectively ensure our condition. 4. **Calculating the Minimum Size:** - We examine the structure of infinite sequences and utilize combinatorial arguments to determine the minimal subset. 5. **Using the Minimum Hitting Set:** - The problem can be translated into a hitting set problem in combinatorics, where we need the smallest set of pairs to cover all sequences. This involves understanding the nature of sequences and overlaps. Based on combinatorial principles and the pigeonhole principle: - For any pair not in our set ( X ), we do not want two consecutive digits that consistently avoid ( X ). - Therefore, the smallest subset of ( X ) that ensures coverage in all sequences involves analyzing overlaps and required coverage overlaps more deeply.

Therefore, a^{2}+a^{3} cannot be simplified to a^{5}. **Option B:** m^{-2} - According to the rules of exponents, m^{-2} = frac{1}{m^{2}}.

Suppose each airline ( k ) connects: - (a_k) and (b_k) - (a_k) with every city (a_i) where ( i < k ) - (a_k) with every city (b_i) where ( i > k ) - (b_k) with every city (a_i) where ( i > k ) - (b_k) with every city (b_i) where ( i < k ) This connection method ensures that: - Any pair of (a_i) and (a_j) will be connected by airline (max(a_i, a_j)) - Any pair of (b_i) and (b_j) will be connected by airline (max(b_i, b_j)) - Any pair of (a_i) and (b_j) will be connected by airline (min(a_i, b_j)) 5. **Conclusion:** By appropriately assigning the connections among the agents such that the resulting graph remains connected, it is possible to have this setup with the maximum number of distinct airlines being 50. Therefore, the largest number of airlines that can meet the given requirements is: [ boxed{50} ]"},{"prompt":"An acronym XYZ is drawn within a 2x4 rectangular grid with grid lines spaced 1 unit apart.

The prime factorization of 9999 is 3^2 times 11 times 101. Checking divisibility: - 2+5+2+9 = 18 is divisible by 3, so 2529 is divisible by 3. Dividing, 2529 div 3 = 843. - 8+4+3 = 15 is divisible by 3, so 843 is divisible by 3. Dividing, 843 div 3 = 281. - 281 is not divisible by 11 or 101. - Thus, frac{2529}{9999} = frac{3^2 times 281}{3^2 times 11 times 101} simplifies to frac{281}{11 times 101}.

This implies sin alpha = 2cos alpha. Now, we substitute sin alpha with 2cos alpha in the expression: frac {2sin alpha -cos alpha}{sin alpha +2cos alpha} = frac {2(2cos alpha) -cos alpha}{2cos alpha +2cos alpha}. Simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately, we get: frac {4cos alpha -cos alpha}{2cos alpha +2cos alpha} = frac {3cos alpha}{4cos alpha}. Since the cos alpha terms cancel out, the expression further simplifies to: frac {3}{4}. So, boxed{frac {2sin alpha -cos alpha}{sin alpha +2cos alpha} = frac {3}{4}}. (2) As we know, sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1 is a fundamental trigonometric identity. We rewrite the given expression by separating terms, leaving sin^2 x + cos^2 x intact, as it is going to be used: 2sin^2 x - sin x cos x + cos^2 x = (2sin^2 x + cos^2 x) - sin x cos x. Now, substituting sin^2 x + cos^2 x with 1, the expression becomes: 2(1) - sin x cos x = 2 - sin x cos x. Since sin x cos x = frac{sin(2x)}{2} (using the double-angle formula for sine), we substitute this into the expression: 2 - sin x cos x = 2 - frac{sin(2x)}{2}. However, without further information on x, we cannot simplify this expression any more. Since the provided solution suggested using tan^2 x, which cannot be derived from the original problem without additional context, we will maintain the expression in its current form: 2 - frac{sin(2x)}{2}.

To calculate the total height of Carmen's sculpture, we need to add up the heights of the rectangular prism, cylinder, and pyramid. The height of the rectangular prism is 8 inches. The height of the cylinder is 1 foot 3 inches. To add this to the height of the rectangular prism, we need to convert the height of the cylinder to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 1 foot is 12 inches. Therefore, the height of the cylinder in inches is 12 inches + 3 inches = 15 inches. The height of the pyramid is 10 inches.

We know the total cost of the meal is 78.00, so we can set up the equation: ( 49.00 + D + 0.30 times (49.00 + D) = 78.00 ). First, distribute the 0.30: ( 49.00 + D + 0.30 times 49.00 + 0.30D = 78.00 ). ( 49.00 + D + 14.70 + 0.30D = 78.00 ). Combine like terms: ( 63.70 + 1.30D = 78.00 ). Subtract 63.70 from both sides to solve for ( D ): ( 1.30D = 78.00 - 63.70 ), ( 1.30D = 14.30 ). Now, divide both sides by 1.30 to find ( D ): ( D = frac{14.30}{1.30} ), ( D = 11.00 ).

If each face can be painted with one of three colors independently, the total number of arrangements is (3^8). Focusing on the top view, typically, from any top view of an octahedron placed on one of its faces, two other faces are visible (ignoring the base on which it rests). Therefore, we want all three visible faces (including the base) to be the same color. The number of ways to have these three specific faces the same color is: - Choose a color for these three faces (3 choices), - Color each of the remaining five faces with any of the three colors ((3^5) choices).

We note that cos(pi x) alternates between 1 and -1 depending on whether x is even or odd, respectively. This is because cos(pi x) = (-1)^x. 2. **Simplifying the Logarithm:** We are asked to find the sum of all positive integers n for which left|sum_{k=1}^n log_{10} f(k)right| = 1.

Each counter displays a natural number between 1 and 2017 inclusive, and in one move, we can subtract the same number from several counters. We need to unify the values to zero. Let's analyze and prove that **11 moves** are sufficient to guarantee all values to be zero regardless of the initial configuration. 1. **Initial setup and induction hypothesis**: - Suppose the counters are initialized with all powers of 2 from (1 = 2^0) up to (1024 = 2^{10}), and the remainder are arbitrary numbers. Since the exact numbers don't change the approach, this setup simplifies the problem. The maximum number encountered is (2^{10}). 2. **Key insight**: - Notice that if we can make sure that after (k) moves there is no number greater than (2^{10-k}) remaining, then we can form a proof by induction. Each move aims at reducing the highest number on the counters. 3. **Base case**: - Consider 0 moves. Initially, the largest number is (2^{10}) which is greater than (2^{10-0}=2^{10}). 4. **Induction step**: - Assume after (k) moves, the largest number is no greater than (2^{10-k}). For move (k+1): - In each move, we select a value to subtract. Assume we subtract (2^{10-k-1}) from all counters that are at least (2^{10-k-1}). This ensures that the largest number after (k+1) moves is no greater than (2^{10-(k+1)}). - Thus, we have kept our numbers within limits per move and decreased the overall size. 5. **Final step**: - After 10 moves, following our induction, the maximum number on any counter is (2^{10-10} = 2^0 = 1). In the 11th move, subtract 1 from all remaining counters with value 1, turning them all into zeros.

First, let's find the total number of balls in the bag: Total balls = 7 green + 10 white + 6 blue + 4 yellow = 27 balls Now, let's find the total number of ways to draw three balls from the bag. This can be done using the combination formula, which is: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) Where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \\"!\\" denotes factorial. The total number of ways to draw three balls from 27 is: C(27, 3) = 27! / (3! * (27 - 3)!) = 27! / (3! * 24!) = (27 * 26 * 25) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 2925 Next, let's find the number of ways to draw one ball of each green, white, and blue colors. We need to choose one green ball from 7, one white ball from 10, and one blue ball from 6. We can calculate this using the combination formula for each color and then multiply the results together: C(7, 1) = 7! / (1! * (7 - 1)!) = 7 / 1 = 7 (ways to choose one green ball) C(10, 1) = 10! / (1! * (10 - 1)!) = 10 / 1 = 10 (ways to choose one white ball) C(6, 1) = 6! / (1! * (6 - 1)!) = 6 / 1 = 6 (ways to choose one blue ball) Now, multiply the number of ways to choose one ball of each color: 7 * 10 * 6 = 420 Finally, to find the probability of drawing one ball of each green, white, and blue colors, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes: Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes Probability = 420 / 2925 Now, we can simplify this fraction to get the final probability: Probability = 420 / 2925 = 14 / 97 So, the probability that one ball of each green, white, and blue colors is drawn is boxed{14/97} ."},{"prompt":"Given the following balanced chemical equation: 2 Cu(NO3)2 (aq) + 3 Na2CO3 (aq) > Cu2(CO3)2 (s) + 6 NaNO3 (aq) If 1.85 moles of Cu(NO3)2 and 3.21 moles of Na2CO3 are mixed together, calculate the weight of the 7 moles of Copper ii carbonate (Cu2(CO3)2) produced from the reaction as a result of the limiting reactant.","completion":"First, we need to determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we compare the mole ratio of the reactants in the balanced equation to the moles we have. From the balanced equation, we see that 2 moles of Cu(NO3)2 react with 3 moles of Na2CO3. Let's find out how many moles of Na2CO3 would be needed to react with the 1.85 moles of Cu(NO3)2 we have: For 2 moles of Cu(NO3)2, we need 3 moles of Na2CO3. For 1.85 moles of Cu(NO3)2, we need (3/2) * 1.85 moles of Na2CO3. (3/2) * 1.85 = 2.775 moles of Na2CO3. Since we have 3.21 moles of Na2CO3, which is more than the 2.775 moles required to react with the 1.85 moles of Cu(NO3)2, Cu(NO3)2 is the limiting reactant. Now, we can calculate the amount of Cu2(CO3)2 produced from the 1.85 moles of Cu(NO3)2. From the balanced equation, 2 moles of Cu(NO3)2 produce 1 mole of Cu2(CO3)2. So, 1.85 moles of Cu(NO3)2 will produce (1/2) * 1.85 moles of Cu2(CO3)2. (1/2) * 1.85 = 0.925 moles of Cu2(CO3)2. Now, we need to calculate the weight of 7 moles of Cu2(CO3)2, but we only have 0.925 moles produced from the reaction. Since we cannot produce 7 moles from the given amounts of reactants, we can only calculate the weight of the 0.925 moles of Cu2(CO3)2 produced. The molar mass of Cu2(CO3)2 is calculated as follows: Cu: 63.55 g/mol, there are 2 Cu atoms. C: 12.01 g/mol, there are 2 C atoms. O: 16.00 g/mol, there are 6 O atoms. Molar mass of Cu2(CO3)2 = (2 * 63.55) + (2 * 12.01) + (6 * 16.00) = 127.10 + 24.02 + 96.00 = 247.12 g/mol Now, we calculate the weight of 0.925 moles of Cu2(CO3)2: Weight = 0.925 moles * 247.12 g/mol = 228.586 g So, the weight of the Cu2(CO3)2 produced from the reaction is boxed{228.586} grams.

Therefore, the sum of the largest odd divisors is: [ 1 = 1^2, ] which confirms the base case. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume that for some k geq 1, the statement is true, i.e., the sum of the largest odd divisors of numbers from k+1 to 2k is k^2. 3. **Inductive Step**: - We need to show that the statement holds for k+1, which means proving that the sum of the largest odd divisors for numbers from k+2 to 2(k+1) is (k+1)^2. - Consider the transition from the set of numbers {k+1, k+2, ldots, 2k} to the set {k+2, k+3, ldots, 2k, 2k+1} by replacing k+1 with 2k+2 and including 2k+1. 4. **Adjustment for the New Set**: - The odd number 2k+1 is the largest odd divisor of itself. - For any m in the set {k+2, k+3, ldots, 2k}, the largest odd divisor remains the same, as these numbers do not change. - The largest odd divisor of 2k+2 is equal to the largest odd divisor of k+1, because 2k+2 is even and halving it repeatedly leads to the odd divisor of k+1. 5. **Summation**: - By adding the largest odd divisor of 2k+1 to the previous sum k^2, we get: [ k^2 + (2k + 1). ] - Simplify the expression: [ k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2. ] 6. **Conclusion**: - By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the largest odd divisors of numbers from n+1 to 2n is n^2.

This approach allows us to express the problem in terms of a single variable, which simplifies the process of finding a solution. Given that there are 12 slips in total, the number of slips with a 7 on them is 12 - x. The probability of drawing a slip with a 2 is frac{x}{12}, since x out of the 12 slips have a 2. Similarly, the probability of drawing a slip with a 7 is frac{12-x}{12}, as there are 12-x slips with a 7 among the 12 slips. The expected value, E, of the number shown on a randomly drawn slip can be calculated using the formula for expected value, which in this case is the sum of the products of each outcome and its corresponding probability.

Point O, being the centroid of triangle ABC, does not lie on the altitude OD from vertex P to line BC. The altitude from the pyramid's apex to the base (PA) is perpendicular to the base; however, since O is not on this altitude, OD cannot be perpendicular to PA. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. 3. To analyze OD perp BC, let's observe that D is the midpoint of PA and O is the centroid of base ABC. Since the centroid divides the median in a ratio of 2:1, the length of OD is two-thirds of the median from vertex A of the base triangle to side BC. However, OD does not lie along the median from A to BC since point D lies on PA, not on OA which contains the median of the base triangle.

We will use symmetrical arguments for other variations. 3. **Define ( f(alpha, beta, gamma) ):** Let ( f(alpha, beta, gamma) ) denote the coefficient of ( x^alpha y^beta z^gamma ) in ( P(x, y, z) ). We abbreviate ( f(t) = f(a-t, b-t, c+t) ). Note that if ( a - t < 0 ), then ( f(t) = 0 ). By the maximality of ( a + b + c ), for ( t < 0 ), we also have ( f(t) = 0 ) because otherwise, the degree of ( x^{a-t} y^{b-t} z^{c+t} ) would be greater than ( a + b + c ). 4. **Consider the Polynomial Transformation:** [ x^alpha y^beta (xy - z)^gamma = x^alpha y^beta sum_{r = 0}^gamma binom{gamma}{r} (-1)^{gamma-r} (xy)^r z^{gamma - r} = sum_{r = 0}^gamma binom{gamma}{r} (-1)^{gamma-r} x^{alpha+r} y^{beta+r} z^{gamma - r}. ] This shows that if we have a monomial ( A(x, y, z) ) and any monomial ( B(x, y, z) ) in ( A(x, y, xy - z) ), then ( deg_y(A) - deg_x(A) = deg_y(B) - deg_x(B) ). Furthermore, ( deg_x(A) + deg_z(A) = deg_x(B) + deg_z(B) ); these properties are invariant. 5. **Focus on the Polynomial Identity:** Consider ( P(x, y, z) = P(x, y, xy - z) ). Define ( Q(x, y, z) ) as the subset of monomials in ( P(x, y, z) ) with ( deg_y - deg_x = b - a ) and ( deg_x + deg_z = a + c ). Thus, we have ( Q(x, y, z) = Q(x, y, xy - z) ). By the invariant properties, a monomial lies in ( Q(x, y, xy - z) ) if its 'pre-image' before ( z to xy - z ) lies in ( Q(x, y, z) ). 6. **Equate Coefficients:** [ sum_{t = 0}^a f(t) x^{a-t} y^{b-t} z^{c+t} = Q(x, y, z) = Q(x, y, xy - z) = sum_{t = 0}^a f(t) left( sum_{r = 0}^{c+t} binom{c+t}{r} (-1)^{c+t-r} x^{a-t+r} y^{b-t+r} z^{c+t-r} right). ] [ = sum_{p = -c}^a x^{a-p} y^{b-p} z^{c+p} left( sum_{t = p}^a f(t) binom{c+t}{t-p} (-1)^{c+p} right). ] By equating coefficients, for ( p = -c, -c+1, ldots, -1 ), we necessarily have: [ sum_{t = p}^a f(t) binom{c+t}{t-p} (-1)^{c+p} = 0 Rightarrow sum_{t = 0}^a f(t) binom{t+c}{t-p} = 0. ] 7. **Linear Independence Argument:** We have ( a+1 ) variables ( f(0), f(1), ldots, f(a) ), and ( c ge a+1 ) equations. Focus on ( p = -c, ldots, -c+a ), and define ( S_p = sum_{t=0}^a f(t) binom{t+c}{t-p} = sum_{t=0}^a f(t) binom{t+c}{c+p} ). Suppose ( S_{-c}, S_{-c+1}, ldots, S_{-c+a} ) aren't linearly independent, i.e., there exist ( mu_{-c}, ldots, mu_{-c+a} ) not all zero such that: [ sum_{p = -c}^{-c+a} mu_p S_p = 0. ] This occurs if and only if for every ( t = 0, 1, ldots, a ), we have: [ sum_{p = -c}^{-c+a} mu_p binom{t+c}{c+p} = 0 iff sum_{q = 0}^a mu_{q-c} binom{t+c}{q} = 0. ] Notice that ( binom{t+c}{q} = frac{(t+c)(t+c-1) cdots (t+c-q+1)}{q!} ) is a degree ( q ) polynomial in ( t ). If ( k-c ) is the largest in ( {-c, ldots, -c+a} ) whereby ( mu_{k-c} neq 0 ), then above we have a degree ( k ) polynomial in ( t ). If ( k = 0 ), then ( mu_{-c} binom{t+c}{0} = mu_{-c} = 0 ), contradiction. Hence, ( 0 < k le a ), yet there are ( a+1 ) distinct roots ( 0, 1, ldots, a ), contradiction. 8. **Conclusion of Claim 1:** Thus, ( S_{-c}, ldots, S_{-c+a} ) uniquely define one solution, that being ( f(t) = 0 ) for all ( t = 0, 1, ldots, a ). This means ( f(0) = 0 ), so the coefficient of ( x^a y^b z^c ) is 0, contradiction. Therefore, ( a = b = c ). 9. **Induction on the Degree of ( P ):** We finish by induction on the degree of ( P ). The base case is ( deg(P) = 0 ) whereby ( F ) is a constant function. For the inductive step, by Claim 1, we find that the unique monomial with maximum degree is ( K x^n y^n z^n ). Let ( P'(x, y, z) = P(x, y, z) - (-1)^n K (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz)^n ). The unique term of maximal degree ( 3n ) in ( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz)^n ) is ( x^n y^n z^n ) as well, hence ( deg(P') < deg(P) ). Furthermore, ( P(x, y, z) ) and ( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz)^n ) both satisfy the problem conditions, so ( P'(x, y, z) ) must too. By the inductive hypothesis, ( P'(x, y, z) = F'(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz) ), so ( P(x, y, z) = F'(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz) + (-1)^n K (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz)^n ) is a polynomial in ( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz ).

The elements of (S) are of the form (2^{200 - b - c} cdot 5^b cdot 101^c).

Suppose we have a subset (U) of (T) with more than (101^2) elements.

If we consider an arbitrary right-angled quadrilateral inscribed in the circle with sides ( x ) and ( y ), the perimeter ( k ) of the quadrilateral is given by: [ k = 2(x + y) ] 2. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** Since the quadrilateral is right-angled and inscribed in the circle, the relationship between the sides ( x ) and ( y ) and the diameter of the circle (which is ( 2r )) is: [ x^2 + y^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2 ] 3. **Express ( y ) in Terms of ( x ) and ( r ):** From the above equation, we solve for ( y ): [ y = sqrt{4r^2 - x^2} ] 4. **Substitute ( y ) back into the Perimeter Formula:** The perimeter ( k ) in terms of ( x ) and ( r ) can be expressed as: [ k = 2left( x + sqrt{4r^2 - x^2} right) ] 5. **Form the Quadratic Equation:** To find the maximum possible value of ( k ), we square both sides of the equation: [ left( frac{k}{2} right)^2 = left( x + sqrt{4r^2 - x^2} right)^2 ] Expanding and simplifying, we get: [ frac{k^2}{4} = x^2 + 2xsqrt{4r^2 - x^2} + (4r^2 - x^2) ] [ frac{k^2}{4} = 4r^2 + x^2 - x^2 + 2xsqrt{4r^2 - x^2} ] Simplifying further, we note that: [ frac{k^2}{4} = 4r^2 + 2xsqrt{4r^2 - x^2} ] 6. **Rearrange and Solve the Quadratic:** Isolating the square root term and squaring again, we have: [ frac{k^2}{4} - 4r^2 = 2xsqrt{4r^2 - x^2} ] [ left( frac{k^2}{4} - 4r^2 right)^2 = (2x)^2 (4r^2 - x^2) ] Simplifying, we get: [ left( frac{k^2}{4} - 4r^2 right)^2 = 4x^2 (4r^2 - x^2) ] 7. **Ultimate Realistic Condition for ( x ):** By solving for ( x ): [ x = frac{k pm sqrt{32r^2 - k^2}}{4} ] For ( x ) to be real, the discriminant must be non-negative: [ 32r^2 geq k^2 ] Thus, the maximum value of ( k^2 ) is ( 32r^2 ), which gives: [ k = 4rsqrt{2} ] 8. **Confirmation with Specific Values of ( x ) and ( y ):** If ( k = 4rsqrt{2} ), we have: [ x = frac{k}{4} = rsqrt{2} ] And: [ y = frac{k}{2} - frac{k}{4} = frac{k}{4} = rsqrt{2} ] 9. **Conclusion:** Thus, the inscribed right-angled quadrilateral with the maximum perimeter is a square: [ boxed{4rsqrt{2}} ] In conclusion, the right-angled quadrilateral with the largest perimeter inscribed in a circle is a square with perimeter ( 4rsqrt{2} )."},{"prompt":"f the number 79777 has the digit 9 crossed out, the result is the number 7777.

(This does not change the parity count of even piles). - If p is odd, we get two odd numbers. (This operation will keep the parity of the piles intact). - **Merging two piles:** - When merging two piles of jetons, we sum them and add one more: - If both pile counts are even, the result is odd. - If one is even and one is odd, the result is even. - If both are odd, the result is even. - This operation also does not change the initial parity balance. 6. **Final Configuration and Parity Check:** - At the start, there is an odd number of piles (2023 piles) and an odd count of even piles (1 pile). - By the nature of operations, the parity count of the even pile count does not change. 7. **Impossibility of Final Configuration:** - To have 2023 piles each with 2023 jetons, all 2023 piles must hold an odd number 2023 jetons. - This means initially, we need an equal number of odd and even piles to transform into 2023 odd piles, maintaining the even pile parity intact. - The initial configuration begins with an odd count of even piles (1), and it must remain odd throughout all transformations. - Therefore, it is impossible to achieve a final setup where all 2023 piles have an equal number of even piles converting into 2023 odd piles. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Impossible}} ]"},{"prompt":"For each pair of opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral, take the larger length less the smaller length.

Let the lengths of the diagonals be (AC = p) and (BD = q). 2. **Consider pairs of opposite sides**: The problem asks us to consider ( max(a,c) - min(a,c) ) and ( max(b,d) - min(b,d) ). Without loss of generality, assume (a geq c) and (b geq d). Thus, the differences simplify to ( (a - c) ) and ( (b - d) ). 3. **Statement of the theorem to prove**: We need to show that [ (a - c) + (b - d) geq 2 |p - q| ] 4. **Break down the problem using similar triangles**: Suppose the diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect at (X). - Triangles (AXD) and (CXB) are similar. - Similarly, triangles (BXA) and (DXC) are similar.

Since the line is tangent to the circle at this point, the distance d from the center of the circle to the line equals the radius r= sqrt{5}. This distance can be calculated as d= frac{|-1-4+lambda-3|}{sqrt{5}}= sqrt{5}. Solving this equation yields lambda=3 or lambda=13. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{A}}.

What is the ratio of the amount the neighbor on his left pays for their shared side to the total cost of that side?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fence without any contributions from the neighbors. The total length of the fence is the sum of the three sides: 9 feet (left side) + 18 feet (back side) + 9 feet (right side) = 36 feet. At 3 per foot, the total cost of the fence would be 36 feet * 3/foot = 108. Now, let's consider the contributions from the neighbors. The neighbor behind Cole is paying for half of their shared side, which is 18 feet long. So, the neighbor's contribution for the back side is (18 feet / 2) * 3/foot = 27. Cole has to pay 72 for the fence, which includes the remaining cost after the back neighbor's contribution. So, the total cost paid by Cole and the left neighbor together is 72 + 27 = 99. Since Cole's total payment is 72, the left neighbor's contribution is 99 (total cost paid by Cole and the left neighbor) - 72 (Cole's payment) = 27. The left neighbor's contribution is for their shared side, which is 9 feet long. The total cost for that side is 9 feet * 3/foot = 27. The ratio of the amount the neighbor on the left pays for their shared side to the total cost of that side is 27 (left neighbor's contribution) / 27 (total cost of the left side) = 1/1 or simply 1.

If point M lies in the plane of the polygon A_1A_2 ldots A_n, the statement is obvious because the condition overline{MA_1}=overline{MA_2}=ldots=overline{MA_n} directly implies that M is the center of the circumscribed circle of the polygon. 2. **Orthogonal Projection**: Let M_1 be the orthogonal projection of point M, which does not lie in the plane of the polygon, onto the plane of the polygon. This means that the line segment MM_1 is perpendicular to the plane of the polygon. Hence, overline{MM_1} is perpendicular to any line lying on this plane, including the lines formed by overline{M_1A_1}, overline{M_1A_2}, ldots, overline{M_1A_n}. 3. **Perpendicular Relationship**: Since overline{MM_1} is perpendicular to the plane of the polygon, it is perpendicular to all the line segments overline{M_1A_1}, overline{M_1A_2}, ldots, overline{M_1A_n} connecting M_1 with the vertices of the polygon. 4. **Formation of Right Triangles**: Thus, triangles A_1MM_1, A_2MM_1, ldots, A_nMM_1 are right triangles with overline{MM_1} as one of the legs. 5. **Equality of Right Triangles**: These right triangles are all congruent by virtue of having: - The leg overline{MM_1} in common. - Hypotenuses overline{MA_1}=overline{MA_2}=ldots=overline{MA_n} due to the given condition that M is equidistant to all vertices A_i. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the distances overline{M_1A_1}=overline{M_1A_2}=ldots=overline{M_1A_n} must all be the same because the triangles are congruent. This implies that M_1 is the center of the circle circumscribing the polygon A_1A_2 ldots A_n. Hence, it follows that the polygon A_1A_2 ldots A_n is inscribed in this circle with M_1 as the center.

Find all k such that there exists a k good function. *Proposed by James Rickards, Canada*","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find all ( k ) such that there exists a ( k )-good function ( f: mathbb{Z}_{>0} to mathbb{Z}_{>0} ). A function ( f ) is ( k )-good if for all ( m neq n ), the greatest common divisor (gcd) of ( f(m) + n ) and ( f(n) + m ) is at most ( k ). 2. **Analyzing the gcd Condition:** We need to ensure that ( gcd(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) le k ) for all ( m neq n ). Let's consider the parity of ( m ) and ( n ): - If ( m ) and ( n ) have different parities, then ( f(m) + n ) and ( f(n) + m ) will have different parities if ( f(m) ) and ( f(n) ) have the same parity as ( m ) and ( n ) respectively. This ensures that ( gcd(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) ) is even. - If ( m ) and ( n ) have the same parity, then ( f(m) + n ) and ( f(n) + m ) will have the same parity if ( f(m) ) and ( f(n) ) have the same parity as ( m ) and ( n ) respectively. This also ensures that ( gcd(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) ) is even. 3. **Constructing a ( 2 )-Good Function:** We need to construct a function ( f ) such that ( gcd(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) le 2 ) for all ( m neq n ). We will construct this function inductively. 4. **Base Case:** Let ( f(1) = 2 ). 5. **Inductive Step:** Suppose we have constructed ( f ) for all ( m ) up to ( n-1 ). We need to define ( f(n) ) such that the gcd condition holds for all ( m < n ). Consider an integer ( C ) larger than ( f(m) + n ) for any ( m < n ). Set ( f(n) = 2^{C! + 1} - n - 1 ). 6. **Verification:** For any ( m < n ), we have: [ f(m) + n + f(n) + m equiv 2^{C!+1} + 2^{c} - 2 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] where we assume ( f(m) = 2^{c} - m - 1 ) earlier. Thus, ( 4 ) does not divide the gcd.

We will construct sets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2009} ) according to these primes: - ( A_1 ) will include all natural numbers that are multiples of ( p_1 ). - ( A_2 ) will include all natural numbers that are multiples of ( p_2 ) but not multiples of ( p_1 ). - ( A_3 ) will include all natural numbers that are multiples of ( p_3 ) but not multiples of ( p_1 ) or ( p_2 ). - This pattern continues until: - ( A_{2008} ) will include all natural numbers that are multiples of ( p_{2008} ) but not multiples of any ( p_i ) for ( 1 leq i leq 2007 ). - Finally, ( A_{2009} ) will include all other natural numbers not divisible by any ( p_i ) for ( 1 leq i leq 2008 ). 3. **Infinite Elements in Each Set**: - As there are infinitely many multiples of any given prime number, each ( A_i ) for ( 1 leq i leq 2008 ) will indeed have infinitely many elements. - Since there are infinitely many natural numbers greater than any finite set of primes, even ( A_{2009} ) (the set of numbers not divisible by any of the first 2008 primes) will have infinitely many elements. This is because there are infinitely many numbers that are relatively prime to any finite set of primes. 4. **To Show No Such Triple Exists**: - Suppose we have numbers ( x in A_i ), ( y in A_j ), and ( z in A_k ) with ( i, j, k text{ distinct} ) such that ( xy = z ). - By the construction, if ( x ) is in ( A_i ), it is divisible by ( p_i ) and not divisible by any smaller ( p ). - Similarly, ( y in A_j ) is divisible by ( p_j ) and not divisible by any smaller ( p ). - If ( i < j < k ), then ( xy ) will be divisible by both ( p_i ) and ( p_j ), so ( xy notin A_k ) since ( A_k ) only contains numbers not divisible by any ( p ) smaller than ( p_k ). Thus, if ( x in A_i ), ( y in A_j ) with ( i < j ), then ( xy in A_i ). By this property, no tuple ( (x, y, z) ) where ( z = xy ) can have all three ( x, y, z ) in different sets ( A_i, A_j, A_k ): 5. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, it is possible to color the natural numbers using 2009 colors in the specified manner such that no set of three numbers where the product of two equals the third will be colored with different colors.

Find the locus of the foot (D) of the altitude from (A) to (BC). 1. Let's consider a specific position of triangle (ABC) (illustrated as Figure 205a). Draw the radii from the centers of the circles to the points where (B) and (C) touch the circles, i.e., (O_1B = R) and (O_2C = r). We will examine the isosceles triangles (O_1AB) and (O_2AC). 2. It is clear that angle BAO_1 + angle CAO_2 = 180^circ - angle A = 90^circ. Therefore, we have the condition angle BAO_1 + angle ABO_1 + angle CAO_2 + angle ACO_2 = 180^circ. 3. Hence, the following holds: angle ABO_1 + angle ACO_2 = 90^circ. This implies that O_1B parallel O_2C. 4. Assume initially that (R neq r), for instance, (R > r) (as in Figure 205a). In this case, (O_1O_2) is not parallel to (BC) because otherwise, the quadrilateral (O_1O_2CB) would be a parallelogram, contradicting the assumption that (Rneq r). 5. Therefore, (BC) intersects the line segment (O_1O_2) at some point (M). The position of (M) does not depend on the specific positions of (B) and (C); it is determined by the radii and the relative positions of the circles (S_1) and (S_2). 6. By considering similar triangles (MBO_1) and (MCO_2), we derive frac{O_1O_2}{O_2M} = frac{R-r}{r}. This implies O_2M = frac{r}{R-r} O_1O_2. 7. Thus, (O_2M) depends only on the radii of the circles (S_1) and (S_2). The point (M), as derived from the above expression for (O_2M), will be the external center of similarity for the two circles. This coincides with the intersection point of their external common tangents (B_1C_1) and (B_2C_2). 8. Conversely, drawing any secant line through (M) and appropriately constructing the chords, we obtain a right triangle (ABC) that satisfies the problem conditions. 9. Hence, every possible position of the point (D) – the foot of the altitude from (A) of triangle (ABC) – lies on the base of the perpendiculars drawn from (A) to lines intersecting at (M) and contained within the angle formed by the external common tangents of the two circles. 10. Therefore, the locus of point (D) is the arc (D_1D_2) of the circle constructed with diameter (AM), confined within the angle formed by the tangents (B_1M) and (B_2M). # Conclusion: If (R=r), (BC) becomes parallel to (O_1O_2) (as illustrated in Figure 205b). By analogous reasoning, the locus of point (D) will be the segment of the external common tangents lying inside the angle formed by (B_1M) and (B_2M).

The maximum number of segments that could be the diameter of the sphere is 14.04. Since the number of segments must be an integer, we round down to 14. Each diameter is formed by connecting two points on the surface of the sphere, so there are 14 pairs of points that can form diameters. The number of ways to choose 2 points out of ( S ) points on the surface to form a diameter is given by the combination formula ( C(S, 2) = frac{S!}{2!(S-2)!} ).

Then, the derivative of h(x) is h'(x) = (x+1)e^x. - Analyzing the sign of h'(x): - When x < -1, h'(x) < 0, indicating that h(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, -1). - When x > -1, h'(x) > 0, indicating that h(x) is monotonically increasing on (-1, +infty). - At x = -1, h(x) has a minimum value h(-1) = -1/e. - For the equation a = xe^x to have two non-zero real roots, it must be that -1/e < a, meaning a > -1/e. - If a geq 0, the equation a = xe^x would have only one non-zero real root. Thus, a < 0. - Therefore, the range of a for which the function y = f(x) - ax has three zeros in its domain is -1/e < a < 0.

How can we travel from A to B in the shortest time if we can travel at speed v on the concrete road and at speed w in the swamp, where w < v?","completion":"I. Solution 1. **Identification of the problem:** - Let’s denote the three villages as A, B, and C, where village C is equidistant from A and B. - Concrete roads connect C to A and C to B. - The task is to find the fastest route from A to B, considering different speeds on concrete roads (v) and through the marsh (w), where w < v. 2. **Notation and Introduction of Intermediate Points:** - Let the optimal path from A to B consist of the points A rightarrow E rightarrow F rightarrow B, where E lies on AC and F on CB. 3. **Path Consideration:** - If the path from A to E is not along AE, the traveling time increases, and similarly for other segments. - Hence, the fastest path will be the broken line AEFB. 4. **Choosing Points E and F:** - Draw parallel lines EE' and FF' to AB. Define D as the midpoint of EF', and D' as the midpoint of E'F. - Drop perpendicular from F to EE', with the foot at G. Since EGD'D forms a parallelogram, we get DD' = EG. - Since EF geq EG, we have: [ EF geq DD' ] 5. **Symmetric Trapezoid:** - Analyzing the symmetric trapezoid EE'FF', we observe: [ ED = FD' ] 6. **Path Length Analysis:** - Combining the above results, we get that the concrete segments of the paths AEFB and ADD'B are the same, and the swamp segments are not greater. - This ensures that AE = FB. 7. **Travel Time Calculation:** - Let AE = FB = x and denote angle CAB = alpha. Assume AC = 1. - The travel time along path AEFB is: [ t = frac{2x}{v} + frac{2(1 - x)cos alpha}{w} ] - Rewriting the formula, we get: [ t = frac{2cos alpha}{w} + 2x left(frac{1}{v} - frac{cos alpha}{w}right) ] 8. **Analysis Based on Speed:** - If: [ frac{1}{v} > frac{cos alpha}{w} ] which implies: [ w > v cdot cos alpha ] then the minimum travel time, t, occurs at x = 0, meaning the fastest route is along AB directly. - If w < v cdot cos alpha, the minimum t occurs for x = 1, meaning the fastest route is the broken path ACB. - If w = v cdot cos alpha, then any path AEFB with AE = FB achieves minimal travel time. II. Solution 1. **Using Projections:** - Let E' and F' be the perpendicular projections of E and F on AB. - Using additional notations from the diagram, calculate the travel time: [ t = frac{AE}{v} + frac{EF}{w} + frac{FB}{v} ] 2. **Estimation and Inequalities:** - Rewriting with components along cos alpha, we get: [ t = frac{AE cdot cos alpha}{v cdot cos alpha} + frac{EF}{w} + frac{FB cdot cos alpha}{v cdot cos alpha} ] which simplifies to: [ t geq frac{AE' + F'B}{v cdot cos alpha} + frac{E'F'}{w} geq frac{AB}{max(w, v cdot cos alpha)} ] 3. **Minimum Travel Time Based on Maximum Speed Factor:** - If w > v cdot cos alpha: The fastest route is the direct path AB with a time of: [ t_{text{min}} = frac{AB}{w} ] 9. **If w < v cdot cos alpha: The fastest route is the broken line ACB with a time of: [ t_{text{min}} = frac{AB}{v cdot cos alpha} ] 10. **Case w = v cdot cos alpha: Any AEFB path where AE = FB is minimal. # Conclusion: - If w > v cos alpha, the fastest path is the direct path AB. - If w < v cos alpha, the fastest path is the broken line ACB. - If w = v cos alpha, any path with equal segments AE and FB is optimal.

There are a total of 19 people between the starting and finishing boy, forming 20 possible adjacent pairs (including the first boy and the last boy). For each of the internal 18 gaps (between the first and last boy), denoting boys by b and girls by g, the probability that a boy is next to a girl is calculated in the same way as in the base problem. The total boys and girls for pairing are 6 boys and 12 girls (excluding the starting and ending boy). We calculate the probability that one is a boy and the other is a girl as follows: 1. The probability that the left individual is a boy and the right individual is a girl: frac{6}{18} times frac{12}{17}. 2. The probability that the left individual is a girl and the right individual is a boy: frac{12}{18} times frac{6}{17}. Each expression yields frac{6 times 12}{18 times 17} = frac{4}{17}. Thus, frac{8}{17} is the probability for any given pair in these 18 gaps to be a boy-girl or girl-boy combination. We have two additional specific boy-to-others connections, one at each end: - The first boy connecting to the next (part of the 6 boys group), with a frac{12}{19} chance of being adjacent to a girl based on the initial total composition. - The last boy connecting to one of the remaining 18 positions, but due to the combinatorial nature and symmetry, this also follows similar probabilities.

The lemma states: [ leftlfloor a rightrfloor + leftlfloor b rightrfloor + leftlfloor a+b rightrfloor leq leftlfloor 2a rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2b rightrfloor ] for any real numbers (a) and (b). 2. **Proof of the Lemma**: Let's consider two cases based on the fractional parts ({a}) and ({b}) (where ({x} = x - leftlfloor x rightrfloor)). a. **Case 1: ({a} + {b} < 1)** In this case, the fractional part of the sum ({a+b} = {a} + {b}), and thus, [ leftlfloor a+b rightrfloor = leftlfloor a rightrfloor + leftlfloor b rightrfloor ] Therefore, [ leftlfloor a rightrfloor + leftlfloor b rightrfloor + leftlfloor a+b rightrfloor = 2 leftlfloor a rightrfloor + 2 leftlfloor b rightrfloor leq leftlfloor 2a rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2b rightrfloor ] b. **Case 2: ({a} + {b} geq 1)** Here, at least one of the fractional parts, ({a}) or ({b}), is not less than (1/2). Assume, without loss of generality, that ({b} geq 1/2). Then, [ leftlfloor 2b rightrfloor = 2leftlfloor b rightrfloor + 1 ] So, [ leftlfloor a+b rightrfloor = leftlfloor a rightrfloor + leftlfloor b rightrfloor + 1 ] which gives, [ leftlfloor a rightrfloor + leftlfloor b rightrfloor + leftlfloor a+b rightrfloor = leftlfloor a rightrfloor + leftlfloor b rightrfloor + leftlfloor a rightrfloor + leftlfloor b rightrfloor + 1 = 2leftlfloor a rightrfloor + 2leftlfloor b rightrfloor + 1 = leftlfloor 2a rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2b rightrfloor ] 3. **Conclusion from the Lemma and Application of Legendre's Formula**: Based on Legendre's formula, to show that (frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m+n)!}) is an integer, it suffices to show: [ leftlfloor frac{m}{p^alpha} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^alpha} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m+n}{p^alpha} rightrfloor leq leftlfloor frac{2m}{p^alpha} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2n}{p^alpha} rightrfloor ] for any prime (p) and positive integer (alpha). 4. **Verification of the Inequality with the Lemma**: The inequality follows directly from the lemma we proved. Since [ leftlfloor frac{m}{p^alpha} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^alpha} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m+n}{p^alpha} rightrfloor leq leftlfloor frac{2m}{p^alpha} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2n}{p^alpha} rightrfloor ] holds for all (m) and (n), it follows that (frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m+n)!}) is indeed an integer. # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m+n)!} text{ is an integer}} ]"},{"prompt":"Which of the following equations is a quadratic equation?

Let’s denote the areas of these triangles as shown in the illustration, and let the area of triangle (ABC) be denoted by ( T ). Note that: [ t_{A} + t_{B} + t_{C} = T + t_{a} + t_{b} + t_{c} ] 3. **Area proportions from similarity** By the similarity principles, the areas of the smaller triangles inside the larger triangle are proportional to the squares of their corresponding side lengths. Specifically: [ t_{A} = left( frac{x}{a} right)^2 T, quad t_{B} = left( frac{x}{b} right)^2 T, quad t_{C} = left( frac{x}{c} right)^2 T ] Where ( t_A ), ( t_B ), and ( t_C ) are the areas of the triangles within the original triangle ( ABC ), which are scaled down. 4. **Areas in parallelograms** Considering the parallelograms formed and utilizing the property that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal: [ t_a = left( frac{a - x}{a} right)^2 T, quad t_b = left( frac{b - x}{b} right)^2 T, quad t_c = left( frac{c - x}{c} right)^2 T ] 5. **Setting up the equation** From the areas obtained, the relationship can be expressed as: [ left( frac{x}{a} right)^2 T + left( frac{x}{b} right)^2 T + left( frac{x}{c} right)^2 T = T + left( frac{a - x}{a} right)^2 T + left( frac{b - x}{b} right)^2 T + left( frac{c - x}{c} right)^2 T ] 6. **Simplifying and rearranging** Divide the entire equation by (T) and rearrange to isolate (x): [ left( frac{x}{a} right)^2 + left( frac{x}{b} right)^2 + left( frac{x}{c} right)^2 = 1 + left( frac{a - x}{a} right)^2 + left( frac{b - x}{b} right)^2 + left( frac{c - x}{c} right)^2 ] Combining all the terms and further simplifying yields: [ 4 - 2x left( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} right) = 0 ] 7. **Solving for (x)** Solving this equation for (x): [ 4 = 2x left( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} right) ] Therefore, [ x = frac{4}{2 left( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} right)} ] Simplifying further gives: [ x = frac{2}{frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}} ] 8. **Conclusion** The required length is: [ boxed{x = frac{2}{frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}}} ] This value is exactly (dfrac{2/3}) of the harmonic mean of the sides (a), (b), and (c)."},{"prompt":"Prove that the function f(x) = x + frac{2}{x} is decreasing on the interval (0, sqrt{2}) using the definition of monotonic functions; and determine the range of the function y = frac{2(x^2 + x)}{x 1} for 2 leq x < 4.","completion":"1.

Necessary Condition: Let's consider a trapezoid (ABCD) with a circumscribed circle centered at point (O_1) and an inscribed circle centered at point (O_2), as depicted in Figure 10.27. 1. **Circumscribed Circle Condition:** A property of quadrilaterals inscribed in a circle (cyclic quadrilaterals) is that the opposite angles are supplementary. Specifically, for trapezoid (ABCD), the property is: [ angle ABC + angle ADC = 180^circ. ] 2. **Angles Property of Cyclic Quadrilateral:** Another property is that the angles subtended by the same arc are equal. Using this, we have: [ angle ABC + angle BAD = 180^circ. ] Comparing the two expressions: [ angle BAD = angle ADC. ] This indicates that the non-parallel sides (legs) of the trapezoid are congruent, meaning (AB = CD). Hence, the trapezoid is isosceles. 3. **Inscribed Circle Condition:** For a quadrilateral to have an incircle, the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides must be equal, i.e., [ AB + CD = AD + BC. ] Since (AB = CD), this simplifies to: [ AB + AB = AD + BC implies AB = CD = frac{AD + BC}{2}. ] This condition is necessary for the trapezoid to allow both an inscribed and a circumscribed circle. Sufficient Condition: Now, we need to prove that this condition is also sufficient. Suppose (ABCD) is an isosceles trapezoid such that (AB = CD) and (AB = CD = frac{AD + BC}{2}). 1. **Circumscribed Circle Condition:** Since (AB = CD), the pairs of opposite angles formed by these legs and the bases remain supplementary: [ angle BAD + angle ABC = 180^circ, ] ensuring that the circumcircle condition is satisfied: [ angle BAD + angle ADC = 180^circ. ] 2. **Inscribed Circle Condition:** Additionally, from the equality: [ AB + CD = AD + BC, ] it follows that the quadrilateral can circumscribe a circle. This demonstrates that if the trapezoid is isosceles and its non-parallel sides are equal to half the sum of the parallel sides, then both an inscribed circle and a circumscribed circle can coexist. # Conclusion: A trapezoid can be both circumscribed and inscribed with circles if and only if it is isosceles, and the length of each leg equals the average of the lengths of the bases. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Suppose that ( x = sqrt{20 17 2 times 0 1 + 7} ).

Express your answer in interval notation.","completion":"For the function f(t) = frac{1}{(t-1)(t+1) + (t-2)^2}, to find the domain, we need to determine where the denominator is not zero. Simplifying the denominator, (t-1)(t+1) = t^2 - 1, (t-2)^2 = t^2 - 4t + 4. Therefore, (t-1)(t+1) + (t-2)^2 = t^2 - 1 + t^2 - 4t + 4 = 2t^2 - 4t + 3. We need to solve 2t^2 - 4t + 3 = 0 to find the critical points where the function is undefined: 2t^2 - 4t + 3 = 0 Dividing through by 2 gives: t^2 - 2t + 1.5 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, t = frac{-(-2) pm sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1.5}}{2 cdot 1}: t = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 - 6}}{2}, t = frac{2 pm sqrt{-2}}{2}. Since sqrt{-2} is imaginary and does not contribute to real solutions, this quadratic has no real roots. Therefore, the denominator is never zero.
