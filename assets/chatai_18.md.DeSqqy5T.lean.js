However, note that whenever the chain containing the (k)-th element is removed, say a (B) chain, and appended to the front of the string, two separate (A) blocks combine, unless the (B) string is the last string in the sequence. Namely, to ensure that the number of \\"breaks\\" do not decrease in a turn, we must have a string of the form, [ underbrace{AAdots A}_{c_1 text{ times}} underbrace{BB dots B}_{c_2 text{ times}} dots underbrace{AA dots A}_{c_{ell - 1} text{ times}} underbrace{BB dots B}_{c_ell text{ times}} ] 5.

Since there are 42 girls in total and 4 of them are sad, there are 42 - 4 = 38 girls who are not sad. These girls could either be happy or neither happy nor sad. Now, we need to find out how many of the 38 girls who are not sad are happy. Since there are 30 happy children in total and we have already accounted for the 4 sad girls, we have 30 - 4 = 26 children who are happy and not sad. Out of these 26 happy children, we need to subtract the number of happy girls to find the number of happy boys. Since we don't have the exact number of happy girls, we can only say that the number of happy boys (HB) is equal to the total number of happy children (30) minus the number of happy girls. However, we do know that the number of boys who are not sad is 12, and since these boys could either be happy or neither happy nor sad, the maximum number of happy boys can be 12.

Find the length of CD.","completion":"First, we verify that triangle ABC is a right triangle. We use the Pythagorean theorem: AB^2 + BC^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 = AC^2. Thus, triangle ABC is a right triangle with angle BAC = 90^circ. Next, using the angle bisector theorem, the ratio BD/AD = BC/AC gives: BD/AD = 8/10 = 4/5. Since BD + AD = AB = 6, let BD = 4x and AD = 5x. Hence: 4x + 5x = 6 implies 9x = 6 implies x = frac{2}{3}. Thus, BD = frac{8}{3} and AD = frac{10}{3}. Now, applying the Pythagorean theorem in triangle BCD: CD^2 = BC^2 + BD^2 = 8^2 + left(frac{8}{3}right)^2 = 64 + frac{64}{9} = frac{576 + 64}{9} = frac{640}{9}.

A strategic subset to remove initially could be {47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55}.

We'll prove a more general statement: Given a set S of points, where the set S includes the origin (0,0) and is invariant under a 90^{circ} rotation, the first player can always guarantee a win. **Step-by-Step Proof:** 1. **Base Case**: - If n = 1, i.e., only one point O(0,0), the first player wins immediately by taking the piece and erasing the only point. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: - Assume the proposition is true for any set of n points, i.e., the first player can always guarantee a win for any set S with n points satisfying the conditions. 3. **Inductive Step**: - Consider that the set S has n+1 points and satisfies the given conditions. We need to show the first player can force a win. 4. **Analyzing the Distances**: - Consider the lengths of all segments (defined as the straight line joining any two points in S). - Let d be the maximum of such lengths, and let A_1B_1, A_2B_2, ..., A_kB_k be all the segments of length d. 5. **Rotational Invariance and Elimination**: - Note that the origin O cannot be one end of these segments. If O was an end of a segment of length d, the segment would not be lengthed d due to rotation properties as OA < sqrt{2}RA where RA = other end of the segment. - Eliminate the points involved in these maximal segments. Let the resulting set be S'. This S' satisfies the invariance under 90^{circ} rotation and contains fewer points. 6. **Application of Inductive Hypothesis**: - By the inductive hypothesis, for the set S' (fewer points compared to S), the first player can guarantee a win. 7. **Winning Strategy for the Original Set S**: - The first player plays according to the winning strategy in S' until the second player makes a move that transfers the game piece into one of the points removed to form S', say A_i. - At that moment, the first player can move the game piece to B_i (the point originally connected to A_i by a segment of length d). This move is still legal as |A_i B_i|= d and previous moves were less than this length. 8. **Conclusion**: - After moving to B_i, there's no larger segment left for the second player to move legally as the maximal length d has been eliminated by construction. - Hence, the second player cannot make a longer move, ensuring the first player's win in the game. Thus, the first player can always ensure a win, no matter how the second player plays, when starting with a set of points with the properties described (containing the origin and invariant under rotation by 90 degrees).

The other points of intersection are ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). 2. **Midpoints of segments:** Let ( O'_1 ), ( O'_2 ), and ( O'_3 ) be the midpoints of the segments ( OA ), ( OB ), and ( OC ) respectively. 3. **Similarity of triangles:** Clearly, ( Delta O'_1O'_2O'_3 sim Delta O_1O_2O_3 ) with a similarity ratio of ( frac{1}{2} ). This is because ( O'_1 ), ( O'_2 ), and ( O'_3 ) are midpoints of the segments connecting ( O ) to ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) respectively. 4. **Proposition:** We use the following proposition: *Let ( Delta ABC ) be a triangle, ( M ) an arbitrary point in the plane, and ( A_1 ), ( B_1 ), ( C_1 ) the projections of ( M ) onto the sides ( BC ), ( CA ), ( AB ). Then ( frac{|A_1B_1C_1|}{|ABC|} = frac{|rho_M|}{4R^2} ), where ( rho_M = OM^2 - R^2 ) is the power of ( M ) with respect to ( odot (ABC) ) and ( |XYZ| ) is the area of ( Delta XYZ ).* 5. **Proof of the proposition:** Let ( A' ), ( B' ), and ( C' ) be the intersections of ( AM ), ( BM ), and ( CM ) respectively with ( C(O, R) ). Hence, ( MA cdot MA' = MB cdot MB' = MC cdot MC' = |rho_M| ).

At this point, there is an odd number of empty squares remaining on the board. - Among these squares, there exists at least one square that has either two filled or two empty neighboring squares. - The second player can always place an O in such a square, ensuring that no immediate threat is posed. 6. **Strategic Moves and Explanation:** - If the second player consistently places Os strategically to avoid creating \\"SOS\\" for the first player while also setting up potential traps, they force the first player to eventually succumb to one of the traps or to be unable to form an \\"SOS\\". 7. **Conclusion of the Original Proof:** By forcing the creation of traps and using strategic placements, the second player can secure a winning strategy. Essentially, the second player forces the first player into positions where their moves are inevitably futile or lead to their loss due to traps. 8. **Remark and Further Analysis:** - The only way to lose is by being forced to play inside a trap. - If a player plays in a cell c and loses, it implies that c must have been adjacent to exactly one S with another blank cell next to it. - If the second player places an S and this doesn't form an immediate \\"SOS\\", the trap logic ensures that the move's consequence can be managed. - Ultimately, since the second player only deals with an even number of blank cells and the nature of traps, this ensures their strategy leads to a win every time on a 1 times 2000 board. 9. **Generalization:** For any 1 times n grid: - If n is odd, the first player has a winning strategy. - If n is even, the second player has a winning strategy. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The second player has a winning strategy for a 1 times 2000 board.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Define two operations for any real numbers a, b, and a positive integer k: 1. a oplus b = kcdotmax(a, b) 2. a ominus b = min(a^2, b^2) Determine if the following statements are true: textbf{(1)} a oplus b = b oplus a textbf{(2)} a oplus (b oplus c) = (a oplus b) oplus c textbf{(3)} a ominus (b oplus c) = (a ominus b) oplus (a ominus c) textbf{(A)} (1)text{ only} textbf{(B)} (2)text{ only} textbf{(C)} text{(1) and (2) only} textbf{(D)} text{(1) and (3) only} textbf{(E)} text{all three}","completion":"Rule 1: a oplus b = b oplus a - Since a oplus b = kcdotmax(a, b) and max(a, b) = max(b, a) by the symmetric property of the max function, a oplus b = kcdotmax(a, b) = kcdotmax(b, a) = b oplus a. - **Conclusion**: Rule 1 is correct.

Let (z_0 = 0) and (z_1 = 1). After (n) moves, let (z_n) denote the new endpoint of the needle after a move. 2. **Rotation Representation:** If (omega = e^{frac{pi i}{4}}), we can set up the following recurrence relation for (z_1, z_2, ldots): [ z_{n} = omega^{e_{n}}(z_{n-2} - z_{n-1}) - z_{n-2} = (1 - omega^{e_{n}})z_{n-1} + omega^{e_{n}}z_{n-2} ] for an arbitrary sequence of integers (e_1, e_2, ldots).

Using angle BAC=frac{pi}{3} and the cosine rule in triangle ABC: cos angle BAC=frac{x^{2}+y^{2}-36}{2xy}=frac{1}{2} This gives us xy=36, and thus the area of triangle ABC is: S_{triangle ABC}=frac{1}{2}xysin angle BAC=frac{1}{2}times 36times frac{sqrt{3}}{2}=boxed{9sqrt{3}} # Part (2): Condition ② Analysis Given R=frac{a}{2sinangle BAC}=frac{6}{sqrt{3}}=2sqrt{3}, but OA=4 contradicts the radius R=2sqrt{3}.

Using the cosine rule, we get: left(b+cright)^{2}-3bc=36 Solving left(bc+9right)left(frac{bc}{9}-4right)=0 gives bc=36, leading to b=c=6.

We also know that the final mixture is 38% ryegrass and is made up of 86.67% of seed mixture X and the rest from seed mixture Y. Let's set up the equation based on the information given: The total ryegrass in the final mixture is the sum of the ryegrass from X and Y. Since the final mixture is 86.67% X, it is 13.33% Y (because 100% - 86.67% = 13.33%). The amount of ryegrass from X in the final mixture is 40% of 86.67%, and the amount of ryegrass from Y in the final mixture is R% of 13.33%. So, the equation representing the total ryegrass in the final mixture is: (40% of 86.67%) + (R% of 13.33%) = 38% Converting percentages to decimals for easier calculation: (0.40 * 0.8667) + (R * 0.1333) = 0.38 Now, let's solve for R: (0.34668) + (0.1333R) = 0.38 0.1333R = 0.38 - 0.34668 0.1333R = 0.03332 R = 0.03332 / 0.1333 R ≈ 0.25 Converting back to a percentage: R ≈ 25% Therefore, seed mixture Y is boxed{25%} ryegrass."},{"prompt":"The intercepts of the line frac{x}{4} frac{y}{3} = 1 on the xaxis and yaxis are respectively ( ) A: 4, 3 B: 4, 3 C: frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{3} D: frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{3}","completion":"Solution: The x-intercept and y-intercept of the line frac{x}{4} - frac{y}{3} = 1 are 4 and -3, respectively.

For every new application of ( f ), it moves the boundaries of these segments outward by 1 unit each time. From the mentioned properties, the graph ( f(f(x)) ) would include segments: [ y = -x - 4 quad text{for} quad x leq -4 ] [ y = x - 3 quad text{for} quad x geq 3 ] 3. **Solve for ( f(f(x)) = frac{1}{2} )**: We start by solving for ( f(f(x)) = frac{1}{2} ). Solving ( f(x) = frac{1}{2} ) gives 2 solutions for ( x ). Each of these will give rise to further solutions when ( f ) is reapplied. Moving these boundary lines outward includes more segments. 4. **General Pattern**: By looking at the problem incrementally: - For ( f(f(x)) ), 8 solutions. - As we continue applying ( f ), each additional layer doubles the number of solutions minus some constant.

For any ( x ), we have: [ x sqrt{5} - 1 < lfloor x sqrt{5} rfloor < x sqrt{5}. ] This inequality holds because ( lfloor x sqrt{5} rfloor ) is the greatest integer less than or equal to ( x sqrt{5} ). 4. **Successive applications of ( g(x) ):** Consider applying ( g(x) ) twice: [ g(g(x)) = lfloor lfloor x sqrt{5} rfloor sqrt{5} rfloor. ] Using the inequality from step 3: [ x sqrt{5} - 1 < lfloor x sqrt{5} rfloor < x sqrt{5}. ] Applying ( sqrt{5} ) again: [ (x sqrt{5} - 1) sqrt{5} < lfloor x sqrt{5} rfloor sqrt{5} < x sqrt{5} cdot sqrt{5}. ] Simplifying: [ 5x - sqrt{5} < lfloor x sqrt{5} rfloor sqrt{5} < 5x. ] Taking the floor function: [ lfloor 5x - sqrt{5} rfloor < lfloor lfloor x sqrt{5} rfloor sqrt{5} rfloor < lfloor 5x rfloor. ] Since ( sqrt{5} ) is irrational, ( lfloor 5x - sqrt{5} rfloor ) is not divisible by 5, and thus ( g(g(x)) ) is not divisible by 5. 5. **Sequence behavior:** Once ( g(x) ) is applied twice in succession, the sequence will continue to apply ( g(x) ) because ( g(g(x)) ) is not divisible by 5. This means: [ a_{n+2} = g(g(a_n)). ] Since ( g(x) ) is increasing for ( x geq 1 ), the sequence ( (a_n) ) will be increasing from this point onward. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the sequence ( (a_n) ) is increasing starting from some term.

Given the series sum_{n=1}^{infty} (-1)^{n-1} frac{1}{n^2}, we denote by S the sum of the series, S_n the partial sum up to the n-th term, and r_n the remainder (error) term after the n-th term. Hence, we write: [ S = S_n + r_n ] 2. We calculate the partial sum S_3 by summing the first three terms: [ S_3 = 1 - frac{1}{2^2} + frac{1}{3^2} = 1 - frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{9} ] Let's compute the explicit value: [ S_3 = 1 - 0.25 + frac{1}{9} = 1 - 0.25 + 0.1111 = 0.8611 ] In fraction form: [ S_3 = frac{1 cdot 36}{36} - frac{9}{36} + frac{4}{36} = frac{36 - 9 + 4}{36} = frac{31}{36} ] 3. Applying Leibniz's theorem for alternating series, which states that the absolute error |r_n| is less than the absolute value of the first omitted term |a_{n+1}|, we get: [ |r_3| < |a_4| ] 4. Since the fourth term of the series is a_4 = -frac{1}{4^2}, [ |a_4| = left| -frac{1}{16} right| = frac{1}{16} = 0.0625 ] Therefore, the absolute error |r_3| < 0.0625. 5. The remainder term r_3 is negative since the sum after the third term decreases; thus: [ -0.0625 < r_3 < 0 ] 6. Hence, the sum of the series S approx frac{31}{36} with an excess error, meaning S is slightly less than frac{31}{36}. Part 2: Estimating the error using the sum of the first four terms 1. Following the same approach, we calculate the partial sum S_4 by summing the first four terms: [ S_4 = 1 - frac{1}{2^2} + frac{1}{3^2} - frac{1}{4^2} = 1 - frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{9} - frac{1}{16} ] In fraction form: [ S_4 = frac{144}{144} - frac{36}{144} + frac{16}{144} - frac{9}{144} = frac{144 - 36 + 16 - 9}{144} = frac{115}{144} ] 2. Again, using Leibniz's theorem, the absolute error |r_4| is less than the absolute value of the first omitted term |a_5|: [ |r_4| < |a_5| ] 3. Since the fifth term of the series is a_5 = frac{1}{5^2}, [ |a_5| = frac{1}{25} = 0.04 ] 4. The remainder term r_4 is positive since the sum after the fourth term increases; thus: [ 0 < r_4 < 0.04 ] 5.

The denominators are 4 and 3, which means the common denominator is 12. Rewrite the terms with the common denominator: [ a = frac{12}{12}a, quad frac{3}{4}a = frac{9}{12}a, quad frac{2}{3}a = frac{8}{12}a ] Now combine them: [ frac{12}{12}a + frac{9}{12}a + frac{8}{12}a = 58 ] Combine the fractions: [ frac{29}{12}a = 58 ] 4. **Solve for (a):** To isolate (a), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (frac{29}{12}): [ a = 58 times frac{12}{29} ] [ a = 2 times 12 = 24 ] So, (a = 24). 5. **Calculate (b) and (c):** Using the given ratios, calculate (b) and (c): [ b = frac{3}{4}a = frac{3}{4} times 24 = 18 ] [ c = frac{2}{3}a = frac{2}{3} times 24 = 16 ] 6. **Determine (d) using the proportion condition:** We use the condition that (frac{a}{b} = frac{c}{d}). Thus: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{24}{18} ] Since (frac{a}{b}) must equal (frac{c}{d}), we can find (d) by: [ frac{c}{d} = frac{16}{d} = frac{24}{18} ] Cross-multiply to solve for (d): [ 24d = 16 times 18 ] [ 24d = 288 ] [ d = frac{288}{24} = 12 ] 7. **Conclusion:** The fourth term of the proportion is (d = 12). The complete proportion can be written as: [ frac{24}{18} = frac{16}{12} ] Therefore, the final answer is: (boxed{12})."},{"prompt":"For real numbers x , let f(x) be the least integer that is greater than or equal to x .

For large ( x ), we have: [ ax - 7 le lceil ax - 7 rceil < ax - 6 ] and [ bx + 3 le lceil bx + 3 rceil < bx + 4 ] 3. **Bounding the expression**: We can bound the given expression as follows: [ x^c left( frac{1}{ax - 6} - frac{1}{bx + 4} right) le x^c left( frac{1}{lceil ax - 7 rceil} - frac{1}{lceil bx + 3 rceil} right) le x^c left( frac{1}{ax - 7} - frac{1}{bx + 3} right) ] 4. **Simplifying the bounds**: For large ( x ), the differences between ( ax - 7 ) and ( ax - 6 ), and between ( bx + 3 ) and ( bx + 4 ), become negligible. Thus, we can approximate: [ x^c left( frac{1}{ax - 7} - frac{1}{bx + 4} right) approx x^c left( frac{1}{ax} - frac{1}{bx} right) ] [ = x^c left( frac{b - a}{abx} right) ] [ = frac{b - a}{ab} x^{c-1} ] 5. **Finding the maximum ( c )**: For the limit to converge, the exponent of ( x ) must be non-positive. Therefore, we require: [ c - 1 le 0 implies c le 1 ] The maximum value of ( c ) is thus ( 1 ). 6. **Calculating the limit**: When ( c = 1 ), the expression simplifies to: [ lim_{x to infty} x left( frac{1}{lceil ax - 7 rceil} - frac{1}{lceil bx + 3 rceil} right) ] Using the bounds again, we get: [ lim_{x to infty} x left( frac{1}{ax - 7} - frac{1}{bx + 4} right) = lim_{x to infty} frac{b - a}{ab} = frac{b - a}{ab} ] 7. **Special case when ( a = b )**: If ( a = b ), the expression inside the limit becomes: [ x^c left( frac{1}{lceil ax - 7 rceil} - frac{1}{lceil ax + 3 rceil} right) ] For large ( x ), this can be approximated as: [ x^c left( frac{1}{ax - 7} - frac{1}{ax + 3} right) = x^c left( frac{10}{(ax - 7)(ax + 3)} right) approx x^c left( frac{10}{a^2 x^2} right) = frac{10}{a^2} x^{c-2} ] For the limit to converge, we need ( c - 2 le 0 implies c le 2 ). The maximum value of ( c ) is ( 2 ), and the limit is: [ frac{10}{a^2} ] The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{b - a}{ab} } ) if ( b neq a ), and ( frac{10}{a^2} ) if ( b = a )."},{"prompt":"The sum of four positive integers that form an arithmetic sequence is 58.

Minimizing a is a way to achieve this. The smallest integer value for a is 1, given that d must remain an integer: [ d = frac{29 - 2 times 1}{3} = frac{27}{3} = 9. ] This gives us the sequence 1, 10, 19, 28.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 36 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 36 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 36000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 10 m/s Now, we know that the train passes an electric pole in 14 seconds. Since the length of the electric pole is negligible compared to the length of the train, the time it takes to pass the pole is the time it takes for the entire length of the train to go by. Length of the train = Speed * Time Length of the train = 10 m/s * 14 s Length of the train = 140 m Next, we need to find out how long it takes for the train to pass the platform completely. We know that it takes 51 seconds for the train to pass the platform. Time to pass the platform = 51 seconds When the train passes the platform, it has to cover its own length plus the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the platform as L (in meters). Total distance covered when passing the platform = Length of the train + Length of the platform Total distance covered = 140 m + L We can use the speed of the train to find out the total distance covered in 51 seconds. Total distance covered = Speed * Time to pass the platform 140 m + L = 10 m/s * 51 s 140 m + L = 510 m Now, we can solve for L, the length of the platform.

Each shape can intersect with the others, and we aim to maximize these intersections. 2. **Intersections Between Shapes:** - **Triangle and Rectangle:** Each side of the triangle can intersect each side of the rectangle. Since a triangle has 3 sides and a rectangle has 4 sides, the maximum number of intersections between the triangle and the rectangle is (3 times 4 = 12). - **Circle with Triangle and Rectangle:** The circle can intersect each side of the triangle and the rectangle twice. The triangle has 3 sides, and the rectangle has 4 sides, so the total number of sides is (3 + 4 = 7). The circle can intersect each of these sides twice, giving (7 times 2 = 14) intersections. 3. **Counting Regions:** - **Initial Regions:** Without any intersections, each shape divides the plane into regions.

The correct approach is to consider the maximum number of regions created by each shape and their intersections. 6. **Correct Calculation:** - **Circle and Rectangle:** The circle can intersect the rectangle at most 8 times (4 sides, each intersected twice). - **Circle and Triangle:** The circle can intersect the triangle at most 6 times (3 sides, each intersected twice). - **Rectangle and Triangle:** The rectangle can intersect the triangle at most 6 times (each side of the triangle intersecting each side of the rectangle).

This indicates that f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}). Therefore, for any x > 0, we have f(x) > f(0) = 0, which simplifies to x > sin x. Applying this to b=sin 3, we note that sin 3 = sin(pi - 3), leading to the conclusion that sin 3 < pi - 3. Next, we define another function g(x)=tan x - x for x in (0, frac{pi}{2}). The derivative of g(x) is: [g'(x)=frac{1}{cos^2 x} - 1 = frac{sin^2 x}{cos^2 x}.] Since sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1, the derivative simplifies to g'(x) = frac{1 - cos^2 x}{cos^2 x} > 0. This shows that g(x) is also monotonically increasing on (0, frac{pi}{2}). Thus, for 0 < x < frac{pi}{2}, we have g(x) > g(0) = 0, which means tan x > x. Applying this to c = tan 4, and noting that 4 is equivalent to 4 - pi in the relevant interval, we find tan 4 > 4 - pi. Since 4 - pi > pi - 3, it follows that c > b. Finally, considering a = cos 2, we know that cos 2 < cos frac{pi}{2} = 0 since cos x decreases from 1 to 0 as x goes from 0 to frac{pi}{2}. Thus, we have established that a < 0.

In this case, each person would get 1 marble less than they do today, so each person would get ( frac{220}{x} - 1 ) marbles.

An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length (the legs) and a third side that can be of a different length (the base). Let's denote the length of the base of the isosceles triangle as b. Since one of the legs of the isosceles triangle is the same as a side of the equilateral triangle, it has a length of 20 units. The other leg, being an isosceles triangle, must also be 20 units long. The perimeter of the isosceles triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides, which is 20 (one leg) + 20 (the other leg) + b (the base) = 55 units.

How can we mark a point on this ray, preferably in the fewest possible steps, given that we have a sufficiently long rope and additional stakes available?","completion":"**Step 1**: Understand the Problem and Available Resources First, let's analyze the tools and resources available for the problem. We have marking stakes, ample rope, and a clear terrain. We need to construct the bisector of an angle in such a way that it divides the angle into quarters. 1. Marking stakes can be used to set points on the ground and to extend a line through two mapped points. 2. By peeking from behind two placed stakes, we can set another stake in a precise line extended beyond the two defined points. 3. Using ropes, we can mark a line segment between two points, and we can also determine intersections. **Step 2**: Set up the Scenario Given points (A), (B), and (C) on the terrain and aiming to define a ray from (A) that halves the angle ( angle BAC): 1. Aim is to find a point which is in the direction that makes a fourth of the angle ( angle BAC ) from the line segment ( AB ). **Step 3**: Steps to Bisect Half the Angle Half the angle process, knowing that the median of an isosceles triangle also serves as its angle bisector: 1. Measure segment (AB) and extend it along ray (AC) to a point ( B_1 ) where ( AB = AB_1 ). 2. Determine the midpoint ( F_1 ) of segment ( BB_1 ). 3. Now, align segment ( A F_1 ) on segment ( AC ), and extend this to point ( B_2 ). 4. The midpoint ( F_2 ) of segment ( B B_2 ) gives us the desired direction for a fourth angle partition. This determines the exact point to set the stake. **Step 4**: Constructing the Ray Using Less Steps Rather than focusing on aligning points incrementally: 1. Extend segment ( AB ) along ray ( AC ) to create a point ( D ) equal in length to ( AB ). 2. In triangle ( ABD ), the external angle at ( D ) equals the half of ( angle BAC ) due to symmetry in an isosceles triangle. 3. Repeating this with ( B ) as the vertex, and extending the span ( BD ) beyond ( B ) mark another point ( E ). 4. The points now confirm that in triangle ( BAE ), the angle (BAE ) will be exactly a quarter of ( angle BAC ) because measure is compounded symmetrically. **Conclusion**: Using two stakes and minimal measurements: [ boxed{text{Point } E text{ is the required bisector direction}} ] Insights: 1. Each process is replicable and simplified upon modification without incorrectness for ( angle BAC > 180^circ ). 2.

Specifically: - Two lines parallel to the sides of the square, passing through the point (B). - One line parallel to the diagonal and passing through the point symmetrical to (B) with respect to the diagonal. 5. **Geometric Construction:** - If the square has sides of length (a) and diagonal length (sqrt{2}a), the lines are constructed as follows: 1. **First Line Segment**: parallel to one pair of square sides and extends through (B). 2. **Second Line Segment**: parallel to the second pair of square sides and extends through (B). 3. **Third Line Segment**: parallel to the diagonal and passing through a point symmetric to (B) relative to the chosen diagonal. 6. **Conclusion:** - The solution involves these three line segments covering the required reflection symmetry to determine those expected collision points.

The correct proposition is to prove that: [ frac{EC}{BM} = frac{FC}{FM} ] 2. **Counterexample Analysis**: The original assertion: [ frac{EC}{BM} = frac{FC}{DM} ] does not always hold. For example, consider a cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD) where the intersections (E) and (F) of the extended sides form an equilateral triangle with (D). Assume the sides of the triangle are of unit length. In this scenario, [ EC = frac{1}{2}, quad BM = frac{1}{3} frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, quad FC = DM = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] Thus, [ frac{EC}{BM} = frac{frac{1}{2}}{frac{1}{3} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} neq frac{FC}{DM} = frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} ] 3. **Correct Problem Analysis**: Given any cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD), we need to examine under what condition the adjusted assertion holds: First, consider: - (E) is the intersection of lines (AB) and (CD). - (F) is the intersection of lines (AD) and (BC). 4. **Cyclic Quadrilaterals and Angle Conditions**: Since (ABCD) and (EADM) are cyclic quadrilaterals, we have: [ angle EMD = angle BCD ] 5. **Quadrilateral (EMFC)**: In quadrilateral (EMFC), we must satisfy: [ angle CEM + angle EMF + angle MFC + angle FCE = 360^circ ] But: - (angle CEM = angle DEM = angle DAM) (since (EADM) is cyclic). - (angle MFC = angle MFB = angle MAB) (since (ABMF) is cyclic). - (angle FCE = angle DCB). 6. **Collinearity and Supplementary Angles**: Using supplementary angles, it follows: [ angle EMF = 180^circ ] indicating that (E, M, F) are collinear. 7. **Similarity of Triangles**: The collinearity of (E, M, F) implies the similarity of triangles (EFC) and (MBF): [ frac{EC}{BM} = frac{FC}{FM} ] 8. **Conclusion**: Thus, the correct condition holds only if: [ frac{EC}{BM} = frac{FC}{FM} ] [ boxed{frac{EC}{BM} = frac{FC}{FM}} ]"},{"prompt":"Do there exist two numbers such that the first is greater than the second by 2016 times, and the sum of its digits is less than the sum of the digits of the second by 2016 times?","completion":"We need to determine whether there exist two numbers such that the first number is 2016 times greater than the second number, and the sum of the digits of the first number is less than the sum of the digits of the second number by a factor of 2016. Let's denote the two numbers by (A) and (B) where (A = 2016 times B). To analyze this, we can construct specific examples. Consider the number (A) in the form ( 11 ldots 15), where the number of ones is greater than 10. For instance, if (A) is of the form ( 11 ldots 11 ldots 15) with more than 10 ones. Next, we will multiply (A) by 2016 and examine the resulting number: [ 11 ldots 15 times 2016 = 10080 + 20160 + 201600 + 2016000 + ldots + 201600 ldots 0 ] This multiplication would result in a number with many nines in its digits because (2 + 0 + 1 + 6 = 9). However, focusing on how the multiplication runs, many nines would disappear through the carry over process from one digit to the next. Let's assume an example multiplication: [ 11 ldots 15 ] [ times quad 2016 ] [ = 2240 ldots 007840 ] We can analyze the sum of the digits of the resulting product. Notice that regardless of the number of ones in the number (A), the sum of the digits of the resulting number is approximately constant at 27: [ 2 + 2 + 4 ldots 0 + 0 + 0 + 7 + 8 + 4 + 0 = 27 ] For the sum of the digits of (A) to be (2016) times the sum of the digits of (B), (B = frac{A}{2016}), it must imply: [ text{Sum of the digits of } A times 2016 = text{Sum of digits of } B ] To ensure the sum of the digits of (A) is 2016 times greater than [ text{Sum of digits of } B = frac{2016 times text{Sum of digits of } A}{2016!} - 5 ] Hence the construction is correct.

Let O and r be the center and radius of the fourth circle, which is tangent to the three given circles externally. 2. Since the circles are tangent to each other externally and no two circles have common interior points, the distance between centers O_i and O_j should be at least the sum of the radii of the two circles. 3. Consider the triangle formed by the centers O, O_1, and O_3. By the triangle inequality, we have: [ OO_1 + OO_3 > O_1O_3 ] 4. The distances OO_1 and OO_3 are given by: [ OO_1 = r + r_1 quad text{and} quad OO_3 = r + r_3 ] 5. The distance O_1O_3 includes both the radii of the two outer circles and the diameter of the middle circle: [ O_1O_3 geq r_1 + 2r_2 + r_3 ] 6. Substituting these values into the triangle inequality: [ (r + r_1) + (r + r_3) > r_1 + 2r_2 + r_3 ] 7. Simplifying the inequality: [ 2r + r_1 + r_3 > r_1 + 2r_2 + r_3 ] 8. Removing the common terms r_1 and r_3 from both sides: [ 2r > 2r_2 ] which simplifies to: [ r > r_2 ] Thus, the radius r of the fourth circle cannot be smaller than r_2.

This can be factored as (f(x) + 1)(f(x) - 3) = 0. - **For f(x) = -1**: There is one solution because f(x) is continuous and monotonically increasing. We denote this solution as x_1. - **For f(x) = 3**: Similarly, there is one solution, denoted as x_2.

Since f_2(x) is monotonically increasing, it crosses zero exactly once in the interval (1, 2).

Can it happen that 90% of its volume is below the water level, while more than half of its surface area is above the water level? (A Shapovalov)","completion":"To determine whether a convex polyhedron can have 90% of its volume below the water level while more than half of its surface area is above the water level, we can use a 2D analogy and then extend it to 3D. 1. **2D Construction**: Consider a rectangle and a triangle in 2D, where the dividing line between them represents the water level. The rectangle represents the part of the polyhedron above the water, and the triangle represents the part below the water. 2. **Dimensions of the Rectangle and Triangle**: - Let the rectangle have dimensions ( k ) and ( 0.5 - k ). - Let the triangle have side lengths ( k ), ( 0.5 - 0.5k ), and ( 0.5 - 0.5k ). 3. **Area Calculation**: - The area of the rectangle is ( k(0.5 - k) ). - The area of the triangle can be calculated using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter ( s ) of the triangle is: [ s = frac{k + (0.5 - 0.5k) + (0.5 - 0.5k)}{2} = frac{k + 1 - k}{2} = 0.5 ] The area ( A ) of the triangle is: [ A = sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} = sqrt{0.5 left(0.5 - kright) left(0.5 - 0.5kright) left(0.5 - 0.5kright)} ] 4. **Limit Analysis**: - We need to show that the ratio of the areas of the rectangle to the triangle approaches zero as ( k ) approaches ( 0.5 ): [ lim_{k to 0.5} frac{k(0.5 - k)}{0.5k sqrt{(0.5 - 0.5k)^2 - (0.5k)^2}} = 0 ] Simplifying the expression inside the square root: [ sqrt{(0.5 - 0.5k)^2 - (0.5k)^2} = sqrt{0.25 - 0.5k + 0.25k^2 - 0.25k^2} = sqrt{0.25 - 0.5k} ] Therefore, the limit becomes: [ lim_{k to 0.5} frac{k(0.5 - k)}{0.5k sqrt{0.25 - 0.5k}} = lim_{k to 0.5} frac{0.5 - k}{0.5 sqrt{0.25 - 0.5k}} = lim_{k to 0.5} frac{0.5 - k}{0.5 sqrt{0.25 - 0.5k}} = 0 ] 5. **Conclusion**: - As ( k ) approaches ( 0.5 ), the area of the rectangle becomes negligible compared to the area of the triangle. - This implies that it is possible to construct a convex polyhedron where 90% of its volume is below the water level while more than half of its surface area is above the water level.

(1) Determine the relationship between a and b. (2) Discuss the monotonicity of the function g(x). (3) Prove that for any n in mathbb{N}^*, the inequality ln(1 + n) > sumlimits_{i=1}^{n} frac{i1}{i^2} holds.","completion":"(1) According to the problem, g(x) = ln x + ax^2 + bx. Then, the derivative of g(x) is g'(x) = frac{1}{x} + 2ax + b. Since the tangent line to the graph of g(x) at the point (1, g(1)) is parallel to the x-axis, we have g'(1) = 0; thus: 1 + 2a + b = 0, which implies that b = -2a - 1. (2) From part (1), g'(x) can be rewritten as: g'(x) = frac{2ax^2 - (2a + 1)x + 1}{x} = frac{(2ax - 1)(x - 1)}{x}. Since the domain of g(x) is (0, +infty), we have two cases: - When a leq 0, 2ax - 1 < 0 always holds on (0, +infty). Therefore, g'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1 and g'(x) < 0 for x > 1. Thus, g(x) is increasing on (0, 1) and decreasing on (1, +infty). - When a > 0, setting g'(x) = 0 gives us x = 1 or x = frac{1}{2a}. Considering three sub-cases based on this: - If frac{1}{2a} < 1 (which means a > frac{1}{2}), then g'(x) > 0 for x > 1 or 0 < x < frac{1}{2a}, and g'(x) < 0 for frac{1}{2a} < x < 1. Thus, g(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{2a}) and (1, +infty), and decreasing on (frac{1}{2a}, 1). - If frac{1}{2a} > 1 (which means 0 < a < frac{1}{2}), then g'(x) > 0 for x > frac{1}{2a} or 0 < x < 1, and g'(x) < 0 for 1 < x < frac{1}{2a}. Thus, g(x) is increasing on (0, 1) and (frac{1}{2a}, +infty), and decreasing on (1, frac{1}{2a}). - If frac{1}{2a} = 1 (which means a = frac{1}{2}), then g'(x) geq 0 for (0, +infty), meaning that g(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). In summary, when a leq 0, the function g(x) is increasing on (0, 1) and decreasing on (1, +infty). When 0 < a < frac{1}{2}, g(x) is increasing on (0, 1) and (frac{1}{2a}, +infty), and decreasing on (1, frac{1}{2a}). When a = frac{1}{2}, g(x) is increasing on (0, +infty), and when a > frac{1}{2}, g(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{2a}) and (1, +infty), and decreasing on (frac{1}{2a}, 1). (3) We provide three methods of proof: - **Proof Method One**: When a = 1, we know that g(x) = ln x + x^2 - 3x is increasing on (1, +infty). Therefore, we have: ln x + x^2 - 3x geq g(1) = -2, which implies: ln x geq -x^2 + 3x - 2 = -(x - 1)(x - 2). Let x = 1 + frac{1}{n}, where n in mathbb{N}^*. Then: ln(1 + frac{1}{n}) > frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n^2}. Adding these inequalities from 1 to n, we obtain: ln(1 + frac{1}{1}) + ln(1 + frac{1}{2}) + ln(1 + frac{1}{3}) + ldots + ln(1 + frac{1}{n}) > left(frac{1}{1} - frac{1}{1^2}right) + left(frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2^2}right) + ldots + left(frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n^2}right). Therefore, by telescoping the series: lnleft(frac{2}{1} times frac{3}{2} times frac{4}{3} times ldots times frac{n + 1}{n}right) > sumlimits_{i=1}^{n} left(frac{i^2 - 1}{i^2}right), we get boxed{ln(1 + n) > sumlimits_{i=1}^{n} frac{i-1}{i^2}}. - **Proof Method Two**: Construct a sequence {a_n} such that the sum of the first n terms, T_n = ln(1 + n). When n geq 2, we have: a_n = T_n - T_{n-1} = lnleft(frac{1 + n}{n}right) = lnleft(1 + frac{1}{n}right), and this expression also holds for a_1 = ln 2. We need to prove that: lnleft(1 + frac{1}{n}right) > frac{n - 1}{n^2} = frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n^2}. Let x = frac{1}{n}. We aim to show that ln(1 + x) - x + x^2 > 0. Denote by h(x) the function h(x) = ln(1 + x) - x + x^2, defined for x > 0. Taking the derivative, we find: h'(x) = frac{1}{1 + x} - 1 + 2x = frac{x(2x + 1)}{1 + x} > 0. Therefore, h(x) is increasing on (0, +infty) and since h(0) = 0, we have that h(x) > 0 for all x > 0. Thus, we conclude that: lnleft(1 + frac{1}{n}right) > frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n^2}, continuing as in Proof Method One. - **Proof Method Three**: Define varphi(n) = ln(1 + n) - sumlimits_{i=1}^{n} frac{i-1}{i^2}. Then, we have: varphi(n + 1) - varphi(n) = ln(n + 2) - frac{n}{(n + 1)^2} - ln(n + 1) = lnleft(1 + frac{1}{n + 1}right) - frac{1}{n + 1} + frac{1}{(n + 1)^2}. Let x = 1 + frac{1}{n + 1} so that x in (1, 2] and frac{1}{n + 1} = x - 1, where n in mathbb{N}^*. Denote by h(x) the function h(x) = ln x - (x - 1) + (x - 1)^2 = ln x + x^2 - 3x + 2. The derivative is: h'(x) = frac{1}{x} + 2x - 3 = frac{(2x - 1)(x - 1)}{x} > 0. Since h(x) is increasing on (1, 2] and h(1) = 0, for x in (1, 2], we have h(x) > 0. Therefore, varphi(n + 1) - varphi(n) > 0, so the sequence varphi(n) is increasing. Additionally, varphi(1) = ln 2 > 0, which leads us to: boxed{ln(1 + n) > sumlimits_{i=1}^{n} frac{i-1}{i^2}}."},{"prompt":"For some constants x and a, the fourth, fifth, and sixth terms in the expansion of (x + a)^n are 210, 462, and 792, respectively.

Thus, combining these elements, we obtain the union set as: P ∪ Q = {1, 2, 3} We ensure that we include each element only once, even though the element 2 appears in both sets.

A: 1 B: 2 C: 4 D: 5","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and expressions involved in the scenario: 1. Let the radius of the circle containing the sector be r. This means the circumference of the entire circle would be 2pi r, but we are only concerned with the sector here. 2. Given that the circumference of the sector is 20, we can express the arc length l of the sector as l = 20 - 2r. This accounts for the arc length and the two radii that make up the sector's boundary, where 0 < r < 10 to ensure the arc length is positive. Next, we find the area of the sector, S, which is given by the formula S = frac{1}{2}rl. Substituting the expression for l from step 2, we get: [S = frac{1}{2}r(20 - 2r) = 10r - r^2] [S = -(r^2 - 10r + 25) + 25 = -(r - 5)^2 + 25] This equation represents a parabola that opens downwards, indicating that the maximum value of S occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex form of a parabola y = a(x - h)^2 + k shows that the maximum area, S_{max}, is achieved when r = 5, leading to: [S_{max} = 25] and the corresponding arc length at this point is l = 20 - 2(5) = 10. Finally, to find the radian measure of the central angle, we use the relationship between the arc length l, the radius r, and the central angle in radians theta, which is theta = frac{l}{r}.

According to the problem, the number obtained by removing the last two digits of ( a^2 ) should also be a perfect square. This number can be expressed as: [ frac{a^2 - c}{100} ] 3. Since both ( a^2 ) and ( frac{a^2 - c}{100} ) are squares, let's denote ( frac{a^2 - c}{100} ) as ( k^2 ) for some integer ( k ). Therefore, we have: [ 100k^2 = a^2 - c ] 4. Rearrange the equation to get: [ a^2 = 100k^2 + c ] 5. Since ( 0 leq c < 100 ), we infer: [ k^2 leq frac{a^2}{100} ] 6. Consider the inequalities representing the difference in squares: [ a^2 - (a-1)^2 leq c < 100 ] Expanding ( (a-1)^2 ): [ a^2 - (a^2 - 2a + 1) = 2a - 1 ] This leads us to: [ 2a - 1 < 100 ] 7.

Since a^2 must be greater than 5 for the foci to be on the x-axis, we can find the distance from the center to the foci (focal length c) by the equation: c = sqrt{a^2 - 5}. Given that the eccentricity e of the ellipse is frac{2}{3}, we can write the equation: e = frac{c}{a} = frac{2}{3}. Substituting the expression for c, we get: frac{sqrt{a^2 - 5}}{a} = frac{2}{3}.

We need to prove that there are infinitely many positive integers ( n ) such that the number of positive divisors of ( 2^n - 1 ) is greater than ( n ). 2. Let's consider numbers of the form ( n = 2^m ) for ( m in mathbb{N} ). We will show that these numbers satisfy the desired condition. 3. Observe that for any ( a in mathbb{N} ), the greatest common divisor of ( 2^a - 1 ) and ( 2^a + 1 ) is 1, i.e., ( (2^a - 1, 2^a + 1) = 1 ). 4. Now consider the number ( 2^{2^m} - 1 ). We can factorize it as follows: [ 2^{2^m} - 1 = (2^{2^{m-1}} - 1)(2^{2^{m-1}} + 1) ] Continuing this factorization, we get: [ 2^{2^m} - 1 = (2^{2^{m-1}} - 1)(2^{2^{m-1}} + 1) = (2^{2^{m-1}} - 1)(2^{2^{m-2}} + 1)(2^{2^{m-2}} - 1) cdots (2^2 + 1)(2^1 + 1)(2^1 - 1) ] 5.

Therefore, the number ( 2^{2^m} - 1 ) has at least ( m ) distinct prime divisors. 7. The number of positive divisors of a number with ( m ) distinct prime factors is at least ( 2^m ). This is because the total number of divisors of a number ( n ) with prime factorization ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ) is given by ( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1) ). If each ( e_i geq 1 ), then the number of divisors is at least ( 2^k ). 8. Since not all numbers of the form ( 2^a + 1 ) are prime, we must have at least one more distinct positive divisor, which means we must have more than ( 2^m ) positive divisors. 9. Since ( 2^m > m ) for all ( m geq 1 ), it follows that the number of positive divisors of ( 2^{2^m} - 1 ) is greater than ( 2^m ), and hence greater than ( m ). 10.

That is, [ (A+B)^k leq 2^{k-1} left(A^k + B^k right) ] We need to show that: [ (A+B)^{k+1} leq 2^k left(A^{k+1} + B^{k+1} right) ] 3. **Expanding and Using the Induction Hypothesis:** Start by using the binomial expansion for (A+B)^{k+1}: [ (A+B)^{k+1} = (A+B)(A+B)^k ] By the induction hypothesis: [ (A+B)^k leq 2^{k-1} left(A^k + B^kright) ] Thus, [ (A+B)^{k+1} leq (A+B) cdot 2^{k-1} left(A^k + B^k right) ] Distributing (A+B) inside the parentheses: [ (A+B)^{k+1} leq 2^{k-1} left(A^{k+1} + AB^k + BA^k + B^{k+1}right) ] 4. **Using the Symmetric Property and Inequalities:** Note that the terms AB^k and BA^k can be treated symmetrically.

Therefore, the total cost under option 1 is: [20 times 300 + (x - 20) times 50 = 6000 + 50x - 1000 = 50x + 5000 , text{yuan}] So, the amount the customer needs to pay under option 1 is boxed{50x + 5000 , text{yuan}}. Part 2: Calculating the Cost with Option 2 For option 2, where both the amplifier and the page-turning pen are priced at 90% of their regular price, the cost calculation is as follows: - The discounted price for 20 amplifiers is 300 times 90% times 20 yuan. - The discounted price for x page-turning pens is 50 times 90% times x yuan. Therefore, the total cost under option 2 is: [300 times 0.9 times 20 + 50 times 0.9 times x = 5400 + 45x , text{yuan}] So, the amount the customer needs to pay under option 2 is boxed{45x + 5400 , text{yuan}}. Part 3: Determining the Most Cost-Effective Option when x=30 When x=30, we calculate the cost for each option: - **Option 1**: 50 times 30 + 5000 = 6500 yuan. - **Option 2**: 45 times 30 + 5400 = 6750 yuan. **Option 3**: A combination of options for a more cost-effective purchase: 1. Buy 20 amplifiers and get 20 page-turning pens for free, costing 20 times 300 = 6000 yuan. 2. Purchase the remaining 10 page-turning pens under option 2 for 10 times 50 times 90% = 450 yuan. The total cost under option 3 is 6000 + 450 = 6450 yuan. Comparing the costs: 6450 < 6500 < 6750, it's clear that option 3 is the most cost-effective. Therefore, the most cost-effective purchasing method when x=30 is boxed{text{Option 3, costing 6450 yuan}}."},{"prompt":"Prove that for a right triangle, (0.4 < frac{r}{h} < 0.5), where (h) is the altitude dropped from the vertex of the right angle.","completion":"To prove that for a right-angled triangle, ( 0.4 < frac{r}{h} < 0.5 ), where ( h ) is the height drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse ( c ), we proceed as follows: 1. **Relate the area to the sides and the radius**: The area ( S ) of the right-angled triangle can be expressed in two ways.

Also, since: [ alpha^2 + beta^2 = (alpha + beta)^2 - 2alpha beta ] and given: [ alpha + beta + a = 3, ; alphabeta a = -1, ] we find: [ alpha^2 + beta^2 = (3 - a)^2 - 2 frac{alpha beta}{a} ] Using ( alpha beta = frac{-1}{a}), we have: [ alpha^2 + beta^2 = (3 - a)^2 + frac{2}{a} ] Substituting and simplifying: [ frac{2 left(-3a^2 + 1right)}{a} + 9 + a^2 = 9 - a^2 ] Given (a > 2sqrt{2}), it is clear (8 - a^2 < 0).

By mathematical induction, (nu_n) is an integer for all (n). Hence: [ a^n = nu_n - (alpha^n + beta^n) ] Since (0 < alpha^n + beta^n < 1), we conclude: [ left[a^nright] = nu_n - 1 ] 9.

Therefore, angle AYX = angle YAX = t^circ. 2. **Angle AXY in triangle AXY**: The sum of angles in any triangle is 180^circ, so for triangle AXY, we have angle AXY + 2t^circ = 180^circ. This gives us angle AXY = 180^circ - 2t^circ. 3. **Angle BXY**: Angles angle AXY and angle BXY are supplementary as they form a straight line.

(Ⅰ) Let the number of Type A employees be x and the number of Type B employees be (150 - x). Let the total monthly basic wage expenditure of the company be y thousand yuan.

The total monthly basic wage expenditure can be written as: y = 2x + 3(150 - x) = 450 - x To minimize y, we set x to its maximum value within the allowed range, which is x = 100. The minimum total monthly basic wage expenditure is: y_{min} = 450 - 100 = 350 Hence, the company should recruit 100 employees of Type A and 50 employees of Type B in order to minimize the total monthly basic wage expenditure.

(ii) If Delta = 0, meaning a^2 = 4b, there is exactly one positive real root for the equation, which is x = frac{a}{2b}.

We need to analyze the divisors of ( n ) to determine the constraints and maximize the number of such divisors. 2. **Divisor Conditions**: - For any divisor ( d equiv 1 pmod{3} ): - Adding 2 results in ( d+2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ). - Since ( d+2 ) is prime, it must be 3. - This means ( d = 1 ). 3. **Prime Factor Constraint**: - Now, consider two different prime numbers ( p ) and ( q neq 3 ) dividing ( n ): - Since both ( p ) and ( q ) must satisfy ( p+2 ) and ( q+2 ) being prime, ( p equiv q equiv 2 pmod{3} ) (because ( 2 pmod{3} + 2 = 4 equiv 1 pmod{3} ) which is not prime except for 3). - The product ( pq equiv 2 cdot 2 = 4 equiv 1 pmod{3} ), leading to a contradiction as: - This implies ( pq ) cannot divide ( n ), so ( n ) must be of the form ( 3^k ) or ( 3^k cdot p ), where ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ). 4. **Divisor Count Analysis**: - ( n ) must thus be of the form ( 3^k p^alpha ) where ( k in mathbb{N} ) and ( alpha in {0, 1} ). - The divisor function ( sigma_0(n) ) for such ( n ) is ( (k+1)(alpha + 1) ). 5. **Bound on k**: - Since ( 3^5 + 2 = 245 ) is not prime, ( k leq 4 ). - For ( alpha = 0 ), this results in ( sigma_0(n) = k+1 leq 5 ). - If ( alpha = 1 ) and ( k leq 3 ), then ( sigma_0(n) leq 2(k+1) leq 8 ). 6. **Absurdity Method**: - To show ( (k, alpha) = (4, 1) ) is impossible: - Assume ( n = 3^4 cdot p = 81p ). - Evaluating ( 3^4 cdot 5 + 2 = 407 = 11 times 37 ) implies ( p neq 5 ). - Check the prime status: - Since ( 3^2 equiv -1 pmod{5} ), 3 is of order 4 modulo 5. - There must exist ( ell ) between 1 and 4 such that ( 3^ell equiv -2p^{-1} pmod{5} ). - ( 3^ell p + 2 ) cannot be prime. 7. **Conclusion**: - Hence, ( sigma_0(n) leq 8 ). - Verify if ( n=3^3 times 5 = 135 ) is sympathique: - Divisors: ( 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 27, 45, 135 ). - Check ( d+2 ): ( 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 29, 47, 137 ). - All are primes.

Thus, by reversing the representation, we ensure that: [ n text{ is a sum of distinct } a_i ] 6. **Bijection Argument**: By constructing the above mappings, we can show a one-to-one correspondence between the two forms of partitioning (n).

Consider the expression (2n+1)^n. Using the binomial theorem, we can approximate this expression: (2n+1)^n = left(2n + 1right)^n For large n, we will expand this around 2n. 2. Make a binomial expansion for (2n + 1)^n. However, since the standard binomial theorem provides an exact form, the approximation might be more interpretable using simpler expansions. Hence, we will use the approximation: (2n + 1)^n approx left(2nright)^n left(1 + frac{1}{2n}right)^n Using the limit approximation for small values of frac{1}{2n} and the binomial expansion: left(1 + frac{1}{2n}right)^n approx e^{frac{n}{2n}} = e^{frac{1}{2}} 3. Therefore: (2n + 1)^n approx (2n)^n e^{frac{1}{2}} Since ((2n)^n) is very large, even a small factor like (e^{frac{1}{2}}) will have a significant impact. 4. Consider the left-hand side (2n - 1)^n + (2n)^n. Notice that ((2n-1)^n) is significantly smaller in comparison to ((2n)^n). Still, we need to show: (2n - 1)^n + (2n)^n < (2n + 1)^n approx (2n)^n e^{frac{1}{2}} 5. Instead, reformulate the comparison directly (for clarity, we will restate the transformed logarithmic behavior): logleft((2n-1)^n + (2n)^nright) < logleft((2n)^n e^{frac{1}{2}}right) Simplify: logleft((2n)^nleft(1 + left(frac{2n-1}{2n}right)^nright)right)< n log(2n) + frac{1}{2} 6. We know that: left(frac{2n-1}{2n}right)^n = left(1 - frac{1}{2n}right)^n approx e^{-frac{1}{2}} for large n. Hence: logleft((2n)^nright) + logleft(1 + e^{-frac{1}{2}}right) approx nlog(2n) + -frac{1}{2} Since 1 + e^{-frac{1}{2}} is slightly larger than 1, but the frac{1}{2} factor in the exponential term argumentation ensures that the left side is strictly less than the approximation above. # Conclusion: Thus, we conclude that: (2n-1)^n + (2n)^n < (2n + 1)^n for any natural number n > 2.

This implies that the function is symmetric about the line x=2. Let's analyze the implications of this symmetry: 1. **Symmetry and Vertex**: The symmetry about x=2 means that the vertex of the parabola defined by f(x) is at x=2. This is because the vertex of a parabola is always located on its axis of symmetry. 2. **Direction of the Parabola**: - If a > 0, the parabola opens upwards. This means that the vertex, located at x=2, represents the minimum value of f(x). - If a < 0, the parabola opens downwards. In this case, the vertex still at x=2 represents the maximum value of f(x). 3. **Evaluating the Options**: - **f(-1)**: This value is symmetrically opposite to f(5) about the line x=2. Depending on the value of a, either could be the smallest or largest, but not the one that cannot be the smallest. - **f(1)**: This value is not on the vertex and is not symmetrically paired with any of the other given options. Its value relative to f(2) depends on the direction of the parabola. - **f(2)**: Being the vertex, this could be the smallest value when a > 0. - **f(5)**: Symmetrically opposite to f(-1), sharing the same reasoning. Given the symmetry and the direction of the parabola, we can conclude that: - When a > 0, f(2) is guaranteed to be the smallest among the given options because it is the vertex and the parabola opens upwards. - When a < 0, either f(-1) or f(5) could be the smallest as they are on the \\"ends\\" of the parabola, which opens downwards. Therefore, the one value that cannot be the smallest among f(-1), f(1), f(2), and f(5), considering the symmetry and direction of the parabola, is f(1).

We have an inscribed quadrilateral ABCD, and the extensions of its opposite sides intersect at points P and Q. Let K and N be the midpoints of the diagonals AC and BD, respectively. 1. Consider triangles ACP and BDP. Since angle CPA and angle CPB both subtend the same arc CB on the circumcircle of ABCD, it follows that angle CPA = angle CPB. Additionally, the triangles ACP and BDP share the common angle at P. 2. By the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion, triangles ACP and BDP are similar. Consequently, the corresponding medians from vertices A and B to points K and N in these triangles will also create similar sub-triangles ANP and BKP. 3. Since the triangles ANP and BKP are similar, we know that their corresponding angles are equal, which implies angle ANP = angle BKP. 4. Similarly, consider triangles ACQ and DBQ.

Notice that each 1x3 rectangle will always contain exactly one red, one blue, and one green square. This is because of the repeating pattern of the colors. 4. **Counting the Colors**: Initially, the board has: - 6 red squares - 6 blue squares - 4 green squares 5. **Invariance**: Each move changes the color of one red, one blue, and one green square. Therefore, the number of red, blue, and green squares will always change by the same amount. This means that the difference in the number of red, blue, and green squares remains invariant. 6. **Impossibility of Equalizing Colors**: Since the initial number of red, blue, and green squares are not equal (6 red, 6 blue, and 4 green), and each move changes one of each color, it is impossible to make all squares black. This is because making all squares black would require an equal number of red, blue, and green squares to be flipped an equal number of times, which is not possible given the initial unequal distribution. Therefore, it is not possible to make all the 1x1 squares black after several moves. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the function ( f(x) = kx^2 + kx + 1 ) has a maximum value of 4 in the interval ([2, 2]), the value of the real number ( k ) is ( ) A.

The GCD will give us the largest square size that can be used to tile the board perfectly. The board measures 77 cm by 93 cm. Let's find the GCD of 77 and 93.

Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from step 1. 3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. The non-zero remainder just before this is the GCD. Let's apply this to 77 and 93: 93 ÷ 77 gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 16 (since 93 = 77 * 1 + 16). Now we replace the larger number (93) with the smaller number (77), and the smaller number (77) with the remainder (16), and repeat the process: 77 ÷ 16 gives us a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 9 (since 77 = 16 * 4 + 9). Now we replace 77 with 16 and 16 with 9: 16 ÷ 9 gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 7 (since 16 = 9 * 1 + 7). Now we replace 16 with 9 and 9 with 7: 9 ÷ 7 gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2 (since 9 = 7 * 1 + 2).

The octahedron has edges of length 1. 2. **Unfolding the Octahedron**: The net of a regular octahedron consists of eight equilateral triangles, grouped into two square pyramids base-to-base. 3. **Identifying Midpoints and Vertices**: The midpoint divides an edge into two segments, each of length frac{1}{2}. Each vertex connects to four edges. 4. **Shortest Path Configuration**: A practical unfolding for the shortest path calculation involves considering the pyramid structure. The insect starting at the midpoint of an edge on one of the bottom triangles can move directly upward to the apex of the pyramid (a vertex of the octahedron). 5. **Calculating the Path Length**: To reach the closest vertex on the same pyramid, the insect would travel a straight line segment from the midpoint to the apex of the pyramid. This segment is perpendicular to the base edge, forming a right triangle with the half-edge and the line segment as legs. Each base edge of the triangle in the net is 1, so the vertex-to-midpoint distance (height) in an equilateral triangle is: [ h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} text{ (since the full height for side 1 is }frac{sqrt{3}}{2}text{)} ] Therefore, the shortest path is simply frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.

Consider the shaded regions 1, 2, and 8 in the given figure, each containing 5 segments (Figure 19). 3. The polygonal chain that intersects each segment exactly once must both enter and exit each of these shaded regions at least once. 4. Conceptually, this polygonal chain can be considered as entering and exiting the regions via the boundary segments. Therefore, each entry and exit point counts as one intersection with a boundary segment. 5. However, since each shaded region (especially those three regions) contains an odd number of boundary segments (5 segments per region), the polygonal chain must intersect an odd number of times. 6. A fundamental property in graph theory, known as the Handshaking Lemma, states that the number of vertices with an odd degree in a graph is even — thus the total number of times the polygonal chain would enter and exit must be even. 7. Since these regions each must be crossed an odd number of times, having three such regions implies that the total number of crossings is odd, which contradicts the requirement of even total crossings implied by the chain having distinct starting and ending points.

Thus, u_1 = 0 and u_2 = 0. Hence, the sequence will be zero immediately. - If n=3, then 0 leqslant u_1, u_2 < 2. Therefore, either u_1 or u_2 must be zero, or u_3 must be zero because u_3 = |u_2 - u_1|. 4. **Inductive Step**: - Let n geq 4 be any integer such that the property holds for n-1 and n-2. We consider u_1, u_2 in llbracket 0, F_n - 1 rrbracket. - If u_1, u_2 < F_{n-1}, by the induction hypothesis, we conclude that there exists a k such that u_k = 0. - If F_{n-1} leqslant u_1, u_2 < F_n, we get: [ |u_2 - u_1| < F_n - F_{n-1} = F_{n-2}. ] Thus, u_3 and u_4 will be smaller than F_{n-2}. The further terms will be smaller than the sequence (u) starting with u_3 and u_4, and by the induction hypothesis, there exists k in llbracket 2, n rrbracket such that u_k = 0. - If u_1 < F_{n-1} leqslant u_2 < F_n, we consider two sub-cases: - If u_3 < F_{n-1}, the following terms will be smaller than those of the sequence starting with u_1 and u_3, which are both smaller than F_{n-1}.

From the equation m^2 = 3n^2, we can see that m^2 is divisible by 3, which implies that m is also divisible by 3 (because the square of a non-multiple of 3 cannot be a multiple of 3). Let's write m as m = 3p where p is a positive integer. Substituting m into the equation m^2 = 3n^2 gives us: (3p)^2 = 3n^2 Longrightarrow 9p^2 = 3n^2 Longrightarrow 3p^2 = n^2.

I. Solution: 1. **Understanding the Tangential Quadrilateral Property**: - For a quadrilateral to be tangential, it must satisfy the condition: AB + CD = BC + AD. 2. **Selecting the Reference Point**: - Without loss of generality, we assume AB geq BC. In the special case where AB = BC, it is obvious that point D must be directly opposite to point B. - If AB < BC, the point D will be such that DA > DC. 3. **Measurement and Calculation**: - Consider DA = DP + CD such that DP is a segment to be measured. \`\`\`math AP = AD - DP = AD - CD = AB - BC \`\`\` 4. **Construction of the Isosceles Triangle**: - The triangle CDP is isosceles with the exterior angle at D equal to angle ABC = beta, because ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore, angle CPD = beta / 2. - Consequently, in triangle APC, we know AP and AC, and the angle opposite to AC is: \`\`\`math angle APC = 180^circ - frac{beta}{2} \`\`\` 5. **Circle Construction**: - P lies on the circle k_1 centered at A with radius AP, and also on the circle i subtended by angle A C = 180^circ - beta / 2, lying on the side opposite to B. - From the center of circle i, we observe AC at an angle of 2 cdot CPD = beta, thus determining the center point E.

II. Solution: 1. **Constructing the Inscribed Circle**: - Finding the center O of the inscribed circle k^*. Knowing AB, BC, and the angles, we can draw the tangents to intersect k from point A. - Center O lies on the bisectors of angles angle ABC and angle DCB.

The magnitude of overrightarrow{a} + 3overrightarrow{b} is then calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: |overrightarrow{a} + 3overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{7^2 + 3^2} = sqrt{49 + 9} = sqrt{58}.

For overrightarrow{a} - koverrightarrow{b} to be parallel to overrightarrow{a} + 3overrightarrow{b}, the components must be proportional, which means there exists a scalar lambda such that: (1-2k,-k) = lambda(7,3). Comparing components, we get two equations: 1-2k = 7lambda quad text{and} quad -k = 3lambda. Dividing the first equation by the second one to eliminate lambda gives us: frac{1-2k}{-k} = frac{7lambda}{3lambda} implies frac{1}{k} - 2 = frac{7}{3}.

To find the relative speed, we subtract the speed of the man from the speed of the train: Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of man Relative speed = 63 km/hr - 3 km/hr Relative speed = 60 km/hr Now we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s to match the time given in seconds.

Clearly, the decimal representation of ( m_1^2 = 1 ) consists of 1 one, fulfilling the condition for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the number ( m_n ) has been constructed such that its decimal representation ends with one and the representation of ( m_n^2 ) ends with a combination of ( n ) ones and twos. 3. **Construction of ( m_{n+1} )**: Consider numbers of the form ( p_k = m_n + k cdot 10^n ), where ( k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 9 ). Each ( p_k ) ends with the digit 1 because ( m_n ) ends with 1.

Therefore, the combination of digits in ( p_k^2 ) will affect only the last ( n+1 ) digits, which contains the digits from ( m_n^2 ) and possibly the influence of ( 2k ). 5. **Selection of ( k )**: - Let ( a ) be the ((n+1))-th digit from the end of ( m_n^2 ). The digit ( a + 2k mod 10 ) can cover all possible digits when ( k in {0, 1, 2, dots, 9}). - Select ( k ) such that the resulting digit is a part of the combination consisting of ( n+1 ) ones and twos. 6. **Inductive Conclusion**: Thus, there exists a ( k ) such that the decimal representation of ( p_k^2 ) ends with the required pattern.

Part 2: Determining the Shape of triangle ABC To determine the shape of triangle ABC, we check the dot product of overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC}: overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{AC} = (-1) times (-2) + (-1) times 2 = 2 - 2 = 0. The dot product being zero implies that overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC} are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at vertex A. In summary, overrightarrow{AB} = boxed{(-1, -1)}, overrightarrow{AC} = boxed{(-2, 2)}, overrightarrow{BC} = boxed{(-1, 3)}, and triangle ABC is a boxed{text{right-angled triangle}}."},{"prompt":"worker ' s daily wage is increased by 40 % and the new wage is 35 per day . what was the worker ' s daily wage before the increase ?","completion":"Let's call the worker's original daily wage \\"W.\\" The worker's wage was increased by 40%, which means the new wage is 140% of the original wage.

In this case, the existential statement claims that there exists at least one real number x_0 such that its base-2 logarithm is less than or equal to zero. 2. The negation of an existential statement is a universal statement. This means we deny the existence of such an object by claiming that no object in the domain satisfies the property. 3.

Denote the set of participants by ( P ). 2. **Building a Sequence**: We start arranging the participants in a sequence such that every participant in the sequence is acquainted with their immediate neighbors in the sequence. This sequence-building process will eventually involve all participants. 3. **Completion of the Sequence**: Assume that the process ends after constructing a segment where each participant except the last is placed in the sequence. Denote the last participant added to the sequence as ( A ), and let ( B ) and ( C ) be two of the participants in the sequence who are acquainted with ( A ) but are not adjacent to ( A ) in the current linear arrangement. 4. **Analysis of Positions**: Consider the relative positions of ( A ) and its friends ( B ) and ( C ) in the sequence. There are a few cases to analyze: - If ( A ) and ( B ) (or ( A ) and ( C )) are separated by an even number of participants, then these participants, together with ( A ) and ( B ) (or ( A ) and ( C )), form the desired even-sized group. This is because the connections ensure each participant knows their immediate neighbors in the round setup. 5. **Both Distances Even**: Suppose that both distances of ( A ) to ( B ) and ( A ) to ( C ) are even. In this case, the number of participants between ( B ) and ( C ) must be odd. Consequently, together with ( A ) and ( C ), as well as all participants between ( B ) and ( C ), they form the desired group with even number relationships around the table ensuring acquaintance with immediate neighbors. 6. **Conclusion**: We demonstrated that such an arrangement is always possible under the given conditions, guaranteeing that we can always form such a group, sitting around a table, satisfying the required conditions.

To find the probability that two randomly chosen diagonals intersect inside the hexagon, we start by calculating the total number of pairs of diagonals. 2. The number of ways to choose 2 diagonals from 9 is given by the combination formula: [ binom{9}{2} = frac{9 cdot 8}{2 cdot 1} = 36 ] 3. Next, we determine how many pairs of diagonals intersect inside the hexagon. Diagonals in a convex hexagon can be of two types: main diagonals (diagonals that connect opposite vertices) and non-main diagonals (all other diagonals). 4. Specifically: - There are (3) main diagonals in a hexagon, since we can identify three pairs of opposite vertices. - There are (6) non-main diagonals. 5.

Consequently, it is not possible for a finite product of (n) factors to cover all positive integers through an arithmetic progression unless some (d_i) are composite numbers with shared prime factors. This contradicts our assumption that the number of distinct primes is strictly increasing. 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. - Hence, there exists some (1 leq k leq n) and (1 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_k ) such that: [ f(d_{i_1} d_{i_2} cdots d_{i_k}) leq k - 1 ] (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Please fill in the numbers 09 into the following six equations to make them correct: 1. 20 times quad 8 = 20 2. quad div 2 + 17 = 20 3. quad times quad 4 = 20 4. quad + 8) div 12 = quad 5. 4 times quad = 20 6. 20 times quad ) = 100","completion":"To solve the given problem, we need to fill in the blanks with numbers from 0 to 9 such that the following equations are satisfied. 1.

Consequently, gcd(a, a+5) must also divide the difference (a+5) - a = 5. Therefore, gcd(a, a+5) can only take the values 1 or 5. 3. The same property holds for b. Hence, gcd(b, b+5) can only be 1 or 5. 4. Noticing that operatorname{LCM}(a, a+5)= operatorname{LCM}(b, b+5) implies gcd(a, a+5) = gcd(b, b+5) (because operatorname{LCM}(m, n) times gcd(m, n) = m times n for any integers m and n), we consider both possible values of the gcd. 5.

Let ( k = 2^l ), and ( log_2(n) = m > l ).

Clearly, this ( k ) will also work for ( c = 2 ) as ( n^{epsilon} > 4 log_2(n) > 2 log_2(n) ). 5. **Prime Power Analysis:** Assume such a set ( S ) exists. For any ( x, y in S ), let ( b(x, y) ) denote the maximal prime ( p ) such that ( xy ) is a perfect ( p )-th power. By definition, this value always exists. Notice that given ( b(x, y) = p ): [ xy geq 2^p implies n^2 geq 2^p implies p leq 2 log_2(n) ] By the pigeonhole principle, each value ( x in S ) has a prime ( p ) which appears more than ( n^{frac{1}{2}-epsilon} ) times as the first element of each pair in ( A_x ). 6. **Subset Construction and Equivalence Classes:** Choose the entire set of ( y in S ) whose pair in the multiset has ( p ) as its first element.

Hence, ( n^{frac{1}{p}} ) is greater than this intersection, a subset of which is our set of ( y ). Since ( n^{frac{1}{p}} > |y| > n^{frac{1}{2}-epsilon} > n^{frac{1}{3}} ), clearly ( p < 3 ), hence ( p = 2 ). 8. **Contradiction and Final Conclusion:** Assume there exists another ( x' in S ) such that ( x' ) is not in the set of ( y ). Since ( b(x, x') ) must be a prime ( p' neq p ), there exist other primes as the first term of elements in ( A_x ). Suppose the size of this set of ( y ) is less or equal to ( frac{|S|}{2} ). In that case, we may choose another prime ( q neq p ) with ( epsilon < frac{1}{6} ) and ( c = 4 ) (n works as defined) to get the property that there are more than ( n^{frac{1}{2}-epsilon} ) in the set of ( z in S ) with first term ( q ), by using pigeonhole on the remaining half of ( S ), not in ( y ). Since this would imply ( q = 2 ) after the same logic as above, reaching a contradiction, it follows that the size of the set of ( y ) is more than ( frac{|S|}{2} ). Let the construction of the set of ( y ) for ( x' ) be the set of ( y' ). Since if the product of two numbers is a perfect square (( p=2 )) then they are in the same equivalence class modulo ( mathbb{Q}^2 ) as ( 0 equiv alpha_i + beta_i equiv alpha_i - beta_i mod 2 ) for ( x = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} ldots p_s^{alpha_s}, y = p_1^{beta_1} p_2^{beta_2} ldots p_s^{beta_s} ), hence ( x' ) itself is also inside the set of ( y' ). Since nothing in particular was assumed of ( x ), it also follows that the size of the set of ( y' ) is ( > frac{|S|}{2} ), so the set of ( y ) and the set of ( y' ) cannot be disjoint subsets of ( |S| ), so let the shared element be ( g ). Assume the set of ( y ) is not equal to the set of ( y' ), then there is an element in ( y ) not in ( y' ) or an element in ( y' ) not in ( y ). Call this element ( h ). Then since ( h ) is equivalent to ( g ) using one set's property and also not equivalent to ( g ) using the other set's property when modulo ( mathbb{Q}^p ). By contradiction, the set of ( y ) and the set of ( y' ) are the same set, which gives us a contradiction as ( x' ) is in the set of ( y ). Therefore since the set of ( y ) is a subset of the set of ( S ) and there is no element in ( S ) not in the set of ( y ), the two sets are equal. This implies the entirety of ( S ) is equivalent modulo ( mathbb{Q}^2 ). Using our previous result that this implies ( |S| ) is less than or equal to the size of the intersection of the set of perfect squares with ( [n] ), this means ( |S| leq lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ), giving us a contradiction. Thus, for all ( n > k ) from ( epsilon < frac{1}{6}, c = 4 ), no such set ( S ) exists. To be specific, no such ( S ) exists for ( n > 2^{576} ). Therefore the numbers ( n ) for which ( S ) exists must be integers in the interval ( [1, 2^{576}] ), so there are only finitely many values of ( n ).

Given that factorials contain many factors of 2, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5.

This is because each factor of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, each factor of 125 contributes yet another, and so on. - For any integer ( n ), the number of factors of 5 in ( n! ) is given by the formula: [ leftlfloor frac{n}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{25} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{125} rightrfloor + cdots ] 3. **Sum Factors of 5 for Each Factorial ( k! )**: - We compute this for each ( k! ) where ( k ) ranges from 1 to 100. - Summing these contributions will give the total number of trailing zeros in the entire product. 4. **Detailed Calculation**: - For ( 1! ): [ leftlfloor frac{1}{5} rightrfloor = 0 ] - For ( 2! ): [ leftlfloor frac{2}{5} rightrfloor = 0 ] - For ( 3! ): [ leftlfloor frac{3}{5} rightrfloor = 0 ] - Continue similarly for each factorial until ( 100! ).

We are tasked with finding the number of shortest paths that an ant can take from point A to point B, traveling along the edges of the cube. 1. **Identify the Shortest Path Criteria**: The shortest path between A and B will always involve traversing three edges (one along each dimension: x, y, and z), since each edge of the cube corresponds to one unit of distance. 2. **Calculate the Number of Possible Paths**: The shortest path necessarily involves: - Moving from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0) (along the x-axis). - Then from (1,0,0) to (1,1,0) (along the y-axis). - Finally, from (1,1,0) to (1,1,1) (along the z-axis). However, the sequences in which these moves occur can vary: - Each move has equal weight (distance of 1), and can occur in any order. 3. **Permutations of Moves**: The total number of distinct sequences (paths) is essentially the number of permutations of the three moves (one along each axis): [ text{Total permutations} = text{number of permutations of 3 moves} = 3! = 6 ] Thus, all shortest paths from A to B involve exactly three edges and can occur in 3! = 6 different sequences.

How many different arrangements are there if at least one of the two daytime spots, A and B, must be chosen? 2. How many different arrangements are there if the two daytime spots, A and B, are to be visited on the same day? 3. How many different arrangements are there if the two daytime spots, A and B, are not to be chosen at the same time?","completion":"1. To find the number of different arrangements where at least one of the two daytime spots, A and B, must be chosen, we consider the following scenarios: - Choose either A or B, but not both. Since we have 2 spots to choose from, and we want only 1, there is binom{2}{1} way. For the remaining 4 spots, we choose from the 8 spots that are not A or B, which is binom{8}{4} ways. Hence, there are binom{2}{1} times binom{8}{4} arrangements. - Choose both A and B, and then choose 3 more spots from the remaining 8 spots, which is binom{2}{2} times binom{8}{3} arrangements. So, the total number of arrangements is: binom{2}{1} times binom{8}{4} + binom{2}{2} times binom{8}{3} = 2 times 70 + 1 times 56 = 140 + 56 = 196 However, since the itinerary includes 3 different time periods for the first day and 2 for the second day, we need to multiply this by the permutations of 3 times from the first day and 2 times from the second day, which is 3! times 2! = 6 times 2 = 12. Therefore, the total number of different arrangements is: 196 times 12 = 2352 [ boxed{2352} ] 2. For A and B to be visited on the same day, we have two scenarios - they are visited on the first day or the second day. - First day: We have 3 spots to fill for the first day and 2 spots for the second day. If A and B are both on the first day, we have binom{3}{2} ways to choose their slots, and binom{8}{3} ways to fill the rest of spots. Then, binom{8}{2} ways to fill the second day. - Second day: If A and B are on the second day, we have binom{2}{2} ways to choose their slots (only one way since they take both spots), and binom{8}{3} ways to fill the first day. Therefore, the total arrangements are: left(binom{3}{2} times binom{8}{3} times binom{8}{2}right) + left(binom{2}{2} times binom{8}{3}right) = left(3 times 56 times 28right) + left(1 times 56right) = left(4704right) + 56 = 4760 However, this counts the specific slots for the days. Since the spots can be visited on any of the 3 time periods for the first day and either of the 2 time periods for the second day, we need to account for the different permutations for each day. Therefore, we multiply by 3! for the first day and 2! for the second day. For the second scenario where both are on the second day, we only need to multiply by 3! for the first day since there is only one way for the second day: 4704 times 6 + 56 times 6 = 28224 + 336 = 28560 This result considers the permutations for the specific times of the day. If both spots are visited on different days, no further multiplication is necessary, as their order within the day does not matter (since they are visited on different days). So the final number of arrangements is: [ boxed{28560} ] 3. For A and B not to be chosen at the same time, we subtract the number of ways they can be chosen together from the total number of ways to choose 5 spots without restriction. The total ways to choose 5 spots without restriction is: binom{10}{5} = 252 Now, the ways A and B can be chosen together are: binom{2}{2} times binom{8}{3} = 1 times 56 = 56 So the number of ways where A and B are not chosen at the same time is: 252 - 56 = 196 Again, considering the different time spots, we will have to multiply 196 by 3! times 2! which is 12: 196 times 12 = 2352 [ boxed{2352} ]"},{"prompt":"On Monday, David produces ( w ) widgets per hour and works for ( t ) hours.

This is a geometric property resulting from the fact that a tetrahedron can be interpreted as a bounded polyhedron composed of 4 triangular faces, each contributing to the total curvature. 2. **Distribution of Plane Angles**: Since the sum of all plane angles (angles between two faces at an edge) at each vertex of the tetrahedron must total 4pi, averaging these angles across the four vertices suggests that at least one vertex must have a relatively small sum of plane angles due to the nature of averages. More precisely, denote the plane angles at a specific vertex by alpha, beta, and gamma. 3. **Bounding by pi**: If we assume that the sum of plane angles at each vertex is exactly 4pi and distribute these evenly, one would expect: [ alpha + beta + gamma leq pi ] This conclusion comes from repartitioning the 4pi sum such that no single vertex exceeds pi in contributing to the overall sum. 4. **Acute Angles**: Assume alpha is not acute (i.e., alpha geq frac{pi}{2} if it isn't sharp, it is geq right angle). Then the surplus angle alpha, when added with the other two angles beta, gamma which always must be ≤ alpha, leads to: [ alpha + beta + gamma leq pi ] Given alpha geq frac{pi}{2}, this inequality can often breach pi without special constraints.

Through government support in developing animal husbandry, the household's average annual per capita net income increased to 5000 yuan by 2020, successfully lifting them out of poverty.

Let the annual average growth rate of the household's average annual per capita net income be x. This means that each year, the income grows by a factor of (1+x). 2. Given that the income increased from 3200 yuan in 2018 to 5000 yuan in 2020, we can model this as 3200(1+x)^2 = 5000, where 2 represents the two years from 2018 to 2020. 3. Solving for x, we rearrange the equation: (1+x)^2 = frac{5000}{3200} = frac{5}{3.2} = frac{25}{16}. 4. Taking the square root of both sides, we find 1+x = sqrt{frac{25}{16}} = frac{5}{4}. 5. Solving for x, we get x = frac{5}{4} - 1 = frac{1}{4} = 25% for the feasible solution. The other solution x = -frac{9}{4} is discarded as an annual growth rate cannot be negative in this context. Therefore, the annual average growth rate of the household's average annual per capita net income is boxed{25%}. Part 2: Projecting Income for 2021 1. To find out if the household's income can reach 6200 yuan by the end of 2021, we apply the growth rate to the income of 2020: 5000(1+25%) = 5000(1+frac{1}{4}) = 5000 cdot frac{5}{4} = 6250. 2.

According to the problem, Sarah drove the first quarter of her trip on a highway, the next 15 miles through a town, and the remaining one-third on a country road. This can be expressed as: [ frac{x}{4} + 15 + frac{x}{3} = x ] 3. To simplify the equation, find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 4 and 3 is 12. Rewrite the fractions with this common denominator: [ frac{3x}{12} + 15 + frac{4x}{12} = x ] 4. Combine the fractions: [ frac{3x + 4x}{12} + 15 = x ] [ frac{7x}{12} + 15 = x ] 5.

When the man swims downstream, his effective speed is the sum of his speed and the speed of the stream (( V_m + V_s )). When he swims upstream, his effective speed is the difference between his speed and the speed of the stream (( V_m - V_s )). We are given that the man swims 30 km downstream in 5 hours. So, we can write the equation for downstream as: [ (V_m + V_s) times 5 = 30 ] Now, let's denote the distance the man swims upstream as ( D_u ). We know that it takes him 5 hours to swim this distance upstream.

The problem also states that on Tuesday, she had 5 more bags than she had on Monday. This can be expressed as M + 5. Since both expressions represent the number of bags she had on Tuesday, we can set them equal to each other: M + 12 = M + 5 To find the number of bags she had on Monday, we need to solve for M. We can do this by subtracting M from both sides of the equation: M + 12 - M = M + 5 - M This simplifies to: 12 = 5 This doesn't make sense because we know that the number of bags on Tuesday is greater than the number on Monday. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement. The problem states that after finding 12 more bags on Tuesday, she had 5 more bags than she had on Monday. This means that the 12 bags she found on Tuesday are the reason she has 5 more bags than on Monday. So, the equation should be: M + 12 = M + 5 But we made a mistake in our initial setup. The correct equation should be: M + 12 = M + M (because the number of bags she has on Tuesday is double what she had on Monday since she has 5 more than the original amount) Now we can solve for M: M + 12 = 2M Subtract M from both sides to isolate M: M + 12 - M = 2M - M 12 = M So, Tiffany had boxed{12} bags of cans on Monday."},{"prompt":"Jason is a sports enthusiast and attends various sports games.

To find the total amount of seed and fertilizer used, we add the amounts together: Total = S + F Total = 45 gallons (seed) + 15 gallons (fertilizer) Total = 60 gallons Therefore, Carson uses a total of boxed{60} gallons of seed and fertilizer combined."},{"prompt":"For the set ( S = left{ left( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_5 right) mid a_i = 0 text{ or } 1, i = 1, 2, cdots, 5 right} ), the distance between any two elements ( A = left( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_5 right) ) and ( B = left( b_1, b_2, cdots, b_5 right) ) is defined as: [ d(A, B) = left| a_1 b_1 right| + cdots + left| a_5 b_5 right| ] Find a subset ( T ) of ( S ) such that the distance between any two elements in ( T ) is greater than 2.

Therefore, for any two vertices in ( T ), there must be exactly one unique path. Conversely: 4. Suppose in graph ( T ), there is exactly one path between any two vertices.

A: (180+x20)(50frac{x}{10})=10890 B: (x20)(50frac{x180}{10})=10890 C: x(50frac{x180}{10})50times 20=10890 D: (x+180)(50frac{x}{10})50times 20=10890","completion":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, following the given information and the rules for rewriting the solution: 1. **Understanding the Problem**: The hotel has 50 rooms, and when the price is 180 yuan, all rooms are booked. For every 10 yuan increase in price, one room remains vacant. The hotel wants to make a profit of 10890 yuan in a day, and it costs 20 yuan per day for each occupied room. 2. **Setting Up the Equation**: The profit made by the hotel is the total revenue minus the total cost. The revenue is the price per room times the number of occupied rooms, and the cost is 20 yuan times the number of occupied rooms. 3. **Price per Room**: Let the price per room be x yuan. 4. **Number of Occupied Rooms**: For every 10 yuan increase in price from 180 yuan, one room becomes vacant. This means the number of occupied rooms can be expressed as 50 - frac{x - 180}{10}, because for every 10 yuan increase, the number of occupied rooms decreases by 1 from the initial 50. 5. **Total Revenue**: The total revenue is the price per room (x yuan) times the number of occupied rooms, which is x cdot left(50 - frac{x - 180}{10}right). 6. **Total Cost**: The total cost is 20 yuan per occupied room, so it's 20 cdot left(50 - frac{x - 180}{10}right). 7. **Profit Equation**: The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. However, since we are looking for the price that makes a profit of 10890 yuan, we set the profit (revenue minus cost) equal to 10890 yuan. The cost part simplifies to just 20 yuan times the number of occupied rooms, which is already included in the revenue part. So, we adjust the equation to account for the profit directly from the revenue, leading to the equation: left(x - 20right)left(50 - frac{x - 180}{10}right) = 10890. 8. **Choosing the Correct Equation**: From the given options, the equation that matches our step-by-step derivation is (x-20)(50-frac{x-180}{10})=10890.

Let the sum of interior angles of a polygon be given by: [ text{Sum of interior angles} = 180^circ times (n - 2) ] 2. We know from the problem that the sum of the interior angles is ( 720^circ ): [ 720^circ = 180^circ times (n - 2) ] 3. Solving for ( n ): [ n - 2 = frac{720^circ}{180^circ} = 4 implies n = 4 + 2 = 6 ] Therefore, our polygon is a hexagon. 4. The given angle between the lateral edge ( l ) and the height ( h ) of the pyramid is ( 30^circ ). Using the cosine function, we can find ( h ): [ h = l cos 30^circ = l times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} l ] 5. Next, we need to find the radius ( R ) of the circumscribed circle around the hexagon. In a regular hexagon, the radius ( R ) is also the side length of the hexagon. Using the sine function and knowing that the circumscribed circle's radius is: [ R = l sin 30^circ = l times frac{1}{2} = frac{l}{2} ] 6. Since ( R ) is equal to the side ( a ) of the hexagon, we have: [ a = frac{l}{2} ] 7.
