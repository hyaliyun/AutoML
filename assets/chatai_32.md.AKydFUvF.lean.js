The total cost w in yuan can be calculated as follows: [w = 500 times frac{m}{20} + 400 times frac{190 - m}{15}] [= 25m + frac{80(190 - m)}{3}] [= 25m - frac{80m}{3} + frac{15200}{3}] [= -frac{5m}{3} + frac{15200}{3}] Since -frac{5}{3} < 0, the cost w decreases as m increases. Given that both types of trucks are fully loaded, frac{m}{20} and frac{190 - m}{15} must be non-negative integers, and 0 leqslant m leqslant 190. Checking for integer solutions for trucks, we find that valid transportation plans are when m = 40, m = 100, and m = 160. These correspond to: 1. A trucks: 2, B trucks: 10; 2. A trucks: 5, B trucks: 6; 3. A trucks: 8, B trucks: 2; Since the cost decreases as m increases, the plan with the largest m has the lowest cost. Therefore, the plan with 8 trucks of type A and 2 trucks of type B has the lowest cost, which is boxed{text{Plan 3}}. # Method 2: Let m be the number of trucks of type A used, then frac{190 - 20m}{15} will be the number of trucks of type B used. The total cost w in yuan is: [w = 500m + 400 times frac{190 - 20m}{15} = -frac{100m}{3} + frac{15200}{3}] Given that 0 < m < 10 (since frac{190}{20} = 9.5), and both m and frac{190 - 20m}{15} must be integers, we find that m = 2, 5, and 8 are valid solutions. This leads to the same three valid transportation plans as in Method 1: 1. A trucks: 2, B trucks: 10; 2. A trucks: 5, B trucks: 6; 3. A trucks: 8, B trucks: 2; Since the cost decreases as m increases, the plan with the largest m has the lowest cost. Therefore, the plan with 8 trucks of type A and 2 trucks of type B has the lowest cost, which is boxed{text{Plan 3}}."},{"prompt":"A kiteshaped field is planted uniformly with wheat.

Due to symmetry, AO = CO and BO = DO. 3. **Determining the Region Closest to AB**: - Each point in triangle ABO is closer to AB than to any other side, due to the angle bisectors and perpendicular distances from points along BD to side AB. - The area of triangle ABO can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: ( text{Area} = frac{1}{2}ab sin(C) ). - Here, AB = 120 m and BO = 80 m (half of BD because BD is a diagonal splitting the kite into two isosceles triangles), and (sin(60^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}). - So, ( text{Area of ABO} = frac{1}{2} times 120 times 80 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 2400 sqrt{3} ) square meters. 4. **Total Area of the Kite**: - The total area of the kite is twice the area of triangle ABO (due to symmetry): ( 4800 sqrt{3} ) square meters. 5. **Fraction of Crop to Longest Side**: - The longest side is AB, and all crops from triangle ABO are brought to AB.

She bought 4 candy bars for 3 dimes each. Cost of 1 candy bar = 3 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 30 cents Cost of 4 candy bars = 4 * 30 cents = 120 cents Now, let's subtract the cost of the candy bars from the total amount to find out how much she had left before buying lollipops.

Similarly, define points (A_1) and (A_2), (B_1) and (B_2) for (triangle BPC) and (triangle CAP). 2. **Identify Isosceles Triangles**: Since (triangle AC_1B), (triangle AC_2B), (triangle BA_1C), (triangle BA_2C), (triangle CB_1A), and (triangle CB_2A) are isosceles triangles with angles of (120^circ) at the vertices, ( triangle A_1B_1C_1) and (triangle A_2B_2C_2) are equilateral triangles (refer to problem II.296 for the result). 3. **Analyze Angles in Quadrilaterals**: Compute the angles in quadrilaterals with vertices (P, A_2, B_2, C_2). This can be used to show that these points (P, A_2, B_2, C_2) lie on the same circle. 4. **Consider Orthocenter**: Let (H) be the orthocenter of (triangle APB). Since (|PH| = |C_1C_2|), (PHC_2C_1) forms a parallelogram, and therefore, the line (C_1H) (Euler line of (triangle APB)) passes through the midpoint of (PC_2). 5. **Midline Properties**: As (PC_2) is a chord of the circle with center (C_1), (C_1H) is perpendicular to (PC_2). 6. **Shared Euler Lines**: Thus, the Euler lines of (triangle APB), (triangle BPC), and (triangle CAP), coincide and are the perpendicular bisectors of segments (PC_2), (PB_2), and (PA_2), respectively. Since points (P, A_2, B_2, C_2) lie on the same circle, these perpendicular bisectors intersect at the center of the equilateral triangle (A_2B_2C_2). 7. **Intersection Point**: By result of problem II.296, these three Euler lines intersect at the point where the medians of the triangle (ABC) intersect. **Conclusion:** Thus, there exists a point (P) on the Euler line of (triangle ABC) such that the distances from the centroids of triangles (ABP), (BCP), and (CAP) to the vertices (C), (A), and (B) respectively are equal.

Since there are 2n coloured vertices, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one pair of consecutive vertices among P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{4n+1} that are both coloured. 6. **Contradiction with sequences**: Without loss of generality, assume P_1 and P_2 are both coloured.

Now, let's find out how many students wear shirts that are not blue, red, or green. We know there are 119 students who wear other colors.

The first 6 m^{3} is charged at a yuan per cubic meter, and the remaining 3 m^{3} is charged at b yuan per cubic meter. The total fee for April is 27 yuan.

Using this rule, let's analyze the given statements: 1. The negation of \\"There exists an x in mathbb{R} such that sin x + cos x = 2\\" is not \\"There exists an x in mathbb{R} such that sin x + cos x neq 2\\". The correct negation should be \\"For all x in mathbb{R}, sin x + cos x neq 2\\". Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. 2. The correct negation of \\"For all x in mathbb{R}, sin x + frac{1}{sin x} geq 2\\" is indeed \\"There exists an x in mathbb{R} such that sin x + frac{1}{sin x} < 2\\".

If we can tile a smaller grid, we can extend this tiling to the whole grid. 4. **Finalizing the proof by expressing example tiling in smaller grids and demonstrating its extension to larger grids:** When ( m = 3 ) and ( n = 8 ), tiling is quite straightforward: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} hline & & & L & L & L & & hline & L & L & & & & L & L hline L & L & & & & L & & L hline end{array} ] Here, replacing each block with exact L-shaped dominos will show proper tiling, which can be extended where ( m-3 ) and n = 8 can be continued similarly. # Conclusion: Thus, a grid of dimension ( m times n ) can be perfectly tiled by L-shaped dominos if and only if ( mn ) is divisible by 8.

What was his speed during the trip from P to Q?","completion":"Let's denote the speed during the trip from P to Q as ( v ) km/hr. When the person returns from Q to P, he increases his speed by 10%, so his return speed is ( v + 0.10v = 1.10v ) km/hr. The average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time. Since the distance from P to Q is the same as the distance from Q to P, we can denote this distance as ( d ). The time taken to travel from P to Q is ( frac{d}{v} ), and the time taken to return from Q to P is ( frac{d}{1.10v} ). The total distance for the round trip is ( 2d ), and the total time is ( frac{d}{v} + frac{d}{1.10v} ). The average speed for the round trip is given as 84 km/hr, so we can set up the equation: [ text{Average speed} = frac{text{Total distance}}{text{Total time}} ] [ 84 = frac{2d}{frac{d}{v} + frac{d}{1.10v}} ] To solve for ( v ), we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by the total time: [ 84 left( frac{d}{v} + frac{d}{1.10v} right) = 2d ] Divide both sides by ( d ) to cancel out the distance: [ 84 left( frac{1}{v} + frac{1}{1.10v} right) = 2 ] Now, let's find a common denominator for the fractions: [ 84 left( frac{1.10 + 1}{1.10v} right) = 2 ] [ 84 left( frac{2.10}{1.10v} right) = 2 ] [ frac{84 cdot 2.10}{1.10} = 2v ] [ frac{176.4}{1.10} = 2v ] [ 160.36 = 2v ] Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for ( v ): [ v = frac{160.36}{2} ] [ v = 80.18 ] So, the speed during the trip from P to Q was approximately boxed{80.18} km/hr."},{"prompt":"Rodney is again trying to guess a secret number based on these updated clues: begin{tabular}{ c } It is a twodigit integer.

Prove that this polygon has cut itself.","completion":"1. **Restate the problem clearly:** We need to prove that a polygon drawn such that every two adjacent sides have one vertical side (drawn from top to bottom) must intersect itself. 2. **Define the polygon and its properties:** Let mathcal{P} = P_1P_2 ldots P_{2n} be a polygon with vertices P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{2n} in sequence. The polygon is drawn such that every two adjacent sides have one vertical side, and all vertical sides are drawn from top to bottom. 3. **Assume the contrary:** Assume that the polygon mathcal{P} does not intersect itself. We will show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. 4. **Draw the odd-labeled points first:** Draw the points P_1, P_3, ldots, P_{2n-1} first. Notice that all lines of the form P_{2i-1}P_{2i} are vertical and parallel to each other. 5. **Introduce horizontal lines through odd-labeled points:** Draw horizontal lines ell_1, ell_3, ldots, ell_{2n-1} through P_1, P_3, ldots, P_{2n-1}, respectively. Each point P_{2i} must lie on the line ell_{2i-1} due to the vertical condition. 6. **Rotate the polygon:** Rotate the polygon so that the lines ell_i are horizontal. Consider the rightmost and leftmost odd-labeled points, P_{2a-1} and P_{2b-1}, respectively. 7. **Analyze the position of the line ell:** Assume that the line ell does not intersect mathcal{P}. Then ell must be either to the right of P_{2a-1} or to the left of P_{2b-1}. Without loss of generality, assume ell is far to the right. 8. **Position of even-labeled points:** Since ell must also hit all rays P_{2i-1}P_{2i}, it follows that for all positive integers i, point P_{2i} is to the right of P_{2i-1}. 9. **Consider the polygon P_1P_2P_{2n-1}P_{2n}:** Note that P_2 is to the right of P_1 and P_{2n-1} is to the left of P_{2n}. If mathcal{P} is to be not self-intersecting, then all other points must be on one side of P_1P_{2n}. 10. **Contradiction:** This condition does not hold because the vertical sides force some points to be on both sides of P_1P_{2n}. Therefore, the assumption that mathcal{P} does not intersect itself leads to a contradiction. 11. **Conclusion:** Hence, the polygon mathcal{P} must intersect itself. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the functions: [f_1(x) = frac{lg(1x^2)}{|x^22|2}] [f_2(x) = (x1) cdot sqrt{frac{x+1}{x1}}] [f_3(x) = log_a(x+sqrt{x^2+1}) quad (a>0, aneq 1)] [f_4(x) = x cdot (frac{1}{2^x1} + frac{1}{2}) quad (x neq 0)] Determine the correct judgment about the even and odd properties of these four functions.

We can complete the square to re-write the equation in standard form: x^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=1. This represents a circle with center (0,1) and radius 1. Next, we find the distance d from the center of the circle to the line y=x-1. The formula for the distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax+By+C=0 is d=frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. Applying this to our circle's center and the line y=x-1 (or x-y-1=0), we have: d= frac {|0 - 1 - 1|}{ sqrt {1^2 + (-1)^2}}= frac{2}{sqrt{2}}= sqrt {2}. Since AB is the diameter of the circle, one endpoint of the diameter, say A, is closest to the line, and the other endpoint, B, is farthest from the line.

We can leverage some combinatorial geometry to find a solution. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Calculate Total Possible Triangles:** If no three points are collinear, every set of three points will form a triangle. The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 6 is given by the combination formula: [ binom{6}{3} = frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = frac{6 times 5 times 4}{3 times 2 times 1} = 20 ] So, if no three points are collinear, we would have 20 triangles. 2. **Find the Required Reduction:** We need exactly 17 triangles. This means we need the number of triangles to be reduced by 3 (since (20 - 17 = 3)). 3. **Collinear Points Concept:** Each set of 3 collinear points does not contribute to the triangle count. Thus, if three points are collinear, we remove 1 triangle from the total count. 4. **Calculate the Collinear Triple Sets:** To remove 3 triangles (to go from 20 triangles to 17 triangles), we need 3 sets of 3 collinear points. Each set of collinear points removes exactly 1 triangle. Hence, we require 3 sets of collinear points. 5. **Place the Points in the Plane:** Think of constraining the arrangement of points such that 3 sets of 3 points are collinear. One example is to place the points at the vertices and midpoints of the sides of a triangle. **Example Configuration:** - Take an arbitrary triangle. - Use the vertices of this triangle as three points. - Use the midpoints of the sides of this triangle as the remaining three points. 6. **Verify the Configuration:** - The vertices of the triangle (3 points) form one collinear set along each side, contributing no triangles. - The midpoints of these sides (3 points) are collinear along each line segment connecting the midpoints, contributing no triangles. In this setup, we have three sets of three collinear points as required.

We will focus on cards labeled ( {1, ldots, n} ) and consider rules for a simplified game. 1. **Modified Game Rules:** In the modified game: - Each player keeps their minimum card. - Each player passes their median card one place to the right. - Each player passes their maximum card two places to the right. These rules are essentially the same as the original game but rotated in context by shifting player names. 2. **Claim:** For each (1 leq r leq n), the card (r) stops moving after at most (r-1) moves. 3. **Proof of Claim:** We treat the cards in ( {1, ldots, r} ) as indistinguishable blue tokens: - When a player receives a blue token for the first time, they turn one of their tokens grey which then never moves again. If a token is still blue after (h) hours and has moved from player 0 to player (d): - Players (0, 1, ldots, d) each have a grey token. - Thus, there are (d+1) grey tokens. Since the maximum value (d) can be (r-1): - Because a token moves at least one player per hour, we have (d geq h). - Therefore, (h leq r-2). Hence, all tokens stop moving by time (r-1). 4. **Explanation with Grey Tokens:** By treating blue tokens changing to grey, the process ensures that: - Grey tokens indicate places where a token has settled. - The maximum total distance any token travels is (r-1). 5. **Return to the Original Game:** Applying the claim to the original game: - After (n-1) hours, all cards ( {1, ldots, n} ) will have traveled such that they keep circulating among players in a distinct order.

Now, we analyze the sign of y' to deduce the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing: 1. For x in (0, frac {1}{e}), ln(x) is negative and ln(x) + 1 is negative because ln(frac {1}{e}) = -1. Hence, in this interval, y' < 0 and the function is monotonically decreasing. 2.

For the given function, a=-1, h=0, and k=5, indicating the vertex is at (0,5) and the symmetry axis is the y-axis. 2. **Effect of the Symmetry Axis:** - Since the symmetry axis is the y-axis, the graph is symmetric about the y-axis.

By symmetry, the point (2,y_{3}) has a corresponding point (-2,y_{3}) on the other side of the symmetry axis. - Since the graph opens downwards, as we move from left to right across the y-axis (from negative x to positive x), the y values first increase until the vertex and then decrease. - Given the x values -4, -2, and -1, we can see that as x increases from -4 to -1, y increases because we are moving closer to the vertex at (0,5). 4. **Determining the Relationship:** - Since -4 < -2 < -1, and knowing that y increases as x increases in this range, we can conclude that y_{1} < y_{3} < y_{2}. - However, considering the symmetry and the downward opening of the graph, the correct relationship, taking into account the entire graph and the original and symmetrical points, is y_{2} > y_{3} > y_{1}.

Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 46 km/hr - 36 km/hr Relative speed = 10 km/hr To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to km/sec. 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, 10 km/hr = 10 km / 3600 sec Now, we can calculate the distance covered by the faster train in 36 seconds at this relative speed.

We now focus on forming midpoints of line segments between point (A) and each of the remaining (N-1) points. There are (N-1) such segments, and thus (N-1) unique midpoints. 4.

We consider the divisibility properties of (x^2 + x + 1) and (x^3 - x + 1) modulo 3: - If (x equiv 1 pmod{3}): [ x^2 + x + 1 equiv 1^2 + 1 + 1 equiv 3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] [ x^3 - x + 1 equiv 1^3 - 1 + 1 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] - If (x equiv 2 pmod{3}): [ x^2 + x + 1 equiv 2^2 + 2 + 1 equiv 4 + 2 + 1 equiv 7 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] [ x^3 - x + 1 equiv 2^3 - 2 + 1 equiv 8 - 2 + 1 equiv 7 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] - If (x equiv 0 pmod{3}): [ x^2 + x + 1 equiv 0^2 + 0 + 1 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] [ x^3 - x + 1 equiv 0^3 - 0 + 1 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] From these cases, we see that (3) does not divide (x^3 - x + 1), and (x^2 + x + 1) is divisible by (3) if and only if (x equiv 1 pmod{3}). 3. Suppose (x = 3k + 1). Then: [ (3k + 1)^2 + (3k + 1) + 1 = 9k^2 + 6k + 1 + 3k + 1 + 1 = 9k^2 + 9k + 3 ] This means (x^2 + x + 1) is not divisible by (9). Therefore, (y = 0) or (y = 1). 4. Now, suppose (d = gcd(x^3 - x + 1, x^2 + x + 1)). Then: [ d mid x(x^2 + x + 1) - (x^3 - x + 1) = x^2 + 2x - 1 ] Observe that in that case: [ d mid (x^2 + 2x - 1) - (x^2 + x + 1) = x - 2 ] This means that (x equiv 2 pmod{d}). Therefore: [ 0 equiv 2^2 + 2 + 1 equiv 7 pmod{d} ] We conclude that (d = 7) or (d = 1). 5. This means that one of the factors is divisible by at most (7) (but not by (49)). This gives us the following possibilities: - (x^3 - x + 1 = 1): [ x^3 - x + 1 = 1 implies x^3 - x = 0 implies x(x^2 - 1) = 0 implies x = 0 text{ or } x = 1 ] For (x = 0), we get (y = 0) and (z = 0). For (x = 1), we get (y = 1) and (z = 0). - (x^3 - x + 1 = 7): [ x^3 - x - 6 = 0 ] The only integer root is (x = 2), which gives (y = 0) and (z = 2). - (x^2 + x + 1 = 1): [ x^2 + x + 1 = 1 implies x^2 + x = 0 implies x(x + 1) = 0 implies x = 0 ] This case has been considered before. - (x^2 + x + 1 = 3): [ x^2 + x + 1 = 3 implies x^2 + x - 2 = 0 implies (x - 1)(x + 2) = 0 implies x = 1 ] This case has been considered before. - (x^2 + x + 1 = 7): [ x^2 + x + 1 = 7 implies x^2 + x - 6 = 0 implies (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0 implies x = 2 ] This case has been considered before. - (x^2 + x + 1 = 21): [ x^2 + x + 1 = 21 implies x^2 + x - 20 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we get: [ x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 80}}{2} = frac{-1 pm 9}{2} ] Thus, (x = 4) or (x = -5). For (x = 4), we have: [ x^3 - x + 1 = 4^3 - 4 + 1 = 64 - 4 + 1 = 61 ] which is not divisible by either (3) or (7).

Speed of train 1: 69 kmph Speed of train 2: 82 kmph To convert kmph to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hour): Speed of train 1 in m/s = 69 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) = 69 * 1000 / 3600 = 19.17 m/s (approximately) Speed of train 2 in m/s = 82 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) = 82 * 1000 / 3600 = 22.78 m/s (approximately) Now, we calculate the relative speed at which the trains are approaching each other by adding their speeds together: Relative speed = Speed of train 1 + Speed of train 2 Relative speed = 19.17 m/s + 22.78 m/s = 41.95 m/s (approximately) The total distance to be covered is the sum of the lengths of the two trains plus the distance between them: Total distance = Length of train 1 + Length of train 2 + Distance apart Total distance = 120 m + 210 m + 80 m = 410 m Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to meet by dividing the total distance by the relative speed: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 410 m / 41.95 m/s ≈ 9.77 seconds Therefore, the trains will meet approximately boxed{9.77} seconds after they start moving towards each other."},{"prompt":"w can n points (n=2,3,4,5,6) be arranged on a sphere so that the distance between the nearest two of these n points is maximized?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to position ( n ) points on a sphere such that the minimum distance between any two of these points is maximized for ( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ). 1. **Case ( n = 2 )**: Placing the two points ( n=2 ) at diametrically opposite points on the sphere, maximizes their separation.

The diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the side length of the square because the circle will touch the square at the midpoint of each side. Therefore, the radius (r) of the inscribed circle is half the side length of the square. Side length of square = 20 inches Radius of inscribed circle (r) = Side length / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10 inches The area (A) of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2. So, the area of the inscribed circle is: A = π * (10 inches)^2 A = π * 100 square inches A = 100π square inches Now, let's find the area of the four quarter-circles placed at each corner of the square. The radius of each quarter-circle is the same as the radius of the inscribed circle, which is 10 inches. The area of a full circle with a radius of 10 inches would be 100π square inches, as calculated above. Since each quarter-circle is one-fourth of a full circle, the area of each quarter-circle is: Area of one quarter-circle = (1/4) * 100π square inches Area of one quarter-circle = 25π square inches Since there are four quarter-circles, the total area of the four quarter-circles is: Total area of four quarter-circles = 4 * 25π square inches Total area of four quarter-circles = 100π square inches However, we need to consider that the quarter-circles overlap the inscribed circle. The overlapping regions are actually four segments of the inscribed circle, each of which is a quarter-circle itself. Therefore, the overlapping area has already been counted in the area of the inscribed circle, and we should not count it again. Thus, the total area of the four quarter-circles, without double-counting the overlapping regions, remains 100π square inches. In summary: - The maximum area of the inscribed circle is 100π square inches. - The total area of the four quarter-circles, without double-counting the overlapping regions, is also boxed{100π} square inches."},{"prompt":"f the monomial frac{2}{3}{x^2}{y^n} and 2x^{m}y^{3} are still monomials when added together, then the value of m^{n} is ____.","completion":"To solve the problem, we start by understanding that for the monomials frac{2}{3}{x^2}{y^n} and -2x^{m}y^{3} to be added together and still result in a monomial, their variables must have the same powers.

This gives us the equations: - 1 = {x}^{2} or 1 = x+y or 1 = 0 - x = {x}^{2} or x = x+y or x = 0 - frac{y}{x} = {x}^{2} or frac{y}{x} = x+y or frac{y}{x} = 0 2. From the possible matches, we observe that 1 = 0 is impossible, and hence 1 = {x}^{2} and 0 must match with either x or frac{y}{x}. Since x = 0 would not satisfy x^2 = 1, it follows that 0 = frac{y}{x}, leading to y = 0. 3. With y = 0, the equation 1 = {x}^{2} becomes our focus. Considering x could be either 1 or -1 to satisfy this equation. 4. However, since x and frac{y}{x} must also match elements in set B, and knowing y=0, we deduce x ≠ 1 because x = 1 would result in a contradiction with the given element matches. Thus, x = -1. 5.

They do not touch any additional rows or columns outside their own diagonals, matching the intended distribution.

This is the foundation for expanding (a+b+c)^8. 2. **Introducing the Third Term**: We can rewrite (a+b+c)^8 as [c+(a+b)]^8. This allows us to apply the binomial theorem again, but this time to a sum involving three terms instead of two. 3. **Expansion Process**: The expansion becomes sum_{r=0}^8 C_8^r (a+b)^r c^{8-r}. This is because we are choosing r terms from (a+b) and the rest, 8-r, from c. 4. **Further Expansion**: To expand (a+b)^r, we use the binomial theorem again, leading to sum_{r=0}^8 C_8^r sum_{k=0}^r C_r^k a^{r-k}b^k c^{8-r}. Here, k represents the number of b's chosen from the (a+b)^r part. 5. **Identifying the Specific Term**: For the term a^{2}b^{3}c^{3}, we have r=5 and k=3. This is because we need 2 a's, 3 b's, and the rest, 3 c's, to match the term. 6. **Calculating the Coefficient**: The coefficient of T_{(2,3,3)} is found by calculating C_8^5 C_5^3. This gives us the coefficient for the term a^{2}b^{3}c^{3} in the expansion. 7. **Final Coefficient Calculation**: We calculate C_8^5 C_5^3 = 56 times 10 = 560. Therefore, the term a^{2}b^{3}c^{3} in the expansion of left(a+b+cright)^{8} is 560a^{2}b^{3}c^{3}, with a coefficient of boxed{560}. Part (2) To write down the general term formula for the expansion of left(a+b+cright)^{n} and explain its correctness: 1. **General Term Formula**: The general term in the expansion of left(a+b+cright)^{n} is given by T_{(r-k,k,n-r)}=C_n^rC_r^ka^{r-k}b^kc^{n-r}, where 0leq kleq rleq n. This formula accounts for choosing r terms from (a+b+c)^n, then k terms from (a+b)^r, and the rest from c. 2. **Explanation Based on Binomial Theorem**: The binomial theorem tells us that the expansion of (a+b)^n is sum_{r=0}^n C_n^r a^{n-r}b^r. When introducing a third term, c, we adapt this theorem to accommodate the additional choices, leading to the expansion of (a+b+c)^n as sum_{r=0}^n C_n^r (a+b)^r c^{n-r}. 3. **Further Expansion and Generalization**: By further expanding (a+b)^r and considering all possible selections of a, b, and c, we arrive at the general term formula. This formula is a direct result of applying the binomial theorem first to (a+b+c)^n and then to the (a+b)^r part of the expansion.

Sue: - She walks half the distance Jamie walks on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. - Jamie doesn't walk additional miles on these days, so Sue's additional walk is based on the group walk. - Sue walks 1.5 miles (half of 3 miles) on these days, which is 1.5 miles x 3 days/week x 4 weeks = 18 miles. Laura: - She walks 1 mile on Mondays and Tuesdays, and 1.5 miles on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. - That's (1 mile x 2 days + 1.5 miles x 3 days) x 4 weeks = (2 miles + 4.5 miles) x 4 weeks = 6.5 miles/week x 4 weeks = 26 miles. Melissa: - She walks 2 miles on Tuesdays and Fridays, and 4 miles on Sundays. - That's (2 miles x 2 days + 4 miles x 1 day) x 4 weeks = (4 miles + 4 miles) x 4 weeks = 8 miles/week x 4 weeks = 32 miles. Katie: - She walks 1 mile every day except Sundays when she walks 3 miles. - That's 1 mile x 6 days/week + 3 miles x 1 day/week = 6 miles + 3 miles = 9 miles/week. - For the month, that's 9 miles/week x 4 weeks = 36 miles. Now, let's add up all the miles: Group walks: 72 miles Jamie: 24 miles Sue: 18 miles Laura: 26 miles Melissa: 32 miles Katie: 36 miles Total miles = 72 + 24 + 18 + 26 + 32 + 36 = 208 miles Therefore, the total miles walked by all the ladies in the group during February is boxed{208} miles."},{"prompt":"The random variable X is given by the distribution function F(x)= begin{cases} 0 & text{if } x leq a frac{(a+x)^{2}}{2 a^{2}} & text{if } a < x leq 0 1frac{(ax)^{2}}{2 a^{2}} & text{if } 0 < x leq a 1 & text{if } x > a end{cases} Find the probability density function of the random variable X.","completion":"To determine the density function ( p(x) ) of the given random variable ( X ) described by the cumulative distribution function (CDF): F(x) = begin{cases} 0 & text{if } x leq -a frac{(a+x)^2}{2a^2} & text{if } -a < x leq 0 1 - frac{(a-x)^2}{2a^2} & text{if } 0 < x leq a 1 & text{if } x > a end{cases} we use the fundamental property that the density function ( p(x) ) is the derivative of the CDF ( F(x) ), whenever the derivative exists: [ p(x) = frac{d}{dx} F(x) ] 1.

What is the exponent of the second term in the equation (1/5)^e * (1/4)^exponent = 1/(2(10)^35)?","completion":"Let's first simplify the equation step by step. Given: (1/5)^e * (1/4)^exponent = 1/(2(10)^35) We know that (10)^35 = (5*2)^35 = (5)^35 * (2)^35. So, we can rewrite the right side of the equation as: 1/(2 * (5)^35 * (2)^35) Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation. We have (1/5)^e and (1/4)^exponent. Since e is given as 35, we can write (1/5)^e as (1/5)^35. We don't know the exponent for (1/4) yet, so we'll leave it as is. So, the equation becomes: (1/5)^35 * (1/4)^exponent = 1/(2 * (5)^35 * (2)^35) Now, let's equate the bases and the exponents on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have a base of 1/5 raised to the 35th power and a base of 1/4 raised to some power (exponent). On the right side, we have a base of 1/5 raised to the 35th power and a base of 1/2 raised to the 35th power. To make the bases match, we need to express 1/4 in terms of 1/2. We know that 1/4 is the same as (1/2)^2. So, we can rewrite (1/4)^exponent as ((1/2)^2)^exponent, which simplifies to (1/2)^(2*exponent). Now, the equation looks like this: (1/5)^35 * (1/2)^(2*exponent) = 1/(2 * (5)^35 * (2)^35) Since the bases of 1/5 match on both sides, we can ignore them for now and focus on the bases of 1/2. We have (1/2)^(2*exponent) on the left side and (1/2)^35 on the right side. To make the exponents match, we set 2*exponent equal to 35. 2*exponent = 35 Now, we solve for the exponent: exponent = 35 / 2 exponent = 17.5 So, the exponent of the second term in the equation is boxed{17.5} ."},{"prompt":"a school of 650 boys, 44% are Muslims, 28% are Hindus, a certain percentage are Sikhs, and the remaining belong to other communities.

Total = Number of Muslim boys + Number of Hindu boys + Number of boys from other communities Total = 286 + 182 + 117 Total = 585 boys Now, to find the number of Sikh boys, we subtract this total from the total number of boys in the school. Number of Sikh boys = Total number of boys - Total number of Muslim, Hindu, and other community boys Number of Sikh boys = 650 - 585 Number of Sikh boys = 65 boys Now, to find the percentage of Sikh boys, we divide the number of Sikh boys by the total number of boys and multiply by 100. Percentage of Sikh boys = (Number of Sikh boys / Total number of boys) * 100 Percentage of Sikh boys = (65 / 650) * 100 Percentage of Sikh boys = 0.1 * 100 Percentage of Sikh boys = 10% So, boxed{10%} of the boys are Sikhs."},{"prompt":"Two fair, sixsided dice are rolled.

The subsets that do not include 9 are exactly the subsets of {1,2,ldots,8}, and their complex power sums contribute S_8 to S_9. 2. **Counting subsets including the element 9:** Each subset of {1,2,ldots,8} can be extended by adding the element 9. This doubles the number of subsets contributing to S_9, thus adding another S_8 to S_9. Additionally, the element 9 contributes a term 9i^k to the complex power sum of each subset where k is the position of 9 in the subset (which is one more than the number of elements in the subset from {1,2,ldots,8}). 3. **Calculating the contribution of 9 to the power sums:** The contribution of 9 to the power sums, denoted as T_9, is given by: [ T_9 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 9 binom{8}{k} i^{k+1} ] This sum represents the binomial expansion of 9i(1+i)^8.

When Bruce and Anne work together at their normal rates, they can clean the house in 4 hours, so their combined rate is 1/4 houses per hour. Therefore, we have: B + A = 1/4 We already know that A = 1/12, so we can substitute that into the equation: B + 1/12 = 1/4 To find B, we subtract 1/12 from both sides: B = 1/4 - 1/12 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12: B = 3/12 - 1/12 B = 2/12 B = 1/6 So, Bruce's rate is 1/6 houses per hour.

When A and B work together in one day, they can complete: (1/15) + (1/20) of the work.

This transformation, with respect to the circles and points involved, has the following effects: - The points of tangency ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) on circle (or line) ( S_1 ) are mapped to points ( B_1^* ) and ( C_1^* ). - Similarly, the points of tangency ( B_2 ) and ( C_2 ) on circle (or line) ( S_2 ) are mapped to points ( B_2^* ) and ( C_2^* ). 4. After the inversion, the circles which were originally touching ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) will become two smaller circles inscribed in the same angle, or in a pair of vertical angles, because inversion preserves angles. 5. Given that ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) are interchanged through such an inversion and the tangency points are preserved by definition, the images ( S_1^* ) and ( S_2^* ) (of circles ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) respectively) can be transformed one into the other by a homothety with center ( A ). 6. **Homothety and Parallelism:** This homothety maps the segments connecting the tangency points ( B_1^* ) and ( C_1^* ) to the segments connecting ( B_2^* ) and ( C_2^* ). Therefore, the segments ( B_1^*C_1^* ) and ( B_2^*C_2^* ) must be parallel due to the property of homothety (mapping lines parallel to each other). 7. **Tangency at Center of Inversion:** The parallel lines, when mapped back to their original positions before the inversion, imply that the circumcircles of triangles ( AB_1C_1 ) and ( AB_2C_2 ) must touch at a single point, which can be certain to lie on line through ( A ) as parallelism transforms back to tangency at the point of inversion. 8. Therefore, the circumcircles of the triangles ( AB_1C_1 ) and ( AB_2C_2 ) touch each other at point ( A ) due to preservation of this geometric property under inversion and homothety. # Conclusion: [ blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The product N of three positive integers is 8 times their sum, and one of the integers is twice the sum of the other two.

We need to verify that this polynomial satisfies the condition for the required range of ( n ). We will first handle ( n = 4 ) and then extend the argument to odd primes ( p ). 2. **Case ( n = 4 ):** For ( n = 4 ), we need to evaluate ( Q(x) mod 4 ).

We start by transforming the left-hand side using the sum-to-product formula: [ sqrt{2}sinleft(alpha + beta + frac{pi}{4}right) = 2sqrt{2}cosleft(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right)sin beta ] This step uses the identity that sin x + cos x = sqrt{2}sin(x + frac{pi}{4}). 2. Simplifying the equation by dividing both sides by sqrt{2}, we get: [ sinleft(alpha + beta + frac{pi}{4}right) = 2cosleft(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right)sin beta ] 3.

Rearranging the terms to isolate the zero on one side, we find: [ sinleft(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right)cos beta - cosleft(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right)sin beta = 0 ] 5. This leads to the conclusion that: [ sinleft(alpha + frac{pi}{4} - betaright) = 0 ] 6. From the property of the sine function, we know that sin x = 0 implies x = kpi, where k is an integer. Thus: [ alpha + frac{pi}{4} - beta = kpi ] 7. Solving for alpha - beta, we get: [ alpha - beta = kpi - frac{pi}{4} ] 8. This implies that the tangent of alpha - beta is -1, since the tangent function has a period of pi and tanleft(-frac{pi}{4}right) = -1. **Method 2:** Starting from the given condition and applying trigonometric identities, we have: 1. sin alpha cos beta + cos alpha sin beta + cos alpha cos beta - sin alpha sin beta = 2(cos alpha - sin alpha)sin beta 2. Simplifying, we get: [ sin(alpha - beta) + cos(alpha - beta) = 0 ] 3. This directly implies that tan(alpha - beta) = -1, since adding sine and cosine of the same angle and equating it to zero suggests that the angle is an odd multiple of frac{3pi}{4}, where the tangent is -1.

The domain of this function is all real numbers (mathbb{R}) because there are no restrictions on x for exponential and linear functions. 2. **Identifying the property of f(x)**: We observe that f(-x) = 3^x - 3^{-x} + x. This can be seen as f(-x) = -(3^{-x} - 3^x - x) = -f(x). This means f(x) is an odd function over mathbb{R}. 3. **Behavior of f(x)**: We note that y = 3^{-x} is a decreasing function on mathbb{R} because as x increases, 3^{-x} decreases. Similarly, y = 3^x and y = x are increasing functions on mathbb{R}. Combining these observations, we conclude that f(x) = 3^{-x} - 3^x - x is a decreasing function on mathbb{R}. 4. **Analyzing the inequality f(2a+3) + f(3-a) > 0**: Given that f(x) is a decreasing function, and from the inequality f(2a+3) + f(3-a) > 0, we can infer that f(2a+3) > -f(3-a). Using the property of odd functions, -f(3-a) = f(a-3).

(8 points) (3) Since the function f(x) is not monotonic in the interval (-1, 1), the derivative f'(x) must have a zero in (-1, 1). The roots of f'(x) = 0 are a-1 and a+1, with an interval length of 2, thus, it's impossible to have 2 zeros in the interval (-1, 1). Therefore, f'(-1)f'(1) < 0, and since a^2 > 0, we have (a+2)(a-2) < 0, which gives -2 < a < 2.

For any integer (x), (x) and (100k + x) (where (k) is an integer) have the same remainder when divided by 100. - Thus, (x^2 mod 100) and ((100k + x)^2 mod 100) will result in the same remainder. - This consideration implies that we only need to evaluate the remainders (0, 1, 2, ldots, 99) when squared, i.e., (x^2 mod 100) for (x) taking values from 0 to 99. 3. **Possible Remainders of Squares Modulo 100**: - Any integer squared can yield only certain particular remainders when divided by 100. Specifically, these remainders are between 0 and 99. - However, since (100 - x) also maps back to the same remainder modulo 100, some remainders are repeated. - By detailed analysis or computation, it is known that there are exactly 51 unique possible remainders for (x^2 mod 100). 4. **Pigeonhole Principle Application**: - Given the 43 numbers, there are 43 squares. - Since there are only 51 unique remainders possible for squares modulo 100 and we have 43 numbers, placing 43 numbers into 51 possible remainder slots, necessarily some slots will contain numbers that are multiples of 5 (multiple of 5 remainders). 5. **Consideration of Multiples of 5**: - Suppose we have three such remainders, say (5k), (5ell), and (5m), where (k), (ell), and (m) are integers. - We now examine their squares. If any pair among (k), (ell), and (m) have the same parity (either both even or both odd), we let those be (k) and (ell). - Thus: [ a = 5k, quad b = 5ell ] [ a^2 - b^2 = (5k)^2 - (5ell)^2 = 25(k^2 - ell^2) ] - Factorizing further, [ a^2 - b^2 = 25(k - ell)(k + ell) ] - If (k) and (ell) are of the same parity, then (k - ell) and (k + ell) are even integers, implying that their product is divisible by 4. 6. **Combining Divisibilities**: - Since (25 times 4 = 100), (a^2 - b^2) is divisible by 100. - By the pigeonhole principle, if we have fewer than 51 remainders, we are forced to include a sufficient number of multiples of 5, and among them, pairs will exist which satisfy the divisibility requirements. 7. **Conclusion**: - Among any 43 positive integers, one can always find two integers (a) and (b) such that (a^2 - b^2) is divisible by 100.

John buys 1.5 ounces of silver at 20 per ounce, so the cost of the silver is: Cost of silver = 1.5 ounces * 20/ounce = 30 He buys twice as much gold in weight, so he buys 1.5 * 2 = 3 ounces of gold. Let's denote the cost per ounce of gold as y. Since the gold is x times more expensive than the silver, we have: y = x * 20/ounce The total cost of the gold is then: Cost of gold = 3 ounces * y = 3 ounces * x * 20/ounce The total amount he spends on both silver and gold is 3030, so we have: Cost of silver + Cost of gold = 3030 30 + 3 * x * 20 = 3030 Now we solve for x: 3 * x * 20 = 3030 - 30 3 * x * 20 = 3000 x * 20 = 1000 x = 1000 / 20 x = 50 Therefore, the gold is boxed{50} times more expensive per ounce compared to the silver."},{"prompt":"To arrange 3 male students, 2 female students, and 1 teacher in a row, with the requirement that all male students are not adjacent to each other, and female students are also not adjacent, the number of ways to arrange them is ( ) A: 72 B: 120 C: 144 D: 168","completion":"First, arrange the 3 male students, which can be done in A_3^3=6 ways, creating 4 gaps.

We are given that ( N ) has exactly 1112 digits. 2. **Consider the effect of adding 1 to ( N ):** Let ( N ) end in exactly ( k ) digits of 9.

To maximize the median, (x) and (2x) should be as large as possible, but without exceeding the largest fixed number (7) since we aim to find the largest median, not just the largest numbers. 3. **Analyzing possible values**: - If (x > 3.5), then (2x > 7), making (2x) the largest number and no longer the median. - If (x leq 3.5), (x) and (2x) could still be among the three middle numbers only if (x) is maximized up to this bound. - At (x = 3), (2x = 6), the set becomes ({3, 6, 4, 3, 7}) in no particular order.

Given that ( AM: MB = 1:3 ), it follows that ( AM = frac{1}{4} AB ) and ( MB = frac{3}{4} AB ). 2. **Relations between segments**: Since ( AB ) is the diameter of the circle, ( AB = 2R ), where ( R ) is the radius of the circle. Thus, ( AM = frac{1}{4} cdot 2R = frac{R}{2} ) and ( MB = frac{3}{4} cdot 2R = frac{3R}{2} ).

What are the height and base radius of the cylinder? 1. **Define Variables**: Let the height of the cylinder be ( m ) and the radius of its base be ( r ). 2. **Surface Area Equation**: The surface area ( A ) of the right circular cylinder is given by: [ A = 2pi r^2 + 2pi r m ] However, because the problem simplified the equation directly in terms of the total surface area provided, we use: [ 8 r^2 + 8 r m = 2720 ] Simplifying this gives: [ r^2 + r m = 341 ] This is Equation (1). 3. **Diagonal Relationship**: The rectangle's diagonal (which measures 26 text{ cm}) relates to its side ( r ) and ( m ) as follows by the Pythagorean theorem: [ r^2 + m^2 = 26^2 ] [ r^2 + m^2 = 676 ] This is Equation (2). 4. **Solving for ( m ) in Terms of ( r )**: From Equation (1): [ r^2 + r m = 341 implies r m = 341 - r^2 ] Therefore, [ m = frac{341 - r^2}{r} ] 5. **Substituting ( m ) into Equation (2)**: Substitute ( m ) from the above expression into Equation (2): [ r^2 + left(frac{341 - r^2}{r}right)^2 = 676 ] [ r^2 + frac{(341 - r^2)^2}{r^2} = 676 ] Multiply through by ( r^2 ): [ r^4 + (341 - r^2)^2 = 676 r^2 ] Expand and simplify: [ r^4 + 341^2 - 2 cdot 341 cdot r^2 + r^4 = 676 r^2 ] [ 2r^4 - 682 r^2 + 116281 = 676 r^2 ] [ 2r^4 - 1358r^2 + 116281 = 0 ] 6. **Solve the Quartic Equation**: Divide the whole equation by 2: [ r^4 - 678r^2 + 57800 = 0 ] Let ( x = r^2 ): [ x^2 - 678x + 57800 = 0 ] Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ): [ x = frac{678 pm sqrt{678^2 - 4 cdot 57800}}{2} ] Calculate the discriminant: [ x = frac{678 pm sqrt{459684 - 231200}}{2} ] [ x = frac{678 pm sqrt{228484}}{2} ] [ x = frac{678 pm 478}{2} ] Thus: [ x_1 = frac{1156}{2} = 578, quad x_2 = frac{200}{2} = 100 ] Therefore: [ r_1^2 = 578, quad r_2^2 = 100 ] So, the positive solutions for ( r ) are: [ r = sqrt{578} text{ cm} quad text{and} quad r = 10 text{ cm} ] 7. **Finding Corresponding ( m ) Values**: For ( r = sqrt{578} text { cm} ): [ m = sqrt{98} text{ cm} ] For ( r = 10 text { cm} ): [ m = 24 text{ cm} ] Hence, the possible dimensions of the cylinder are: - Radius ( r = sqrt{578} text{ cm} ) and height ( m = sqrt{98} text{ cm} ) - Radius ( r = 10 text{ cm} ) and height ( m = 24 text{ cm} ).

The value of tanleft(frac{pi}{6}right) is a well-known special angle in trigonometry, which corresponds to 30^circ.

First, let's find the LCM of 9 and 15. The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2. The prime factorization of 15 is 3 × 5. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in the factorization of both numbers. So, the LCM of 9 and 15 is 3^2 × 5 = 9 × 5 = 45. Now, we need to find the largest multiple of 45 that is less than or equal to 509. To do this, we divide 509 by 45 and take the integer part of the result: 509 ÷ 45 = 11 with a remainder of 14. The largest multiple of 45 less than 509 is 11 × 45 = 495.

In the plane xOy, construct a convex m+2 sided polygon OA_0A_1 ldots A_m such that: [ begin{cases} O A_{0} = O A_{m} triangle O A_{i} A_{i+1} text{ is a right-angled triangle at } A_i text{ for } 1 leq i leq m-1. end{cases} ] 8. Choose some small alpha such that: [ angle l_1 O l_2 = angle l_2 O l_3 = ldots = angle l_{m-1} O l_m = alpha ] 9. On line l_1, choose a point A_1. From point A_{1}, draw perpendiculars to line l_{i+1}(2 leq i leq m-1) to get the perpendicular points A_2, A_3, ldots, A_m. 10. Thus, angle O A_{i+1} A_i = alpha, where triangle O A_{i} A_{i+1} is a right-angled triangle. 11. Similarly, we construct O A_m in such a way that it is frac{1}{k} times the distance of its previous length, making it spiral inward forming a polygon. 12. If we place points O^prime and O^{primeprime} on the z-axis symmetrically aligned with this polygon, so the conditions O O^prime = O O^{primeprime} = O A_0 = O A_m hold. 13. This configuration leads to 2m right-angled triangles formed by triangles like O^prime A_i A_{i+1} and two isosceles right-angled triangles O^prime A_0 O^{primeprime} and O^prime A_m O^{primeprime}. 14. Therefore, for even n geq 4, such a polyhedron can be constructed, proving that all even n geq 4 are possible values for n.

Since this equation holds for all x in mathbb{R}, we have k = -1. boxed{k = -1} (2) The graph of function f(x) and g(x) having exactly one common point is equivalent to the equation f(x) = g(x) having a unique real solution, which is equivalent to the equation 4^{x} + 1 = (a cdot 2^{x} - frac{4}{3}a) cdot 2^{x} having a unique real solution, and a cdot 2^{x} - frac{4}{3}a > 0. Let 2^{x} = t, then this problem is equivalent to the equation (a-1) cdot t^{2} - frac{4}{3}at - 1 = 0 having only one positive real root and a cdot 2^{x} - frac{4}{3}a > 0. Thus, we have: ① If a-1=0, i.e., a=1, then t= -frac{3}{4}, which is not consistent with the problem, so it is discarded. ② If a-1 neq 0, i.e., a neq 1.

When a = -3, we get t = frac{1}{2}, which is consistent with the problem. (Ⅱ) The equation has one positive root and one negative root, i.e., frac{-1}{a-1} < 0, which means a > 1 is consistent with the problem.

The distance of each focus from the center (0,0) is sqrt{a^2-b^2}, where a^2 is the larger denominator and b^2 is the smaller one. Here, a^2=3 and b^2=1, so the distance is sqrt{3-1}=sqrt{2}. Thus, the foci are at F_{1}(-sqrt{2}, 0) and F_{2}(sqrt{2}, 0). **Step 2: Relating the Area of Triangles to the Distance from the Foci** Given that the area of triangle F_{1}AB is twice the area of triangle F_{2}AB, and considering the line y=x+m intersects the x-axis at M(-m,0), we can relate the distances from the foci to M as |F_{1}M|=2|F_{2}M|. **Step 3: Calculating the Distance from the Foci to Point M** We calculate the distances: - For F_{1}M, the distance is |-sqrt{2}-(-m)|=|sqrt{2}+m|. - For F_{2}M, the distance is |sqrt{2}-(-m)|=|sqrt{2}+m|.

Player A hides the ball, and Player B tries to find it. At each step, Player B chooses a box, and Player A reveals the distance of the ball to the chosen box and then moves the ball to an adjacent box. 2. **Understanding the Distance**: When Player B chooses a box, Player A reveals the distance of the ball to that box. This distance is the minimum number of steps along the edges of the n-gon to reach the ball from the chosen box. 3. **Movement of the Ball**: After revealing the distance, Player A moves the ball to an adjacent box. This means that the ball can only move to one of the two neighboring boxes. 4. **Strategy for Player B**: To guarantee finding the ball, Player B needs to systematically reduce the possible locations of the ball. The key is to use the information about the distance and the movement pattern of the ball. 5. **Step-by-Step Strategy**: - **Step 1**: Player B chooses any box, say box 1. Let the distance revealed be d_1. - **Step 2**: Player A moves the ball to an adjacent box. Now, the ball can be in one of the two boxes adjacent to the original box where it was. - **Step 3**: Player B chooses one of the two possible boxes where the ball could have moved.

Now, Player B has two possible locations for the ball again. - **Step 5**: Player B continues this process, each time narrowing down the possible locations of the ball based on the distances revealed and the movement pattern. 6. **Guaranteed Win**: To guarantee a win, Player B needs to ensure that the ball is found within a finite number of steps. The strategy involves systematically checking each box and using the distance information to eliminate possibilities. 7. **Least Number of Steps**: The least number of steps required for Player B to guarantee finding the ball can be determined by considering the worst-case scenario. In the worst case, Player B needs to check each box at least once and use the distance information to track the ball's movement. 8. **Conclusion**: The least number of steps for which Player B can guarantee to win is n.

Compute the vector relationships for the sides of triangle KMN: [ overrightarrow{N K} = overrightarrow{A A_1}, quad overrightarrow{M N} = overrightarrow{C C_1}, quad overrightarrow{K M} = overrightarrow{B B_1} ] 2. For the triangle PQR, we need to assert the relationships between the vectors in terms of triangle ABC: [ overrightarrow{P Q} = overrightarrow{K K_1}, quad overrightarrow{Q R} = overrightarrow{N N_1}, quad overrightarrow{R P} = overrightarrow{M M_1} ] 3.

However, weather events are inherently unpredictable and subject to variability, making them random rather than certain.

A census survey implies examining every single unit in the population, which is impractical and unnecessary for understanding the service life of products. Instead, a sampling survey, which involves examining a subset of the population, is more appropriate and efficient for this purpose.

Part b) 1. **Description of the problem:** We need to find if it's possible to construct a parallelepiped such that it can be covered by three squares, each pair of squares sharing an edge. 2. **Illustration of the solution for a specific configuration:** The problem suggests using a parallelepiped with dimensions (1 times 4 times 6). The three squares that cover it are two (4 times 4) squares and one (6 times 6) square. The (6 times 6) square is used to cover three faces: front, bottom, and back.

The ergodic theorem implies that [ lim_{m to infty} frac{1}{m+1} sum_{j=0}^m (U^{-j} A U^j)_{ik} ] converges almost everywhere.

We arrange natural numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, ldots in a spiral manner. Let's analyze and break down the problem into steps. Step 1: Analyzing the pattern of placement Each cell in the given grid is labeled with sequential natural numbers placed in a spiral pattern. The numbers increase gradually as you move along the path of the spiral. Step 2: Establishing growth pattern When moving vertically or horizontally along the spiral, each next number in a cell increases by exactly 4 compared to the previous cell. Similarly, when moving diagonally, the increase is by exactly 8. Step 3: Understanding the placement in the cells Let's verify the pattern with an example. Assume the initial configuration where the spiral starts: \`\`\` B A 1 C D \`\`\` In the cells along the spiral: - A number increases by 4 when moving vertically or horizontally. - A number increases by 8 when moving diagonally. From this, it's apparent that moving along any given path follows a predictable pattern of increments. Step 4: Specific focus on multiples of 4 and 76 (a) **Claim: Infinite presence of multiples of 76** To demonstrate this, observe that multiples of 4 will be present repeatedly because every fourth step increases the number by 4 in any linear direction of the spiral. Starting from 32, a multiple of 4 will appear after every fourth step. Given the numbers increment by 4 and 8: - Moving ahead sufficiently far in the sequence will eventually include a number which is a multiple of 76 because 76 itself is a multiple of 4, specifically 76 = 4 times 19.

Since the plane ( P ) is infinite and the number of lines ( L ) is also infinite, there must be at least three segments that intersect pairwise.

So for point P, x = -1 + cos alpha, and y = sin alpha. Now, we want to maximize the expression 2x + 3y. Plug in the expressions for x and y: 2x + 3y = 2(-1 + cos alpha) + 3sin alpha = 2cos alpha + 3sin alpha - 2. This expression can be rewritten using the trigonometric identity for a linear combination of sin and cos: 2cos alpha + 3sin alpha = Rcos(alpha - phi), where R = sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = sqrt{13} and phi is the phase angle such that cos phi = frac{2}{sqrt{13}}, quad sin phi = frac{3}{sqrt{13}}. The maximum value of cos(alpha - phi) is 1 when alpha = phi. Thus, the maximum value of 2x + 3y is obtained when cos(alpha - phi) = 1: 2x + 3y = sqrt{13} cos(alpha - phi) - 2 = sqrt{13} cdot 1 - 2 = sqrt{13} - 2. Therefore, the maximum value of 2x + 3y is boxed{sqrt{13} - 2}. This problem leverages the standard equation of a circle and seeks the maximum value of a function using trigonometric relations.

Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Consider all possible pairs sum constraints:** Let's denote the set of perfect squares less than or equal to the largest possible sum ( 2001 + 2001 = 4002 ). These perfect squares are: [ 1^2 = 1,; 2^2 = 4,; 3^2 = 9,; 4^2 = 16,; 5^2 = 25,; ldots,; 63^2 = 3969,; 64^2 = 4096 ] However, the sum cannot exceed 4002, so we need to stop at ( 63^2 = 3969 ). Hence, the relevant perfect squares are ( 1, 4, 9, 16, ldots, 3969 ). 2. **Perfect squares sum constraints for every pair:** The next step is to ensure that any subset ( W ) of ( m ) elements contains at least one pair ( (u, v) ) such that ( u+v ) is one of these perfect squares. 3. **Double counting argument:** Consider the negation: assume there exists a subset ( W subseteq X ) with ( 999 ) elements such that no two elements' sum in this subset is a perfect square. 4. **Pigeonhole principle argument:** We'll prove by contradiction, using the pigeonhole principle, that this is impossible for ( m geq 1000 ). The key observation is any subset of 1000 numbers from ( {1, 2, ldots, 2001} ) must include a pair whose sum is a perfect square. 5. **Construction of ( 999 ) elements without a perfect square sum:** Now let’s show that it is possible to construct a subset with 999 elements such that no sum of two elements is a perfect square. For any number ( n ) and the set containing ( n ), exclude any number ( k ) such that ( n + k ) is a perfect square. If this were the case of ( m=999 ), then the number of forbidden pairs (or elements for each choice) grows inconveniently close to exhausting all ( 2001 ) elements. 6. **Conclusion:** As ( m=999 ) can be shown possible through construction (as suggested), the smallest ( m ) such that any ( m )-element subset must contain a pair whose sum is a perfect square is ( 1000 ). Therefore, the smallest positive integer ( m ) that satisfies the condition is: [ boxed{999} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the set M={(x,y)| begin{cases} 2x+y=2 xy=1 end{cases}}, what is M?

Multiply the second equation by 2 to facilitate elimination: 2(x - y) = 2(1) Rightarrow 2x - 2y = 2. 2.

Let's set up an equation to represent this situation: 60% of total fruit = Number of apples (A) 40% of total fruit = Number of oranges left (8) Since the percentages must add up to 100%, we can say that the total number of pieces of fruit after removing 15 oranges is A + 8. Now, we can express the number of apples as 60% of the total number of pieces of fruit: 0.60 * (A + 8) = A To solve for A, we can distribute the 0.60: 0.60A + 0.60 * 8 = A 0.60A + 4.8 = A Now, we'll subtract 0.60A from both sides to isolate A: 0.60A - 0.60A + 4.8 = A - 0.60A 4.8 = 0.40A Now, we'll divide both sides by 0.40 to solve for A: 4.8 / 0.40 = A A = 12 So, there are boxed{12} apples in the bowl."},{"prompt":"Given f(x 3) = 2x^2 3x + 1, find f(1).","completion":"**Analysis:** This problem requires us to find the value of a function at a specific point.

We can rewrite this using the double-angle identity for sine: begin{align*} f(x) &= sinfrac{1}{2}x-frac{1}{2}sin x &= sinfrac{1}{2}x-sinfrac{1}{2}xcosfrac{1}{2}x &= sinfrac{1}{2}x(1-cosfrac{1}{2}x) = 0. end{align*} This equation is satisfied if sinfrac{1}{2}x=0 or 1-cosfrac{1}{2}x=0, which simplifies to cosfrac{1}{2}x=1. Since xin left[0,2pi right], then frac{1}{2}xin[0,pi]. Solving gives x=0 or x=2pi. Therefore, option A is incorrect because there are not three different zeros. For option B, we find the derivative of f(x): begin{align*} f'(x) &= frac{1}{2}cosfrac{1}{2}x-frac{1}{2}cos x &= frac{1}{2}(cosfrac{1}{2}x-2cos^2frac{1}{2}x+1) &= frac{1}{2}(1-cosfrac{1}{2}x)(1+2cosfrac{1}{2}x). end{align*} Since frac{1}{2}xin[0,frac{pi}{2}] for xin left[0,pi right], we have 0leqcosfrac{1}{2}xleq1, which implies f'(x)geq 0. Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on left[0,pi right], making option B correct. For option C, we already know from option B that f(x) is monotonically increasing on left[0,pi right]. By extending this analysis, we find that f(x) reaches a maximum value when x=frac{4pi}{3}, and at this point, f(frac{4pi}{3})=frac{3sqrt{3}}{4}. Therefore, option C is correct. For option D, we examine the tangent line of f(x) at the origin. The function passes through the origin (f(0)=0), and f'(0)=0, indicating the tangent line at the origin is y=0. Since the line y=x also passes through the origin but has a different slope, it cannot be the tangent line of f(x) at the origin. Furthermore, by analyzing the function g(x)=x-sinfrac{1}{2}x+frac{1}{2}sin x, we find that g(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,2pi), meaning the graph of f(x) is always below the line y=x on (0,2pi].

Then (a = c(b^n - 1) = b^n - 1). In base (b), (b^n - 1) is represented as (overline{(b-1)(b-1)ldots(b-1)}) (with (n) digits, each being (b-1)). Thus, (a) has exactly (n) non-zero digits. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that for (c) represented as (sum_{i=0}^{m} x_i b^i) where (0 leq x_i < b), the number (c(b^n - 1)) has at least (n) non-zero digits in base (b). We need to show that for (c' = x_{m+1} b^{m+1} + sum_{i=0}^{m} x_i b^i), the number (c'(b^n - 1)) also has at least (n) non-zero digits. 3. **Expression for (a):** Let (c' = x_{m+1} b^{m+1} + c), where (c = sum_{i=0}^{m} x_i b^i). Then: [ a = c'(b^n - 1) = (x_{m+1} b^{m+1} + c)(b^n - 1) = x_{m+1} b^{m+1} (b^n - 1) + c(b^n - 1) ] Let (c(b^n - 1) = sum_{i=0}^{m+n} y_i b^i), where (0 leq y_i < b). Then: [ a = x_{m+1} b^{m+n+1} + sum_{i=0}^{m+n} y_i b^i - x_{m+1} b^{m+1} ] 4. **Analyzing the Digits:** - If (x_{m+1} = y_{m+1}), then (a) has the same number of non-zero digits as (c(b^n - 1)) because one digit would be changed to zero and a non-zero digit would be added, without changing anything else. - If (x_{m+1} < y_{m+1}), we will get one more non-zero digit. - If (x_{m+1} > y_{m+1}), then we can replace (y_{m+1} - x_{m+1}) by (y_{m+1} - x_{m+1} + b) (a non-zero number) and adjust the coefficients of larger exponents to get all coefficients in range. This would mean decreasing the first non-zero coefficient met when going left from exponent (m+1) by 1 and changing all zero coefficients met on the way to (b-1). At most one coefficient is changed from non-zero to zero, but the added non-zero coefficient for exponent (m+n+1) would offset this decrease. 5. **Conclusion:** By induction, (c(b^n - 1)) would have at least as many non-zero digits as (c(b^n - 1)), ensuring that (a) has at least (n) non-zero digits in base (b).

We will consider two cases separately: when (n) is even and when (n) is odd. 1. **Case 1: (n) is even** Let (n = 2k) for some integer (k).

When the man is rowing upstream, the speed of the boat will be the difference between the speed of the boat in standing water and the speed of the stream. So, the upstream speed is 16 kmph - 2 kmph = 14 kmph. The time taken to row downstream to the place is the distance divided by the downstream speed, which is D/18 hours. The time taken to row upstream back to the starting point is the distance divided by the upstream speed, which is D/14 hours.
