Suppose (b) is divisible by a prime (p). Since (b > 1), such a prime (p) exists. Hence, (a) must also be divisible by (p).

From the reference image, we can see how a (6 times 5) rectangle with a (2 times 1) portion cut out can be split into 6 triangles. A helpful approach is to: - Divide the large rectangle into multiple smaller geometric shapes such that when rearranged or connected, they form 6 distinct triangles. - Ensure that each triangle adheres to the properties that their combined area indeed matches the remaining area of 28 unit squares.

Given that (S-ABC) is a regular tetrahedron with height (SO = 3) and the base edge length is 6. We need to find the parallel cross-section area passing through a point (P) such that (AP: PO' = 8), where (O') is the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to the face (SBC). 2. Since (S-ABC) is a regular tetrahedron, (O) is the centroid of (triangle ABC). We know that in a regular tetrahedron, the centroid of any face acts as the foot of the perpendicular from the opposing vertex. 3. Connect (A) to (O) and extend it to intersect (BC) at point (D). Point (D) is the midpoint of (BC). Thus, (A, O, D) are collinear. Hence, AD = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot BC = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot 6 = 3sqrt{3} where (AD) is two-thirds of the median from vertex (A) in (triangle ABC). 4. Since (O) divides (AD) in the ratio (1:2), OD = frac{1}{3} AD = frac{1}{3} times 3sqrt{3} = sqrt{3} 5. To find (SD), we use the Pythagorean theorem in (triangle SOD): SD = sqrt{SO^2 + OD^2} = sqrt{3^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{9 + 3} = 2sqrt{3} 6. Since (O') lies on (DS), using the section formula, since (O') divides (AD) in the given ratio, we can find: O'D = frac{OD}{SD} cdot AD = frac{sqrt{3}}{2sqrt{3}} cdot 3sqrt{3} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} 7. Let’s denote the intersection of our desired plane and (SD) as (O''). Since (AP: PO' = 8), the division ratio is akin to finding that (P) divided the height proportionally: frac{AP}{PO'} = 8 implies frac{O''D}{AD} = frac{8}{9} 8. Calculating (O''D), we have: O''D = frac{8}{9} times O'D = frac{8}{9} times frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} 9. Now, the height from (S) to the new plane is: SC'' = SD - O''D = 2sqrt{3} - frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{6sqrt{3} - 4sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} 10. The given cross-section ((A'',B'',C'')) forms another triangle similar to (triangle ABC), with area ratio in proportion to the squares of the heights.

To find the sum of the exterior angles of a convex n-gon, we first recall some fundamental properties of polygons. 2. The sum of the interior angles of a convex n-gon is given by the formula: [ text{Sum of the interior angles} = 180^circ (n-2) ] This formula is derived from the fact that a convex polygon can be divided into (n-2) triangles, and each triangle has an interior angle sum of 180^circ. 3. Each interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle are supplementary, meaning they sum to 180^circ. Therefore, if we denote an interior angle as theta_i, the corresponding exterior angle is 180^circ - theta_i. 4. The exterior angles at each vertex add up to a straight angle, i.e., 180^circ. For all n vertices, the sum of these straight angles is: [ 180^circ times n ] 5.

We need to mark points Y and Z on edges mathrm{CC}_1 and mathrm{A}_1 mathrm{D}_1 respectively, in such a way that triangle mathrm{XYZ} is equilateral. 1. **Establishing the Position of Point X**: - Given that X divides mathrm{AB} in the ratio 1:2 from A, let the edge length of the cube be a. - Therefore, mathrm{XA} = frac{a}{3} and mathrm{XB} = frac{2a}{3}. 2. **Finding Points Y and Z**: - Mark the point Z on mathrm{A}_1 mathrm{D}_1 such that mathrm{A}_1 mathrm{Z} : mathrm{ZD}_1 = 2 : 1. Hence, mathrm{A}_1 mathrm{Z} = frac{2a}{3} and mathrm{ZD}_1 = frac{a}{3}. - Similarly, mark point Y on mathrm{CC}_1 such that mathrm{C}_1 mathrm{Y} : mathrm{YC} = 2 : 1.

Next, let's investigate each answer option. A: For a + b to be perpendicular to c = (0,1), their dot product should be zero: (a + b) cdot c = (0, 1+x^2) cdot (0,1) = 0 times 0 + (1+x^2) times 1 = 1 + x^2.

Since a+b=(0, 1 + x^2) only has a second component and c=(0,1) only has a second non-zero component as well, a+b can be considered as a scalar multiple of c.

Since -(1+x^2) is always negative for any real x, this dot product cannot be zero; hence, a + b cannot be perpendicular to d. D: For a + b to be parallel to d = (1,-1), one should be a scalar multiple of the other.

(2) From (1), we have f(x)-g(x)=mx- frac {m}{x}-2ln x, Therefore, [f(x)-g(x)]′= frac {mx^{2}-2x+m}{x^{2}}, Since f(x)-g(x) is monotonic on [1,+infty), Thus mx^{2}-2x+mgeqslant 0 or mx^{2}-2x+mleqslant 0 holds on [1,+infty), Since mx^{2}-2x+mgeqslant 0 is equivalent to m(1+x^{2})geqslant 2x, i.e., mgeqslant frac {2x}{1+x^{2}}, and frac {2x}{1+x^{2}}= frac {2}{x+ frac {1}{x}}leqslant frac {2}{2 sqrt {xcdot frac {1}{x}}}=1, hence mgeqslant 1.

First, we find the total number of ways to distribute all books without any restriction. Since there are 4 options (students) for each of the 5 books, this can be done in 4^5 ways. Next, we subtract the distributions where at least one student does not get any book. For any given student, the number of ways for that student to get no books is (4-1)^5 = 3^5. However, since there are 4 students, we multiply this by 4, getting 4 cdot 3^5. We are overcounting the cases where exactly two students get no books. We choose 2 out of 4 students in binom{4}{2} ways, and distribute the books among the remaining 2 students in 2^5 ways. Therefore, we add back binom{4}{2} cdot 2^5. For cases where exactly three students get no books, we've subtracted them three times (one for each student being considered in the second step) and added them back three times in the third step. Therefore, we don't need to adjust for these cases as they have already been excluded.

Consider the number (10! = 3628800). - It is divisible by 10. If we change any digit except the last one, the divisibility by 10 persists. This means that the resulting number cannot end in a prime digit and hence cannot be prime. - If we replace the last digit (0) with any digit from 1 to 9, the resulting number will be of the form (10k + m), where (k) is an integer and (m) is one of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Since (10!) is divisible by 10, the new number is still divisible by the last digit and thus not prime. - If the last digit is replaced by 1, the resulting number is (3628801), which is divisible by 11. Therefore, we cannot obtain a prime number by changing one digit in (10!). 2. Consider the number ((10!)^3). - If any digit except the last digit is altered, the reasoning from the first example applies, i.e., divisibility arguments prevent the number from being prime. - If the last digit is changed from 0 to 1, the number would be ((10!)^3 + 1). We use the identity: [ (10! + 1)((10!)^2 - 10! + 1) = (10!)^3 + 1 ] Here, ((10!)^2 - 10! + 1) is another factor of ((10!)^3 + 1), hence making it a composite number. Therefore, altering one digit in ((10!)^3) cannot produce a prime. 3. Consider the number (19! + 10). - As in the cases above, altering any digit except the last one keeps the properties of the number such that it remains composite. - If the last digit (which is 0) is replaced with 1 to 9, the resultant number takes the form (10k + m). Still not prime due to similar divisibility issues discussed in the earlier examples. Thus, altering one digit in (19! + 10) consistently fails to achieve a prime number.

This implies that ( f(1) = 1 ) since ( f ) is a function from ( mathbb{Q}_{+}^{*} ) to ( mathbb{Q}_{+}^{*} ). 2. **Show that ( f(xy) = f(x) f(y) )**: Consider the equation again and set ( x = frac{1}{f(y)} ): [ fleft(frac{1}{f(y)} f(y)right) = frac{fleft(frac{1}{f(y)}right)}{y}. ] Since ( f(f(1)) = f(1) ) and ( f(1) = 1 ), this simplifies to [ f(1) = frac{fleft(frac{1}{f(y)}right)}{y}. ] Thus, [ 1 = frac{fleft(frac{1}{f(y)}right)}{y}, ] which implies [ fleft(frac{1}{f(y)}right) = y. ] Now set ( z = frac{1}{f(y)} ).

Since the diameter of one hexagon is 1964 meters, this guarantees that adjacent hexagons (which share a side) are exactly 982 meters apart. 4. **Ensuring Minimum Distance Between Same-Colored Hexagons:** To ensure that no two hexagons of the same color are closer than 1966 meters, consider applying a coloring where every color is used in such a pattern that each hexagon is surrounded by a buffer zone of at least two other hexagons of different colors. By using 9 different colors, we can establish a periodic coloring pattern. One common pattern is the arrangement often called the “distance-3 coloring,” where each hexagon’s neighboring hexagons (those sharing a side) all receive different colors, repeated every distance of 3 hexagons. 5. **Pattern Application and Check:** - Suppose we denote the colors by ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_9 ). - Color the hexagons in such a way that each hexagon is surrounded by hexagons of different colors, ensuring that no two hexagons of the same color are adjacent or even two steps away. - This means at least two rows of hexagons must be of a different color before a repeat color appears. 6. **Verification of Distance:** Given this arrangement, the closest pair of points within the same-colored hexagons are separated by more than 1964 meters, specifically: [ sqrt{(3 times 982)^2} = 3 times 982 = 2946 text{ meters} ] which satisfies our requirement that any two points of the same color are more than 1966 meters apart. # Conclusion: By tiling the plane with hexagons of 982 meters side length and using 9 colors in a proper distance-3 pattern, we ensure that any two points of the same color are separated by a distance greater than 1966 meters.

Suppose x_1 < x_2, we have x_2 - x_1 > 0 and thus f(x_2 - x_1) > 1, and f(x_1) > 0. Then: f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f(x_2 - x_1 + x_1) - f(x_1) = f(x_2 - x_1)f(x_1) - f(x_1) = f(x_1)[f(x_2 - x_1) - 1]. Since x_2 - x_1 > 0, we conclude that f(x_2 - x_1) - 1 > 0, which results in f(x_2) - f(x_1) > 0. Therefore, f(x_1) < f(x_2) and we can deduce that f(x) is monotonically increasing over mathbb{R}. Now moving to the inequality f(log_{frac{1}{2}}x) leq frac{1}{f(log_{frac{1}{2}}x + 1)}, let's rewrite it using the property of f(x) as follows: f(log_{frac{1}{2}}x)f(log_{frac{1}{2}}x + 1) leq 1. Since we know: f(0) = 1, text{ and } f(x)f(y) = f(x + y), we can write: f(2log_{frac{1}{2}}x + 1) leq f(0). This simplifies to: 2log_{frac{1}{2}}x + 1 leq 0. Solving this inequality for x, we arrive at: log_{frac{1}{2}}x leq -frac{1}{2}, which leads to: x geq 4.

These points determine (binom{n+1}{3}) triangles. - Each subset of (n) points forms (binom{n}{3}) triangles. - There are (n+1) such subsets, so summing the acute triangles, and noting each triangle is counted (n-2) times, we get: [ p_n cdot binom{n}{3} cdot frac{n+1}{n-2} leq p_n cdot binom{n+1}{3} ] - This shows the proportion (p_{n+1}) of acute triangles in the ((n+1)) points is at most (p_n). Thus, we conclude that the proportion of acute triangles cannot exceed (70%).

The midpoint of AB has coordinates (1,-frac{1}{2}). We aim to find the eccentricity of C. Let's denote the coordinates of A and B as A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}), respectively.

Shade the region below this line since x must be less than or equal to 2y. 3. x leqslant 2 - 2y: The line x = 2 - 2y has a slope of -2, an x-intercept of 2, and a y-intercept of 1. Shade the region below this line since x must be less than or equal to 2 - 2y. The feasible region is the intersection of these three shaded regions. We want to find the maximum value of z = x + y, which corresponds to the highest point on the line z = x + y that intersects the feasible region. To find this point, we can look for the vertices of the feasible region. One vertex is the intersection of the lines x - y = -1 and x = 2y. To find this point, solve the system of equations: begin{cases} x - y = -1 x = 2y end{cases} Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2y - y = -1 Rightarrow y = 1 Then, x = 2(1) = 2. So one vertex is (2, 1). Another vertex is the intersection of the lines x = 2y and x = 2 - 2y. To find this point, solve the system of equations: begin{cases} x = 2y x = 2 - 2y end{cases} Equate the two expressions for x: 2y = 2 - 2y Rightarrow 4y = 2 Rightarrow y = frac{1}{2} Then, x = 2left(frac{1}{2}right) = 1. So another vertex is left(1, frac{1}{2}right). The last vertex is the intersection of the lines x - y = -1 and x = 2 - 2y. To find this point, solve the system of equations: begin{cases} x - y = -1 x = 2 - 2y end{cases} Substitute the second equation into the first equation: (2 - 2y) - y = -1 Rightarrow -3y = -3 Rightarrow y = 1 Then, x = 2 - 2(1) = 0. So the last vertex is (0, 1). Now, we can evaluate z = x + y at each vertex: - At (2, 1): z = 2 + 1 = boxed{3} - At left(1, frac{1}{2}right): z = 1 + frac{1}{2} = boxed{frac{3}{2}} - At (0, 1): z = 0 + 1 = boxed{1} The maximum value of z occurs at the vertex (2, 1). However, this point does not satisfy the original system of inequalities, since x + 2y - 2 = 2 + 2(1) - 2 = 2 > 0.

Show that the value of ( BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 ) is independent of the position of point ( P ). First Solution: 1. **Translation of ( P ) Perpendicularly to ( AB ):** Let's move point ( P ) in a direction perpendicular to the side ( AB ), arriving at a new point ( Q ). Let the perpendicular projections of ( Q ) onto the sides ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) be ( Q_1 ), ( Q_2 ), and ( Q_3 ) respectively. 2. **Analysis of Projections ( Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 ):** Note that ( Q_3 = P_3 ), implying that ( AP_3 ) remains unchanged. Since ( Q ) is derived from moving ( P ) perpendicularly to ( AB ), the distances ( P_1Q_1 ) and ( P_2Q_2 ) are equal and these distances change in opposite senses such that the total sum ( BP_1 + CP_2 ) does not change. 3. **Invariant Sum:** As moving ( P ) perpendicularly to a side does not change the total distance sum, by successive perpendicular steps, a combination of these movements can be constructed to move ( P ) to any point inside the triangle without changing ( BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 ). 4. **Special Position Conclusion:** Observing the triangle’s symmetry and regularity, if point ( P ) is moved to a vertex (for example ( A )), ( P_3 ) would coincide with the midpoint of ( BC ). Since ( P ) is at the vertex ( A ), ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) each reach their respective edge projections. Finally, in the case of vertex positioning: [ BP_1 = CP_2 = frac{a}{2}, quad text{and} quad AP_3 = a ] Thus, we add these distances up: [ BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 = frac{a}{2} + frac{a}{2} + a = 2a ] Given the configuration, it becomes clear: [ BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 = a ] Observing symmetry and applying same logic: [ BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 = boxed{frac{3}{2}a} ] Hence we conclude, the sum ( BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 ) remains invariant independently moving within the triangle ( ABC )."},{"prompt":"Elsa gets 500 MB of cell phone data each month.

The proposition claims that after one step, the obtained pieces will each have a mass smaller than frac{2}{2} = 1 times the mass of the original chocolate. We choose the original chocolate's mass as the unit mass. - In the first step, the largest piece is divided, and as per the problem’s condition, the result will be at least two pieces each with a mass not exceeding half of the original piece's mass. Hence, after the first step, every resulting piece has a mass of at most frac{1}{2} of the original chocolate's mass, which is less than 1 unit mass. Therefore, for k=1, the statement holds true. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that the statement is true for all k < m, i.e., after k steps, every piece of chocolate has a mass less than frac{2}{k+1} times the original mass. 3. **Inductive Step:** We need to show that the statement holds for k=m. **Case 1: m=2r+1 (odd)** - Consider the situation after r steps. According to the induction hypothesis, after r steps, all obtained pieces have a mass of less than frac{2}{r+1} times the original mass. - From this point, further divisions have to respect the rule that the new pieces must be smaller than half of the divided piece's mass. Thus, each resulting piece from step r+1 onwards will have a mass smaller than frac{1}{r+1} of the original mass. - Suppose there are s pieces each with a mass of at least frac{1}{r+1} after r steps. - During the next s steps, each piece must be subdivided, resulting in each new piece having a mass of less than frac{1}{r+1}. - Clearly, since these are the largest pieces, and all subsequent pieces will be smaller. Consequently, after s+r steps, there will be no pieces larger than frac{1}{r+1} remaining. - Since s leq r+1 (if we had s geq r+2, the total mass would exceed 1, which is impossible), the required steps s+r leq 2r+1 = m ensures that: [ text{After m steps} implies text{mass of each piece} < frac{2}{m+1} ] **Case 2: m=2r (even)** - In this case, we consider the mass being smaller than frac{1}{r+1}. We need to show that pieces smaller than frac{1}{r+1} can be broken down to less than frac{2}{m+1}. - For pieces larger than frac{1}{r+1} after r steps, we must ensure that their number cannot exceed r (otherwise their combined mass would surpass 1, which is impossible). - Thus, within the next r steps, the largest pieces must break down into pieces each less than frac{1}{r+1}. Hence, at most after the 2r steps, all resulting pieces will be smaller than frac{2}{m+1}. 4. **Conclusion:** By mathematical induction, the proposition holds true for every k geq 1.

A looping path is a sequence ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{10} ) where each point is visited exactly once, and ( A_{i} ) is adjacent to ( A_{i+1} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 10 ), with ( A_{11} = A_1 ). 2. **Graph Representation**: Imagine each point in the triangular array as vertices in a graph, and edges connect adjacent vertices. The arrangement of the points can be visualized as below, with common numbering of vertices: \`\`\` 1 / 2---3 / / 4---5---6 / / / 7---8---9---10 \`\`\` 3. **Counting Sequences and Loops**: We are interested in sequences that visit all 10 points and return to the starting point, thereby forming a closed loop. Analyze the implications: - Each valid sequence can be thought of as a unique permutation of the 10 points with the additional constraint that each consecutive pair in the permutation is an adjacent pair in the graph. 4. **Adjacency Constraints**: Because each ( A_i ) must be adjacent to ( A_{i+1} ), the sequence effectively traces a path along the edges of the graph. This means the path forms a type of Hamiltonian cycle (a cycle visiting each vertex exactly once). 5. **Corners and Edges**: Consider the three corners of the array (points 1, 4, and 10): - The path must enter and exit from these points in a specific manner to return to the start point and form a closed loop. 6. **Counting the Loops**: From the triangular structure, there are exactly 3 distinct Hamiltonian cycles possible due to the fixed structure and adjacency constraints. These loops can intuitively be described as \\"V-shapes\\" spanning the corners. Here is an illustration of possible sequences: - Corner-focused loops form 3 unique sequences. 7. **Account for Rotations and Reflections**: Each unique path can be travelled starting from any of the 10 points, and each path can be traversed in two directions (clockwise and counterclockwise). - Thus, each Hamiltonian cycle is counted multiple times in this counting process. 8. **Final Calculation**: Given 3 Hamiltonian cycles, for any starting point and direction, the number of such sequences will thus be: [ 10 times 2 times 3 = 60 ] This calculation recognizes the cyclic nature of the paths and covers all possible start points and traversal directions. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{60} ]"},{"prompt":"Koalas absorb only (30%) of the fiber they eat.

Therefore, Zhenya's inability to determine his hat color means either: - Both Lyova and Grisha are wearing black hats. - One wears a black hat, and the other a white hat. 4. **Lyova's Observation**: - Lyova hears Zhenya and knows that either: - Lyova and Grisha both have black hats. - One has a black hat, and the other has a white hat. - If Lyova saw Grisha wearing a white hat, Lyova would infer that his own hat must be black because Zhenya could not have seen two white hats.

To assess the truthfulness of P, we first need to find the eccentricity of the ellipse when m=4. The general formula for the eccentricity e of an ellipse with equation frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 is e = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}}. If m=4, we can identify that a^2=m=4 and b^2=1. Hence, the eccentricity e of the ellipse is: e = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{4}} = sqrt{frac{3}{4}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} Proposition P is a true statement. The converse of proposition P is: \\"If the eccentricity of ellipse C is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, then m=4\\". For an ellipse with its focal points on the x-axis, it is true that if e = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} then m=4. However, if the focal points are on the y-axis, the value of m would be frac{1}{4} in order to maintain the same eccentricity. Hence, the converse is not necessarily true. The inverse of the original proposition P is: \\"If m is not equal to 4, then the eccentricity of ellipse C is not frac{sqrt{3}}{2}\\". The truth value of the inverse is the same as its converse, which is false. The contrapositive of proposition P is: \\"If the eccentricity of ellipse C is not frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, then m is not 4\\". This is true by the definition of contrapositive (if a statement is true, so is its contrapositive).

Extending this to all integers, if we believe such a contradiction, then f(n, m) remains constant across the entire domain, contrary to the fundamental working assumption. - Hence, there must be values n and m where the function f(n, m) takes values greater than k, and similarly for values less than k.

This implies frac{25}{9}a^2 = frac{a^2}{9} + 4c^2, hence c^2 = frac{2}{3}a^2. Since c^2 = a^2 - 4, we have a^2 = 12.

According to the information given, R = 25. 1. The number of tickets sold to the horror movie is 18 more than three times the number of tickets sold to the romance movie. So, if we denote the number of tickets sold to the horror movie as H, we have: H = 3R + 18 Substituting the value of R, we get: H = 3(25) + 18 H = 75 + 18 H = 93 So, 93 tickets were sold to the horror movie. 2.

However, the ratio given implies that the number of comedy tickets must be a whole number that, when multiplied by 5, gives a whole number of horror tickets. Since we know the number of horror tickets is 93, which is a multiple of 5, the number of comedy tickets must be a whole number that, when multiplied by 4, gives a number that is one less than a multiple of 5. The closest whole number to 74.4 that satisfies this condition is 74 (because 74*4 = 296, which is one less than 297, a multiple of 5). So, 74 tickets were sold to the comedy movie.

Each pair ((m, n)) corresponds to different values of ( a = -(m + n) ): [ begin{align*} (-42, -7) & Rightarrow a = -(-42 + (-7)) = -(-49) = 49, (-24, -8) & Rightarrow a = -(-24 + (-8)) = -(-32) = 32, (-18, -9) & Rightarrow a = -(-18 + (-9)) = -(-27) = 27, (-15, -10) & Rightarrow a = -(-15 + (-10)) = -(-25) = 25, (-12, -12) & Rightarrow a = -(-12 + (-12)) = -(-24) = 24, (-5, 30) & Rightarrow a = -(-5 + 30) = -25, (-4, 12) & Rightarrow a = -(-4 + 12) = -8, (-3, 6) & Rightarrow a = -(-3 + 6) = -3, (-2, 3) & Rightarrow a = -(-2 + 3) = -1, (0, 0) & Rightarrow a = -(0 + 0) = 0. end{align*} ] 8.

The right angle is at H in both triangles and A is a common vertex. Hence, triangle BHA sim triangle HEA by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity. 5.

Prove that no other point besides point ( O ) has this property.","completion":"**Step 1:** Given a convex polygon ( A_1 A_2 ldots A_n ), we have a point ( O ) inside the polygon such that any line segment ( O A_i ) contains another vertex ( A_j ). This indicates that for each vertex ( A_i ), there exists a corresponding vertex ( A_j ) such that ( O ) lies on ( A_i A_j ). **Step 2:** Since each ( O A_i ) line contains another vertex ( A_j ), the vertices of the polygon can be paired up such that lines ( A_i A_j ) pass through ( O ). These lines are diagonals of the polygon passing through the common point ( O ). **Step 3:** Because each pair of vertices ((A_i, A_j)) is connected by a diagonal passing through ( O ), the total number of vertices ( n ) must be even. This is because splitting ( n ) vertices into pairs leaves no vertex unpaired, ensuring each diagonal pairs exactly two vertices. **Step 4:** In an even-sided polygon, if vertices are paired as described, there must be ( m ) such pairs, where ( m ) is half of the total number of vertices ( n ) (( m = frac{n}{2} )). **Step 5:** For each diagonal ( A_i A_j ) passing through ( O ), there must be an equal number of vertices on either side of the diagonal. This symmetric configuration is only possible if ( O ) is positioned at the unique intersection point of all these diagonals within the polygon. **Step 6:** Therefore, ( O ) is the intersection point of all diagonals linking pairs of opposite vertices. This point must naturally divide the polygon into two equal parts on each diagonal, which means ( O ) is the unique central point where all diagonals intersect. **Step 7:** The property that any line ( O A_i ) contains another vertex ( A_j ) cannot be satisfied by any other point except ( O ). This is because ( O ) is the only point ensuring that any diagonal ( A_i A_j ) includes exactly two vertices divided by ( O ). **Conclusion:** Thus, ( O ) is the only point inside the convex polygon with the stated property, where each vertex is part of a diagonal passing through ( O ).

So, [ f(x) = overrightarrow{m} cdot overrightarrow{n} = (2cos x)cdot(cos x) + (2sqrt{3}sin x)cdot(cos x). ] Expanding the dot product gives: [ f(x) = 2cos^2 x + 2sqrt{3}sin xcos x. ] Using the trigonometric identities cos 2x = cos^2 x - sin^2 x = 2cos^2 x - 1 and sin 2x = 2sin xcos x, we can rewrite f(x) as: [ f(x) = 2cos^2 x + 2sqrt{3}sin xcos x = cos 2x + 1 + sqrt{3}sin 2x. ] Further simplifying using the sum to product formulas, we get: [ f(x) = 2sin left(2x + frac{pi}{6}right) + 1. ] To find the maximum value of f(x), we need to maximize sin left(2x + frac{pi}{6}right), which reaches its maximum value of 1 when 2x + frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}.

Banker's gain (BG) is the difference between the banker's discount (BD) and the true discount (TD).

Let's denote the sum due 5 years hence as S, the rate of interest as r (12% per annum), and the time as t (5 years). The present value (PV), which is the true discount, can be calculated as: PV = S / (1 + r)^t We don't know the sum S, but we can express the true discount in terms of S: TD = S / (1 + 0.12)^5 Now, we need to find the relationship between the banker's discount and the true discount.

For the first type of goods: - The merchant marks up the goods by 45%, so the new price is 100 + (100 * 0.45) = 100 + 45 = 145. - Then the merchant offers a discount of 15% on the marked price, so the discount is 145 * 0.15 = 21.75. - The final selling price after the discount is 145 - 21.75 = 123.25. For the second type of goods: - The merchant marks up the goods by 75%, so the new price is 100 + (100 * 0.75) = 100 + 75 = 175. - Then the merchant offers a discount of 30% on the marked price, so the discount is 175 * 0.30 = 52.50. - The final selling price after the discount is 175 - 52.50 = 122.50.

Find the maximum number of fat triangles.","completion":"To find the maximum number of fat triangles, we need to count the number of triangles formed by points in ( P ) such that the origin ( O ) is strictly inside the triangle. We will use combinatorial arguments and properties of convex polygons to solve this problem. 1. **Total Number of Triangles:** The total number of triangles that can be formed by 2021 points is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{2021}{3} ] 2. **Non-Fat Triangles:** A triangle is non-fat if the origin ( O ) is not strictly inside it. This can happen in two cases: - The origin lies on one of the sides of the triangle. - The origin lies outside the triangle. To minimize the number of non-fat triangles, we need to consider the configuration of points. We will use the fact that no two points lie on a line through the origin and no three points are collinear. 3. **Configuration and Symmetry:** Consider a regular 2021-gon centered at the origin ( O ). This configuration ensures that no two points lie on a line through the origin and no three points are collinear. Each point on the 2021-gon can be connected to the origin, dividing the plane into 2021 sectors. 4. **Counting Non-Fat Triangles:** For any point ( A ) in ( P ), let ( x ) and ( 2020 - x ) be the number of points on the two sides of the line joining ( A ) with the origin. The number of non-fat triangles with ( A ) as a vertex is: [ binom{x}{2} + binom{2020 - x}{2} ] To minimize this, we use Jensen's inequality, which tells us that the function ( binom{n}{2} ) is convex. Therefore, the minimum value is achieved when ( x ) and ( 2020 - x ) are as equal as possible. 5. **Applying Jensen's Inequality:** Since ( x ) and ( 2020 - x ) should be as equal as possible, we set ( x = 1010 ) and ( 2020 - x = 1010 ).

To keep the cost the same, they would need to spend X on food, not 1.5 * X. To find out how much they need to reduce their consumption, we can set up the following equation: New Consumption * (1.5 * Current Price) = Current Consumption * Current Price Let's denote New Consumption as C_new and Current Consumption as C_current. We know that C_current * Current Price = X (their current food bill). So, we have: C_new * (1.5 * Current Price) = C_current * Current Price Dividing both sides by Current Price, we get: C_new * 1.5 = C_current Now, we want to find C_new, so we divide both sides by 1.5: C_new = C_current / 1.5 This means that the Sims family will have to reduce their consumption to 2/3 (or about 66.67%) of their current consumption to keep their food bill the same after a 50% price increase.

To show this, first consider the homothety centered at G with a ratio of -frac{1}{2}. The reason we're considering this homothety is that it maps lines into lines and scales segments by -frac{1}{2}. Specifically, under this homothety, point P will be mapped to a point Q such that P G : G Q = 2 : 1. 4. Recall a property of the nine-point circle: it is the image of the circumcircle under the homothety centered at the orthocenter H with a coefficient of -frac{1}{2}. Another property of this circle is that G is the homothetic center of the circumcircle and the nine-point circle with a coefficient frac{3}{2}, meaning the nine-point circle is exactly halfway between the circumcircle and the orthocenter of triangle ABC respecting the centroid G. 5. Now, we consider the homothety centered at G with a coefficient frac{1}{2}. Under this transformation, the circumcircle of triangle ABC will map to its nine-point circle. 6.

So, each pattern segment is ( B R R R R B ). 4. **Total Red Beads Calculation:** - Since there are 30 blue beads, assume each blue is separated by 4 red beads (as estimated).

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 72 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 72 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 72000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 20 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while crossing the tunnel using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken to cross the tunnel is given as 74.994 seconds. Total distance covered = Speed * Time Total distance covered = 20 m/s * 74.994 seconds Total distance covered = 1499.88 meters The total distance covered is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the tunnel.

Since the distances from the points to the plane alpha are the same, any three of the points will determine a unique plane parallel to alpha at some distance. Consider first finding a plane equidistant from points A, B, and C. There will be only one such plane because these three points determine a unique plane, and you can find a parallel plane equidistant from all three by taking the midpoint of the segment perpendicular to this plane from the fourth point, D. So, one possible plane alpha. Next, look for planes that are equidistant from A, B, and D. Similarly, there will be one such plane. The same reasoning applies to planes equidistant from A, C, D and B, C, D, resulting in one more plane for each set of three points, giving us three more planes. So far, we have found 4 unique planes that are equidistant from three of the points. However, we have not considered the planes that are not parallel to any of the three-point planes defined above. These planes will cut the tetrahedron formed by the points A, B, C, and D into two parts with equal volumes. Only a plane passing through the centroid of the tetrahedron can cut it this way. Since the centroid of a tetrahedron is the common intersection point of the four medians, from any vertex to the centroid of the opposite face, there is one and only one such plane from each vertex. This gives us 4 more planes. However, one of these is redundant because we are considering the same centroid plane four times. Therefore, we subtract the three redundant planes from the total we had from the parallel consideration. Consequently, the grand total is 4 + 4 - 3 = 5 planes. But wait, there seems to be a discrepancy. We have to go back and consider if we have counted all possibilities. Ah, I realized I did not consider the infinite number of planes that can be equidistant from two pairs of points on opposite sides of the tetrahedron. I have to correct my previous analysis. When considering the four vertices of the tetrahedron, any three of these vertices define one of the four triangular faces of the solid. The mid-plane perpendicular to each face and intersecting the line segment that connects the opposite vertex with the centroid of the face will be at an equal distance from all four points. With four faces, we have four such planes. But that's not all. Given that these are the only planes we've discussed so far, and one should also consider the planes that contain the centroids of opposite edges of the tetrahedron. Due to symmetry, each of these will also be equidistant from all four vertices. There are three pairs of opposite edges in a tetrahedron, resulting in three planes.

First, we know that x=sin a and a is within the interval left[-frac{pi}{4},frac{3pi}{4}right]. 2. By considering the range of a, we determine the possible values of x. Since a is between -frac{pi}{4} and frac{3pi}{4}, the sine function is non-negative in this interval.

For assertion A: Since leftlfloor x rightrfloor leq x by definition, f(x) = x - leftlfloor x rightrfloor must be greater or equal to zero, because it's the difference between x and a smaller or equal integer. Therefore, option A is correct. 2. For assertion B: The range of f(x) is [0, 1), which does not include 1.

When (a-b)^2=0, then |a+b|=2, solving this gives: a=b, so |2b|=2, |b|=1, then a=b=pm1; 2. When (a-b)^2=1, then |a+b|=1, solving this gives: a-b=pm1, a+b=pm1, forming 4 systems of equations: - For a-b=1 and a+b=1, solving this gives: a=1, b=0; - For a-b=1 and a+b=-1, solving this gives: a=0, b=-1; - For a-b=-1 and a+b=1, solving this gives: a=0, b=1; - For a-b=-1 and a+b=-1, solving this gives: a=-1, b=0.

Substituting ( c ) into Equation 2, we get: [ f(f(c)) = 1 - f(c) implies f(c) = 1 - c ] Since ( f(c) = c ), we have: [ c = 1 - c implies 2c = 1 implies c = frac{1}{2} ] Therefore, ( frac{1}{2} ) is a fixed point of ( f ). 3. **Symmetry of the function:** Substitute ( x ) with ( 1 - x ) in Equation 1: [ f(f(1-x)f(x)) = f(1-x) ] Since ( f(1-x) = f(x) ) (as shown in the solution), we have: [ f(f(x)f(1-x)) = f(x) ] This confirms that ( f(1-x) = f(x) ), indicating that ( f ) is symmetric about ( x = frac{1}{2} ). 4. **Evaluate ( f(f(x)) ):** From Equation 2, we have: [ f(f(x)) = 1 - f(x) ] Applying ( f ) again, we get: [ f(f(f(x))) = f(1 - f(x)) ] Since ( f ) is symmetric, ( f(1 - f(x)) = f(f(x)) ).

Calculate Mike's average weekly time spent watching TV and playing video games, considering a 4week time frame.","completion":"First, let's calculate the total time Mike spends watching TV each week. - On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he watches TV for 4 hours each day. So for these three days, he watches a total of 4 hours/day * 3 days = 12 hours. - On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he watches TV for 3 hours each day. So for these two days, he watches a total of 3 hours/day * 2 days = 6 hours. - On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he watches TV for 5 hours each day. So for the two weekend days, he watches a total of 5 hours/day * 2 days = 10 hours. Adding these up, Mike watches a total of 12 hours + 6 hours + 10 hours = 28 hours of TV per week. Now, let's calculate the average time he spends playing video games each week. Since he plays video games for half as long as he watches TV and only on 3 random days a week, we need to find the average daily TV watching time and then halve it. The total TV watching time per week is 28 hours, and there are 7 days in a week, so the average daily TV watching time is 28 hours/week ÷ 7 days/week = 4 hours/day. Since he plays video games for half as long as he watches TV, the average video game playing time per day is 4 hours/day ÷ 2 = 2 hours/day. However, he only plays video games on 3 random days a week, so the total video game playing time per week is 2 hours/day * 3 days/week = 6 hours/week. Now, let's calculate the total average time spent on both activities over a 4-week period. For TV watching: 28 hours/week * 4 weeks = 112 hours over 4 weeks. For video game playing: 6 hours/week * 4 weeks = 24 hours over 4 weeks. Adding these together, the total time spent on both activities over 4 weeks is 112 hours + 24 hours = 136 hours. To find the average weekly time spent on both activities, we divide the total time by 4 weeks: 136 hours / 4 weeks = 34 hours/week.

This property will be crucial in understanding the behavior of both f(x) and g(x). 2. **Determining the nature of f(x):** Given f(x) + g(2-x) = 5, and using the symmetry of g(x), we can substitute g(2+x) for g(2-x), which gives us f(x) + g(2+x) = 5. If we let x be replaced by -x, we get f(-x) + g(2-x) = 5. Since f(x) + g(2-x) = 5 for all x, comparing these equations shows that f(-x) = f(x), indicating that f(x) is an even function. 3. **Finding f(0):** With g(2) = 4 and knowing that f(0) + g(2) = 5, we can solve for f(0) to get f(0) = 1. 4. **Symmetry of f(x) about the point (-1, -1):** From the equation g(x) - f(x-4) = 7, substituting g(2-x) for g(x) gives us g(2-x) = f(-x-2) + 7. Using this in the equation f(x) + g(2-x) = 5, we find that f(x) + f(-x-2) = -2.

According to the problem, the sum of the lengths of all the edges of the rectangular solid is 24, which includes 4 edges of length x on the base, and 4 vertical edges. Each vertical edge length is given by frac{24 - 4x - 4x}{4} = 6 - 2x, where (0 < x < 3). Thus, the volume V(x) of the rectangular solid is given by: V(x) = x^2(6 - 2x), quad(0 < x < 3) To determine the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the function V(x). We first compute the derivative of V(x) with respect to x: V'(x) = 12x - 6x^2 Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points yields: V'(x) = 6x(2 - x) = 0 This equation is satisfied when x = 2, and since V'(x) > 0 for (0 < x < 2) and V'(x) < 0 for (2 < x < 3), the volume V(x) is increasing before x = 2 and decreasing after. Therefore, the volume function V(x) has a unique maximum at x = 2. At this value of x, the height of the rectangular solid is 6 - 2 cdot 2 = 2 meters.

Prove that their common area is at least 2 / 3.","completion":"I. **First Solution** 1. **Initialization**: Since the centroids of the two equilateral triangles coincide, the vertices of the two triangles lie on the same circle. Let's fix one of the triangles and consider the possible placements of the other triangle. 2. **Observation of Overlap**: As observed in the provided figure (1. ábra), we assign an “inner” triangle to every segment of the “outer” triangle not part of the common overlap. 3. **Calculations Related to Areas**: Since one side of each inner-outer pair of triangles is shared, the ratio of their areas is the ratio of their altitudes. The altitude of the inner triangle remains constant—it matches the radius of the circle that can be inscribed in an equilateral triangle. The altitude of the outer triangle is maximized when one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the circle's arc between the other two vertices of the fixed triangle. This outer triangle, in that case, coincides with the inner triangle, meaning their altitudes are equal. Therefore, the altitude of the outer triangles is at most as large as that of the inner triangles. 4. **Comparison of Areas**: Consequently, the sum of the areas of the outer triangles T_k is at most equal to the sum of the areas of the inner triangles T_b, i.e., T_k leq T_b. On the other hand, T_b is precisely the area of the common overlap of the triangles. Thus, the total area of both triangles combined is 2 T_b + T_k, and considering their unit area: [ 2 = 2 T_b + T_k leq 2 T_b + T_b = 3 T_b ] Hence, [ frac{2}{3} leq T_b ] This is the assertion we needed to prove. blacksquare II. **Second Solution** 1. **Fixed Triangles**: The portions of the triangles that do not overlap and are shaded (see 2. ábra) are congruent by rotation and reflection. 2. **Maximizing Area**: By known geometric inequalities, the equilateral triangle has the maximum area among all triangles with the same perimeter. (This is detailed in resources such as Kazarinoff's \\"Geometric Inequalities,\\" pages 57-58.) 3. **Optimal Rotation**: This implies that the remaining area is maximized when the triangles are rotated 60^circ relative to each other. 4. **Subdivision of Areas**: As shown in the figure (3. ábra), in this case, the common overlap can be divided into 6 smaller equilateral triangles, congruent to those cut off from the original triangles. Since the original triangles each contain 9 of these smaller triangles in total, [ text{Area of the common part} = frac{6}{9} = frac{2}{3} ] In any other configuration, the area of the common overlap would be larger.

First, we need to determine how many days are in April. April has 30 days. Jimmy's father was receiving 20 emails a day before subscribing to the news channel.

So, for the first 15 days, he received: 20 emails/day * 15 days = 300 emails Now, we know that by the end of April, he had a total of 675 emails. We can subtract the number of emails he received in the first 15 days from the total number of emails to find out how many emails he received in the last 15 days. 675 total emails - 300 emails from the first half = 375 emails in the last half Now, we need to find out how many additional emails he received per day after subscribing to the news channel. We know he received 375 emails in the last 15 days, so we divide that number by 15 to find the number of emails he received per day in the last half of the month. 375 emails / 15 days = 25 emails/day Since we know he was originally receiving 20 emails per day, we can subtract that from the 25 emails per day he received in the last half of the month to find out how many additional emails he received per day from the news channel. 25 emails/day - 20 emails/day = 5 additional emails/day Therefore, Jimmy's father received boxed{5} additional emails per day after subscribing to the news channel."},{"prompt":"[ 4.65 sin ^{2}left(135^{circ}2 alpharight)sin ^{2}left(210^{circ}2 alpharight)sin 195^{circ} cos left(165^{circ}4 alpharight) ]","completion":"We aim to simplify the given expression: [ 4.65 sin^2left(135^circ - 2alpharight) - sin^2left(210^circ - 2alpharight) - sin 195^circ cos left(165^circ - 4alpharight) ] Step 1: Apply the double-angle identity on the sine terms: The double-angle identity for the sine function sin^2(x) is given by: [ sin^2(x) = frac{1 - cos(2x)}{2} ] **For the first term:** [ sin^2left(135^circ - 2alpharight) = frac{1 - cosleft(2left(135^circ - 2alpharight)right)}{2} = frac{1 - cosleft(270^circ - 4alpharight)}{2} ] **For the second term:** [ sin^2left(210^circ - 2alpharight) = frac{1 - cosleft(2left(210^circ - 2alpharight)right)}{2} = frac{1 - cosleft(420^circ - 4alpharight)}{2} ] Then substituting these identities into the initial problem: Step 2: Transform the expression using the obtained double-angle identities: [ 4.65 left( frac{1 - cosleft(270^circ - 4alpharight)}{2} right) - left( frac{1 - cosleft(420^circ - 4alpharight)}{2} right) - sin 195^circ cos left(165^circ - 4alpharight) ] Step 3: Simplify the constant terms separately: [ = frac{4.65}{2} left(1 - cosleft(270^circ - 4alpharight)right) - frac{1}{2} left(1 - cosleft(420^circ - 4alpharight)right) - sin 195^circ cos left(165^circ - 4alpharight) ] [ = 2.325 (1 - cosleft(270^circ - 4alpharight)) - frac{1}{2} left(1 - cosleft(420^circ - 4alpharight)right) - sin 195^circ cos left(165^circ - 4alpharight) ] Step 4: Combine and further simplify: [ = 2.325 - 2.325 cosleft(270^circ - 4alpharight) - frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} cosleft(420^circ - 4alpharight) - sin 195^circ cos left(165^circ - 4alpharight) ] [ = left(2.325 - frac{1}{2}right) - 2.325 cosleft(270^circ - 4alpharight) + frac{1}{2} cosleft(420^circ - 4alpharight) - sin 195^circ cos left(165^circ - 4alpharight) ] Step 5: Evaluate the trigonometric expressions: Notice that: [ 270^circ - 4alpha = sin(90^circ - theta) = cos theta ] [ 420^circ - 4alpha = 360^circ + 60^circ - 4alpha = sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] Step 6: Recognize trigonometric identities: [ sin (270^circ - 4alpha) = -cos (4alpha) ] [ cos (420^circ - 4alpha) = cos (60^circ - 4alpha) ] Step 7: Combine all parts and obtain the simplified version: [ = frac{1.825}{2} - 2.325 (-cos(4alpha)) + frac{1}{2}cos(4alpha) - sin(360^circ - 4alpha) - sin(30^circ + 4alpha) ] [ = left(frac{2}{2}right) + left(cos(60^circ - 4alpha)right) + sin(4alpha) - sin(4alpha) ] [ = sin(4alpha) ] Conclusion: The expression simplifies to: [ boxed{sin(4alpha)} ]"},{"prompt":"Given vectors overrightarrow{m}=(sin ^{2}x+ frac{1+cos 2x}{2},sin x), overrightarrow{n}=( frac{1}{2}cos 2x frac{ sqrt{3}}{2}sin 2x,2sin x), define the function f(x)= overrightarrow{m}cdot overrightarrow{n}, xin mathbb{R}.

Each cell initially contains one pawn, and we need to determine if it is possible to rearrange the pawns such that each pawn moves to a cell adjacent to its original position. 2. **Important Observation About the Chessboard**: A standard chessboard has alternating black and white cells. Therefore, any black cell is adjacent to white cells and vice versa. This means each cell has neighbors of the opposite color. 3. **Counting Cells of Each Color**: Because the total number of cells is odd, the number of black cells and white cells will not be equal. Specifically, if the number of cells is ( N ) (an odd number), then the number of black cells will be (frac{N-1}{2}) and the number of white cells will be (frac{N+1}{2}) (or vice versa). 4. **Rearranging Pawns on the Chessboard**: For each pawn to move to an adjacent cell of a different color, there would need to be an equal number of black and white cells. This would ensure that every pawn currently on a black cell can move to an adjacent white cell and vice versa. 5. **Contradiction**: Given that the chessboard has an odd number of cells, there cannot be an equal number of black and white cells. Therefore, it is impossible for every pawn to move to an adjacent cell of the opposite color under these circumstances. 6. **Conclusion**: Because it is impossible to have a configuration where each pawn moves to an adjacent cell, given the discrepancy in the number of black and white cells in an odd-numbered chessboard, the required rearrangement of pawns as stated in the problem is not possible. boxed{text{Thus, it is impossible for each pawn to move to an adjacent cell.}}"},{"prompt":"Petya chose a natural number ( a > 1 ) and wrote fifteen numbers on the board: ( 1 + a, 1 + a^2, 1 + a^3, ldots, 1 + a^{15} ).

If such a point exists, find its coordinates; if not, explain why.","completion":"(1) B is given by (0, b) and F_2 by (c, 0) with F_1 symmetrically placed at (-c, 0). Now, since D lies on the negative x-axis, let's set D as D(x_0, 0) with x_0 < 0. We also know that vec{F_2B} = (-c, b) and vec{BD} = (x_0, -b) and these two are perpendicular, hence, their dot product is 0: -cx_0 - b^2 = 0 From this relation, we can find x_0 = -frac{b^2}{c}. By the equation 2vec{F_1F_2} + vec{F_2D} = vec{0}, we have vec{F_2D} = - left( frac{b^2}{c}+c, 0 right) and 2vec{F_1F_2} = (4c, 0). Adding these up gives us the necessary condition: 4c-frac{b^2}{c}=0 Rightarrow b^2 = 3c^2 Given that tan(angle BF_2F_1) = frac{b}{c} = sqrt{3} it follows that angle BF_2F_1 = 60^circ. Therefore, triangle BF_1F_2 is an equilateral triangle. (2) Knowing b = sqrt{3}c, we get a = 2c. D has coordinates (-3c, 0). Since triangle BDF_2 is a right triangle, its circumcircle's center is at F_1 which has coordinates (-c, 0), and its radius would be 2c. Using the distance from F_1 to D as the diameter, we have |(-c)-(-3c)| = 2(2c) Rightarrow c = 1, which then gives us b = sqrt{3} and a = 2.

As M is the reflection of P across the x-axis, we find M is given by (x_1, -y_1). The direction vector of line QM is (x_2 - x_1, y_2 + y_1), so the equation of line QM is: frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{y + y_1}{y_2 + y_1} If we set y=0, we can solve for x as follows: begin{align*} x &= x_1 + frac{y_1(x_2 - x_1)}{y_2 + y_1} &= frac{y_1x_2 + y_2x_1}{y_2 + y_1} &= frac{k(x_1 - 1)x_2 + k(x_2 - 1)x_1}{k(x_2 - 1) + k(x_1 - 1)} &= frac{2kx_1x_2 - k(x_1 + x_2)}{k(x_1 + x_2) - 2k} &= frac{2x_1x_2 - (x_1 + x_2)}{(x_1 + x_2) - 2} &= frac{2left(frac{4k^2 - 12}{3 + 4k^2}right) - left(frac{8k^2}{3 + 4k^2}right)}{left(frac{8k^2}{3 + 4k^2}right) - 2} &= frac{-24}{-6} &= 4 end{align*} Therefore, a point N does exist and its coordinates are: boxed{(4, 0)}"},{"prompt":"There are 5 electronic shops (a, b, c, d, e) in the Naza market.

Similarly, frac{1}{a_i} - frac{1}{a_n} geq frac{n-i}{25}, by a_i geq i we can judge; ④ From ③, combined with the inequality, we can deduce n leq 9.

The point N on the nearest riverbank to B, intersecting the line extended from AN^{prime prime} through B, determines the bridge's position. # Conclusion: By construction, the bridge should be located such that it optimally minimizes the path A M N B by aligning N, N^{prime prime}, and B on a straight path. **2.

This makes AK = L^{prime}L. 2. **Path Equivalence:** We then seek the minimal combination of paths, for example, AK + LM + NB transforming and reflecting it results in AL^{prime} + LM + NB. 3. **Bridge Placement:** To minimize the path AKLMNB, the consideration reduces similarly to the simplest case by aligning subsequent segments. The determination of each segment involves replicating the entire process for each subsequent pair of paths across multiple rivers while maintaining alignment. 4. **Step-by-Step Bridge Placement:** - From point A, draw AL^{prime} perpendicular to the direction of the river and equal to its width. Connect it with point B obtaining segment B with river-crossing adjustments through N^{prime}. - Extend and intersect to find the exact point for optimal bridge placement MN by ensuring alignment of all reflection points AL^{prime} and B through river banks. # Conclusion: The placement of bridge MN and subsequent bridges follows the successive minimal path configuration ensuring each segment aligns with the direct straight path principles through each intermediary reflection. boxed{Solution;Completed.}"},{"prompt":"A plane cuts a sphere with a volume of 4sqrt{3}pi, and the resulting crosssectional area is pi.

We will use the given rules: 1. If ( a ) is removed, then ( 2a ) must also be removed. 2. If ( a ) and ( b ) are removed, then ( a + b ) must also be removed. Let's analyze the problem step-by-step: 1. **Removing the smallest number:** - If we remove 1, then we must also remove 2 (since ( 2 times 1 = 2 )), 3 (since ( 1 + 2 = 3 )), and so on. This will lead to removing all numbers in the set ( A ). Therefore, removing 1 is not optimal. 2. **Removing even numbers:** - Consider removing the even numbers ( 2, 4, 6, ldots, 2(n-1) ). This removes ( n-1 ) numbers. According to the rules, removing these numbers does not force us to remove any additional numbers because: - ( 2a ) for any ( a ) in the set of even numbers is already included in the set of even numbers. - The sum of any two even numbers is also an even number, which is already included in the set of even numbers. 3. **Sum of remaining numbers:** - The sum of the set ( A ) is: [ sum_{k=1}^{2n-1} k = frac{(2n-1) cdot 2n}{2} = n(2n-1) ] - The sum of the removed even numbers is: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2k = 2 sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = 2 cdot frac{(n-1)n}{2} = n(n-1) ] - Therefore, the sum of the remaining numbers is: [ n(2n-1) - n(n-1) = n(2n-1) - n^2 + n = n^2 ] 4. **Verification of optimality:** - By Lemma 1, removing 1 leads to removing all numbers, which is not optimal. - By Lemma 2, removing the even numbers ( 2, 4, ldots, 2(n-1) ) leaves us with a sum of ( n^2 ). - By Lemma 3, any other combination of removed numbers will result in a sum of the remaining numbers that is less than ( n^2 ).
