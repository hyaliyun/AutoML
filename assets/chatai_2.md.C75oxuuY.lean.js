Find the area of the square OABC.","completion":"To determine the area of the square OABC, we must consider the relationship between the square and its orthogonal projection onto the plane forming the parallelogram. The important factor is the angle of inclination of the square with respect to the plane of the projection. Let the side length of the square (OABC) be (a). Then, the area of (OABC) would be (a^2). We need to relate (a) to the side length of the parallelogram (O^1A^1 = 4). Without loss of generality, assume the plane of the parallelogram is horizontal. There are two main scenarios to consider: 1. If the square is parallel to the plane, then its orthogonal projection will also be a square with the same dimensions, and thus (a = O^1A^1 = 4). In this case, the area of the square (OABC) will be equal to the area of the parallelogram. 2. If the square is not parallel to the plane, then its orthogonal projection will be a parallelogram where the side lengths are the lengths of the square's sides when projected orthogonally onto the plane. If (theta) is the angle between the plane of the square and the projection plane, then we have (O^1A^1 = a cos(theta)). Since (O^1A^1 = 4), we have (a cos(theta) = 4). The extreme scenario occurs when the square is tilted such that one of its sides is projected onto a single point, which means (cos(theta) = 0), and this leads to a side of the projection being zero, which would not be consistent with the given conditions. For all other cases, the area can be found as follows: a = frac{4}{cos(theta)} The minimum value of (a) occurs when (theta = 0^circ), which is scenario 1. In any other case, (a) will be larger because (0 < cos(theta) leq 1). Thus, the minimum area of square (OABC) occurs when (a = 4), which means the minimum area is (4^2 = 16). The maximum area scenario is less straightforward because while the side length of the parallelogram remains constant, the area of the square increases as (theta) increases from (0^circ) until a side is projected onto a single point. That said, without more information (such as the length of the other side of the parallelogram), we cannot find an exact maximum area. To conclude, the minimum area of square (OABC) is (boxed{16}), and the maximum area cannot be determined from the given information."},{"prompt":"Let M={1,2,...,n} .

Since the profit share is directly proportional to the amount invested and the time period for which the investment is made, we can write the following equations based on the information provided: Let the total profit be \\"P\\". Then, the profit shares of A, B, and C would be in the ratio of their investments, given that they invested for the same time period. So, the profit share of A would be (x/P), the profit share of B would be (10000/P), and the profit share of C would be (12000/P). Given that the profit share of B is Rs. 3500, we can write: 10000/P = 3500 From this, we can find P (total profit): P = 10000 / 3500 P = 20/7 Now, we know the difference between the profit shares of A and C is Rs. 1399.9999999999998 (which we can round to Rs. 1400 for simplicity). So we can write: (x/P) - (12000/P) = 1400 Substituting the value of P we found earlier: (x/(20/7)) - (12000/(20/7)) = 1400 Multiplying both sides by (20/7) to clear the fraction, we get: 7x/20 - 7*12000/20 = 1400 * (20/7) Simplifying, we get: 7x/20 - 8400/20 = 4000 Multiplying both sides by 20 to clear the fraction, we get: 7x - 8400 = 80000 Now, we solve for x: 7x = 80000 + 8400 7x = 88400 Dividing both sides by 7, we get: x = 88400 / 7 x = 12628.57142857143 So, A invested approximately Rs. boxed{12628.57} ."},{"prompt":"The parabola y=(x+3)^{2} is shifted down by 1 unit length, and then shifted to the right by ______ units length.

This transformation maps the equilateral triangles to right isosceles triangles. - This transformation preserves the area ratios, so the area calculations remain valid under this transformation. 3. **Applying Pick's Theorem**: - Pick's Theorem relates the area ( A ) of a simple polygon with integer coordinates to the number of interior points ( I ) and boundary points ( B ): [ A = I + frac{B}{2} - 1 ] - In our case, the polygon ( S ) uses all 210 points exactly once, and since it is a closed non-self-intersecting polygon, all points are boundary points. Thus, ( I = 0 ) and ( B = 210 ). 4. **Calculating the Area**: - Substituting ( I = 0 ) and ( B = 210 ) into Pick's Theorem: [ A = 0 + frac{210}{2} - 1 = 105 - 1 = 104 ] - This area is in the transformed grid where the triangles are right isosceles triangles. 5. **Transforming Back to the Original Grid**: - The area calculated in the transformed grid needs to be converted back to the original equilateral triangle grid. - The area of an equilateral triangle with side length 1 is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ). The transformation scales the area by a factor of ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ) (since the height of the equilateral triangle is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ) times the side length). - Therefore, the area in the original grid is: [ A_{text{original}} = 104 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 52sqrt{3} ] The final answer is (boxed{52sqrt{3}})."},{"prompt":"Let (A=(0,6)) and (B=(0,10)).

To convert km/hr to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hr): Relative speed in m/s = 90 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hr) Relative speed in m/s = 90 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 90 * (10 / 36) Relative speed in m/s = 90 * (5 / 18) Relative speed in m/s = 25 m/s Now, we need to find the time it takes for the train to pass the man.

We can complete the square to better understand the behavior of the function: y = x^2 - 2x = (x - 1)^2 - 1. The graph of this parabola is symmetric about the vertical line x = 1, and it opens upwards since the coefficient of the x^2 term is positive. Given the domain [0, 3], we need to find the minimum and maximum values of the function within this interval to determine the range. In the interval [0, 1], the function is monotonically decreasing because the vertex of the parabola is at x = 1, and we're looking at the left side where x is less than 1. As x moves from 0 to 1, the square term (x - 1)^2 becomes smaller (as it approaches zero), and hence y becomes smaller. In the interval [1, 3], the function is monotonically increasing because we're now on the right side of the vertex. As x moves from 1 to 3, the square term (x - 1)^2 increases, and hence y increases. Since the vertex is at x = 1, the minimum value of y within the domain [0, 3] occurs at x = 1: y_{text{min}} = (1 - 1)^2 - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1. The maximum value of y within the domain [0, 3] occurs at the endpoints, x = 0 or x = 3, since the function is increasing after x = 1. When x = 3, we have: y_{text{max}} = (3 - 1)^2 - 1 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. Note that at x = 0, the value of y is 0 - 0 - 1 = -1, which is not higher than the value at x = 3. Consequently, the minimum value is y_{text{min}} = -1 and the maximum value is y_{text{max}} = 3 within the given domain.

We can reformat this expression as follows: [ f(z) + (z - x) leq f(f(f(x))) ] Simplifying, this gives: [ f(z) + z leq f(f(f(x))) + x ] 3. Now, substitute ( z = f(f(x)) ): [ f(f(f(x))) + f(f(x)) leq f(f(f(x))) + x ] This simplifies to: [ f(f(x)) leq x ] 4. Substitute ( f(x) ) in place of ( x ) in the inequality above: [ f(f(f(x))) leq f(x) ] 5. Combining these results, we obtain the following chain of inequalities: [ f(z) + z leq f(f(f(x))) + x leq f(x) + x ] From this, we infer that: [ f(z) + z leq f(x) + x ] 6.

The volume (V) of a tetrahedron is given by: [ V = frac{1}{3} times text{Base Area} times text{Height} ] 4. **First Calculation of Volume**: Consider tetrahedron (FGMP) with base (triangle FGM) and height (GP): - (triangle FGM) is a right-angled triangle at (G) with (FG = GM = 200). - The area of (triangle FGM) is: [ text{Area}_{FGM} = frac{1}{2} times 200 times 200 = 20000 ] - Therefore, the volume with (GP = x) as height is: [ V = frac{1}{3} times 20000 times x ] 5. **Second Calculation of Volume**: Consider tetrahedron (FGMP) with base (triangle PFM): - The shortest distance from (G) to any point inside (triangle PFM) is 100, meaning the height is 100. - Next, calculate the side lengths for (triangle PFM): - Distance (FM) using the Pythagorean theorem: [ FM = sqrt{FG^2 + GM^2} = sqrt{200^2 + 200^2} = 200sqrt{2} ] - Distances (FP) and (MP) are ( sqrt{200^2 + x^2} = sqrt{x^2 + 40000} ). 6. **( triangle PFM) Is Isosceles**: Since (triangle PFM) is isosceles with (FP = MP), let (T) be the midpoint of (FM): [ FT = TM = frac{FM}{2} = 100sqrt{2} ] 7. **Calculate (PT)**: Since (PT) is perpendicular to (FM): [ PT = sqrt{FP^2 - FT^2} = sqrt{(sqrt{x^2 + 40000})^2 - (100sqrt{2})^2} = sqrt{x^2 + 40000 - 20000} = sqrt{x^2 + 20000} ] 8. **Area of (triangle PFM)**: [ text{Area}_{PFM} = frac{1}{2} times FM times PT = frac{1}{2} times 200 sqrt{2} times sqrt{x^2 + 20000} ] 9. **Volume of Tetrahedron**: With base (triangle PFM) and height (100): [ V = frac{1}{3} times left( frac{1}{2} times 200 sqrt{2} times sqrt{x^2 + 20000} right) times 100 ] 10. **Equate Both Volumes**: [ 20000x = frac{1}{3} times 200 sqrt{2} times sqrt{x^2 + 20000} times 100 ] Simplifying, begin{align*} 20000x &= frac{1}{2} times 200 sqrt{2} times 100 times sqrt{x^2 + 20000} 20000x &= 10000 sqrt{2} times sqrt{x^2 + 20000} 2x &= sqrt{2} sqrt{x^2 + 20000} 4x^2 &= 2(x^2 + 20000) 4x^2 &= 2x^2 + 40000 2x^2 &= 40000 x^2 &= 20000 x &= sqrt{20000} = 100sqrt{2} end{align*} 11. **Determine (HP)**: [ HP = 200 - x = 200 - 100sqrt{2} approx 200 - 141.42 = 58.58 ] # Conclusion: The closest length among the given answers is approximately 59.

Show that it is possible to select ( p ) of these grid points such that no three of them are collinear.","completion":"1. **Define the Points**: Let ( p ) be an odd prime number. We consider points on the plane where both coordinates are integers from the set ({0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1}). We seek to select ( p ) points such that no three of them are collinear. 2. **Construct the Points**: We will demonstrate that the points ( A_i = (i, i^2 ; text{mod} ; p) ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, p-1 ) satisfy the required condition. Here, ( y(i) = i^2 ) is the least non-negative remainder of ( i^2 ) when divided by ( p ). Formally, ( y(i) = i^2 + c cdot p ) for some integer ( c ), which ensures that ( y(i) ) is within the range ( [0, p-1] ). 3. **Investigate Collinearity**: Assume for contradiction that points ( A_i, A_j, A_k ) with ( i, j, k ) distinct, are collinear. The slope between any two points must be the same, hence: [ frac{y(j) - y(i)}{j - i} = frac{y(k) - y(i)}{k - i} ] 4. **Clear Denominators** and Substitute ( y(i) ): [ frac{j^2 - i^2 + v cdot p}{j - i} = frac{k^2 - i^2 + w cdot p}{k - i} ] Where ( y(j) = j^2 + v cdot p ) and ( y(k) = k^2 + w cdot p ). Multiplying both sides by the denominators to clear them, we get: [ (k - i)(j^2 - i^2 + v cdot p) = (j - i)(k^2 - i^2 + w cdot p) ] 5. **Expand and Rearrange**: Expanding both sides, we get: [ (k - i)(j^2 - i^2 + v cdot p) = (j - i)(k^2 - i^2 + w cdot p) ] Simplify and factor: [ (k - i)(j - i)(j + i) + (k - i)v cdot p = (j - i)(k - i)(k + i) + (j - i)w cdot p ] Cancel common terms: [ (k - j)(j + k) = p left( (j - i)w - (k - i)v right) ] 6. **Divisibility Argument**: For the above relation to hold, the left-hand side must be divisible by ( p ) because ( p ) is prime. Since ( j neq k ), ( i neq k ), and ( i neq j ), each term ( j, k, i ) is distinct and less than ( p ). None of ( (k - j)(j + k) ) are zero modulo ( p ), thereby contradicting that the prime ( p ) divides ( (k - j)(j + k) ). Hence, the assumption is invalid. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, no set of three points among the ( p ) selected points ( { (i, i^2 ; text{mod} ; p) mid i = 0, 1, ldots, p-1 } ) is collinear. Thus, we have demonstrated the existence of ( p ) points satisfying the condition.

Since each number has exactly one other number that adds up to 7 with it (for example, 1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 4), there are 4 valid choices for the second face. 3. **Calculating the Total Choices:** Multiplying the choices for the first and second faces gives us 6 times 4 = 24. However, this counts each pair twice (once for each order of selection), so we must divide by 2 to correct for overcounting. 4. **Final Calculation:** The correct total number of ways is 24 / 2 = 12. Therefore, the number of ways to paint two faces of a die red, so that the numbers on the red faces don't add up to 7, is boxed{12}. # Alternative Neat Way: 1. **Observation:** On a standard die, numbers that add up to 7 are on opposite faces. Therefore, to avoid sums of 7, we must choose two faces that are not opposite. 2. **Choosing Faces Based on Edges:** Since two non-opposite faces must share an edge, and each pair of such faces corresponds to one edge of the die, we can directly count the choices by counting the edges of the die. 3. **Counting Edges:** A cube, like a die, has 12 edges. 4. **Conclusion:** Since there is exactly one pair of non-opposite faces for each edge, there are 12 valid choices for painting two faces red without their numbers adding up to 7.

Since ( F_{n} = 2^{2^{n-1}} + 1 ) and ( F_{m} = 2^{2^{m-1}} + 1 ), we focus on their difference to find a contradiction: [ d mid (F_{n} - F_{m}) = left(2^{2^{n-1}} + 1right) - left(2^{2^{m-1}} + 1right) = 2^{2^{n-1}} - 2^{2^{m-1}}. ] Notice that ( 2^{2^{n-1}} ) is much larger than ( 2^{2^{m-1}} ). Hence, we can compute the difference: [ 2^{2^{n-1}} - 2^{2^{m-1}}. ] 5. **Conclude ( d mid 2 ):** On substituting back into our identity, we find: [ d mid left( F_{n} - F_1 F_2 cdots F_{n-1} right). ] As established, ( F_1 F_2 cdots F_{n-1} = F_n - 2 ), implying: [ d mid 2. ] 6. **Odd Numbers:** We note that each ( F_k ) is odd because: [ 2^{2^{k-1}} text{ is even, so } 2^{2^{k-1}} + 1 text{ is odd}. ] Thus, ( F_n ) and ( F_m ) being odd implies ( d neq 2 ). 7. **Conclude Relatively Prime:** Since ( d mid 2 ) and ( d neq 2 ), we have ( d = 1 ). # Conclusion: The numbers ( F_n ) and ( F_m ) are relatively prime, hence: [ boxed{1} ]"},{"prompt":"Solve the equation [2x^2 = frac{4x+2}{x2}.]","completion":"Start by multiplying both sides of the equation by x-2 (assuming x neq 2 to avoid division by zero): [ -2x^2(x-2) = 4x + 2, text{ or } -2x^3 + 4x^2 = 4x + 2. ] Rearranging terms gives: [ 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2 = 0. ] Factor out 2: [ 2(x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x + 1) = 0. ] Further simplification: [ x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0. ] Recognize this as: [ (x-1)^3 = 0. ] Thus, [ x-1 = 0 Rightarrow x = 1. ] Conclusion: The only solution to the equation is x = boxed{1}."},{"prompt":"The coordinates of the focus of the hyperbola C:{y}^{2}frac{{x}^{2}}{3}=1 are ( ).

For a hyperbola of the form {y}^{2}-frac{{x}^{2}}{a^2}=1, the semi-major axis a is given directly by comparing it to the standard form, yielding a=1. The term under the x^2 gives us frac{1}{a^2} = frac{1}{3}, so a^2 = 3, but since a=1, this term actually represents b^2, where b is the semi-minor axis. Thus, b=sqrt{3}. The distance from the center to a focus, c, for a hyperbola, is found using the equation c^2 = a^2 + b^2.

By the given function, f'(x) = x - frac{a}{1-x} = frac{-x^2 + x - a}{1-x}. (i) If a geq frac{1}{4}, then -x^2 + x - a leq 0, thus f'(x) leq 0. The only case when f'(x) = 0 is when a = frac{1}{4} and x = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, f(x) is strictly decreasing on (-infty, 1).

Therefore, f(x) is strictly decreasing on (-infty, frac{1 - sqrt{1-4a}}{2}) and strictly increasing on (frac{1 - sqrt{1-4a}}{2}, 1). In summary, when a geq frac{1}{4}, the function f(x) is strictly decreasing on (-infty, 1); when 0 < a < frac{1}{4}, the function f(x) is strictly decreasing on (-infty, frac{1 - sqrt{1-4a}}{2}) and (frac{1 + sqrt{1-4a}}{2}, 1), and strictly increasing on (frac{1 - sqrt{1-4a}}{2}, frac{1 + sqrt{1-4a}}{2}); when a leq 0, the function f(x) is strictly decreasing on (-infty, frac{1 - sqrt{1-4a}}{2}) and strictly increasing on (frac{1 - sqrt{1-4a}}{2}, 1). **(2)** From part (1), we know that f(x) has two extreme points if and only if 0 < a < frac{1}{4}. Since the extreme points x_1 and x_2 satisfy -x^2 + x - a = 0, we have x_1 + x_2 = 1 and x_1x_2 = a. This implies 0 < x_1 < frac{1}{2}. Consider f(x_2) - x_1 = frac{1}{2}x_2^2 + a ln(1-x_2) - x_1 = frac{1}{2}(1-x_1)^2 + x_1x_2 ln x_1 - x_1 = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2}x_1^2 - 2x_1 + x_1(1-x_1)ln x_1. Define g(x) = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2x + x(1-x)ln x for 0 < x < frac{1}{2}. Then, g'(x) = x - 2 + (1-2x)ln x + x(1-x) cdot frac{1}{x} = (1-2x)ln x - 1. When x < frac{1}{2}, (1-2x)ln x < 0, so g'(x) < 0. Thus, g(x) is strictly decreasing on (0, frac{1}{2}). Also, g(frac{1}{2}) = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{8} - 1 + frac{1}{4}lnfrac{1}{2} = -frac{3 + ln 4}{8}. Therefore, g(x) > g(frac{1}{2}) = -frac{3 + ln 4}{8}, which implies f(x_2) - x_1 > -frac{3 + ln 4}{8}.

There are two types of adjacencies to consider: horizontal and vertical. - **Horizontal Adjacencies:** Each row of the 8x8 grid has 7 horizontal edges, and there are 8 such rows: [ 8 times 7 = 56 ] - **Vertical Adjacencies:** Each column of the 8x8 grid has 7 vertical edges, and there are 8 such columns: [ 8 times 7 = 56 ] Adding these together, the total number of shared sides (adjacencies) is: [ 56 + 56 = 112 ] 3. **Comparing Pairs to Edges:** We compare the total number of color pairs (120) to the total number of adjacencies (112): [ 120 > 112 ] Since the number of color pairs (120) exceeds the number of adjacencies (112), it is mathematically impossible to have every pair of different colors share a side. # Conclusion Therefore, it is not possible to color the squares of an 8x8 grid in 16 colors such that any two cells of different colors share at least one side in common.

Substituting the coordinates of point M(sqrt{3},frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) into the ellipse equation frac{x^{2}}{4c^{2}}+frac{y^{2}}{3c^{2}}=1, we find c=1. Thus, the equation of the ellipse is frac{x^{2}}{4}+frac{y^{2}}{3}=1. (II) The equation of line OM is easily found to be y=frac{1}{2}x. When the slope of line l does not exist, the midpoint of AB will not be on the line y=frac{1}{2}x. Therefore, the slope of line l does exist. Let the equation of line l be y=kx+m (mneq 0). Combining it with the ellipse equation and eliminating y, we get: (3+4k^{2})x^{2}+8kmx+4m^{2}-12=0 The discriminant is Delta=48(3+4k^{2}-m^{2}) > 0. Let A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}).

Since N is on the line y=frac{1}{2}x, we have frac{3m}{3+4k^{2}}=frac{1}{2}times(-frac{4km}{3+4k^{2}}), which gives k=-frac{3}{2}. So, Delta=48(12-m^{2}) > 0, which implies -sqrt{12} < m < sqrt{12} and mneq 0. |AB|=sqrt{1+k^{2}}|x_{1}-x_{2}|=sqrt{1+(-frac{3}{2})^{2}}timessqrt{(x_{1}+x_{2})^{2}-4x_{1}x_{2}}=frac{sqrt{39}}{6}sqrt{12-m^{2}}, and the distance d from the origin O to line l is d=frac{2|m|}{sqrt{13}}.

To find out how many more pencils are needed per classroom, we divide the total shortage by the number of classrooms: 85 pencils needed / (6 classrooms + 9 classrooms) = 85 pencils needed / 15 classrooms ≈ 5.666... pencils needed per classroom Again, since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, we'll round up to the nearest whole number because we can't give a classroom less than a whole pencil. So each classroom is short by 6 pencils. Now, let's find out the total number of pencils that must be purchased: 6 classrooms (from Box A) * 6 pencils needed per classroom = 36 pencils needed for classrooms from Box A 9 classrooms (from Box B) * 6 pencils needed per classroom = 54 pencils needed for classrooms from Box B Total pencils needed = 36 pencils (for Box A classrooms) + 54 pencils (for Box B classrooms) = 90 pencils Therefore, the store must purchase boxed{90} pencils to fulfill the school's needs."},{"prompt":"Two concentric circles have radii (3) and (5).

A subset ( Y subset X ) is called independent if there are no ( a, b in Y ) such that ( a prec b ). 2. **Goal:** We aim to prove that an independent set ( Y ) contains at most 48 elements. 3. **Partition ( X ) by the sum of coordinates:** For ( j = 0, 1, ldots, 21 ), define [ X_j = {(a_1, a_2, a_3) in X mid a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = j}. ] 4. **Define successors and predecessors:** If ( x prec y ) and ( x in X_j ), ( y in X_{j+1} ) for some ( j ), then ( y ) is called a successor of ( x ), and ( x ) is a predecessor of ( y ). 5. **Prove the lemma for successors:** **Lemma:** If ( A ) is an ( m )-element subset of ( X_j ) and ( j leq 10 ), then there are at least ( m ) distinct successors of the elements of ( A ). **Proof of Lemma:** For ( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 ), define [ X_{j, k} = {(a_1, a_2, a_3) in X_j mid min(a_1, a_2, a_3, 7 - a_1, 7 - a_2, 7 - a_3) = k}. ] It is easy to verify that every element of ( X_{j, k} ) has at least two successors in ( X_{j+1, k} ), and every element of ( X_{j+1, k} ) has at most two predecessors in ( X_{j, k} ). Therefore, the number of elements of ( A cap X_{j, k} ) is not greater than the number of their successors. Since ( X_j ) is a disjoint union of ( X_{j, k} ), ( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 ), the lemma follows. 6. **Analogous statement for predecessors:** Similarly, elements of an ( m )-element subset of ( X_j ) for ( j geq 11 ) have at least ( m ) predecessors. 7. **Transform the independent set ( Y ):** Let ( Y ) be an independent set, and let ( p ) and ( q ) be integers such that ( p < 10 < q ). Transform ( Y ) by replacing all elements of ( Y cap X_p ) with their successors, and all elements of ( Y cap X_q ) with their predecessors. After this transformation, ( Y ) will still be independent, and by the lemma, its size will not be reduced. Every independent set can eventually be transformed in this way into a subset of ( X_{10} ). 8. **Bound on the size of ( X_{10} ):** The set ( X_{10} ) has exactly 48 elements. # Conclusion: Thus, the maximum number of elements in an independent set is 48.

This means that the graph of the function y=frac{2}{x} will be located in the first and third quadrants of the Cartesian coordinate system. 2. In the context of the inverse proportion function, particularly y=frac{2}{x}, as x increases, y decreases within each of the quadrants where the graph is present (the first and third quadrants).

Hence, the total area (A) is: [ A = A_{1} + A_{2} = A_{1} + 2A_{1} = 3A_{1} ] Since (A_{2} = 2A_{1}), the ratio of their areas directly translates to the square of the similarity ratio (k): [ left( frac{text{side of smaller triangle}}{text{side of larger triangle}} right)^2 = frac{A_{1}}{3A_{1}} = frac{1}{3} ] 4. **Similarity Ratio Calculation**: The similarity ratio (side length ratio) (k) is therefore ( sqrt{frac{1}{3}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ). 5. **Determining the Length of the Segment**: Since the line divides the triangle's area in half and is parallel to the base, it divides the sides proportionally: [ text{Length of the segment} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} times 36 ] [ text{Length of the segment} = frac{36}{sqrt{2}} = 18sqrt{2} ] 6. **Conclusion**: The length of the segment created by the line parallel to the base of the triangle is: [ boxed{18sqrt{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Robin's hair was 14 inches long.

Therefore, we have: [ A_{KLMN} = frac{1}{2} cdot A_{ABCD} ] 4. **Considering Movement of Points:** - Assume point K is fixed on side AB and point M moves along side CD from C to D. Since A_{KLMN} is half of A_{ABCD} and changes monotonically as M moves, there is exactly one position of M for which this condition is satisfied. 5. **Monotonic Variation:** - As point M moves from C to D, the shape of KLMN changes, leading the area A_{KLMN} to either increase or decrease monotonically. Hence, there is only one possible value where A_{KLMN} equals frac{1}{2} A_{ABCD}. 6. **Conclusion via Parallelism:** - For the area A_{KLMN} to be exactly half of A_{ABCD} at a particular instance, we consider that the diagonals LN or KM of KLMN need specific alignment. - If we assume that LN is not parallel to AB, then when M moves, only fixed L and N positions can maintain the half-area relationship due to monotonic change, proving MK parallelism. - When MK becomes parallel to AD and BC, this positional fix ensures A_{KLMN} conditions. Thus, one of the diagonals of quadrilateral KLMN is parallel to one of the sides of the parallelogram ABCD. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Joe had 50 toy cars.

Lines l_{1} and l_{2}, being perpendicular and passing through A(0,1), form a rectangle with the circle at points where they intersect the circle. Step 2: Use the Properties of the Rectangle Let E and F be the midpoints of the chords intercepted by lines l_{1} and l_{2} on circle C. Since AECF forms a rectangle due to the perpendicular nature of l_{1} and l_{2}, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to this rectangle.

Construct the set ( B = bigcup_{varepsilon > 0} bar{A}_varepsilon ). By definition, for all omega in B, f_n(omega) rightarrow f(omega) uniformly as every bar{A}_varepsilon subseteq B and within each bar{A}_varepsilon the uniform convergence holds. 6.

Because B = bigcup_{varepsilon > 0} bar{A}_varepsilon has full measure relative to Omega (meaning mu(B) = mu(Omega)), the convergence f_n(omega) rightarrow f(omega) happens almost everywhere in Omega. 8.

Let line ( h ) intersect two lines ( a ) and ( b ) at point ( A ) and be perpendicular to both.

Any vector ( vec{c} ) in the plane can be written as: [ vec{c} = x vec{a} + y vec{b} ] for some scalars ( x ) and ( y ). 9. **Dot Product Calculation**: The dot product of ( vec{h} ) with ( vec{c} ) is: [ vec{h} cdot vec{c} = vec{h} cdot (x vec{a} + y vec{b}) = x (vec{h} cdot vec{a}) + y (vec{h} cdot vec{b}) ] Given ( vec{h} perp vec{a} ) and ( vec{h} perp vec{b} ): [ vec{h} cdot vec{a} = 0 quad text{and} quad vec{h} cdot vec{b} = 0 ] Therefore, [ vec{h} cdot vec{c} = x cdot 0 + y cdot 0 = 0 ] Hence, ( vec{h} perp vec{c} ).

Let's start by using properties of inequalities involving powers of 10 and the number of digits in a number. Specifically, for a natural number A: [ 10^{k-1} < A < 10^k ] This inequality tells us that the decimal representation of A consists of k digits. Proof Steps: 1. Consider the number 2002^n. Since 2002^n is not a power of 10, there exists an integer k such that: [ 10^{k-1} < 2002^n < 10^k ] This implies that 2002^n has k digits. 2. Now, consider the number 2002^n + 2^n. We need to show that this number also has k digits. 3. Notice that 2^n is a much smaller number compared to 2002^n. We will analyze how the addition affects the number of digits. - We know from the properties of exponents and logarithms that 2002^n grows much faster than 2^n. - Specifically, 2002^n + 2^n cannot exceed 10^k because 2^n is considerably smaller, and adding it to 2002^n will not be enough to reach the next power of 10. 4. Formally, consider the nearest higher multiple of 2^n to 2002^n, which is 2002^n + 2^n. Since: [ 2002^n + 2^n < 2002^n + 2002^n = 2 cdot 2002^n < 10^{k+1} ] 5. From 10^{k-1} < 2002^n < 10^k, it follows directly: [ 10^{k-1} < 2002^n + 2^n < 10^k ] 6. Divide the inequality 2002^n + 2^n < 10^k by 2002^n yields: [ 1 + frac{2^n}{2002^n} < frac{10^k}{2002^n} ] Given that k > n and because both 2002^n and 10^k are integers: [ 1 + frac{2^n}{2002^n} < 2 ] 7. Therefore, the right side still holds to k digits since adding 2^n does not result in an increment to the next higher power of 10. 8. Due to this analysis, 2002^n + 2^n does not reach 10^k. In conclusion, both 2002^n and 2002^n + 2^n contain the same number of digits in their decimal representation.

When three people share a carriage, there are two carriages empty. This means that the total number of carriages is the number of carriages used by the people plus the two empty ones. Since each carriage is shared by three people, the number of carriages used is frac{x}{3}. Therefore, the total number of carriages is frac{x}{3} + 2. 2. When two people share a carriage, nine people have to walk. This means that not all people can be accommodated in the carriages when each carriage is shared by two people.

We proceed to verify each of the four propositions: For proposition ①, we want to show that left{left(frac {1}{2}right)^{a_n}right} is a geometric sequence. To do that, we check if the ratio between consecutive terms is constant: frac{left(frac{1}{2}right)^{a_{n+1}}}{left(frac{1}{2}right)^{a_n}} = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{a_{n+1} - a_n} = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{d}.

Rahul's work rate is ( frac{1}{3} ) of the work per day, since he can complete the work in 3 days. Rajesh's work rate is ( frac{1}{R} ) of the work per day. When they work together, their combined work rate is ( frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{R} ) of the work per day.

So, we need to find the ratio of their work rates to divide the 250 proportionally. Rahul's work rate to Rajesh's work rate is ( frac{1/3}{1/R} = frac{R}{3} ). Since Rahul gets 100, let's assume Rajesh gets ( 250 - 100 = 150 ). The ratio of their earnings is ( frac{100}{150} = frac{2}{3} ). So, we have ( frac{R}{3} = frac{2}{3} ).

Because we are working with arcs of a unit circle, we can represent the mass of the arcs in terms of their length. Assume the arcs are made of wire with a linear density of (1). Therefore, the mass of arc (ACB) is (2alpha), and the mass of arc (A_1CB_1) is (2beta). 3. Due to symmetry about (OC), the center of mass of the arcs (AA_1) and (BB_1) lies on (OC). 4.

Here, (f(p)) is defined as the smallest positive integer (a) such that there does not exist an integer (n) satisfying (p mid n^2 - a). 1. Identifying Quadratic Nonresidues: A quadratic nonresidue (a) modulo (p) is an integer for which there is no integer (n) such that (n^2 equiv a (text{mod} p)). The smallest such (a) is typically a prime number. We are interested in finding the smallest quadratic nonresidue for each odd prime (p). 2. Heuristic Argument: We use a heuristic that treats the values (left(frac{p_1}{q}right), left(frac{p_2}{q}right), ldots), where (q) is a uniformly random prime, as independent coin flips (heads being (1) and tails being (-1), each with probability (frac{1}{2})). For large (N), the joint distributions of (left(frac{p_1}{q}right), ldots, left(frac{p_n}{q}right)), where (q) is a uniformly random prime less than (N), converges to (n) independent coin flips. This insight helps to model the finding of the smallest quadratic nonresidue. 3. Modeling the Finding Process: Given the heuristic, we model the search for the smallest quadratic nonresidue as flipping independent fair coins for each prime, continuing until we find the first \\"heads\\". This translates into estimating (f(p)^2) by summing up the squares of prime numbers weighted by ( frac{1}{2^n} ). 4.

Additionally, the vertex of the parabola, point E, lies on the segment AD. 2. **Symmetry of the Parabola**: Noting that a parabola is symmetric about a vertical axis passing through its vertex, and since both points B and C are on the parabola and on the same horizontal line, they must be symmetric with respect to this vertical axis. 3. **Finding Coordinates and Symmetry Axis**: Since E is the midpoint of AD and AD is parallel to the x-axis, the x-coordinate of E is also the midpoint of B and C. Given that B and C lie on a horizontal line, this confirms the symmetry of the parabola. 4. **Calculating Side Length of the Square**: Denote the unknown side length of the square as L.

This means (AM = MC). - A perpendicular (MH) is dropped from (M) onto the side (BC), intersecting (BC) at (H). - Point (P) is the midpoint of segment (MH). 2. **Finding Characteristics of Triangle (ADC):** - When drawing the height (AD) from vertex (A) perpendicular to (BC), since triangle (ABC) is isosceles with (AB = AC), (AD) will bisect (BC) at point (D). - Hence, triangle (ADC) still maintains symmetry with (D) being the midpoint, and (DH = HC). 3. **Proving Perpendicularity of (AH) and (BP):** - **Step 1:** Examine triangles (BHM) and (ADC): - Note that triangle (BHM) is a right triangle because (MH) is perpendicular to (BC). - Similarly, triangle (ADC) is a right triangle because (AD) is perpendicular to (BC). - **Step 2:** Establishing Similar Triangles: - Observe that (angle DAC = 90^circ - angle ACB), which is equal to the angle (angle HBM) since those two angles are complementary to (angle BHC = angle DBC). - By the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity postulate, triangles (BHM) and (ADC) are similar. 4. **Implication of Similar Triangles:** - In similar triangles, the corresponding sides are proportional, and hence corresponding altitudes and medians in similar triangles will be proportional too. 5. **Rotating and Parallels:** - By rotating triangle (BHM) by (90^circ), the corresponding sides will align such that (BHM) remains similar to (ADC), maintaining parallelism of corresponding lines. - The corresponding median from (B) to (H), which is (BP), and the height from (A) to (H), which is (AH), will be parallel by this rotation. 6. **Final Conclusion:** - Since we have already established that (BP) and (AH) should be perpendicular by the properties derived from the similarity and rotation, we can conclude (AH perp BP).

For the females, we know that the average age is 30 years and there are 10 females. The formula for average age is the total sum of ages divided by the number of individuals. Therefore, we can express the total sum of ages for females as: [S_f = 30 times 10] For the males, the average age is 35 years and there are 15 males. Similarly, we calculate the total sum of ages for males as: [S_m = 35 times 15] To find the average age of all 25 people in the choir, we need to find the total sum of ages for both females and males and then divide by the total number of people. The total sum of ages is the sum of S_f and S_m, and the total number of people is 25. Thus, the average age is calculated as follows: [ text{Average age} = frac{S_f + S_m}{25} = frac{(30 times 10) + (35 times 15)}{25} ] Simplifying the expression: [ text{Average age} = frac{300 + 525}{25} = frac{825}{25} = 33 ] Therefore, the average age of the 25 people in the choir is boxed{33} years."},{"prompt":"Given two segments (AB) and (CD), prove that if (AC^2 + BD^2 = AD^2 + BC^2), then (AB) is perpendicular to (CD).

Consider the vectors (overline{AB}), (overline{CD}), (overline{AC}), (overline{AD}), (overline{BD}), and (overline{BC}). Depending on their mutual arrangement, we might have either a planar or a spatial figure (see Fig. 5.15). 2. Given that overline{AB}^2 = |overline{AB}|^2 = AB^2, we can transform the given equality as follows: [ AC^2 + BD^2 = AD^2 + BC^2 ] 3.

One possible configuration: - Suppose edge (A_1A_2) is red, (A_3A_4) is yellow, and the other edges are blue. - The diagonals (A_1A_3) and (A_2A_4) will also be colored one of the three colors.

Given that M is the midpoint of P and a fixed point Q(6,0), we can use the midpoint formula to express x_{1} and y_{1} in terms of x and y: x_{1} = 2x - 6, quad y_{1} = 2y. Point P lies on the circle x^{2}+4x+y^{2}-32=0, which can be rewritten as (x+2)^{2}+y^{2}=36 by completing the square. Substituting the expressions for x_{1} and y_{1} into this equation gives: (2x - 4)^{2} + (2y)^{2} = 36.

Observing the grid dimensions, a winning line needs either: - 7 consecutive cells in a row (horizontal) - 7 consecutive cells in a column (vertical) 3. **Formulating a Strategy:** It can be inferred that if Gosha plays optimally, he will try to block Dima from creating a line of 7 and at the same time attempt to create his own. Conversely, Dima will also try to block Gosha while creating his 7-line. 4. **Examining the Grid and Turns:** Given that Gosha and Dima alternate turns, the inherent symmetry and the rules of the game imply the need to analyze control over spots more critically.

Under the conditions ( a - b < x < a + b ), the values ( 2a ), ( 2b ), and ( 2x ) can be considered as the side lengths of a triangle. Let ( S ) denote the area of this triangle. 6. By the properties of triangles, the area ( S ) of the triangle with sides ( 2a ), ( 2b ), and ( 2x ) can be used to find ( f(x) ). Specifically, [ f(x) = -S^2 ] 7. The maximum area ( S ) of a triangle occurs when the included angle between sides of fixed lengths is (90^circ). Given sides ( 2a ) and ( 2b ), the maximum area is obtained when ( 2x = sqrt{(2a)^2 + (2b)^2} ), i.e., ( x = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). Thus, [ S_{text{max}} = frac{1}{2} times 2a times 2b = 2ab ] 8.

Suppose two even numbers, (a) and (b), are adjacent. The sum of these numbers is also even ((a + b)), and (a) must be a divisor of (a + b). Since (a) is even, (a + b) must also be even, and (a) being even means that (b) must also be even.

The largest power of 2 less than 1024 is 2^{10} = 1024. However, representing it as 1024 = 2^{10} uses only one term, so we need to involve smaller powers. 2. Decrementing from 2^{10} and considering 2^9 = 512. We would then require text{number} = 1024 - 512 = 512. 3. Further use 2^8 = 256. Hence, text{number} = 512 - 256 = 256. 4. Now, instead of using the remaining 256 as 2^8, let's decompose it further. Use 2^7 = 128. Hence, text{number} = 256 - 128 = 128. 5. Use 2^6 = 64. Hence, text{number} = 128 - 64 = 64. 6. Finally use 2^5 = 32 and 2^4 = 16. text{number} = 64 - 32 = 32 and text{number} = 32 - 16 = 16 where 16 = 2^4. The resulting representation with maximum terms is 1024 = 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 16, or 1024 = 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4.

Define ( C_{1} equiv Z[(A, m_{1}), (B, m_{2})] ) as the center of mass of the system composed of only the points ( (A, m_{1}) ) and ( (B, m_{2}) ). To prove: The line ( CO ) intersects the segment ( AB ) at the point ( C_{1} ). 4. Step 1: - Consider combining the masses at points ( A ) and ( B ). This system can be replaced by a single point ( (C_{1}, m_{1}+m_{2}) ) placed at the center of mass ( C_{1} ). By definition, the coordinates of ( C_{1} ) are given by the weighted average: [ C_{1} = frac{m_{1} cdot A + m_{2} cdot B}{m_{1} + m_{2}} ] 5. Step 2: - Since the position of the center of mass of the whole system does not change by replacing ((A, m_{1})) and ((B, m_{2})) with ((C_{1}, m_{1} + m_{2})), we consider the two-point system ((C_{1}, m_{1}+m_{2})) and ((C, m_{s})). 6.

We can subtract the number of selections that do not satisfy this condition from the total. The case where only internists are selected can be done in binom{5}{4} ways, since there are 5 internists. Similarly, the case where only surgeons are selected can be done in binom{6}{4} ways, since there are 6 surgeons.

We will outline two distinct methods to determine the fifth card. Method 1: In a standard deck of French cards, the cards come in four different suits.

The assistant can use the first card to communicate the suit of the fifth card, agreeing beforehand with the magician that the fifth card will have the same suit as the first one shown. 1.

Now the assistant needs to communicate the exact rank (value) of the fifth card ( x ) using the remaining three cards. 3. Assign an order to the suits, for example, using the bridge ranking: Clubs (lowest), Diamonds, Hearts, Spades (highest). 4. This way, any pair of cards can be uniquely ordered. 5.

By arranging the cards and calculating the difference ( b - a ) (where ( a ) and ( b ) are the values of two cards: ( y ) and ( x ), respectively), the assistant encodes the distance modulo 13: - If ( b - a leq 6 ), assign ( y = a ) and ( s = b - a ); thus ( x = b ). - If ( b - a > 6 ), assign ( y = b ) and ( s = 13 - (b - a) ); then ( x = a ). This method ensures ( 1 leq s leq 6 ). The value of the fifth card ( x ) can be determined by ( x equiv (y + s) mod 13 ). Method 2: If there is an identifiable reference point in the first four cards, using the cyclical numbering mod 13, the assistant can directly communicate the information. 1. Rank the cards from 1 to 52, arranged: Clubs Ace = 1 to Spades King = 52. 2. The 24 permutations of the four cards can cover 24 different pieces of information. 3. The assistant and magician agree on identifying the reference card (usually the one with the highest rank in the given order). If ( a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 ) are the ranks of the first four handed cards: - If ( a_5 - a_4 leq 24 ), let ( a_5 ) be the fifth card, and use ( s = a_5 - a_4 ). - If ( a_5 - a_4 geq 25 ), let ( a_1 ) be the fifth card, and set ( s = (a_1 + 52 - a_5) mod 52 ). By identifying the suitable card, ( s ) symbolizes the difference to determine the fifth card ( x ): [ x equiv (y + s) mod 52 textrm{, } boxed{(1 leq s leq 24)} ] Thus, the card trick is possible without supernatural powers by pre-agreed upon systematic signaling between the assistant and the magician."},{"prompt":"On a (4n + 2)times (4n + 2) square grid, a turtle can move between squares sharing a side.The turtle begins in a corner square of the grid and enters each square exactly once, ending in the square where she started.

According to the given information, the number of boxes of type A that can be produced with 6000 yuan is equal to the number of boxes of type B that can be produced with 4500 yuan. This can be represented by the equation: [ frac{6000}{x + 500} = frac{4500}{x} ] Solving this equation for x: [ 6000x = 4500(x + 500) 6000x = 4500x + 2250000 1500x = 2250000 x = 1500 ] Thus, the cost per box of type B is 1500 yuan/box, and the cost per box of type A is 1500 + 500 = 2000 yuan/box. boxed{text{The cost per box of type A is 2000 yuan/box, and the cost per box of type B is 1500 yuan/box.}} Part 2: Production Plans Calculation Let the factory produce m boxes of type B.

Therefore, the mode of the seventh-grade contestants' scores is 6. boxed{6} Part 2: Average Score of the Eighth-Grade Contestants To find the average score, we sum all the scores and divide by the number of scores. For the eighth-grade contestants, the scores are: 5, 6, 8, 7, 5, 8, 7, 9, 8, 8. The sum of these scores is 2 times 5 + 6 + 2 times 7 + 4 times 8 + 9 = 10 + 6 + 14 + 32 + 9 = 71.

Substituting a + b from the given equation into the AM-GM inequality, we obtain ab - 3 = a + b geqslant 2sqrt{ab}. 4.

This is because if a equiv b pmod{6}, then a - b equiv 0 pmod{6}. 3. **Possible Remainders**: Any integer n when divided by 6 can have one of the six possible remainders: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. 4. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**: The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item. Here, the \\"items\\" are the twelve chosen integers, and the \\"containers\\" are the six possible remainders modulo 6. 5. **Conclusion by Pigeonhole Principle**: Since we are choosing twelve integers (twice the number of categories of remainders), at least two of these integers must fall into the same category (i.e., they have the same remainder when divided by 6).

Since k is an integer, both k-1 and k+1 are consecutive even integers. Let us denote k-1 = 2a and k+1 = 2b where a and b are integers. Therefore, we have: [ 2a cdot 2b = 12n^2 ] [ 4ab = 12n^2 ] [ ab = 3n^2 ] 3. Since a and b are integers, we need to find pairs (a, b) such that ab = 3n^2.

From advocating for one child per couple in 1980 to relaxing the conditions for having two children in rural areas in 1984; from the implementation of the singlechild policy to the universal twochild policy, China's family planning policy has always been dynamically adjusted. Under the premise that the basic national policy of family planning remains unchanged, the increasingly flexible Chinese population policy will help alleviate the social pressure brought by population aging. Meanwhile, China will weigh the pros and cons, and timely, scientifically research, adjust, and improve the fertility policy according to the specific conditions of China's economic, social development, and population structure changes. This will further highlight the peopleoriented concept, promote family happiness and social harmony, promote the longterm balanced development of China's population, and promote the sustained and healthy development of the economy.

In how many ways can this be done, if the order of the different sized pieces also matters?","completion":"To solve the problem, we define the number of pieces of wire that are 2 meters long as ( x ) and those that are 3 meters long as ( y ). We need to satisfy the equation: [ 2x + 3y = 25 ] This is a Diophantine equation, which means we are looking for integer solutions. 1. First, we solve for ( x ): [ x = frac{25 - 3y}{2} ] 2. Since ( x ) and ( y ) must both be integers, the expression ( 25 - 3y ) must be even (so that it can be divided by 2). It follows that ( 3y ) must be odd (since 25 is odd, subtracting an odd number from it results in an even number). 3. Since ( 3y ) is odd, ( y ) itself must be odd. We also need to ensure ( x > 0 ) which implies: [ 3y < 25 implies y < frac{25}{3} approx 8.33 ] So ( y ) must be an odd number less than 8.33. The possible values for ( y ) are: [ y = 1, 3, 5, 7 ] 4.

Next, we count the number of different ways to arrange these pieces for each solution: - For ((11, 1)), we have 12 pieces in total (11 pieces of 2 meters and 1 piece of 3 meters). The number of ways to arrange these is calculated using the multinomial coefficient: [ frac{12!}{1! cdot 11!} = 12 ] - For ((8, 3)), we have 11 pieces in total (8 pieces of 2 meters and 3 pieces of 3 meters): [ frac{11!}{3! cdot 8!} = 165 ] - For ((5, 5)), we have 10 pieces in total (5 pieces of 2 meters and 5 pieces of 3 meters): [ frac{10!}{5! cdot 5!} = 252 ] - For ((2, 7)), we have 9 pieces in total (2 pieces of 2 meters and 7 pieces of 3 meters): [ frac{9!}{2! cdot 7!} = 36 ] 6.

Since ( f ) is a monic cubic polynomial, we can write: [ f(x) = x^3 + ax ] 2. Because ( f(x) ) is odd, the coefficient of ( x ) (which we will denote as ( a )) must ensure that ( f(x) ) behaves correctly, i.e., ( f(x) + f(-x) = (x^3 + ax) + (-x^3 - ax) = 0 ), reflecting its odd nature.

Therefore, our formula becomes: [ binom{9 + 26 - 1}{26 - 1} = binom{34}{25} ] 4. **Relation to Binary Strings**: Another way to think about this is using binary strings. If we create a binary string of length 34 that contains 9 zeroes (representing the letters being chosen) and 25 ones (representing the separating gaps or transitions between different letters), each valid string corresponds uniquely to a different collection of the 9 letters among the 26 possible. 5. **Counting Binary Strings**: The number of such binary strings is given by the number of ways to choose 9 positions out of 34 to place zeroes (the rest will automatically be ones): [ binom{34}{9} ] 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the number of different collections of 9 letters is: boxed{binom{34}{9}}"},{"prompt":"Given that sin alpha + cos alpha = sqrt{2}, find the value of tan alpha + frac{cos alpha}{sin alpha} (alpha is in quadrant I).

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a root (z in mathbb{C}) with (|z| geq 1), such that (P(z) = 0). 3. **Derive a Contradiction for (|z| geq 1)**: Given (P(z) = 0), by substituting (z) into (P(x)), we get: [ (z-1) P(z) = 0. ] This implies: [ a_n |z|^{n+1} = left| left(a_n - a_{n-1}right) z^n + cdots + left(a_1 - a_0right) z + a_0 right|. ] Using the triangle inequality: [ leq left(a_n - a_{n-1}right) |z|^n + cdots + left(a_1 - a_0right) |z| + a_0. ] Substituting (|z|): [ leq left(a_n - a_{n-1}right) |z|^{n+1} + cdots + left(a_1 - a_0right) |z|^{n+1} + a_0 |z|^{n+1}. ] Thus: [ leq a_n |z|^{n+1}. ] For equality to hold, (a_n |z|^{n+1}) would need to equal ( left(a_n - a_{n-1}right) |z|^n + cdots + a_0 |z|^{n+1}).

An obtuse angle is greater than 90 degrees. - Since the sum of the angles in any triangle must be exactly 180 degrees, if beta is obtuse (i.e., beta > 90^circ), then the sum of alpha and alpha must be less than 90 degrees for the total to be 180 degrees. This implies each alpha must be less than 45 degrees, which makes them acute. - It is impossible for both alpha to be obtuse because their sum would exceed 180 degrees, violating the triangle’s angle sum property.

We are to show that (P), (Q), and (H) are collinear. 2. **Orthocenter Properties**: Recall that the orthocenter (H) of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect. Consequently, (H) is also on the perpendiculars dropped from (B) to (AC) and from (C) to (AB). 3. **Power of a Point Theorem**: We use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that the power of a point with respect to a circle is equal for any circle through the point. Specifically, if a point (H) is on the radical axis of two circles, then the powers of (H) with respect to each circle are equal. 4. **Power Calculation with Circle ( text{diameter} [BN])**: - Since (BH perp AC), (H) is on the circle with diameter (BN). - The power of (H) with respect to the circle of diameter (BN) is: [ text{Power of } H = -HB cdot HH_B ] where (H_B) is the foot of the altitude from (B) on (AC). 5. **Power Calculation with Circle ( text{diameter} [CM])**: - Similarly, since (CH perp AB), (H) is on the circle with diameter (CM). - The power of (H) with respect to the circle of diameter (CM) is: [ text{Power of } H = -HC cdot HH_C ] where (H_C) is the foot of the altitude from (C) on (AB). 6. **Cyclic Quadrilateral**: The points (B), (H_C), (H_B), and (C) are concyclic (lying on the same circle) because they form a cyclic quadrilateral due to the right angles at (H).

When n=30, show that there exists a number such that the difference between it and the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring numbers is at least frac{2}{113}. **Answer:** **(1) Proof:** # Step 1: Consider the real numbers positioned in a circular manner. Let the numbers be x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n such that sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 0 and one number, say x_k = 1. # Step 2: Utilize the conditions of the problem. Given that one of the numbers is 1 and the sum of all numbers is 0, there must be both positive and negative numbers in the set due to the symmetry and balancing out to zero. # Step 3: Apply the concept of adjacent differences. Since we need to prove there are two adjacent numbers such that their difference is at least frac{4}{n}: - Assume the maximum difference between two adjacent numbers is Delta = x_i - x_{i+1} for some i. Note that the sum of all differences around the circle is given by: sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - x_{i+1}) = 0. Thus, it implies there must be both positive and negative differences. # Step 4: Show bounds for the maximum difference. From the intermediate value theorem and symmetry properties, at least one of the differences between adjacent numbers around the circle must be at least: Delta geq frac{4}{n}. Thus, we have proven the first part. boxed{Delta geq frac{4}{n}}. **(2) Proof:** # Step 5: Consider the arithmetic mean and difference. We need to prove there exists a number such that the difference between it and the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring numbers is at least frac{8}{n^2}. # Step 6: Define the problem in terms of means. By considering the numbers around the circle, x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n, we look for: left| x_i - frac{x_{i-1} + x_{i+1}}{2} right| # Step 7: Use bounds on differences calculated in part (1). Given part (1), there exists a Delta geq frac{4}{n}, we improve this using differences of means: left| x_i - frac{x_{i-1} + x_{i+1}}{2} right| geq frac{8}{n^2} This arises because differences in fact impact neighbors' values leading to multiplication of constants. boxed{left| x_i - frac{x_{i-1} + x_{i+1}}{2} right| geq frac{8}{n^2}}. **(3) Improved Estimate:** # Step 8: Propose an improved constant.

We need to prove that these ( n ) lines divide the full angle ( 360^circ ) into equal parts. 2. Let's denote the ( n ) angles formed by these lines around point ( O ) as ( alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_n ). Each angle ( alpha_i ) corresponds to an elementary angle, formed between two consecutive straight lines. 3. By definition, the total sum of the ( n ) elementary angles around point ( O ) is: [ alpha_1 + alpha_2 + cdots + alpha_n = 360^circ ] 4. It is required that any two lines forming an elementary angle at point ( O ) have another line dividing one of their vertical angles into two equal parts. This implies that each elementary angle must have a corresponding bisector that is also one of the ( n ) lines. 5. Let us assume the greatest of these elementary angles, say ( alpha ), and denote the adjacent elementary angles to ( alpha ) as ( beta ) and ( gamma ). 6. Since a line passing through point ( O ) divides one of the vertical angles formed by ( alpha ) into two equal parts, then after a ( 90^circ ) rotation around ( O ), this line will become a bisector of the pair of larger angles (which include ( alpha )). 7. Consequently: - If the line that initially formed the angle ( alpha ) is rotated by ( 90^circ ), it will split the supplementary angles formed by ( beta ) and ( gamma ) which also includes ( alpha ). This ensures that the sum ( alpha + beta + gamma = 360^circ ), implying that each of them are equally distributed around the circle. 8. Given that all ( n ) bisectors are lines marked such that each pair of adjacent lines share one such bisector, it becomes evident that: [ alpha = beta = gamma ] because the elementary angles must be equally bisected and their sum must total to ( 360^circ ).

We place Argovia at the origin ((0,0)) and Zillis at ((d,0)), with (d) being a positive real number. 1. **Define Movement and Rotation**: - Larry makes a (90^circ) left turn every (ell) kilometers. - Rob makes a (90^circ) right turn every (r) kilometers. - Since (ell) and (r) are relatively prime, they have no common divisors other than 1. 2. **Case Analysis Based on (ell) and (r) Modulo 4**: - **Case 1**: (underline{ell - r equiv 2 pmod{4}}) - After each complete cycle of (ell r) kilometers, consider the net effect of turns. - The car will have a net turn of (180^circ) (left or right) after this cycle, bringing it back to the origin ((0,0)) facing east. - Therefore, it cannot cover the distance to reach Zillis if (d > ell r). - **Case 2**: (ell - r equiv 1 pmod{4}) - After each (ell) kilometers interval, the car has made a net turn of (90^circ) to the right. - Let the movement vector for the first (ell) kilometers be ((x,y)). The subsequent displacements will be: [ (y, -x), (-x, -y), (-y, x) ] - After four such intervals (i.e., within (4ell r) kilometers), the car returns to ((0,0)) facing east. - As such, the car cannot reach Zillis if it is further away than (4 ell r) kilometers. - **Case 3**: (ell - r equiv 3 pmod{4}) - This case is similar to Case 2, switching the roles of left and right. After each complete (4ell r) kilometers, the car returns to ((0,0)) facing east. - Therefore, the car cannot reach Zillis if it is further than (4 ell r). - **Case 4**: (ell equiv r pmod{4}) - Here, (ell) and (r) are either both congruent to (1 pmod{4}) or both congruent to (3 pmod{4}). - The car makes no net turn after each section of (ell r) kilometers, and thus travels in a straight line.

The remainder will have both nuts and chocolate chips.

Given the numbers (x, y, z in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right]), we need to find the maximum value of the expression: [ A = sin(x - y) + sin(y - z) + sin(z - x) ] 2. We can start by noting that without loss of generality, we can assume ( x leq y) and ( x leq z ) because the expression (A) does not change under cyclic permutations of the variables. Thus, it suffices to consider these conditions. 3. Using the sum-to-product identities, we can rewrite (sin(x - y) + sin(z - x)) as: [ sin(x - y) + sin(z - x) = 2 sinleft(frac{z - y}{2}right) cosleft(frac{z + y}{2} - xright) ] 4. Note that the argument of the sine term (frac{z - y}{2}) lies within (left[-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right]), and the argument of the cosine term (frac{z + y}{2} - x) lies within (left[-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right]), given that (frac{pi}{2} geq frac{z+y}{2} geq x). 5. Let's consider two cases: - Case 1: (z > y) - Case 2: (z leq y) 6. **Case 1: (z > y)** Here, the term ( sin(x - y) + sin(z - x) ) achieves its largest possible value when (frac{z - y}{2}) has its maximum, which occurs when (x = y). This means: [ A = sin(y - y) + sin(y - z) + sin(z - y) = 0 ] 7. **Case 2: (z leq y)** Fixing (y) and (z), (sin(x - y) + sin(z - x)) achieves its maximum when (x = 0). In this case, we have: [ A = sin(z) - sin(y) + sin(y - z) ] Using the sum-to-product identities again, we can write: [ A = -sin(y) + 2 sinleft(frac{y}{2}right) cosleft(frac{y}{2} - zright) ] 8. The cosine term (cosleft(frac{y}{2} - zright)) achieves its largest value when (frac{y}{2} - z = 0). This is because the cosine function is maximized at zero in this interval. Thus: [ A leq 2 sinleft(frac{y}{2}right) - sin(y) ] 9. Next, recall the double-angle identity: (sin(y) = 2 sinleft(frac{y}{2}right) cosleft(frac{y}{2}right)). Therefore: [ A leq 2 sinleft(frac{y}{2}right) left(1 - cosleft(frac{y}{2}right)right) ] 10.

This is because they will both be at the starting point again after an integer number of laps, and the first time this happens for both of them together will be at the LCM of their individual lap times. We know that 252 is a factor of 2772, so let's find out how many times 252 goes into 2772: 2772 ÷ 252 = 11 This means that P completes 11 rounds in 2772 seconds. Now, since 2772 seconds is the LCM of P's and Q's round times, and we know that P's round time is 252 seconds, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by 252, gives us 2772.

The factors of 11 are 1 and 11. Since Q cannot complete the same number of rounds as P in the same time (otherwise, they would have the same speed), Q must complete 1 round in the time P completes 11 rounds.

Expanding this square, we have: [ (tx + u)^2 = t^2x^2 + 2tux + u^2. ] Matching coefficients with cx^2 + frac{45}{2}x + 1, the conditions are: - t^2 = c - 2tu = frac{45}{2} - u^2 = 1 From u^2 = 1, u = pm 1. Choosing u = 1 (the solution is symmetric for u = -1, resulting in the same c): - Using 2tu = frac{45}{2} with u = 1 gives 2t = frac{45}{2}; hence, t = frac{45}{4}. - Therefore, t^2 = left(frac{45}{4}right)^2 = frac{2025}{16}. Thus, the given expression is: [ left(frac{45}{4}x + 1right)^2 = frac{2025}{16}x^2 + frac{45}{2}x + 1. ] This confirms c = frac{2025}{16}.

How long is the train?","completion":"To find the length of the train, we need to calculate the total distance covered by the train while passing the bridge. This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. First, let's convert the speed of the train from km/hour to m/second to match the units of the bridge length and the time given. Speed in m/s = (Speed in km/hour) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hour) Speed in m/s = 45 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 45000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while passing the bridge using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken to pass the bridge is given as 42 seconds, so: Distance = 12.5 m/s * 42 s Distance = 525 meters This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. Therefore, we can find the length of the train (let's call it L_train) by subtracting the length of the bridge from the total distance: L_train = Distance - Length of the bridge L_train = 525 meters - 140 meters L_train = 385 meters So, the length of the train is boxed{385} meters."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],I={key:0},M={key:1};function W(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
