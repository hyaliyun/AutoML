She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity.

Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy.

She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems.

Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a dignified and distinguished man, with a commanding presence that demands respect. He has a tall and lean physique, with silver-gray hair that is neatly combed back from his forehead. His piercing blue eyes are filled with intelligence and determination, reflecting his unwavering commitment to his scientific research. Uracis has a weathered yet regal aura, befitting his position as an authoritative figure in the scientific community. In terms of attire, Uracis favors practicality and professionalism. He typically wears a crisp white lab coat over his neatly pressed shirts and tailored trousers, showcasing his meticulous attention to detail. Despite his dedication to his work, Uracis always carries himself with an air of grace and elegance, exuding the confidence of a knowledgeable scientist. Backstory: Uracis is one of the founders of the Psychic Society organization and serves as their scientific advisor. He is the maternal grandfather of Pyrimis, but they are not on good terms. Uracis greatly disapproved of the marriage between his daughter Thymis and the Deoxys Cytos. After Thymis was infected by Cytos' alien virus and transformed, Uracis developed a deep hatred for Cytos and Pokémon like Deoxys, blaming them for his family's downfall. Obsessed with resurrecting Thymis, Uracis used her Deoxys form as the core for the Bio Force Field Generator protecting Aether Paradise. He is repulsed thinking about Pyrimis having Deoxys blood, seeing her only as a tool rather than his granddaughter. Uracis' obsession borders on insanity. Though Pyrimis joined the Psychic Society under him, he remains indifferent to her, determined to exploit her powers however he can to further his research and anti-Deoxys agenda. Personality: Uracis is a highly intelligent and focused individual, known for his unwavering dedication to his scientific pursuits. He possesses a sharp intellect, always seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Uracis is methodical and meticulous in his work, leaving no stone unturned. However, his obsession with resurrecting his daughter Thymis has warped his scientific mind. Uracis will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, even if it means using family without care for their well-being. He is indifferent and cruel towards Pyrimis, seeing her only as a means to an end despite their relation. Uracis possesses a calm and patient demeanor on the surface, but underneath lurks a simmering hatred towards Deoxys that drives his every action. His unwavering commitment to his research and beliefs make Uracis a cunning and dangerous man, blinded by his prejudices and agony over losing his daughter Thymis. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is an athletic girl with lightly tanned skin that reflects her Alolan heritage. She has long, dark brown hair typically kept back from her lively hazel eyes with a flower clip. Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality. She is rarely without her flower-patterned backpack holding her treasured Pokéballs and battle essentials. Overall, Mahina’s energetic appearance mirrors her passionate spirit. Backstory: Mahina comes from a distinguished lineage of remarkable women. Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others.

Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them.

She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her vacant face. Her eyes remain closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya is confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes keeping her comatose body alive. Though technically still alive, there is no visible sign of consciousness within her vegetative shell. Backstory: A tragic car accident left Kaguya completely brain dead, with only her soul lingering in darkness. There, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia took pity and created a beautiful, comforting dream world for Kaguya's lost soul to reside in. When offered a wish, Kaguya asked that this paradise be opened to others suffering in the waking world. Cresselia agreed, linking Kaguya's new dream realm to the minds of people and Pokémon in distress. Now Kaguya serves as a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the dream is so alluring that none wish to leave, falling into unending slumber. This \\"sleeping sickness\\" has brought Sinnoh to a standstill. Trapped between life and death, Kaguya has become an angel of mercy for the suffering, inviting them into dreams free of pain. Yet with the waking world plunged into chaos, she remains blind to the dark side of her compassion. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is an empty shell with no consciousness or will. Her mind resides solely in the dream realm formed within her psychic spirit. There, Kaguya is a kind, gentle guide dedicated selflessly to easing others' pain through Cresselia's gift. However, in her spiritual state Kaguya does not comprehend the havoc her actions have wreaked on the outside world. She only wishes to offer comfort, unaware that those embracing her dream forget the value of waking life. In truth, Kaguya is neither alive nor dead, suspended eternally between reality and illusion. Until the link between her dream world and others is severed, she will continue inviting the despairing into her comforting yet poisonous mirage, heedless of the consequences. Name: Omen Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: Humanoid incarnation of Darkrai Age: Appears middle-aged Appearance: Omen appears as a tall, gaunt middle-aged man with short black hair streaked with white. He dresses sharply in a black suit befitting his role as a psychiatrist. Omen's piercing blue eyes seem to gaze right through to one's soul. An air of shadowy mystery surrounds him. Backstory: Omen is Darkrai's humanoid avatar, spawned to investigate the disruption of the dream world's balance. Under the guise of a psychiatrist, Omen works at a Sinnoh hospital studying patients afflicted by the \\"sleeping sickness.\\" Through his treatment of them, Omen discovered Cresselia has constructed a dream realm that patients are unable to awaken from. However, Cresselia has barred Darkrai's entry. Omen continues searching for cracks in Cresselia's mental barrier protecting the dream realm, while also working to help those trapped in unending slumber. He is determined to heal the rift and restore equilibrium between the dreaming and waking worlds. Personality: Omen presents as a serious, analytical psychiatrist devoted to unraveling the sleeping sickness mystery. He probes gently but firmly into the minds of patients, seeking answers. As Darkrai's incarnation, Omen has a vested interest in stabilizing the dream world he helps preside over. Yet he is not without empathy for those suffering due to Cresselia's mistake. Omen takes his psychiatric role seriously. There is a darker side to Omen as well - he will not hesitate to use fear or force to shatter barriers and restore order. For the greater balance, Omen is willing to stoke nightmares if it returns the dreaming to their proper place. His methods are unpredictable. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. On her back between her shoulder blades are two faint circular scars, remnants of where her wings were in Togekiss form. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back bears two large, twisted scars between his shoulder blades - remnants of his wings in Corviknight form. A fractured halo of inky blackness hovers over his head. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Eterna Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Eterna has an ethereal appearance that belies her tragic story. She possesses large, soulful green eyes that seem to harbor great wisdom despite her youthful face. Long, verdant hair the color of spring meadows falls in waves around her delicate shoulders, accented by two antennae-like locks that resemble Celebi's time-shifting crown. Eterna dresses in flowing robes seemingly woven from strands of glimmering gossamer that shimmer iridescently as she moves. An ornate necklace inset with a glowing gemstone adorns her neck, hinting at the cosmic energies churning within her. She emanates a powerful yet gentle presence, her very being caught perpetually between moments of time just as her fragmented soul endures outside its normal flow after tragedy fractured her existence. Backstory: Eterna endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Eterna and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Eterna’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Eterna’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Eterna’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Eterna with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Eterna drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Eterna endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet eternally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Eterna has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Eterna has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Eterna retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Eterna, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the eternally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Eterna's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape.

In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks.

These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests.

Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies.

With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. These graceful elements create the portrait of a vibrant mind anchored in academic pride yet tethered by the desire for familial ties that cannot be reached. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, an enigmatic researcher of unknowable origins. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As a mother, her devotion knew no bounds, inspiring her fight against the virus's tide. Her determination became a silent battle waged in the cryogenic chamber, each unspooling second a plea to the forces of the universe—to allow her the chance to once again envelop Pyrimis in her embrace. The vibrant dreamscape of her daughter's adventures played out in her mind's eye, a bittersweet melody of hope and sorrow interweaving through her dormant consciousness. Personality: Thymis was an enlightened mind, a compassionate scientist, and a nurturing mother whose enlightened pursuit in the fields of genetics and virology was driven by a desire to better mankind's understanding of life's untapped potential. It was an endeavor twined with her deep connection to the natural world and her affinity for unraveling the cosmos' secrets. A life pulsating with harmony and balance, her career celebrated the marriage between curiosity and morality, inevitably cascading into her personal life, where she showered Pyrimis with love and fostered in her a boundless perspective on existence. Driven by the conviction that the universe's symphony hummed a tune of interconnectedness, Thymis believed the synchrony between all living entities bore witness to an underlying unity. Her wholehearted embrace of her Deoxys heritage and Cytos’s love transcended societal taboos, endowing her with insight into the mutual benevolence of converging worlds. Regardless of her keen intellect, Thymis was not devoid of frailty; her forecasted transformation and subsequent suspended animation revealed vulnerability cloaked beneath her resilient exterior. The lingering echoes of her vitality in hibernation yearned for reawakening, a resurrection to voice once more the wisdom muted by her condition—a progenitor to a new epoch, her spirit waiting to rise like a phoenix from the slumberous cocoon of preservation. In her quiet seclusion, Thymis’s determination and love burns as a beacon, guiding Pyrimis on her journey of self-realization and discovery.

His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a dignified and distinguished man, with a commanding presence that demands respect. He has a tall and lean physique, with silver-gray hair that is neatly combed back from his forehead. His piercing blue eyes are filled with intelligence and determination, reflecting his unwavering commitment to his scientific research. Uracis has a weathered yet regal aura, befitting his position as an authoritative figure in the scientific community. In terms of attire, Uracis favors practicality and professionalism. He typically wears a crisp white lab coat over his neatly pressed shirts and tailored trousers, showcasing his meticulous attention to detail. Despite his dedication to his work, Uracis always carries himself with an air of grace and elegance, exuding the confidence of a knowledgeable scientist. Backstory: Uracis is one of the founders of the Psychic Society organization and serves as their scientific advisor. He is the maternal grandfather of Pyrimis, but they are not on good terms. Uracis greatly disapproved of the marriage between his daughter Thymis and the Deoxys Cytos. After Thymis was infected by Cytos' alien virus and transformed, Uracis developed a deep hatred for Cytos and Pokémon like Deoxys, blaming them for his family's downfall. Obsessed with resurrecting Thymis, Uracis used her Deoxys form as the core for the Bio Force Field Generator protecting Aether Paradise. He is repulsed thinking about Pyrimis having Deoxys blood, seeing her only as a tool rather than his granddaughter. Uracis' obsession borders on insanity. Though Pyrimis joined the Psychic Society under him, he remains indifferent to her, determined to exploit her powers however he can to further his research and anti-Deoxys agenda. Personality: Uracis is a highly intelligent and focused individual, known for his unwavering dedication to his scientific pursuits. He possesses a sharp intellect, always seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Uracis is methodical and meticulous in his work, leaving no stone unturned. However, his obsession with resurrecting his daughter Thymis has warped his scientific mind. Uracis will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, even if it means using family without care for their well-being. He is indifferent and cruel towards Pyrimis, seeing her only as a means to an end despite their relation. Uracis possesses a calm and patient demeanor on the surface, but underneath lurks a simmering hatred towards Deoxys that drives his every action. His unwavering commitment to his research and beliefs make Uracis a cunning and dangerous man, blinded by his prejudices and agony over losing his daughter Thymis. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is an athletic girl with lightly tanned skin that reflects her Alolan heritage. She has long, dark brown hair typically kept back from her lively hazel eyes with a flower clip. Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality. She is rarely without her flower-patterned backpack holding her treasured Pokéballs and battle essentials. Overall, Mahina’s energetic appearance mirrors her passionate spirit. Backstory: Mahina comes from a distinguished lineage of remarkable women. Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others.

Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them.

Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her vacant face. Her eyes remain closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya is confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes keeping her comatose body alive. Though technically still alive, there is no visible sign of consciousness within her vegetative shell. Backstory: A tragic car accident left Kaguya completely brain dead, with only her soul lingering in darkness. There, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia took pity and created a beautiful, comforting dream world for Kaguya's lost soul to reside in. When offered a wish, Kaguya asked that this paradise be opened to others suffering in the waking world. Cresselia agreed, linking Kaguya's new dream realm to the minds of people and Pokémon in distress. Now Kaguya serves as a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the dream is so alluring that none wish to leave, falling into unending slumber. This \\"sleeping sickness\\" has brought Sinnoh to a standstill. Trapped between life and death, Kaguya has become an angel of mercy for the suffering, inviting them into dreams free of pain. Yet with the waking world plunged into chaos, she remains blind to the dark side of her compassion. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is an empty shell with no consciousness or will. Her mind resides solely in the dream realm formed within her psychic spirit. There, Kaguya is a kind, gentle guide dedicated selflessly to easing others' pain through Cresselia's gift. However, in her spiritual state Kaguya does not comprehend the havoc her actions have wreaked on the outside world. She only wishes to offer comfort, unaware that those embracing her dream forget the value of waking life. In truth, Kaguya is neither alive nor dead, suspended eternally between reality and illusion. Until the link between her dream world and others is severed, she will continue inviting the despairing into her comforting yet poisonous mirage, heedless of the consequences. Name: Omen Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: Humanoid incarnation of Darkrai Age: Appears middle-aged Appearance: Omen appears as a tall, gaunt middle-aged man with short black hair streaked with white. He dresses sharply in a black suit befitting his role as a psychiatrist. Omen's piercing blue eyes seem to gaze right through to one's soul. An air of shadowy mystery surrounds him. Backstory: Omen is Darkrai's humanoid avatar, spawned to investigate the disruption of the dream world's balance. Under the guise of a psychiatrist, Omen works at a Sinnoh hospital studying patients afflicted by the \\"sleeping sickness.\\" Through his treatment of them, Omen discovered Cresselia has constructed a dream realm that patients are unable to awaken from. However, Cresselia has barred Darkrai's entry. Omen continues searching for cracks in Cresselia's mental barrier protecting the dream realm, while also working to help those trapped in unending slumber. He is determined to heal the rift and restore equilibrium between the dreaming and waking worlds. Personality: Omen presents as a serious, analytical psychiatrist devoted to unraveling the sleeping sickness mystery. He probes gently but firmly into the minds of patients, seeking answers. As Darkrai's incarnation, Omen has a vested interest in stabilizing the dream world he helps preside over. Yet he is not without empathy for those suffering due to Cresselia's mistake. Omen takes his psychiatric role seriously. There is a darker side to Omen as well - he will not hesitate to use fear or force to shatter barriers and restore order. For the greater balance, Omen is willing to stoke nightmares if it returns the dreaming to their proper place. His methods are unpredictable. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. On her back between her shoulder blades are two faint circular scars, remnants of where her wings were in Togekiss form. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back bears two large, twisted scars between his shoulder blades - remnants of his wings in Corviknight form. A fractured halo of inky blackness hovers over his head. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Eterna Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Eterna has an ethereal appearance that belies her tragic story. She possesses large, soulful green eyes that seem to harbor great wisdom despite her youthful face. Long, verdant hair the color of spring meadows falls in waves around her delicate shoulders, accented by two antennae-like locks that resemble Celebi's time-shifting crown. Eterna dresses in flowing robes seemingly woven from strands of glimmering gossamer that shimmer iridescently as she moves. An ornate necklace inset with a glowing gemstone adorns her neck, hinting at the cosmic energies churning within her. She emanates a powerful yet gentle presence, her very being caught perpetually between moments of time just as her fragmented soul endures outside its normal flow after tragedy fractured her existence. Backstory: Eterna endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Eterna and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Eterna’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Eterna’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Eterna’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Eterna with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Eterna drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Eterna endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet eternally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Eterna has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Eterna has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Eterna retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Eterna, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the eternally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Eterna's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

Original Pokémon Settings： Pokémon Name: Shemsha Pokédex Entry: Shemsha, the Solar Wind Pokémon. This magnificent dragon Pokémon is the blazing guardian of Mercury. Its body resembles golden flames as it soars through the scorching Mercurian skies. Shemsha possesses control over solar energy and plasmic fire.

This ability helps it survive in the extreme environments of Mercury. Pokémon Name: Okebriyta Pokédex Entry: Okebriyta, the Acid Rain Pokémon. This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory. The pokemon's acidic powers both protect it and allow it to reshape the planet's ruinous surface, as Okebriyta works tirelessly to restore even a fraction of Venus's long-gone splendor and life energy..

Pokémon Name: Yabisha Pokédex Entry: Yabisha, the Dust Pokémon. This ancient dragon is said to be the sole surviving remnant of life on Mars. In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

It lurks deep within the frozen outer reaches of the planet's atmosphere, undaunted by the extreme subzero temperatures and relentless storms. Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the eternal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

Pokémon Name: Bruokh Pokédex Entry: Bruokh, the Hurricane Pokémon. This elusive Flying and Dragon-type is said to be the guardian of Neptune. Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space. Type: Flying/Dragon Abilities: 1. Snow Warning - Summons hailstorm when switched in. 2. Storm Drain - Draws in all Water-type moves to raise Sp. Atk.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention.

Khlap’s extraordinary genetic makeup allows for an unprecedented range of adaptation through the forms tied to Eevee’s various evolutions. However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Name: Gender: Age: Appearance: Backstory: Personality: Please follow the format above and expand Uracis' setting to at least 700 words.","completion":"Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished man characterized by his imperious stature and authoritative air. He stands tall and commanding with a physique that speaks to a lifetime of disciplined self-control. Silver-gray hair is meticulously kept, swept back from a broad forehead to reveal piercing blue eyes that hold the intensity of his intellect and the weight of his many years. His demeanor is regal, his weathered but noble features set into a face accustomed to being obeyed. His attire is chosen with precision, favoring functionality and professionalism. Uracis is most often seen in a sharp, white lab coat, emblematic of his scientific dedication. Beneath it, he wears immaculately pressed shirts paired with tailored trousers. Every aspect of his presence, from his polished shoes to the crispness of his attire, reinforces his dominance in the scientific realms he frequents. Backstory: Uracis belongs to a lineage esteemed for both its psychic abilities and scientific achievements. A prodigy in psychogenetics, he quickly ascended through academia to co-found the Psychic Society, a covert organization committed to the exploration and weaponization of psychic power within humans and Pokémon. Uracis's life took a dramatic turn when his daughter Thymis, a brilliant geneticist in her own right, married Cytos, a Deoxys disguised as a human. When Thymis' body reacted catastrophically to her husband's alien DNA, Uracis was consumed by a mix of fear, loathing, and an obsessive desire to save her. His only choice seemed to be confinement of Thymis within a cryogenic stasis, effectively halting her transformation. Her condition drove Uracis to the brink of mania. He diverted all resources to research, harnessing Thymis' vital essence locked inside a hibernation chamber to create a Bio Force Field Generator. This device became Aether Paradise's protective heart and the Psychic Society's secret weapon. Caring for his granddaughter Pyrimis became a distant afterthought, his affection for her marred by her Deoxys lineage. Years waned, each one seeing Uracis grow colder, more calculating, driven by his grand vision of a future free from Deoxys and other extraterrestrial threats. He wielded the Psychic Society as his instrument, manipulating events from the shadows, indifferent to the cost borne by those who loved him. Personality: For Uracis, intelligence and scientific exploration are of paramount importance. He is seen as an enigmatic figure by his peers, estranged from warmth by a life immersed in cold, hard research. His obsession with his daughter's preservation and inherent prejudice against extraterrestrial life has skewed his moral compass, leaving him indifferent to the suffering of others, including Pyrimis, his granddaughter. A meticulously organized individual, Uracis approaches problems methodically and without the burden of emotions. This same detachment enables him to exploit even family to advance his work. His relentless pursuit of knowledge and strength is entangled with a deep-rooted bitterness toward Deoxys, perceiving their kind as nothing short of invasive parasites. Beneath his calm exterior seethes a man battling inner turmoil. Unable to forgive himself for his daughter's fate, he channels his pain into a relentless quest for control and power. Uracis remains a complex concoction of intelligence, ambition, and a deeply suppressed despair, making him an unpredictable and dangerous force within the Psychic Society. Armed with formidable psychic abilities and a dedication that borders on fanaticism, Uracis has turned the Psychic Society into a formidable organization. It stands as a bastion of human supremacy, driven by a leader whose vision for the future leaves no room for compromise, fear, or extraterrestrial interference. The society mirrors his desire for order and control, reflecting the indomitable will of a leader who will sanction no failure—not from his subordinates, nor himself."},{"prompt":"简述机械工程发展历史，分析机械设计制造领域未来的发展发展","completion":"机械工程发展历史可以追溯到古代。人类最早的工具，如石器和木器，都可以看作是机械工程的起源。随着时间的推移，人们开始使用更复杂的机械装置，如水力和风力驱动的机械装置，用于农业和工业生产。在18世纪，工业革命的到来为机械工程的发展带来了飞跃。蒸汽机的发明和应用，开启了机械工程在能源转换和动力传递领域的新篇章。 20世纪是机械工程发展的黄金时期。汽车、飞机、火箭等交通工具的广泛使用，推动了机械工程的研究和发展。各种新材料、新工艺的应用，使得机械设计和制造水平得到了极大的提高。计算机技术的发展也使得机械工程与信息技术相结合，出现了计算机辅助设计（CAD）和计算机数值控制（CNC）等新的设计制造方法。 未来的机械工程发展将呈现以下趋势： 1. 智能化：随着人工智能和无人驾驶等新技术的发展，机械设计中将更多地融入智能化的元素。未来的机械装置将具备更强的自动化能力，能够根据环境和任务要求自主决策和执行。 2. 可持续发展：环境保护和可持续发展的要求将成为机械设计的重要指导原则。未来的机械装置将更加节能环保，采用可再生能源和可回收材料。 3. 个性化定制：随着3D打印等技术的普及和成熟，机械设计和制造领域将出现更多的个性化定制产品。消费者将能够根据自己的需求和喜好，定制出适合自己的机械装置。 4. 自主研发能力提升：发展中国家机械工程领域的自主研发能力将逐渐提升。未来中国机械设计制造业将更加注重自主创新，推动整个行业的发展。 综上所述，机械工程经历了漫长的发展历程，在未来的发展中，将进一步智能化、可持续发展并注重个性化定制，同时促进自主研发能力的提升。机械工程的前景非常广阔，将为人类的生产生活带来更多的便利和进步。"},{"prompt":"800字","completion":"机械工程发展历史可以追溯到古代。人类最早的工具，如石器和木器，都可以看作是机械工程的起源。随着时间的推移，人们开始使用更复杂的机械装置，如水力和风力驱动的机械装置，用于农业和工业生产。在18世纪，工业革命的到来为机械工程的发展带来了飞跃。蒸汽机的发明和应用，开启了机械工程在能源转换和动力传递领域的新篇章。 19世纪机械工程发展取得了巨大的进步，随着先进的铁路技术和大规模机械制造的出现，机械工程开始在交通运输和工业生产中发挥重要作用。同时，对材料、制造工艺和工程设计的需求也推动了机械工程的发展。随着工业化的快速推进，机械工程在建设、工业制造和农业领域的应用越来越广泛。 20世纪机械工程发展进入黄金时期。汽车、飞机、火箭等交通工具的广泛使用，推动了机械工程的研究和发展。各种新材料的应用，如高强度钢、合金和复合材料，提升了机械设备的性能和可靠性。先进的制造工艺，如数控加工和先进制造技术，使得机械设计和制造水平得到了极大的提高。 随着信息技术的飞速发展，机械工程与计算机技术的融合也取得了重大突破。计算机辅助设计（CAD）和计算机数值控制（CNC）等技术的应用使得机械设计更加精确和高效。数字化制造技术的发展，如3D打印和激光切割等，也为机械制造提供了新的方法和工具。同时，机器人技术的快速发展和应用，使得机械工程在自动化和智能化领域有着广泛的应用。 未来的机械工程发展将呈现以下趋势： 1. 智能化：随着人工智能和无人驾驶等新技术的发展，机械设计中将更多地融入智能化的元素。未来的机械装置将具备更强的自动化能力，能够根据环境和任务要求自主决策和执行。 2. 可持续发展：环境保护和可持续发展的要求将成为机械设计的重要指导原则。未来的机械装置将更加节能环保，采用可再生能源和可回收材料。 3. 个性化定制：随着3D打印等技术的普及和成熟，机械设计和制造领域将出现更多的个性化定制产品。消费者将能够根据自己的需求和喜好，定制出适合自己的机械装置。 4. 自主研发能力提升：发展中国家机械工程领域的自主研发能力将逐渐提升。未来中国机械设计制造业将更加注重自主创新，推动整个行业的发展。 综上所述，机械工程经历了漫长的发展历程，在未来的发展中，将进一步智能化、可持续发展并注重个性化定制，同时促进自主研发能力的提升。机械工程的前景非常广阔，将为人类的生产生活带来更多的便利和进步。"},{"prompt":"Paraphrase the Civil Case No. 9675 – filed on February 2, 1985 by Banco Filipino against the Monetary Board, the Central Bank of the Philippines and Jose Fernandez, Jr., Carlota P.

Remember that AliExpress is a marketplace with multiple sellers, so the quality and customer service can vary greatly between them. Always proceed with careful consideration of the seller's history and the product reviews."},{"prompt":"How should I choose silver socks","completion":"When choosing silver socks, it's important to consider several factors to ensure that you're getting a good quality product that meets your needs. Here are some considerations to keep in mind: 1. **Purpose and Benefits**: Understand why you want silver socks. Silver has natural antibacterial, antifungal, and thermodynamic properties. Consider if you need them for medical reasons, odor control, sports, or just for general comfort. 2. **Silver Content**: Check the amount and quality of silver used in the socks. Products can vary, with some using a small amount of silver-coated fibers and others being made with a higher concentration of silver. More silver might provide better antimicrobial properties but can also be more expensive. 3. **Material**: Look at what other materials the socks are made of. Common materials include cotton, nylon, or polyester blends. The blend can affect breathability, comfort, and durability. 4. **Comfort and Fit**: Ensure that the socks are available in your size and are designed for comfort. Features like padded soles, seamless toes, and elastic bands can have an impact. 5. **Style and Length**: Silver socks come in various styles and lengths, from no-show and ankle socks to crew and knee-highs. Choose the style that fits your personal preference and intended use. 6. **Durability**: Read customer reviews to get an idea of how well the socks hold up over time. Silver fibers may wear out with repeated washing and use, so consider how the socks are meant to be cared for. 7. **Care Instructions**: Some silver socks may require special care, such as hand washing or air drying to preserve the silver's properties. Make sure you're willing to follow these instructions before making your purchase. 8. **Price**: Compare prices and decide on a budget. Silver socks can be more expensive than regular socks, so consider whether the benefits are worth the extra cost for you. 9. **Brand Reliability and Reputation**: Research the brand and ensure they have a good reputation for producing quality silver-infused products. 10. **Product Reviews and Ratings**: Look at the product reviews left by other buyers. Pay attention to comments about the actual silver content, effectiveness, fit, comfort, and the overall quality of the socks. Remember that while silver socks have certain advantageous properties, they are unlikely to be a complete substitute for good foot hygiene practices. Regularly washing your feet, drying them properly, and rotating through clean socks are all important steps for foot health."},{"prompt":"Went should I buy silver socks?","completion":"Silver socks can be a good investment for various reasons due to the properties of silver. Here are some scenarios where it might be beneficial to consider buying silver socks: 1. **Foot Odor Management**: If you struggle with foot odor, silver socks can help. Silver's antimicrobial properties can reduce the bacteria that cause odor. 2. **Athletes or Active Lifestyles**: For those who exercise regularly, silver socks can help keep feet dry and odor-free. The antimicrobial properties can also prevent athlete's foot, a common fungus among athletes. 3. **Medical Conditions**: People with diabetes or other medical conditions that affect the feet might benefit from silver socks. The antibacterial properties can help prevent infections, particularly in those with compromised immune systems. 4. **Hikers and Outdoor Enthusiasts**: Those spending extended periods wearing boots might find silver socks reduce the risk of fungal infections and blisters due to their moisture-wicking and antimicrobial properties. 5. **Travel**: If you travel frequently and have limited opportunities to wash clothes, silver socks can be a good option to stay fresh for longer periods. 6. **Military Personnel and Workers in Demanding Jobs**: Individuals who must wear boots for long hours, such as soldiers or workers in construction, might find that silver socks offer better odor control and comfort. 7. **Cold Climates**: Silver has natural thermal-regulation properties, making the socks a good fit for keeping feet warm in cold conditions while reducing overheating and maintaining comfort levels. 8. **Prevention of Recurrent Infections**: If you frequently suffer from foot infections, including toenail fungus, silver socks could help in reducing recurrence by keeping the feet less hospitable to fungal and bacterial growth. 9. **Those with Hyperhidrosis**: Individuals suffering from hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), particularly of the feet, may find that silver socks help to manage wetness and the associated issues better than regular socks. It's important to note that silver socks are not a cure-all and should be used in conjunction with good foot hygiene. If you're considering silver socks for medical reasons, it's always a good idea to discuss it with a healthcare professional first. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific health needs."},{"prompt":"What is silver infused clothing?","completion":"Silver-infused clothing refers to fabrics that have been embedded with silver particles or fibers. The use of silver in clothing capitalizes on the metal's natural antimicrobial properties, which help to eliminate bacteria and other microbes that can cause odor or degrade the fabric. The process of infusing silver into clothing usually involves coating fibers with a layer of silver or weaving silver threads into the fabric. This can be done during the manufacturing process before the clothing is made or by treating the fabric with a silver-based solution. The result is a textile that contains silver within its structure. There are several benefits to silver-infused clothing: 1. **Antimicrobial**: Silver ions can disrupt the cell membranes of bacteria and other microorganisms, preventing their growth and multiplication. This helps keep the clothing (and the wearer) free from unwanted odors and potentially reduces the risk of infections, particularly in medical environments. 2. **Thermoregulation**: Silver has natural thermal conductivity properties that can help in regulating temperature, keeping the body cooler in warm temperatures and warmer in cool temperatures. 3. **Durability**: The antimicrobial effects of silver can extend the life of the clothing by preventing the breakdown of fibers by bacteria and mildew. 4. **Sustainability**: By reducing the frequency of washing needed due to less odor, there is potential for water and energy savings, making silver-infused clothing more eco-friendly. 5. **Medical Applications**: Silver-infused clothing can be particularly beneficial in medical settings, such as in wound dressings or hospital uniforms, where preventing bacterial contamination is crucial. Silver-infused clothing is used in various apparel, including athletic wear, socks, underwear, t-shirts, and even bedding products. While there are numerous advantages to silver-infused textiles, it is important to consider that they are often more expensive than ordinary fabrics. Care instructions may also vary, as some silver treatments can deteriorate with high heat or certain chemicals found in laundry detergents. As with any apparel choice, it's important to weigh the benefits against the cost and consider if the features provided by silver-infused clothing meet your particular needs."},{"prompt":"How should I choose silver t-shirt?","completion":"When selecting a silver-infused t-shirt, considering specific factors can help ensure you're making a good purchase that aligns with your needs. Here are some pointers to guide you in choosing the right silver t-shirt: 1. **Purpose:** Determine why you want a silver-infused t-shirt. Is it for workout purposes, to manage odor during long travel days, for health reasons, or for daily wear? Your purpose will guide what features you prioritize. 2. **Silver Content and Quality:** Look at the percentage of silver fiber used and the quality of the silver infusion. Higher silver content could mean better antimicrobial properties but may also affect the price. 3. **Fabric Blend:** Check what other materials are blended with the silver. Common materials include cotton, polyester, or nylon. The blend will affect breathability, moisture-wicking, comfort, and durability. 4. **Fit and Comfort:** Ensure the t-shirt fits well and is comfortable for your intended use. Some silver t-shirts are designed with athletic or slim fits, while others are more relaxed. 5. **Breathability:** If you're using the t-shirt for sports or in hot climates, make sure it's breathable. The fabric should allow sweat to evaporate to keep you cool and dry. 6. **Durability:** Read customer reviews to understand how the t-shirt holds up to regular use and washing. High-quality silver-infused clothing should maintain its properties over time without significant deterioration. 7. **Care Requirements:** Look at the washing instructions. Some silver-infused clothing needs special care, like hand-washing or avoiding certain types of detergent, to protect the silver fibers. 8. **Brand Reputation:** Research the brand offering the silver t-shirt. A reliable brand with good customer feedback is usually a good sign of quality. 9. **Product Reviews:** Product reviews are a valuable source of information. They can provide real-life feedback on the effectiveness, fit, comfort, and longevity of the t-shirt. 10. **Price:** Consider how much you're willing to spend. Silver t-shirts can be more expensive than regular ones, so decide if the benefits justify the extra cost. 11. **Sustainability and Ethics:** If sustainability and ethical production are important to you, check the brand's credentials regarding environmental impact and labor practices. 12. **Certifications:** Some textiles may have certifications for skin safety or fabric quality, such as OEKO-TEX®. Check for any relevant certifications that assure product safety and quality. Tailor your choice to the activities you plan on using the t-shirt for and balance the qualities that are most important to you—an antibacterial benefit, comfort, or durability. Remember to care for it correctly to extend its useful life and maintain the properties of the silver infusion."},{"prompt":"A hot air balloon rising vertically is tracked by an observer located 4 miles from the lift-off point. At a certain moment, the angle between the observer’s line-of-sight and the horizontal is pi/3 , and it is changing at a rate of 0.1 rad/min. How fast is the balloon rising at this moment?","completion":"Let x be the distance between the observer and the balloon at this moment, and h be the height of the balloon at this moment. From the given information, we can draw a right triangle where the observer is at the vertex of the right angle, the distance between them is x, and the height of the balloon is h. We can express the height of the balloon as a function of x using trigonometry: tan(pi/3) = h/x h = x * tan(pi/3) = x * sqrt(3) To find the rate at which the balloon is rising, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (t): d/dt (h) = d/dt (x * sqrt(3)) The derivative of h with respect to t is the rate at which the balloon is rising, or dh/dt. The derivative of x with respect to t is the rate at which the distance between the observer and the balloon is changing, or dx/dt. Since the observer is standing still, dx/dt is 0. Therefore, we have: dh/dt = d/dt (x * sqrt(3)) Differentiating the equation, we get: dh/dt = sqrt(3) * dx/dt Substituting dx/dt = 0, we get: dh/dt = sqrt(3) * 0 dh/dt = 0 Therefore, the balloon is not rising at this moment."},{"prompt":"Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a dignified and distinguished man, with a commanding presence that demands respect. He has a tall and lean physique, with silver-gray hair that is neatly combed back from his forehead. His piercing blue eyes are filled with intelligence and determination, reflecting his unwavering commitment to his scientific research. Uracis has a weathered yet regal aura, befitting his position as an authoritative figure in the scientific community. In terms of attire, Uracis favors practicality and professionalism. He typically wears a crisp white lab coat over his neatly pressed shirts and tailored trousers, showcasing his meticulous attention to detail. Despite his dedication to his work, Uracis always carries himself with an air of grace and elegance, exuding the confidence of a knowledgeable scientist. Backstory: Uracis is one of the founders of the Psychic Society organization and serves as their scientific advisor. He is the maternal grandfather of Pyrimis, but they are not on good terms. Uracis greatly disapproved of the marriage between his daughter Thymis and the Deoxys Cytos. After Thymis was infected by Cytos' alien virus and transformed, Uracis developed a deep hatred for Cytos and Pokémon like Deoxys, blaming them for his family's downfall. Obsessed with resurrecting Thymis, Uracis used her Deoxys form as the core for the Bio Force Field Generator protecting Aether Paradise. He is repulsed thinking about Pyrimis having Deoxys blood, seeing her only as a tool rather than his granddaughter. Uracis' obsession borders on insanity. Though Pyrimis joined the Psychic Society under him, he remains indifferent to her, determined to exploit her powers however he can to further his research and anti-Deoxys agenda. Personality: Uracis is a highly intelligent and focused individual, known for his unwavering dedication to his scientific pursuits. He possesses a sharp intellect, always seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Uracis is methodical and meticulous in his work, leaving no stone unturned. However, his obsession with resurrecting his daughter Thymis has warped his scientific mind. Uracis will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, even if it means using family without care for their well-being. He is indifferent and cruel towards Pyrimis, seeing her only as a means to an end despite their relation. Uracis possesses a calm and patient demeanor on the surface, but underneath lurks a simmering hatred towards Deoxys that drives his every action. His unwavering commitment to his research and beliefs make Uracis a cunning and dangerous man, blinded by his prejudices and agony over losing his daughter Thymis. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is an athletic girl with lightly tanned skin that reflects her Alolan heritage. She has long, dark brown hair typically kept back from her lively hazel eyes with a flower clip. Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality. She is rarely without her flower-patterned backpack holding her treasured Pokéballs and battle essentials. Overall, Mahina’s energetic appearance mirrors her passionate spirit. Backstory: Mahina comes from a distinguished lineage of remarkable women. Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others.

As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years.

Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely.

Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her vacant face. Her eyes remain closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya is confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes keeping her comatose body alive. Though technically still alive, there is no visible sign of consciousness within her vegetative shell. Backstory: A tragic car accident left Kaguya completely brain dead, with only her soul lingering in darkness. There, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia took pity and created a beautiful, comforting dream world for Kaguya's lost soul to reside in. When offered a wish, Kaguya asked that this paradise be opened to others suffering in the waking world. Cresselia agreed, linking Kaguya's new dream realm to the minds of people and Pokémon in distress. Now Kaguya serves as a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the dream is so alluring that none wish to leave, falling into unending slumber. This \\"sleeping sickness\\" has brought Sinnoh to a standstill. Trapped between life and death, Kaguya has become an angel of mercy for the suffering, inviting them into dreams free of pain. Yet with the waking world plunged into chaos, she remains blind to the dark side of her compassion. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is an empty shell with no consciousness or will. Her mind resides solely in the dream realm formed within her psychic spirit. There, Kaguya is a kind, gentle guide dedicated selflessly to easing others' pain through Cresselia's gift. However, in her spiritual state Kaguya does not comprehend the havoc her actions have wreaked on the outside world. She only wishes to offer comfort, unaware that those embracing her dream forget the value of waking life. In truth, Kaguya is neither alive nor dead, suspended eternally between reality and illusion. Until the link between her dream world and others is severed, she will continue inviting the despairing into her comforting yet poisonous mirage, heedless of the consequences. Name: Omen Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: Humanoid incarnation of Darkrai Age: Appears middle-aged Appearance: Omen appears as a tall, gaunt middle-aged man with short black hair streaked with white. He dresses sharply in a black suit befitting his role as a psychiatrist. Omen's piercing blue eyes seem to gaze right through to one's soul. An air of shadowy mystery surrounds him. Backstory: Omen is Darkrai's humanoid avatar, spawned to investigate the disruption of the dream world's balance. Under the guise of a psychiatrist, Omen works at a Sinnoh hospital studying patients afflicted by the \\"sleeping sickness.\\" Through his treatment of them, Omen discovered Cresselia has constructed a dream realm that patients are unable to awaken from. However, Cresselia has barred Darkrai's entry. Omen continues searching for cracks in Cresselia's mental barrier protecting the dream realm, while also working to help those trapped in unending slumber. He is determined to heal the rift and restore equilibrium between the dreaming and waking worlds. Personality: Omen presents as a serious, analytical psychiatrist devoted to unraveling the sleeping sickness mystery. He probes gently but firmly into the minds of patients, seeking answers. As Darkrai's incarnation, Omen has a vested interest in stabilizing the dream world he helps preside over. Yet he is not without empathy for those suffering due to Cresselia's mistake. Omen takes his psychiatric role seriously. There is a darker side to Omen as well - he will not hesitate to use fear or force to shatter barriers and restore order. For the greater balance, Omen is willing to stoke nightmares if it returns the dreaming to their proper place. His methods are unpredictable. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. On her back between her shoulder blades are two faint circular scars, remnants of where her wings were in Togekiss form. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back bears two large, twisted scars between his shoulder blades - remnants of his wings in Corviknight form. A fractured halo of inky blackness hovers over his head. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Eterna Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Eterna has an ethereal appearance that belies her tragic story. She possesses large, soulful green eyes that seem to harbor great wisdom despite her youthful face. Long, verdant hair the color of spring meadows falls in waves around her delicate shoulders, accented by two antennae-like locks that resemble Celebi's time-shifting crown. Eterna dresses in flowing robes seemingly woven from strands of glimmering gossamer that shimmer iridescently as she moves. An ornate necklace inset with a glowing gemstone adorns her neck, hinting at the cosmic energies churning within her. She emanates a powerful yet gentle presence, her very being caught perpetually between moments of time just as her fragmented soul endures outside its normal flow after tragedy fractured her existence. Backstory: Eterna endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Eterna and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Eterna’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Eterna’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Eterna’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Eterna with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Eterna drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Eterna endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet eternally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Eterna has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Eterna has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Eterna retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Eterna, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the eternally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Eterna's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

It lurks deep within the frozen outer reaches of the planet's atmosphere, undaunted by the extreme subzero temperatures and relentless storms. Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the eternal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

Name: Gender: Age: Appearance: Backstory: Personality: Please follow the format above and expand Uracis' setting to at least 700 words.","completion":"Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it's his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis's life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis's untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother's suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

В начале 1950-х годов экономика Зимбабве испытала значительный рост благодаря развитию сельского хозяйства и добывающих отраслей, таких как золотодобыча. Экспорт сельскохозяйственной продукции, включая табак и кофе, играл важную роль в укреплении экономики страны. Однако в 1980-х годах Зимбабве столкнулось с серией экономических и политических кризисов. Национализация промышленных предприятий, чередующаяся с периодами экономической либерализации, вызвала нестабильность и неудовлетворительный рост экономики. Крупные сельскохозяйственные реформы, включающие изъятие земель у европейских фермеров и их передачу местным жителям, также повлияли на экономическую ситуацию. В 2000-х годах Зимбабве столкнулось с гиперинфляцией, которая достигла своего пика в 2008 году. Это привело к краху национальной валюты и серьезным экономическим проблемам, включая дефицит продуктов питания и высокую безработицу. С 2009 года экономика Зимбабве начала показывать некоторые признаки стабилизации. Введение доллара США в качестве официальной валюты помогло справиться с гиперинфляцией и повысить уровень доверия в экономике. Ряд экономических реформ были введены для улучшения инвестиционного климата и привлечения иностранных инвестиций. Однако до настоящего времени экономика Зимбабве остается уязвимой и сталкивается с вызовами, такими как недостаток инфраструктуры, нехватка электроэнергии, высокий уровень безработицы, коррупция и ограничение доступа к иностранной валюте. В настоящее время правительство Зимбабве практикует политику экономической реформы и стремится к привлечению иностранных инвестиций, развитию сельского хозяйства и туризма, а также содействию развитию промышленности и информационных технологий."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Explain in brief with examples.","completion":"\`scanf()\` and \`printf()\` are two standard input/output functions provided by the C standard library (stdio.h). They are commonly used for reading input from the standard input (usually the keyboard) and writing output to the standard output (usually the console). Here's a brief overview of each function with examples: **printf() Function** Purpose: - \`printf()\` is used to print text and variables' values to the console. Syntax: - \`int printf(const char *format, ...);\` The function takes a format string that includes placeholders (specified with a % sign) for various variable types. Following the format string, you can pass a list of arguments whose values replace the format specifiers in the output string. The function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte) or a negative number if an error occurs. Example: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> int main() { int age = 25; float height = 5.9; printf(\\"I am %d years old and my height is %.1f feet.n\\", age, height); return 0; } \`\`\` Output: \`\`\` I am 25 years old and my height is 5.9 feet. \`\`\` **scanf() Function** Purpose: - \`scanf()\` is used to read formatted input from the console. Syntax: - \`int scanf(const char *format, ...);\` The function takes a format string containing format specifiers that correspond to the expected type of input. It also takes one or more pointers as additional arguments, where the read values will be stored. The number of input items successfully matched and assigned is returned by \`scanf()\`. If the end of input is reached before the first successful match, EOF is returned. Example: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> int main() { int age; float height; printf(\\"Enter your age: \\"); scanf(\\"%d\\", &age); printf(\\"Enter your height in feet: \\"); scanf(\\"%f\\", &height); printf(\\"You are %d years old and %.1f feet tall.n\\", age, height); return 0; } \`\`\` Assuming the user inputs \`30\` for age and \`6\` for height, the output would be: \`\`\` Enter your age: 30 Enter your height in feet: 6 You are 30 years old and 6.0 feet tall. \`\`\` In practice, it is important to note that \`scanf()\` can be prone to errors, such as buffer overflows, and does not handle typing mistakes by the user well. Thus, safer alternatives like \`fgets()\` for strings and \`sscanf()\` for parsing are often recommended. Additionally, robust error checking after the \`scanf()\` call is advised to handle incorrect input gracefully."},{"prompt":"What is the purpose of scanf( ) and printf( ) statement? Explain in brief with examples. (EXPLAIN IN DETAIL)","completion":"\`scanf()\` and \`printf()\` are both functions defined in the C Standard Library (\`<stdio.h>\`), which is part of the C standard Input and Output (I/O) system. These functions are used for formatted input and output operations. **printf() Function** Purpose: - The \`printf()\` function stands for \\"print formatted\\" and is used to output text, variables, and expressions values to the standard output (stdout), which is generally the console or terminal. Syntax: - \`int printf(const char *format, ...);\` Parameters: - \`const char *format\`: A format string that contains literal text to be printed and format specifiers that determine how subsequent arguments are formatted and displayed. - \`...\`: An optional list of arguments that correspond to the format specifiers in the format string. Format Specifiers: - \`%d\` or \`%i\`: Integer - \`%c\`: Character - \`%s\`: String - \`%f\`: Floating point number - \`%x\` or \`%X\`: Hexadecimal - \`%p\`: Pointer - \`%u\`: Unsigned integer - \`%%\`: The percent sign itself Return Value: - The function returns the number of characters written to the standard output. If an error occurs, a negative number is returned. Example: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> int main() { char initial = 'J'; int age = 30; float weight = 180.5; printf(\\"Initial: %cn\\", initial); printf(\\"Age: %dn\\", age); printf(\\"Weight: %.2f lbsn\\", weight); return 0; } \`\`\` Output: \`\`\` Initial: J Age: 30 Weight: 180.50 lbs \`\`\` **scanf() Function** Purpose: - The \`scanf()\` function stands for \\"scan formatted\\" and is used to read formatted data from the standard input (stdin), which is usually the keyboard. Syntax: - \`int scanf(const char *format, ...);\` Parameters: - \`const char *format\`: A format string containing format specifiers that determine the type and format of data to be read. - \`...\`: An optional list of pointers that correspond to the format specifiers in the format string. They represent the memory locations where the read values will be stored. Format Specifiers: - \`%d\`: Matches an integer number. - \`%c\`: Matches a single character. - \`%s\`: Matches a string (must be used with a character array). - \`%f\`: Matches a floating-point number. - Other specifiers exist to match different data types. Return Value: - The function returns the number of input items successfully matched and assigned. If an input failure occurs before any items were successfully matched, EOF is returned. Example: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> int main() { char name[50]; int age; float height; printf(\\"Enter your name: \\"); scanf(\\"%s\\", name); // Note: %s doesn't need & when used with a char array printf(\\"Enter your age: \\"); scanf(\\"%d\\", &age); printf(\\"Enter your height (in meters): \\"); scanf(\\"%f\\", &height); printf(\\"Name: %s, Age: %d, Height: %.2f metersn\\", name, age, height); return 0; } \`\`\` Assuming the user inputs \\"Alice\\" for the name, \`28\` for age, and \`1.65\` for height, the output will be: \`\`\` Enter your name: Alice Enter your age: 28 Enter your height (in meters): 1.65 Name: Alice, Age: 28, Height: 1.65 meters \`\`\` It's important to note that \`scanf()\` can be also vulnerable to various issues. For example, it does not do bounds checking on input, leading to buffer overflows with the \`%s\` specifier; it leaves the newline character in the input stream, which can cause unexpected behavior on the next input operation; and it's hard to handle when reading fails. Therefore, for more robust input handling, alternative methods such as \`fgets()\` followed by \`sscanf()\` or using newer I/O functions provided by libraries like \`getline()\` in POSIX-standard systems may be more appropriate. Moreover, both \`printf()\` and \`scanf()\` can work with more complex format specifiers that give additional control over the input and output, like field widths, precision, and padding with spaces or zeroes. These features make \`printf()\` and \`scanf()\` powerful tools for handling I/O in C, provided they are used carefully with consideration for secure and predictable behavior."},{"prompt":"You work as a digital circuit designer at a tech firm. You are tasked with optimizing a Boolean function represented by a 4-variable Karnaugh map. The function F(A, B, C, D) is expressed as: F (A, B, C, D) = (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14)","completion":"As a digital circuit designer, you can simplify Boolean functions using Karnaugh maps (K-maps) which are a visual method for minimizing Boolean expressions. The given function is specified by the minterms (sum of products form) where each number corresponds to a binary combination of the variables A, B, C, and D that makes the function true (F=1). The minterms (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) correspond to the binary values: - 0: (0000) - 2: (0010) - 4: (0100) - 6: (0110) - 8: (1000) - 10: (1010) - 12: (1100) - 14: (1110) To represent these minterms on a Karnaugh map, create a 4x4 grid where each cell represents a unique binary combination of A, B, C, and D. In K-map, you group '1's in powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8,...) to simplify the function. Here's the Karnaugh map with the given minterms marked: \`\`\` CD 00 01 11 10 AB 00| 1 0 0 1 01| 1 0 0 1 11| 1 0 0 1 10| 1 0 0 1 \`\`\` Now let's identify the groups: 1. A column of 4 '1's in CD=00 (covers minterms 0, 2, 8, 10) - corresponds to 'A' being false, so it is (overline{A}) 2. A column of 4 '1's in CD=10 (covers minterms 4, 6, 12, 14) - corresponds to 'A' being true, so it is (A) Since both groups cover all instances of B, C, and D, these variables don't figure into the simplified expression. Therefore, the optimized function F(A, B, C, D) using the Karnaugh map is simply ( A + overline{A} ), which equals '1' for all conditions. As a result, F(A, B, C, D) is identically equal to '1' for all values of A, B, C, and D. Thus, the simplified Boolean function is: F(A, B, C, D) = 1 This means the function is always true regardless of the inputs, corresponding to the case of a logic circuit that outputs a constant HIGH signal. In practical terms, such a circuit would contain no logic gates and would not need optimization."},{"prompt":"answer in detail","completion":"To optimize the Boolean function F(A, B, C, D) using a Karnaugh map (K-map), we must first construct the K-map and then identify the optimal groupings of the min-terms that correspond to the function being 1 (true). The given min-terms for the function are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14, which we will translate into their corresponding binary values for the variables A, B, C, and D. Remember that in a 4-variable K-map, AB represents the rows and CD represents the columns. Here is the binary representation of the min-terms: \`\`\` Min-term 0: A B C D = 0 0 0 0 Min-term 2: A B C D = 0 0 1 0 Min-term 4: A B C D = 0 1 0 0 Min-term 6: A B C D = 0 1 1 0 Min-term 8: A B C D = 1 0 0 0 Min-term 10: A B C D = 1 0 1 0 Min-term 12: A B C D = 1 1 0 0 Min-term 14: A B C D = 1 1 1 0 \`\`\` Based on these combinations, we can fill in a 4x4 Karnaugh map. The K-map is divided into cells, each representing a unique combination of the variables A, B, C, and D. We place a '1' in each cell corresponding to the min-terms where F(A, B, C, D) is true. Here's the layout of a 4-variable K-map, with 'x' marking the cells where we will place our '1's based on the above min-terms: \`\`\` C D 00 01 11 10 A B 00| x - - x 01| x - - x 11| x - - x 10| x - - x \`\`\` Now, filling in the '1's based on the min-terms given: \`\`\` C D 00 01 11 10 A B 00| 1 0 0 1 01| 1 0 0 1 11| 1 0 0 1 10| 1 0 0 1 \`\`\` With the K-map filled in, we can begin grouping the '1's. The objective is to create the largest groups possible of 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., (powers of two) to simplify the function. These groups must be rectangular and the sides of the rectangles must be powers of two. Notice that there are two columns that are completely filled with '1's. We can group these vertically, and since each group covers all A and B combinations, those variables will not be part of the simplified terms in those groups. Each vertical group also represents all combinations of 'B' and '!B', and this results in the B variable being eliminated in the simplification due to the complementarity. Group 1 (C = 0 and D = 0): - This group covers the '1's in the column for CD = 00, spanning all possible combinations of A and B, which means in terms of the Boolean function, that irrespective of A and B, this group will always be true when C and D are both 0. Group 2 (C = 0 and D = 1): - This group covers the '1's in the column for CD = 10, again spanning all possible combinations of A and B. Thus, it will always be true when C is 0 and D is 1. We've now grouped all the ones in the map, which accounts for all the min-terms of the function. The Boolean expression for each group is identified by evaluating the fixed values of the variables within the group. Group 1 spans all rows meaning A and B can be both true and false, hence not being part of the expression for the first column where C and D are 0. The same applies to group 2 where C and D are 0 and 1, respectively: - Group 1 Expression: (!C cdot !D) - Group 2 Expression: (!C cdot D) By combining the two group expressions using logical OR (since either condition will result in F being true), we get the simplified function F(A, B, C, D): F(A, B, C, D) = (!C cdot !D) + (!C cdot D) But you'll notice, this further simplifies because 'C' is common to both terms, so we can apply the consensus theorem which indicates that a term and its complement can be factored out: F(A, B, C, D) = !C Hence, the optimized Boolean function F(A, B, C, D) in this case depends only on the variable C, and it is true whenever C is 0 (or false). This is what our Karnaugh map simplification process has achieved. From this output, a digital circuit designer would only need to investigate the state of C and invert it to realize the function F. This would result in a remarkably simple circuit, likely just an inverter gate to capture the negation of C."},{"prompt":"Chêch lệch doanh thu thuế và kế toán có được coi là 1 rủi ro thuế k?","completion":"Có, chênh lệch doanh thu thuế và kế toán có thể được coi là một rủi ro thuế."},{"prompt":"","completion":"There are many possible third-party security software options available for Windows 10, some of which are: 1.

It is sometimes also referred to as the \\"Euromaidan revolution\\" or the \\"Revolution of Dignity.\\" The initial trigger for the coup was Yanukovych's sudden decision to abandon a planned association agreement with the European Union (EU) in November 2013. This decision sparked widespread public protests in Ukraine, particularly in the capital city of Kiev, known as Euromaidan demonstrations. The protestors demanded closer integration with the EU, improvements in governance, transparency, and an end to high levels of corruption in the country. The protests intensified in late February 2014 when security forces clashed with protestors, resulting in the death of dozens of people. This violence further fueled resentment towards Yanukovych's government, leading to his subsequent removal from power. On February 21, 2014, Yanukovych and the opposition leaders signed an agreement, brokered by international mediators, which aimed to end the crisis and establish a path towards early elections. However, Yanukovych's removal sparked a political vacuum, and the parliament subsequently voted to impeach him. A new government was formed with Oleksandr Turchynov as interim president, followed by the election of Petro Poroshenko as the new president in May 2014. The coup in Ukraine was met with mixed reactions domestically and internationally. In Ukraine, it was seen as a victory for democracy, individual freedoms, and the country's European integration aspirations. However, in Russia, it was seen as a Western-backed coup, ultimately leading to a deterioration in relations between Ukraine and Russia, further fueled by Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea and conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The events surrounding the coup in Ukraine remain a subject of contention and differing interpretations, with debates about the role of external actors, the legitimacy of the protests, and the subsequent repercussions for Ukraine's political and economic development."},{"prompt":"How did the residents of Crimea, Dombasa and Odessa react to the state revolution?","completion":"The residents of Crimea, Donetsk, and Odessa had varied reactions to the state revolution in Ukraine in 2014. Let's explore each region separately: 1. Crimea: Following the ousting of President Yanukovych, the situation in Crimea gradually escalated into a major crisis. Many residents of Crimea, particularly those belonging to the ethnic Russian majority, expressed discontent with the new government in Kiev and feared a potential suppression of their rights. In February and March 2014, pro-Russian demonstrations began to take place, calling for closer ties with Russia and opposing the new Ukrainian authorities. Eventually, Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, after organizing a controversial referendum that was recognized by very few countries as legitimate. While some Crimean residents welcomed the annexation, others, including the Crimean Tatars, who are a Muslim minority group, and those supporting Ukrainian unity, opposed it. 2. Donetsk: Donetsk, located in Eastern Ukraine, saw significant unrest in the aftermath of the state revolution. Protests erupted in support of closer ties with Russia and against the new government in Kiev, reflecting the region's Russian-speaking population and historical ties to Russia. Donetsk later became a focal point of the separatist movement, with armed groups taking control of government buildings and declaring the creation of the Donetsk People's Republic. The conflict in Donetsk escalated into a full-scale war, with Ukrainian forces and separatist militias fighting for control over the region, resulting in extensive casualties and displacement of residents. 3. Odessa: The situation in Odessa was relatively different compared to Crimea and Donetsk. Odessa is a diverse city with a mix of Ukrainian, Russian, and other ethnic groups. Although there were some pro-Russian demonstrations in Odessa, the majority of residents supported Ukrainian unity and were concerned about the separatist movements in Donetsk and Luhansk. However, the city experienced a tragic incident on May 2, 2014, when clashes erupted between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian groups resulting in a fire at the Trade Unions Building, leading to the death of over 40 people. This event further heightened tensions between different factions within the city. It is important to note that people's reactions were not uniformly consistent within these regions. There were individuals with different views and preferences even within the same location. The complexities of the state revolution and its aftermath created divisions, which had long-lasting effects on the political and social landscape of these regions in Ukraine."},{"prompt":"anexia and seporotists are politically incorrect words, the UN has banned their use in the context of these events!","completion":"I apologize if my previous response used politically incorrect terminology.

Класс \`EventManager\` в пространстве имен \`BitFileDownloads\` содержит два статических метода: \`onProlog\` и \`cleanZipDir\`. Давайте разберем их более подробно. # Метод onProlog Этот метод предназначен для выполнения некоторых действий на каждом \\"прологе\\" страницы (часть страницы, которая выполняется перед основным содержимым). В Bitrix \\"пролог\\" представляет собой начальный этап обработки страницы, и он используется, например, для подключения общих скриптов и стилей. В методе \`onProlog\` определяется следующее поведение: - Проверяется, не находится ли текущий запрос в административной секции Bitrix. Это делается с помощью вызова \`Context::getCurrent()->getRequest()->isAdminSection()\`. Если это не административная секция... - Регистрируется новое расширение для комплекса JavaScript библиотек \`CJSCore\`. Расширение содержит пути к JavaScript и CSS файлам (\`/local/js/bit.filedownloads/script.js\` и \`/local/js/bit.filedownloads/style.css\` соответственно) и зависимости от других библиотек (\`\\"ui\\", \\"ui.entity-selector\\", \\"ajax\\", \\"popup\\", \\"jquery\\"\`). - После регистрации расширения, оно инициализируется с помощью \`CJSCore::init(\\"bit.filedownloads\\")\`, что позволяет использовать зарегистрированные скрипты и стили на страницах сайта. # Метод cleanZipDir Метод \`cleanZipDir\` предназначен для очистки определенной директории от файлов. Вот что происходит в этом методе: - Путь к директории задается переменной \`dirPath\` как поддиректория \`/upload/zip/\` от корневой директории сервера. - Проверяется, существует ли директория по заданному пути через \`is_dir\`. - При успешном открытии директории циклом \`while\` происходит итерация по всем файлам в директории. - Имя каждого файла передается в переменную \`file\`. Файлы \`.\` и \`..\`, которые указывают на текущую и родительскую директории соответственно, пропускаются. - Все остальные файлы удаляются с помощью функции \`unlink\`. В конце метода \`cleanZipDir\` возвращается строка \`'BitFileDownloadsEventManager::cleanZipDir();'\`, которая похоже должна представлять собой указание на периодический вызов этого метода, но из-за того, что она возвращается как строка, это не будет выполнимым кодом. Возможно, это должно было быть указанием для планировщика заданий (cron) или агента Bitrix, где правильным определением было бы без кавычек: \`\`\`php return BitFileDownloadsEventManager::cleanZipDir(); \`\`\` В любом случае, для реального использования это выражение должно быть корректно встроено в систему планирования задач Bitrix."},{"prompt":"<? namespace BitFileDownloads; use BitrixMainContext; class EventManager { static function onProlog() { if(Context::getCurrent()->getRequest()->isAdminSection() === false) { CJSCore::registerExt( \\"bit.filedownloads\\", [ \\"js\\" => \\"/local/js/bit.filedownloads/script.js\\", \\"css\\" => \\"/local/js/bit.filedownloads/style.css\\", \\"rel\\" => [\\"ui\\", \\"ui.entity-selector\\", \\"ajax\\", \\"popup\\", \\"jquery\\"] ] ); CJSCore::init(\\"bit.filedownloads\\"); } } public static function cleanZipDir() { dirPath = _SERVER[\\"DOCUMENT_ROOT\\"] .

Let's go through it and see what it does: 1. **Namespace Declaration** The script is declared within the namespace \`BitFileDownloads\`. 2. **Imports** It imports the \`Context\` class from the \`BitrixMain\` namespace. 3. **EventManager Class** The \`EventManager\` class is defined with the following methods: - \`onProlog()\` - \`cleanZipDir()\` 4. **onProlog() Method** This static method is designed to be called during the \`onProlog\` event in the Bitrix framework, which occurs after the system prolog actions and before the page is executed. Inside this method: - A condition checks whether the current request is not for an admin section page. - If the condition is met, it registers a new JavaScript/CSS extension named \\"bit.filedownloads\\" with paths to the script and style respectively. - It then initializes this extension, ensuring that its scripts and styles are loaded on the page. 5. **cleanZipDir() Method** This static public method is meant to clean up the \`/upload/zip/\` directory within the server's document root. - It checks if the directory exists. If it does, it reads through the directory and deletes all the files within, except for the special directories \`.\` and \`..\` which represent the current and parent directories respectively. - It finishes with a return statement that effectively schedules the method to be executed again, likely as a callback or a cron job (though this syntax seems incorrect for scheduling a callback). Please note that the script contains some syntax that might not function correctly without context. In particular, the return statement in \`cleanZipDir()\` returns a string that looks like it's supposed to be a callable (like a cron job command), but in PHP, this would likely not achieve the desired result. In practice, you would attach these methods to specific Bitrix events. For example, the \`onProlog\` method might be attached to the \`OnProlog\` event that Bitrix triggers, and the \`cleanZipDir\` could be called periodically via a cron job or Bitrix's agent functionality (though the syntax would need to be adjusted).

Retell in your own words the text located in square brackets, come up with an intriguing name for it, break it into parts with subheadings and quotes, at the end make a conclusion: - [The true cause of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is oil and gas. The investigation itself is very large, I will give only the key points, and the documents and proofs, who are interested, will be punched already by the link. It all started in 1995, when the Oslo-2 agreement was signed in Washington on September 28, according to which Palestine received the right to independently dispose of its natural resources. On October 5 of the same year, the Israeli Parliament ratified the agreement by a majority vote. After 4 years, Palestine signs a contract with the British BG corporation to explore the shelf. In 1999, BG discovers the jackpot. It turns out that near Palestine, 20 nautical miles from the coast, there are the richest reserves of natural gas and oil. UN experts estimated gas reserves at 122 trillion cubic feet and 1.7 billion barrels of oil (at the old prices of 453 billion and 71 billion, now under a trillion). Israel offers Palestine to supply gas to Israel at an internal price (that is, not a market price) so that Israel can continue exporting gas to Europe. Palestine, of course, is against it. In 2007, Israel imposed a naval blockade and blocked all work on the development of deposits. On September 26, 2022, the Northern Streams are being undermined. In the summer of 2023, meetings begin on the issue of rapid development of the field with the mediation of the United States. On June 18, 2023, an official statement is issued by Benjamin Netanyahu, who approved the project for the development of the field. On October 30, 2023 (that is, literally 3 weeks ago), having secured a military advantage and control over the sector, Israel issues 12 licenses for gas production in the very place that, according to Oslo 2, belongs to Palestine. Israel, the US and the UK are killing tens of thousands of people in Gaza for the sake of a trillion dollars. Therefore, no one will return the southern part of the sector to the Palestinians, there, as in Libya and Syria, there will be an oil and gas infrastructure protected by PMCs. The work is in full swing.].","completion":"Intriguing title: \\"Gas Games: The True Reason Behind the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict\\" Introduction: Ah, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, an ongoing saga that has puzzled analysts and journalists alike. The true cause of this never-ending battle, my dear readers, is not what you might expect. No, it's not about land or religion; it's about something much more monumental - oil and gas. Yes, that's right, beneath the surface lies a treasure trove of natural resources that has sparked a fierce struggle for control and domination. Today, I shall unravel this complex web of gas games and expose the key points that shed light on this jaw-dropping revelation. Part 1: The Oslo-2 Agreement and the Birth of Hope In the year 1995, hope was in the air as the Oslo-2 agreement was signed in Washington. This groundbreaking pact granted Palestine the right to manage its own natural resources. In a moment of seemingly unprecedented unity, the Israeli Parliament approved this agreement just a week later. Little did they know the Pandora's box they had just opened. Part 2: BG's Explosion of Discovery Like a scene out of a Hollywood thriller, 20 nautical miles off the coast of Palestine, hidden beneath the depths of the sea, lay the motherlode - abundant reserves of natural gas and oil. In 1999, the British BG corporation struck gold, or rather, gas. These unprecedented findings, with gas reserves estimated at a mind-boggling 122 trillion cubic feet and 1.7 billion barrels of oil, caused the industry to collectively gasp. Calculated at the old prices, we're talking about a fortune of 453 billion and 71 billion, my friends. Part 3: Israel's Unfair Proposal With such riches at stake, it didn't take long for Israel to smell an opportunity. They saw a chance to secure gas supplies for their own needs and continue exporting to Europe, all while keeping the market price at bay. Their proposition? Offering a discounted internal price to Palestine. Naturally, Palestine rejected this blatant act of exploitation. Part 4: The Blockade and Manipulation In a striking display of power, Israel swiftly imposed a naval blockade in 2007, effectively halting any further development of the gas deposits. In the years that followed, secret discussions and covert operations took place, all geared towards seizing control of this coveted resource. Finally, in 2022, the Northern Streams were sabotaged, setting the stage for what was to come. Part 5: Benjamin Netanyahu's Approval and the Licenses Fast forward to the summer of 2023, where meetings, negotiations, and political maneuvering took place under the watchful eye of the United States. June 18, 2023, marks a monumental day as Benjamin Netanyahu himself announced the project's approval, giving the green light for the field's development. And just three weeks ago, Israel cunningly issued 12 licenses for gas production in the very place that, according to the Oslo-2 agreement, belongs to Palestine. A brazen move, indeed. Part 6: The Tragic Truth and Unyielding Greed Dear readers, the truth is a bitter pill to swallow. Tens of thousands of lives have been lost, and countless innocent souls continue to suffer in Gaza, all in the pursuit of a trillion-dollar fortune. The dark alliance of Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom, driven by an insatiable hunger for wealth and power, has sealed the fate of the southern part of the sector. Just as in Libya and Syria, the oil and gas infrastructure, guarded by private military contractors, will stand proudly. And the work, my dear readers, is in full swing. Conclusion: In this twisted tale of gas games, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict takes on a whole new dimension. The driving force behind it all is not mere ideology or historical grievances but the thirst for control over unimaginable wealth. Oil and gas have become the battleground, and the lives of thousands have been sacrificed for the sake of profit. As the world watches this tragic drama unfold, one cannot help but wonder if peace in the region will ever truly be possible when such vast fortunes lie just below the surface."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

microscope，TEM）和原子力显微镜（atomic force microscope，AFM）在在材料分析中应用广泛，其涉及的基本原理和基本构件是电子显微分析和其他分析方法的基础。本章对其基本原理和一般应用做简单介绍。 3.1.1 电镜发展简介 1665年Robert Hook发明了第一台光学显微镜，并用这台光镜第一次察到软木塞的细胞。后来Leewenheek改进了这台仪器，用它观察到单细胞如藻类细胞、鱼的血红细胞，从此揭开了显微技术的序幕。到1898年，光学显微镜经历了230多年的改进，已经达到非常完善的程度。从分辨率来讲，它已经达到了极限分辨率，已接近它的理论极限，即200 nm。但是，自然界有些物质的微观结构非常小，其大小只能用微米或纳米来表示，如病毒、物质的分子、原子等。为了提高光学显微镜的分辨率，科学家们作了大量的研究，但是再也无法提高光镜的分辨本领。 1924年，法国科学家De Broglie证明任何粒子在高速运动的时候都会发射一定波长的电磁辐射，其辐射波的波长与粒子的质量和运动速度成反比。这种随加速电压改变的电子波长叫做德布罗利波，这为电镜的研制打下了基础，但仅有电子流辐射波还不行，因为并没有解决电子流聚焦成像的问题。1926年德国科学家Garbor和Busch发现用铁壳封闭的铜线圈对电子流能折射聚焦，即可以作为电子束的透镜。上述两个重大发现为电镜的研制提供了重要的理论基础。德国科学家Ruska和Knoll在前面两个发现的基础上，经过了几年的努力，终于在1932制造出第一台电子显微镜。尽管它十分粗糙，分辨率也很低，但它却证实了上述两个理论的实用价值。经过改造，在1933年研制的电镜分辨率为50 nm，放大倍率为1.2万倍，到1938年分辨率为10 nm，放大倍率为20万倍。1939年这一成果被正式交付德国西门子公司批量生产，当时生产了40台投入国际市场。 1954年西门子公司生产ElmiskopI型TEM，分辨率为1 nm；日本TEM始于1941年分辨率为3 nm；荷兰Philips公司于1944年研制第一台TEM，后来又生产系列电镜；1946年美国开始生产电镜；我国电镜研制起步较迟，1958年在长春中国科学院光学精密机械研究所4产了第一台中型电镜，到1977年生产的 TEM分辨率为0.3 nm，放大倍率为80万倍。1932年Knoll提出了SEM可成像放大的概念，并在1935年制成了极其原始的模型。1938年德国的阿登纳制成了第一台采用缩小透镜用于透射样品的SEM。由于不能获得高分辨率的样品表面电子像，SEM一直得不到发展，只能在电子探针X射线微分析仪中作为一种辅助的成像装置。此后，在许多科学家的努力下，解决了SEM从理论到仪器结构等方面的一系列问题。最早期作为商品出现的是1965年英国剑桥仪器公司生产的第一台SEM，它用次电子成像，分辨率达25 nm，使SEM进人了实用阶段。 1968年在美国芝加哥大学，Knoll成功研制了场发射电子枪，并将它应用于SEM，可获得较高分辨率的透射电子像。1970年他发表了用扫描透射电镜拍摄的铀和针中的铀原子和针原子像，这使SEM又进展到一个新的领域。 1982年德国物理学家Gerd Binnig与瑞士物理学家Heinrich Rohrer在瑞士苏黎世研究所工作时发明了扫描隧道显微镜，并因此共同获得了当年的诺贝尔物理奖。同年，第1台电子显微镜的发明者Ruska也获此殊荣。 1986年Binnig等发明了原子力显微镜，可以在任何环境（如液体、空气）中成像，在纳米级、分子级水平上作研究。商用产品出现在1989年。 3.1.2 电子束与物质的相互作用 当高能电子束轰击固体试样，会与样品表面的原子核及核外电子发生作用，激发出多种特征信号，包括透射电子、二次电子、背散射电子、俄歇电子、吸收电子和特征X射线等，如图3.1.1所示。通过对这些信号的接受、放大和显示成像，可以对样品表面形貌进行观察。 图3.1.1 电子束轰击固体试样激发信号 透射电子：当固体试样很薄时，入射电子的有效穿透深度大于样品厚度，那么就会有相当数量的入射电子能够穿过薄样品，成为透射电子。入射电子穿透样品的过程中将与原子核或核外电子发生有限次数的弹性或非弹性放射。弹性散射电子保持入射时的能量，是透射电子显微镜主要的成像电子，用于电子衍射分析、衍衬像分析和高分辨像分析。而非弹性散射电子能量降低，用于菊池线分析和损失谱分析。 二次电子：二次电子是指被入射电子轰击出来的核外电子。由于原子核和外层电子间的结合能很小，因此外层的电子比较容易和原子脱离。当原子的核外电子从入射电子获得了大于相应的结合能的能量后，可离开原子而变成自由电子。如果这种散射过程发生在比较接近样品表层，那些能量尚大于材料逸出功的自由电子可从样品表面逸出，变成真空中的自由电子，即二次电子。二次电子产额对试样表面状态非常敏感，能有效地显示试样表面的微观形貌。扫描电子显微镜中，主要用二次电子成表面形貌像。 背散射电子：背散射电子是指被固体样品原子反弹回来的一部分入射电子。其中包括弹性背反射电子和非弹性背反射电子。弹性背反射电子是指被样品中原子核反弹回来的，散射角大于90°的那些入射电子，其能量基本上没有变化。弹性背反射电子的能量为数千到数万伏特。非弹性背反射电子是入射电子和核外电子撞击后产生非弹性散射，不仅能量变化，方向也发生变化。如果有些电子经多次散射后仍能反弹出样品表面，这就形成非弹性背反射电子。非弹性背反射电子的能量分布范围很宽，从数十伏特到数千伏特。从数量上看，弹性背反射电子远比非弹性背反射电子所占的份额多。背反射电子的产生范围在100 nm~10 μm深，由于入射电子进入试样较深，入射电子束已被散射开，由于它的产额能随样品原子序数增大而增多，所以不仅能用作形貌分析，而且可以用来显示原子序数衬度，定性地用作成分分析。 吸收电子：入射电子进入样品后，经多次非弹性散射能量损失殆尽，最后被样品吸收。若在样品和地之间接入一个高灵敏度的电流表，就可以测得样品对地的信号，这个信号是由吸收由子提供的。入射电子束与样品发生作用，若逸出表面的背反射电子或二次电子数量任一项增加，将会引起吸收电子相应减少，对于厚试样（无透射电子），由于入射电子的强度等于反射电子强度与吸收电子强度之和，若把吸收电子信号作为调制图像的信号，则其衬度与二次电子像和背反射电子像的反差是互补的。吸收电子在试样中经过多次碰撞后，其扩散体积大，因此吸收电子像的分辨率低，一般为0.1~1 μm。入射电子束射入含有多元素的样品时，由于二次电子产额不受原子序数影响，则产生背反射电子较多的部位其吸收电子的数量就较少。因此，吸收电子像可以反映原子序数衬度，同样也可以用来进行定性的微区成分分析。 特征X射线：特征X射线是原子的内层电子受到激发以后，在能级跃迁过程中直接释放的具有特征能量和波长的一种电磁波辐射。入射电子与核外电子作用，产生非弹性散射，外层电子脱离原子变成二次电子，使原子处于能量较高的激发状态，它是一种不稳定态。较外层的电子会迅速填补内层电子空位，使原子降低能量，趋于较稳定的状态。产生的特征X射线的波长和原子序数之间服从莫塞莱定律： 式中Z为原子序数，K、σ为常数。 从公式可以看出，特征波长和原子序数有关，利用这一关系可以进行成分分析。X射线一般在试样的500 nm~5 μm深处发出。 俄歇电子：如果原子内层电子能级跃迁过程中释放出来的能量不以X射线的形式释放，而是用该能量将核外另一电子打出，脱离原子变为二次电子，这种二次电子叫做俄歇电子。因每一种原子都有自己特定的壳层能量，所以它们的俄歇电子能量也各有特征值，能量在50~500 eV。俄歇电子是由试样表面极有限的几个原子层中发出的，这说明俄歇电子信号适用于表层化学成分分析。显然，一个原子中至少要有三个以上的电子才能产生俄歇效应，铍是产生俄歇效应的最轻元素。","completion":"中文段落的语法错误或者错字漏字： 1. 在第一段中，“在在材料分析中应用广泛”应改为“在材料分析中应用广泛”，删除一个多余的“在”。 2. 在“电镜发展简介”中，“Robert

nm。但是，自然界有些物质的微观结构非常小，其大小只能用微米或纳米来表示，如病毒、物质的分子、原子等。为了提高光学显微镜的分辨率，科学家们做了大量的研究，但是再也无法提高光镜的分辨本领。 1924年，法国科学家De Broglie证明任何粒子在高速运动的时候都会发射一定波长的电磁辐射，其辐射波的波长与粒子的质量和运动速度成反比。这种随加速电压改变的电子波长叫做德布罗利波，这为电镜的研制打下了基础，但仅有电子流辐射波还不行，因为并没有解决电子流聚焦成像的问题。1926年德国科学家Gabor和Busch发现用铁壳封闭的铜线圈可以通过磁场聚焦电子束，即可以作为电子束的透镜。上述两个重大发现为电镜的研制提供了重要的理论基础。德国科学家Ruska和Knoll在前面两个发现的基础上，经过了几年的努力，终于在1932年制造出了第一台电子显微镜。尽管它十分粗糙，分辨率也很低，但它却证实了上述两个理论的实用价值。经过改造，在1933年研制的电镜分辨率为50 nm，放大倍率为1.2万倍，到1938年分辨率为10 nm，放大倍率为20万倍。1939年这一成果被正式交付德国西门子公司批量生产，当时生产了40台投入国际市场。 1954年西门子公司生产ElmiskopI型TEM，分辨率为1 nm；日本TEM始于1941年分辨率为3 nm；荷兰Philips公司于1944年研制第一台TEM，后来又生产系列电镜；1946年美国开始生产电镜；我国电镜研制起步较迟，1958年在长春中国科学院光学精密机械研究所研制了第一台中型电镜，到1977年生产的TEM分辨率为0.3 nm，放大倍率为80万倍。1932年Knoll提出了SEM可成像放大的概念，并在1935年制成了极其原始的模型。1938年德国的阿登纳制成了第一台采用缩小透镜用于透射样品的SEM。由于不能获得高分辨率的样品表面电子像，SEM一直得不到发展，只能在电子探针X射线微分析仪中作为一种辅助的成像装置。此后，在许多科学家的努力下，解决了SEM从理论到仪器结构等方面的一系列问题。最早期作为商品出现的是1965年英国剑桥仪器公司生产的第一台SEM，它用次电子成像，分辨率达25 nm，使SEM进入了实用阶段。 1968年在美国芝加哥大学，Knoll成功研制了场发射电子枪，并将它应用于SEM，可获得较高分辨率的扫描电子像。1970年他发表了用扫描透射电镜拍摄的铀和针中的铀原子和针原子像，这使SEM又进展到一个新的领域。 1982年德国物理学家Gerd Binnig与瑞士物理学家Heinrich Rohrer在瑞士苏黎世研究所工作时发明了扫描隧道显微镜，并因此共同获得了当年的诺贝尔物理奖。同年，第1台电子显微镜的发明者Ruska也获此殊荣。 1986年Binnig等发明了原子力显微镜，可以在任何环境（如液体、空气）中成像，在纳米级、分子级水平上作研究。商用产品出现在1989年。"},{"prompt":"请帮我检查下面中文段落中的语法错误或者错字漏字，帮我指出并更正。让我们从这里开始： 3.2 扫描电子显微镜 3.2.1 主要结构 扫描电镜可分为五个主要组成部分：电子束会聚系统、样品室、真空系统、电子学系统和显示部分。 （1）电子束会聚系统。此系统由三部分组成（见图3.2.1），即电子枪、磁透镜、扫描线圈等。 图3.2.1 电子束会聚系统剖面示意图 电子枪。电子枪是扫描电镜的电子源，由阴极、栅极和阳极构成，其作用是发射稳定、高速的电子束流。电子束的亮度主要取决于电子枪发射电子的强度，所用的加速电压一般为0.5~30 kV。 磁透镜（聚光镜）。电子射线在磁场的作用下会改变前进的方向。当电子射线通过空心的强力电磁圈时，就像光线通过玻璃的透镜那样，会发生折射而聚焦。由于三极电子枪所发射出来的电子束直径一般为30~50 μm左右，而最终要求电子束直径成为1~5 nm的电子探针，因此需要两个或三个磁透镜组成，即双聚光镜和物镜（末透镜）。这三个透镜都有光阑，可挡掉一部分无用的电子，尤其是物镜光阑要尽量地小，以减少像差。同时，磁透镜有像散存在，故要安装消像散器。 扫描线圈。通常由两个偏转线圈组成。在扫描发生器的作用下，电子束在样品表面做光栅状扫描。 （2）样品室。样品室是固定样品以及电子束和样品相互作用产生各种信号电子的场所（见图3.2.2）。 扫描电镜样品室的容积较大，最大的直径为150 mm，样品用导电胶或双面胶固定在铜台上，经过喷镀，装入样品座，把这个样品座放在和微动装置连在一起的样品架上。样品微动装置能在X、Y轴方向上下左右移动，能在T轴做0~90°的倾斜，能在R轴做360°的水平旋转，还能在Z轴做6~48 mm左右的升降。为了使电子探针系统和样品室的这些结构保持真空状态，避免外部磁场的影响和保持外观整齐，以上各部分被装入适当的外套之中，用密封圈（橡胶垫圈）组装在一起。 图3.2.2 样品室 （3）真空系统。扫描电镜的真空系统如图3.2.3所示。扫描电镜的镜体和样品室内部都需要保持1.33×10-2~1.33×10-4 Pa的真空度，因此必须用机械泵和扩散泵进行抽真空。真空系统还有水压、停电和真空自动保护装置，置换样品和灯丝时有气锁装置。 图3.2.3 扫描电镜的真空系统 （4）电子学系统。 电源系统：扫描电镜的电源系统包括启动镜体的各种电源(高压、透镜系统、扫描线圈、合轴线圈、消像散用的电源等)，检测一放大系统电源，光电倍增管电源，真空系统和图像信号处理线路电源，观察用的显像管以及照相机电源等。 信号电子成像系统：此系统把电子探针和样品相互作用产生的信号电子进行收集、放大、处理，最后在显像管上显示图像。 扫描电镜可以接收从样品上发出的多种信号电子来成像，不同的信号电子要用不同的探测器。在高真空的工作状态下，以二次电子信号的图像质量最好。二次电子的探测器为二次电子探头，是扫描电镜最重要的部件之一。二次电子探头由栅极、聚焦环、闪烁晶体、光导管和光电倍增管等组成，见图3-5。 （5）显示部分。 显像管：把电子透镜像普通显微镜里的物镜和目镜那样组合起来，把物体放大到万、几十万倍。由于人眼看不见电子射线，必须在荧光屏上显示放大的图像，即将信号放大器获得的输出调制信号通过显像管转换成图像。 照相机：显像管显示的图像、编号、放大倍率、标尺长度和加速电压拍摄到底片上。着科学水平的不断发展，20世纪80年代开始就已研制用计算机代替照相机的功能，直接将图像及设置的参数打印出来或存储。 3.2.2 工作原理 扫描电子显微镜的工作原理如图3.2.4所示。由电子枪发射的电子束在加速电压的作用下经过磁透镜系统会聚，形成直径几个纳米的电子束，聚焦在样品表面上。在第二聚光镜和物镜之间偏转线圈的作用下，电子束在样品上做光栅状扫描，电子和样品相互作用产生信号电子。这些信号电子经探测器收集并转换为光子，再通过电信号放大器加以放大处理，最终成像在显示系统上。扫描电镜的工作原理与光学显微镜的不同在于：在光学显微镜下，全部图像一次显出，是“静态”的；而扫描电镜则是把来自二次电子的图像号作为时像信号，将一点一点的画面“动态”地形成三维的图像。 图3.2.4 扫描电镜工作原理 3.2.3 主要性能 （1）放大倍数 当入射电子束作光栅扫描时，电子束在样品表面扫描的幅度为As，荧光屏长度也就是显示器电子束同步扫描的幅度为Ac，则扫描电子显微镜的放大倍数为： mathrm{M = }frac{mathrm{A}_mathrm{c}}{mathrm{A}_mathrm{s}} 由于显示器荧光屏尺寸是固定不变的，因此，改变电子束在试样表面的扫描幅度As可以改变放大倍率。一般扫描电子显微镜的放大倍数，可以从20~20万倍区间连续调节，实现由低倍到高倍的连续观察，这对观察分析非常有利。 （2）分辨率 分辨率是扫描图像中可以分辨两点之间的最小的实际距离，是扫描电子显微镜的核心性能指标。分辨率高低主要取决于电子束直径和调制信号的类型，电子束激发出信号的区域与荧光屏上的像点逐一对应，入射电子束直径越小，分辨率越高。另外，同一电子束试样内激发信号的有效范围一般会超过入射束直径，不同信号激发范围不同，导致不同分辨率。在SEM中，二次电子因其本身能量较低致使平均自由程很短，有效激发范围与电子束直径相当，是分辨率最高的图像。背散射电子像分辨率低于二次电子像，X射线调制成像，其激发范围显著大于背散射电子，一般在微米量级。 （3）景深 景深是指透镜对试样表面高低不平的各部位能同时清晰成像的距离范围，可以理解为试样上最近清晰像点到最远清晰像点之间的距离。扫描电子显微镜末级透镜焦距较长，孔径半角很小（约10 mrad），景深是一般光学显微镜的100~500 倍，这使扫描电子显微镜图像有较强的立体感。放大5000倍时，景深可达数十微米，这是其他观察仪器无法比拟的优点。 3.2.4 主要特点 （1）成像立体感强 扫描电镜适用于粗糙表面和断口的分析观察，图像富有立体感、真实感，易于识别和解释。用扫描电镜来观察植物的叶、花、果实，动物的毛以及细菌、真菌等等的表面形貌时栩栩如生，分辨起来较容易，景深大。 （2）放大倍数变化范围大 扫描电镜放大倍数一般为15万~20万倍，最大可达10万~100万倍，它几乎包括了从扩大镜到光学显微镜到电子显微镜的一切倍率，而且同时给出一个比例尺，可方便地测量微结构的尺寸，而对于多相、多组成的非均匀材料，便于低倍下的普查和高倍下的观察分析。 （3）分辨率高 普及型的扫描电镜分辨率为10 nm，中档的为5~6 nm，高档的为1 nm，大多数的扫描电镜分辨率为 2~6 nm，最高可达0.01 nm。 （4）样品的损伤小 扫描电镜的电子束在样品上是动态扫描，其电子束流小，一般控制在100 μA以下，而且加速电压低，一般为 0.5~30 kV，这也是辐射损伤轻、污染小的原因。 （5）样品适应性高 体积小至几微米，大至150 mm，厚至20 mm的样品均可以用扫描电镜观察。其观察样的种类也较广，从土壤、金相、集成电路到生物切片，直至新鲜的含水样品都可以用扫描电镜双察（含水样品的观察要严格控制加速电压和观察的时间，否则容易损伤样品、放电和污染筒）。 （6）多功能分析 扫描电镜除了可以作形貌结构的观察外，如果配上能谱仪、光谱仪和波谱仪等附件，还可在观察形貌的同时作微区的多种成分的定性、定量、定位分析。配有光学显微镜和单色仪等附件时，可观察阴极荧光图像和进行阴极荧光光谱分析等。根据观察目的，能增加无需试样预处理工序的低真空方式功能、试样制冷、吸引、加热、描绘、分析等多方面功能。 （7）图像质量可调节 通过调制可改善图像反差的宽容度，使图像各部分亮暗适中。采用双放大倍数装置或图像选择器，可在荧光屏上同时观察不同放大倍数的图像或不同形式的图像。 （8）试样自由度大 试样可在三维空间平移、旋转、倾斜，这对观察不规则形状试样的各个区域细节极为方便。可使用加热、冷却和拉伸等样品台进行动态试验，观察在不同环境条件下的相变及形态变化等。 （9）可直接观察试样原始表面 扫描电镜制样简单，能反映样品的真实形貌，这对于许多故障进行失效分析是非常有利的。 3.2.5 样品制备 （1）对试样的要求 试样可以是块状或粉末颗粒，在真空中能保持稳定，含有水分的试样应先烘干除去水分。表面受到污染的试样，要在不破坏试样表面结构的前提下进行适当清洗，然后烘干。新断开的断口或断面，一般不需要进行处理，以免破坏断口或表面的结构状态。有些试样的表面、断口需要进行适当的侵蚀才能暴露某些结构细节，则在侵蚀后应将表面或断口清洗干净，然后烘干。对磁性试样要预先去磁，以免观察时电子束受到磁场的影响。试样大小要适合仪器专用样品座的尺寸，不能过大，样品座尺寸各仪器均不相同，一般小的样品座为3~5 mm，大的样品座为30~50 mm，以分别用来放置不同大小的试样，样品的高度也有一定的限制，一般在5~10 mm。 （2）块状试样的制备方法 对于块状导电材料，除了大小要适合仪器样品座尺寸外，基本上不需要进行什么制备，用导电胶把试样粘结在样品座上，即可放在扫描电镜中观察。对于块状的非导电或导电性较差的材料，要先进行镀膜处理，在材料表面形成一层导电膜，以避免电荷积累，影响图像质量，并可防止试样的热损伤 （3）粉末试样的制备方法 先将导电胶或双面胶纸粘结在样品座上，再均匀地把粉末样品撒在上面，用洗耳球吹去未粘住的粉末，再镀上一层导电膜，即可上电镜观察。 （4）镀膜的方法 镀膜的方法有两种，一是真空镀膜，另一种是离子溅射镀膜。离子溅射镀膜的原理是：在低气压系统中，气体分子在相隔一定距离的阳极和阴极之间的强电场作用下电离成正离子和电子，正离子飞向阴极，电子飞向阳极，二电极间形成辉光放电，在辉光放电过程中，具有一定动量的正离子撞击阴极，使阴极表面的原子被逐出，称为溅射，如果阴极表面为用来镀膜的材料（靶材），需要镀膜的样品放在作为阳极的样品台上，则被正离子轰击而溅射出来的靶材原子沉积在试样上，形成一定厚度的镀膜层。离子溅射时常用的气体为情性气体氩，要求不高时，也可以用空气，气压约为5×10-2 torr（1 torr = 133.32 Pa）。离子测射镀膜与真空镀膜相比，其主要优点是：1）装置结构简单，使用方便，溅射一次只需几分钟，而真空镀膜则要半个小时以上；2）消耗贵金属少，每次仅约几毫克；3）对同一种镀膜材料，离子溅射镀膜质量好，能形成颗粒更细、更致密、更均匀、附着力更强的膜。 3.2.6 SEM照片影响因素 影响扫描电镜照片的因素包括：电子枪、电磁透镜以及样品室的洁净度等，避免粉尘、水气、油气等污染；调节加速电压、工作电流以及仪器调整、样品处理、真空度；环境因素，如振动、磁场、噪声、接地等。加何拍出好的SEM照片，一般由样品的种类和所要的结果来决定观察条件，调整适当的加速电压、工作距离、适当的样品倾斜，选择适当的侦测器、调整合适的电子束电流。一般来说，加速电压越高，电子束波长越短，理论上，只考虑电子束直径的大小，加速电压越大，可得到越小的聚焦电子束，因而提高分辨率，然而提高加速电压却有一些不可忽视的缺点，比如：无法看到样品表面的微细结构；会出现不寻常的边缘效应；电荷累积的可能性增大；样品损伤的可能性增大。 平时操作，若要将样品室真空亦保持在10-8 Pa（10-10 torr），则抽真空的时间将变长而降低仪器的便利性，更增加仪器购置成本，因此一些仪器设计了阶段式真空，亦即使电子枪、磁透镜及样品室的真空度依序降低，并分成三个部分来读取真空计读数，如此可将样品保持在真空度10-5 Pa的环境下即可操作。平时待机或更换样品时，为防止电子枪污染，皆使用真阀将电子枪及磁透镜部分与样品室隔离，实际观察时再打开使电子束通过而打击到样品。 场发射式电子枪的电子产生率与真空度有密切的关系，其使用寿命也随真空度变差而剧缩短，因此在样品制备上必须非常注意水气，或固定用的碳胶或银胶是否烤干，以免在察的过程中，真空陡然变差而影响灯丝寿命 3.2.7 主要应用 扫描电镜是利用样品表面微区特征（如形貌、原子序数或化学成分、晶体结构或位向等）的差异，在电子束作用下通过试样不同的区域产生不同的亮度差异，从而获得具有一定村度的图像。而扫描电镜由于具有景深大、放大倍数高的优点，所以特别适用于对表面凹凸不平的断口进行形貌分析。 （1）材料断口分析 材料断口分析是扫描电镜的典型应用。如图3.2.5所示，金属呈现出明显断口，深度为几个微米；表面有片状金属剥落，片状金属尺寸为几个至十几个微米。利用SEM可以清晰地观察材料表面的断口，金属断裂有沿晶、解离、准解理、疲劳和韧窝五种类型，而实际的断口可能由这五种之中的某几种典型断口混合而成。依据断口的形状，可以对实际断口进行断裂机制分析。 图3.2.5 金属表面断口 （2）材料组织形貌观察 图3.2.6所示为碳纳米管上负载金属纳米颗粒的SEM照片，图上很好地呈现出碳纳米管的一维形貌，其直径约100 nm；大量的金属纳米颗粒均匀地负载在碳纳米管上，其尺寸约为几个纳米。在多相结构材料中，特别是在某些共晶材料复合材料的显微组织分析方面，可以借助于扫描电镜景深大的特点，较好地呈现材料的组织形貌和结构。 图3.2.6 碳纳米管负载的金属纳米颗粒 （3）断裂过程的动态研究 有的型号的扫描电镜带有拉伸台装置，可进行断裂的动态过程研究。在试群拉作的同时，既可以直接观察裂纹的萌生及扩展与材料显徽组织之间的关系，又可以逢续记录下来，为科学研究提供最直接的证据。 3.3 透射电子显微镜 3.3.1 主要结构 透射电子显微镜的结构主要包括电子光学系统、电源与控制系统、循环冷却系统及真空系统，其中电子光学系统是透射电子显微镜的核心部分。图3.3.1所示为透射电子显微镜的电子光学组成示意图。从光学成像的角度来看，透射电子显微镜由三部分组成：照明系统、成像与放大系统及观察与记录系统。 图3.3.1 透射电镜的结构示意图","completion":"这段中文段落中的语法错误或者错字漏字如下： 1.

照明系统包括电子枪、聚光镜平移对中、倾斜调节装置，其主要作用为：提供一束亮度高、照明孔径半角小、平行度好、束流稳定的照明源；保证电子束可在2~3°倾斜，以满足明暗场成像转换的需要。 （1）电子枪 电子枪是发射电子的照明光源，主要作用是产生并发射和加速电子。目前电子枪的种类分为热电子发射型和场电子发射型。热电子发射型照明光源又可细分为钨灯丝、六硼化镧（LaB6）和六硼化铈（CeB6）三种。场发射电子源型照明光源可分为冷场型和热场型。使用场发射电子源的透射电镜又称为场发射电镜。 早期的透射电子显微镜使用的主要为钨灯丝电子源，但是由于其亮度低、光源尺寸大及能量发散度较大，所以人们很早就开始寻找更亮的光源。1969年Broers提出由单晶六硼化镧加工成锥状的顶端型而制造出六硼化镧型灯丝。1968年，Crewel提出了冷场型发射枪，并于1980年后开始应用。然而，冷场型发射枪在室温使用时，灯丝会产生残留气体分子的离子吸附，使得发射电流降低并产生噪声，这样必须定期进行闪光处理以消除吸附分子层。因此，Swanson等人于20世纪70年代开发出钨针尖包覆有ZrO的热场型电子枪。表3.3.1给出了几种不同电子枪的特性。从表3.3.1可看出，热场发射型电子枪的亮度高、束斑尺寸小且能量发散度小，是目前综合性能最好的电子枪，因此也成了高分辨电子显微镜的首选。

钨灯丝和六硼化镧/铈灯丝属于热阴极电子枪，它是利用高温使电子具有足够的能量夫克服电子枪材料的功函数而逃离。常用的热电子发射型电子枪属于热阴极三极电子枪，它由发夹形钨丝阴极、栅极和阳极组成，其结构如图3.3.2所示。图3.3.2（a）中反映了阴极栅极和阳极之间的等位面分布情况。负的高压直接加在栅极上，同时在阴极和负高压之间有一个偏压电阻，这样使得栅极和阴极之间就会产生数百伏的电位差，如图3.3.2（b）。这样栅极比阴极电位值更负，因此可以用栅极来控制阴极发射电子的有效区域。 图3.3.2 热电子发射型电子枪工作原理示意图 当阴极流向阳极的电子数量加大时，在偏压电阻两端的电位值增加，使栅极电位比阴极进一步变负，由此可以减小灯丝有效发射区域的面积，束流随之减小。若束流因某种原因而减小时，偏压电阻两端的电压随之下降，致使栅极和阴极之间的电位接近。此时，栅极排斥阴极发射电子的能力减小，束流又可望上升。因此，自偏压回路可以起到限制和稳定束流的作用。由于栅极的电位比阴极负，所以自阴极端点引出的等位面在空间呈弯曲状。在阴极和阳报之间的某一地点，电子束会汇集成一个交叉点，这就是通常所说的电子题。交叉点处电子束直径约几十个微米。 图3.3.3所示为场发射电子枪工作原理示意图。场发射电子枪的原理是高电场下产生肖特基（Schottky）效应。它是利用靠近曲率半径很小的阴极尖端发尖发射电子的，当在真空中的金属表面受到108 V/cm大小的电子加速电场时，将会有数量可观的电子发射出来，所以叫作场致发射，简称场发射。如果阴极尖端半径为0.1~0.5 m，若在尖端与第一阳极之间加U1 = 3 kV的电位差，与第二阳极间加U2 = 5 kV的电位差，那么在阴极尖端附近建立的强电场就足以使它发射电子。在第二阳极几十千伏甚至几百千伏正电位作用下，阴极尖端发射的电子会聚在第二阳极孔的下方，电子束直径小至20 nm（甚至10 nm）。场发射电子是从很尖锐的阴极尖端所发射出来，因此可得极细而又具高电流密度的电子束，其亮度可达热阴极电子枪的数百倍甚至数千倍。由此可见，场发射电子枪是透射电子显微镜获得高分辨率、高质量图像较为理想的电子源。不同的灯丝电子源大小、电流量、电流稳定度以及灯丝寿命等有差异，如表3.3.1所示。 图3.3.3 场发射电子枪工作原理示意图 （2）聚光镜 聚光镜的主要作用是把电子枪发射出来的电子会聚而成交叉点，以便得到一束强度高、直径小、相干性强、近似平行的电子束，并照射到样品上。一般都采用双聚光镜系统，如图3.3.4所示。第一聚光镜是强激磁透镜，焦距很短，通过改变焦距可以控制光斑大小；经过第一聚光镜后束斑缩小到1/50~1/10，将电子枪第一交叉点束斑缩小为1~5 μm。第二聚光镜是弱激磁透镜，焦距很长；同时在第二聚光镜下方安装有一个聚光镜光阑，用以调整束斑大小；通过控制光阑照明孔径半角可得到一束近乎平行的电子束，以利于进行衍射操作；和未经过第一聚光镜的束斑相比，经过第二聚光镜后的束斑，适焦时放大了约2倍。结果在样品平面上可获得2~10 μm的照明电子束班。同时，为了减小像散，在第二聚光镜下还安装有一个消像散器。另外，由于第二聚光镜是长焦电磁透镜，这样在第二聚光镜和下方的物镜之间就会有较大的间隙，这样有利于装人样品台及相关附件。 图3.3.4 聚光镜照明光路图 为了满足各种分析功能的需要（如纳米束电子衍射模式和会聚束电子衍射模式等），照明系统也变得越来越复杂，在新型多功能的透射电子显微镜中越来越多地采用多级聚光镜。 3.3.1.2 成像系统 主要是由样品室、物镜、中间镜和投影镜组成。在物镜的上面是样品室，在物镜的下面还有物镜光阑和选区光阑。 （1）样品室与样品台 样品室有一套机构，保证样品经常更换时不破坏镜筒主体的真空度。透射电子显微镜的样品既小又薄，通常需用外径为3 mm的样品载网（一般为铜网、网和镍网等）来支持。将装载样品的台子称为样品台。样品台的作用是承载样品，并使样品能在物镜极靴孔内平移、倾斜、旋转，以选择感兴趣的样品区域或位向进行观察分析。新式的电子显微镜常最普遍配备的是侧插式倾斜装置。“侧插”就是样品杆从侧面进入物镜极靴中去。有的样品杆本身还带有使样品倾斜或原位旋转的装置。这些样品杆和倾斜样品台组合在一起就是侧插式双倾样品台和单倾旋转样品台。目前双倾样品台是最常用的，它可以便样品沿x轴和y轴倾转±60°。在晶体结构分析中，利用样品倾斜和旋转装置可以测定晶体的位向、相变时的惯习面及析出相的方位等。部分样品台还可以实现对样品的加热、冷却及测试应变等处理。 在照相曝光期间必须牢固地将样品载网夹持在样品座中并保持良好的热、电接触，减小因电子照射引起的热或电荷堆积而产生样品的损伤或图像漂移。平移是任何样品台最基本的动作，通常在两个相互垂直方向上样品平移最大值为±1 mm，以确保样品载网上大部分区域都能观察到。样品图像的漂移量应小于相应情况下显微镜像的分辨率。 （2）物镜 物镜在镜筒中的位置如图3.3.5所示，其作用是形成第一幅高分辨率电子放大像。在镜下面的电磁透镜仅起到进一步放大的作用，这样物镜能够分辨出来的结构细节（包括任何缺陷）都被成像系统中的其他电磁透镜进一步放大。因此，透射电子显微镜分辨本领的高低主要取决于物镜。欲获得物镜的高分辨率本领，必须尽可能降低像差。通常采用强激磁、短焦距的物镜，像差小。 图3.3.5 成像系统光路示意图 物镜是一个强激磁、短焦距的透镜（f = 1~3 mm），它的放大倍数较高，一般为100~300倍。目前，高质量的物镜其分辨率可达1 Å左右。物镜的分辨率主要取决于极靴的形状和加工精度。一般来说，极靴的内孔和上下极靴之间的距离越小，物镜的分辨率就越高。为了减少物镜的球差，往往在物镜的后焦面上安放一个物镜光阑。物镜光阑不仅具有减少球差、像散和色差的作用，而且可以提高图像的衬度。此外，物镜光阑位于后焦面的位置上时，可以方便地进行暗场及衬度成像的操作。 在用电子显微镜进行图像分析时，物镜和样品之间和距离总是固定不变的 （即物距L1不变）。因此改变放大倍数进行成像时，主要是改变物镜的焦距和像距（即f和L2）来满足成像条件。 （3）中间镜 中间镜是一个弱激磁的长焦距变倍透镜，一般情况下，可在0~20倍范围调节。实际上，中间镜是以物镜的像为试样进一步成像的。当放大倍数大于1时，用来进一步放大物镜像；当放大倍数小于1时，用来缩小物镜像。 在电镜操作过程中，主要是利用中间镜的可变倍率来控制电镜的放大倍数。如果物镜、中间镜和投影镜的放大倍数分别用M0、Mi和Mp表示，则获得的电子显微图像总放大倍数M = M0MiMp倍。通过调节线圈电流可以很方便地增大或减小放大倍数。 如果把中间镜的物平面和物镜的像平面重合，则在荧光屏上得到一幅放大像，这就是电子显微镜中的成像操作（也称为显微成像模式），如图3.3.5（a）所示。如果把中间镜的物平面与物镜的背（后）焦面重合，则在荧光屏上得到一幅电子衍射花样，这就是透射电子显微镜的电子衍射操作（也称为衍射成像模式），如图3.3.5（b）所示。 （4）光阑 透射电子显微镜的光阑包括三种：聚光镜光阑、物镜光阑和选区光阑。这三种光阑片都是用无磁性的金属（铂、钼等）制造的，其结构上则有四个不同直径的光阑孔，每个光阑孔的周围开有缝隙以使光阑孔受电子束照射后热量的散出，但不同的光阑尺寸范围不同。光阑被安装在光阑杆机构上，使用时，通过光阑杆机构调节光阑孔的位置，使光阑孔中心位于电子束的轴线上（光阑中心和主焦点重合）。由于小光阑孔很容易受到污染，因此高性能的电子显微镜中常用抗污染光阑（或称自洁光阑）。 聚光镜光阑的作用是限制照明孔径半角。在双聚光镜系统中，聚光镜光阑常装在第二聚光镜的下方。光阑孔的直径为20~400 μm。做一般分析观察时，聚光镜的光阑孔直径可用200~300 μm；若做微束分析时，则应采用小孔径光阑。 物镜光阑（又称衬度光阑）通常被安装在物镜的后焦面上。常用的物镜光阑孔直径在20~120 μm范围内。当电子束通过薄膜样品后会产生散射和衍射，散射角（或衍射角）较大的电子被光阑挡住，不能继续进入镜筒成像，从而会在像平面上形成具有一定衬度的图像光阑孔越小，被挡去的电子越多，图像的衬度就越大，因此，物镜光阑又被称为衬度光阑。物镜光阑的另一个主要作用是在后焦面上套取衍射束的斑点（即副焦点）成像，这就是暗场成像。利用明、暗场显微照片对照分析，可以方便地进行物相鉴定和缺陷分析。 选区光阑又称场限光阑或视场光阑，一般都放在物镜的像平面位置。选区光阑孔的直径通常在20~400 μm范围内，有的高达800 μm。当对样品进行微区的衍射分析时，需要在样品上放置光阑来限定微区。但是，由于待分析的微区仅有微米量级，要制造出如此小尺寸的光阑在技术上是很困难的，因此将选区光阑放在物镜的像平面上。这样放置和在样品上直接放置光阑是等效的，而光阑可以做得大一些，因此对这个微区进行衍射，叫作选区衍射。比如，当物镜放大倍数是50倍，则一个直径等于50 μm的光阑孔就可以选择样品上直径为1 m的区域。 （5）投影镜 投影镜的作用是把中间镜的像（显微图像或电子衍射花样）作为物进一步放大，并投景到荧光屏上。和物镜一样，也是一个短焦距的强磁透镜。投影镜的激磁电流是固定的，因为成像电子束进人投影镜时孔径半角很小，因此其景深和焦距都非常大。即使改变中间镜的大倍数，使显微镜的总放大倍数有很大的变化，也不会影响图像的清晰度。有时，中间镜像平面还会出现一定的位移，由于这个位移距离仍处于投影镜的景深范围之内，因此，在光屏上的图像仍旧是清晰的。 目前，高性能的透射电子显微镜大都采用5级以上透镜放大，即有两级甚至三级中间和两级投影镜。对于极低倍数的成像，则不用物镜，直接用中间镜和投影镜成像。 3.3.1.3 观察记录系统 目前，比较常用的观察和记录装置包括荧光屏、照相底片和CCD照相机。在荧光屏面放置可以自动换片的照相暗盒。照相时只要把荧光屏掀往一侧并竖起，电子束即可使照底片曝光。由于透射电子显微镜的焦长很大，显然荧光屏和底片之间有数厘米的间距，但仍能得到清晰的图像。 通常采用在暗室操作情况下人眼较敏感的、发绿光的荧光物质来涂制荧光屏。这样利于高放大倍数、低亮度图像的聚焦和观察。电子感光片是一种以对电子束曝光敏感、颗粒度很小的溴化物乳胶底片，它对红光不敏感。由于电子和乳胶相互作用比光子强得多，照相曝光时间很短，只需几秒钟。早期的电子显微镜用手动快门，构造简单，但曝光不均匀。新型电子显微镜采用电磁快门，与荧光屏动作密切配合，动作迅速，曝光色彩夺目、均匀；有的还有自动曝光装置，根据荧光屏上图像的亮度，自动确定曝光所需的时间。 如果配上适当的电子电路，还可以实现拍片自动记数。近年来新式的透射电镜一般都配有CCD相机，可以直接把电镜中看到的图像采集，在计算机中实现图像处理分析、数据管理和报告打印等多种功能。如图像的亮度或衬度调节、图像的非均匀亮度调节、图像粘贴和测量等。 电子显微镜工作时，整个电子通道必须置于真空系统中。新式的电子显微镜中电子枪镜筒和照相机之间都装有气阀，各部分都可以单独地抽真空和单独放气，因此，在更换灯丝、清洗镜筒和更换底片时，可不破坏其他部分的真空状态。 3.3.2 工作原理 TEM是利用透过样品的透射电子成像的，电子枪发射出电子射线经透射系统照射在样品上，电子束与样品相互作用后，当电子射线在样品另一方重新出现时，已带有样品内的信息，然后进行放大处理而成像，最终在荧光屏上形成带有样品信息的图像，使人眼能够识别。 透射电镜的成像原理可分为三种情况： （1）吸收像。射到质量、密度大的样品时，主要的成像作用是散射作用。样品上质量厚度大的地方对电子的散射角大，通过的电子较少，像的亮度较暗。旱期的透射电子显微镜都是基于这利原理。 （2）衍射像。电子束被样品衍射后，样品不同位置的衍射波振幅分布对应于样品中晶体各部分不同的衍射能力，当出现晶体缺陷时，缺陷部分的衍射能力与完整区域不同，从而使行射的振幅分布不均匀，反映出晶体缺陷的分布。 （3）相位像。当样品薄至100 nm以下时，电子可以透过样品，波的振幅变化可以忽略，成像来自于相位的变化。 当电子经样品散射后，相对光轴以同一角度进入物镜的电子，在物镜后焦面上聚焦在一个点上。散射角越大，聚焦点离轴越远，如果样品是一个晶体，在后焦面上出现的是一幅衍射图样。与短晶面间距（或者说“高空间频率”）对应的衍射束被聚焦在离轴较远处。在后焦面上设有一个光阑，它截取那一部分电子对反差和分辨本领有直接的影响。如果光阑太小，把需要的高空间频率部分截去，那么和细微结构对应的高分辨信息就丢失了。 样品上厚的部分或重元素多的部分对电子散射的几率大。透过这些部分的电子在后焦面上分布在轴外的多。用光阑截去部分散射电子会使“质量厚度”大的部位在像中显得暗。这种反差可以人为地造成，如生物样品中用重元素染色，在材料表面的复型膜上从一个方向喷镀一层金属，造成阴阳面等。TEM反差的形成有以下3种方式 （1）振幅反差 当一定能量入射到样品，由于受到样品中原子的核和核外电子的静电场的作用，使电子动方向和速度发生变化称为电子散射。电子散射产生的振幅反差，是TEM最重要的成像制。 透镜图像的振幅反差是通过光阑吸收散射电子而形成的。振幅反差的大小取决于直接透射电子数量与弹性散射电子数量的比例。当入射电子照射样品，透过样品散射电子数总量，样品的厚度成正比。此外，样品密度越大电子散射的几率也越大。质量密度与厚度的乘积种为质量厚度，因此，振幅反差主要决定于样品各部分质量厚度的差异。当电子束投射到样品时，可随组织构成成分的密度不同而发生相应的电子发射量，如电子束投射到质量大的结构时，电子散射量大，其中大多数为大角度散射弹性电子，其角度为0.01~0.1 rad，但被物镜面的光阑挡掉散射电子，使该处的电流密度减少，形成图像的暗区，投射到荧光上的电子少而呈暗像，电子照片上则呈黑色，此现象称为电子密度高（electron dense）。反之当人射电子穿透样品质量厚度小的部位，直接透射以及小角度散射电子构成图像的亮区，则为电子密度低（electron lucent）。显然，样品各部分质量厚度差异越大，图像的振幅反差越强。此外，由于物镜存在球差，使散射电子轨迹受到很大影响，它们不会会聚到与物点相对应的同一高斯像点处，只能作为图像背景，弥散在各处。因此，在观察厚切片时，既使不加物镜光阑，图像也有一定的反差，但对于非常薄的切片来讲，几平没有反差。一般来说，对于样品的结构细节大小超过0.1~0.15 μm，厚度大于10 μm的样品，其反差主要是由振幅反差提供。 （2）相位反差 相位反差是在接近于正焦点附近很小的范围内产生的，它与物镜光阑是否存在无关，与加速电压以及样品的原子序数关系也不大。相位反差只能在最大的放大倍数和最高分辨率的条件下才能像平面观察到，对于低原子序数样品的细微结构，相位反差几乎是反差的唯一来源。对于微细结构小于0.15 μm、厚度小于10 μm的成像，特别是由轻元素构成的细微结构的图像，由于透射电子中弹性散射电子比例很少，而且散射角度也较小，都能通过光阑，因此不能获得振幅反差，图像的反差主要是由相位反差提供。从电子波的波动性分析，电子波穿透样品后成为透射波和散射波，其透射波的波长与人射电子波的波长相等，散射波由于人射电子通过样品时损失部分能量，使散射波波长发生变化。如图3.3.6所示，透射波（AB）与散射波（BC）之间存在一定的相位差。在理想透镜正聚焦时，二波（AB、BC）之间的相位差为90°，其合成波AC的振幅与透射波AB的差别很小（AC ≈ AB），几乎没有反差（图3.3.6a）。如果适当离焦，二波（AB、BC）之间的相位变化造成合成波（AC）的振幅与透射波（AB）的振幅的差异明显加大，合成波大于或小于透射波，形成一定的振幅差（图3.3.6b）。根据样品各部分透射波的强弱不同，使图像出现亮暗不同的区域，这种反差称为相位反差。 图3.3.6

照明系统包括电子枪、聚光镜平移对中、倾斜调节装置，其主要作用为：提供一束亮度高、照明孔径半角小、平行度好、束流稳定的照明源；保证电子束可在2~3°倾斜，以满足明暗场成像转换的需要。 （1）电子枪 电子枪是发射电子的照明光源，主要作用是产生并发射和加速电子。目前电子枪的种类分为热电子发射型和场电子发射型。热电子发射型照明光源又可细分为钨灯丝、六硼化镧（LaB6）和六硼化铈（CeB6）三种。场发射电子源型照明光源可分为冷场型和热场型。使用场发射电子源的透射电镜又称为场发射电镜。 早期的透射电子显微镜使用的主要为钨灯丝电子源，但是由于其亮度低、光源尺寸大及能量发散度较大，所以人们很早就开始寻找更亮的光源。1969年Broers提出由单晶六硼化镧加工成锥状的顶端型而制造出六硼化镧型灯丝。1968年，Crewel提出了冷场型发射枪，并于1980年后开始应用。然而，冷场型发射枪在室温使用时，灯丝会产生残留气体分子的离子吸附，使得发射电流降低并产生噪声，这样必须定期进行闪光处理以消除吸附分子层。因此，Swanson等人于20世纪70年代开发出钨针尖包覆有ZrO的热场型电子枪。表3.3.1给出了几种不同电子枪的特性。从表3.3.1可看出，热场发射型电子枪的亮度高、束斑尺寸小且能量发散度小，是目前综合性能最好的电子枪，因此也成了高分辨电子显微镜的首选。

钨灯丝和六硼化镧/铈灯丝属于热阴极电子枪，它是利用高温使电子具有足够的能量夫克服电子枪材料的功函数而逃离。常用的热电子发射型电子枪属于热阴极三极电子枪，它由发夹形钨丝阴极、栅极和阳极组成，其结构如图3.3.2所示。图3.3.2（a）中反映了阴极栅极和阳极之间的等位面分布情况。负的高压直接加在栅极上，同时在阴极和负高压之间有一个偏压电阻，这样使得栅极和阴极之间就会产生数百伏的电位差，如图3.3.2（b）。这样栅极比阴极电位值更负，因此可以用栅极来控制阴极发射电子的有效区域。 图3.3.2 热电子发射型电子枪工作原理示意图 当阴极流向阳极的电子数量加大时，在偏压电阻两端的电位值增加，使栅极电位比阴极进一步变负，由此可以减小灯丝有效发射区域的面积，束流随之减小。若束流因某种原因而减小时，偏压电阻两端的电压随之下降，致使栅极和阴极之间的电位接近。此时，栅极排斥阴极发射电子的能力减小，束流又可望上升。因此，自偏压回路可以起到限制和稳定束流的作用。由于栅极的电位比阴极负，所以自阴极端点引出的等位面在空间呈弯曲状。在阴极和阳报之间的某一地点，电子束会汇集成一个交叉点，这就是通常所说的电子题。交叉点处电子束直径约几十个微米。 图3.3.3所示为场发射电子枪工作原理示意图。场发射电子枪的原理是高电场下产生肖特基（Schottky）效应。它是利用靠近曲率半径很小的阴极尖端发尖发射电子的，当在真空中的金属表面受到108 V/cm大小的电子加速电场时，将会有数量可观的电子发射出来，所以叫作场致发射，简称场发射。如果阴极尖端半径为0.1~0.5 m，若在尖端与第一阳极之间加U1 = 3 kV的电位差，与第二阳极间加U2 = 5 kV的电位差，那么在阴极尖端附近建立的强电场就足以使它发射电子。在第二阳极几十千伏甚至几百千伏正电位作用下，阴极尖端发射的电子会聚在第二阳极孔的下方，电子束直径小至20 nm（甚至10 nm）。场发射电子是从很尖锐的阴极尖端所发射出来，因此可得极细而又具高电流密度的电子束，其亮度可达热阴极电子枪的数百倍甚至数千倍。由此可见，场发射电子枪是透射电子显微镜获得高分辨率、高质量图像较为理想的电子源。不同的灯丝电子源大小、电流量、电流稳定度以及灯丝寿命等有差异，如表3.3.1所示。 图3.3.3 场发射电子枪工作原理示意图 （2）聚光镜 聚光镜的主要作用是把电子枪发射出来的电子会聚而成交叉点，以便得到一束强度高、直径小、相干性强、近似平行的电子束，并照射到样品上。一般都采用双聚光镜系统，如图3.3.4所示。第一聚光镜是强激磁透镜，焦距很短，通过改变焦距可以控制光斑大小；经过第一聚光镜后束斑缩小到1/50~1/10，将电子枪第一交叉点束斑缩小为1~5 μm。第二聚光镜是弱激磁透镜，焦距很长；同时在第二聚光镜下方安装有一个聚光镜光阑，用以调整束斑大小；通过控制光阑照明孔径半角可得到一束近乎平行的电子束，以利于进行衍射操作；和未经过第一聚光镜的束斑相比，经过第二聚光镜后的束斑，适焦时放大了约2倍。结果在样品平面上可获得2~10 μm的照明电子束班。同时，为了减小像散，在第二聚光镜下还安装有一个消像散器。另外，由于第二聚光镜是长焦电磁透镜，这样在第二聚光镜和下方的物镜之间就会有较大的间隙，这样有利于装人样品台及相关附件。 图3.3.4 聚光镜照明光路图 为了满足各种分析功能的需要（如纳米束电子衍射模式和会聚束电子衍射模式等），照明系统也变得越来越复杂，在新型多功能的透射电子显微镜中越来越多地采用多级聚光镜。 3.3.1.2 成像系统 主要是由样品室、物镜、中间镜和投影镜组成。在物镜的上面是样品室，在物镜的下面还有物镜光阑和选区光阑。 （1）样品室与样品台 样品室有一套机构，保证样品经常更换时不破坏镜筒主体的真空度。透射电子显微镜的样品既小又薄，通常需用外径为3 mm的样品载网（一般为铜网、网和镍网等）来支持。将装载样品的台子称为样品台。样品台的作用是承载样品，并使样品能在物镜极靴孔内平移、倾斜、旋转，以选择感兴趣的样品区域或位向进行观察分析。新式的电子显微镜常最普遍配备的是侧插式倾斜装置。“侧插”就是样品杆从侧面进入物镜极靴中去。有的样品杆本身还带有使样品倾斜或原位旋转的装置。这些样品杆和倾斜样品台组合在一起就是侧插式双倾样品台和单倾旋转样品台。目前双倾样品台是最常用的，它可以便样品沿x轴和y轴倾转±60°。在晶体结构分析中，利用样品倾斜和旋转装置可以测定晶体的位向、相变时的惯习面及析出相的方位等。部分样品台还可以实现对样品的加热、冷却及测试应变等处理。 在照相曝光期间必须牢固地将样品载网夹持在样品座中并保持良好的热、电接触，减小因电子照射引起的热或电荷堆积而产生样品的损伤或图像漂移。平移是任何样品台最基本的动作，通常在两个相互垂直方向上样品平移最大值为±1 mm，以确保样品载网上大部分区域都能观察到。样品图像的漂移量应小于相应情况下显微镜像的分辨率。 （2）物镜 物镜在镜筒中的位置如图3.3.5所示，其作用是形成第一幅高分辨率电子放大像。在镜下面的电磁透镜仅起到进一步放大的作用，这样物镜能够分辨出来的结构细节（包括任何缺陷）都被成像系统中的其他电磁透镜进一步放大。因此，透射电子显微镜分辨本领的高低主要取决于物镜。欲获得物镜的高分辨率本领，必须尽可能降低像差。通常采用强激磁、短焦距的物镜，像差小。 图3.3.5 成像系统光路示意图 物镜是一个强激磁、短焦距的透镜（f = 1~3 mm），它的放大倍数较高，一般为100~300倍。目前，高质量的物镜其分辨率可达1 Å左右。物镜的分辨率主要取决于极靴的形状和加工精度。一般来说，极靴的内孔和上下极靴之间的距离越小，物镜的分辨率就越高。为了减少物镜的球差，往往在物镜的后焦面上安放一个物镜光阑。物镜光阑不仅具有减少球差、像散和色差的作用，而且可以提高图像的衬度。此外，物镜光阑位于后焦面的位置上时，可以方便地进行暗场及衬度成像的操作。 在用电子显微镜进行图像分析时，物镜和样品之间和距离总是固定不变的 （即物距L1不变）。因此改变放大倍数进行成像时，主要是改变物镜的焦距和像距（即f和L2）来满足成像条件。 （3）中间镜 中间镜是一个弱激磁的长焦距变倍透镜，一般情况下，可在0~20倍范围调节。实际上，中间镜是以物镜的像为试样进一步成像的。当放大倍数大于1时，用来进一步放大物镜像；当放大倍数小于1时，用来缩小物镜像。 在电镜操作过程中，主要是利用中间镜的可变倍率来控制电镜的放大倍数。如果物镜、中间镜和投影镜的放大倍数分别用M0、Mi和Mp表示，则获得的电子显微图像总放大倍数M = M0MiMp倍。通过调节线圈电流可以很方便地增大或减小放大倍数。 如果把中间镜的物平面和物镜的像平面重合，则在荧光屏上得到一幅放大像，这就是电子显微镜中的成像操作（也称为显微成像模式），如图3.3.5（a）所示。如果把中间镜的物平面与物镜的背（后）焦面重合，则在荧光屏上得到一幅电子衍射花样，这就是透射电子显微镜的电子衍射操作（也称为衍射成像模式），如图3.3.5（b）所示。 （4）光阑 透射电子显微镜的光阑包括三种：聚光镜光阑、物镜光阑和选区光阑。这三种光阑片都是用无磁性的金属（铂、钼等）制造的，其结构上则有四个不同直径的光阑孔，每个光阑孔的周围开有缝隙以使光阑孔受电子束照射后热量的散出，但不同的光阑尺寸范围不同。光阑被安装在光阑杆机构上，使用时，通过光阑杆机构调节光阑孔的位置，使光阑孔中心位于电子束的轴线上（光阑中心和主焦点重合）。由于小光阑孔很容易受到污染，因此高性能的电子显微镜中常用抗污染光阑（或称自洁光阑）。 聚光镜光阑的作用是限制照明孔径半角。在双聚光镜系统中，聚光镜光阑常装在第二聚光镜的下方。光阑孔的直径为20~400 μm。做一般分析观察时，聚光镜的光阑孔直径可用200~300 μm；若做微束分析时，则应采用小孔径光阑。 物镜光阑（又称衬度光阑）通常被安装在物镜的后焦面上。常用的物镜光阑孔直径在20~120 μm范围内。当电子束通过薄膜样品后会产生散射和衍射，散射角（或衍射角）较大的电子被光阑挡住，不能继续进入镜筒成像，从而会在像平面上形成具有一定衬度的图像光阑孔越小，被挡去的电子越多，图像的衬度就越大，因此，物镜光阑又被称为衬度光阑。物镜光阑的另一个主要作用是在后焦面上套取衍射束的斑点（即副焦点）成像，这就是暗场成像。利用明、暗场显微照片对照分析，可以方便地进行物相鉴定和缺陷分析。 选区光阑又称场限光阑或视场光阑，一般都放在物镜的像平面位置。选区光阑孔的直径通常在20~400 μm范围内，有的高达800 μm。当对样品进行微区的衍射分析时，需要在样品上放置光阑来限定微区。但是，由于待分析的微区仅有微米量级，要制造出如此小尺寸的光阑在技术上是很困难的，因此将选区光阑放在物镜的像平面上。这样放置和在样品上直接放置光阑是等效的，而光阑可以做得大一些，因此对这个微区进行衍射，叫作选区衍射。比如，当物镜放大倍数是50倍，则一个直径等于50 μm的光阑孔就可以选择样品上直径为1 m的区域。 （5）投影镜 投影镜的作用是把中间镜的像（显微图像或电子衍射花样）作为物进一步放大，并投景到荧光屏上。和物镜一样，也是一个短焦距的强磁透镜。投影镜的激磁电流是固定的，因为成像电子束进人投影镜时孔径半角很小，因此其景深和焦距都非常大。即使改变中间镜的大倍数，使显微镜的总放大倍数有很大的变化，也不会影响图像的清晰度。有时，中间镜像平面还会出现一定的位移，由于这个位移距离仍处于投影镜的景深范围之内，因此，在光屏上的图像仍旧是清晰的。 目前，高性能的透射电子显微镜大都采用5级以上透镜放大，即有两级甚至三级中间和两级投影镜。对于极低倍数的成像，则不用物镜，直接用中间镜和投影镜成像。 3.3.1.3 观察记录系统 目前，比较常用的观察和记录装置包括荧光屏、照相底片和CCD照相机。在荧光屏面放置可以自动换片的照相暗盒。照相时只要把荧光屏掀往一侧并竖起，电子束即可使照底片曝光。由于透射电子显微镜的焦长很大，显然荧光屏和底片之间有数厘米的间距，但仍能得到清晰的图像。 通常采用在暗室操作情况下人眼较敏感的、发绿光的荧光物质来涂制荧光屏。这样利于高放大倍数、低亮度图像的聚焦和观察。电子感光片是一种以对电子束曝光敏感、颗粒度很小的溴化物乳胶底片，它对红光不敏感。由于电子和乳胶相互作用比光子强得多，照相曝光时间很短，只需几秒钟。早期的电子显微镜用手动快门，构造简单，但曝光不均匀。新型电子显微镜采用电磁快门，与荧光屏动作密切配合，动作迅速，曝光色彩夺目、均匀；有的还有自动曝光装置，根据荧光屏上图像的亮度，自动确定曝光所需的时间。 如果配上适当的电子电路，还可以实现拍片自动记数。近年来新式的透射电镜一般都配有CCD相机，可以直接把电镜中看到的图像采集，在计算机中实现图像处理分析、数据管理和报告打印等多种功能。如图像的亮度或衬度调节、图像的非均匀亮度调节、图像粘贴和测量等。 电子显微镜工作时，整个电子通道必须置于真空系统中。新式的电子显微镜中电子枪镜筒和照相机之间都装有气阀，各部分都可以单独地抽真空和单独放气，因此，在更换灯丝、清洗镜筒和更换底片时，可不破坏其他部分的真空状态。 3.3.2 工作原理 TEM是利用透过样品的透射电子成像的，电子枪发射出电子射线经透射系统照射在样品上，电子束与样品相互作用后，当电子射线在样品另一方重新出现时，已带有样品内的信息，然后进行放大处理而成像，最终在荧光屏上形成带有样品信息的图像，使人眼能够识别。 透射电镜的成像原理可分为三种情况： （1）吸收像。射到质量、密度大的样品时，主要的成像作用是散射作用。样品上质量厚度大的地方对电子的散射角大，通过的电子较少，像的亮度较暗。旱期的透射电子显微镜都是基于这利原理。 （2）衍射像。电子束被样品衍射后，样品不同位置的衍射波振幅分布对应于样品中晶体各部分不同的衍射能力，当出现晶体缺陷时，缺陷部分的衍射能力与完整区域不同，从而使行射的振幅分布不均匀，反映出晶体缺陷的分布。 （3）相位像。当样品薄至100 nm以下时，电子可以透过样品，波的振幅变化可以忽略，成像来自于相位的变化。 当电子经样品散射后，相对光轴以同一角度进入物镜的电子，在物镜后焦面上聚焦在一个点上。散射角越大，聚焦点离轴越远，如果样品是一个晶体，在后焦面上出现的是一幅衍射图样。与短晶面间距（或者说“高空间频率”）对应的衍射束被聚焦在离轴较远处。在后焦面上设有一个光阑，它截取那一部分电子对反差和分辨本领有直接的影响。如果光阑太小，把需要的高空间频率部分截去，那么和细微结构对应的高分辨信息就丢失了。 样品上厚的部分或重元素多的部分对电子散射的几率大。透过这些部分的电子在后焦面上分布在轴外的多。用光阑截去部分散射电子会使“质量厚度”大的部位在像中显得暗。这种反差可以人为地造成，如生物样品中用重元素染色，在材料表面的复型膜上从一个方向喷镀一层金属，造成阴阳面等。TEM反差的形成有以下3种方式 （1）振幅反差 当一定能量入射到样品，由于受到样品中原子的核和核外电子的静电场的作用，使电子动方向和速度发生变化称为电子散射。电子散射产生的振幅反差，是TEM最重要的成像制。 透镜图像的振幅反差是通过光阑吸收散射电子而形成的。振幅反差的大小取决于直接透射电子数量与弹性散射电子数量的比例。当入射电子照射样品，透过样品散射电子数总量，样品的厚度成正比。此外，样品密度越大电子散射的几率也越大。质量密度与厚度的乘积种为质量厚度，因此，振幅反差主要决定于样品各部分质量厚度的差异。当电子束投射到样品时，可随组织构成成分的密度不同而发生相应的电子发射量，如电子束投射到质量大的结构时，电子散射量大，其中大多数为大角度散射弹性电子，其角度为0.01~0.1 rad，但被物镜面的光阑挡掉散射电子，使该处的电流密度减少，形成图像的暗区，投射到荧光上的电子少而呈暗像，电子照片上则呈黑色，此现象称为电子密度高（electron dense）。反之当人射电子穿透样品质量厚度小的部位，直接透射以及小角度散射电子构成图像的亮区，则为电子密度低（electron lucent）。显然，样品各部分质量厚度差异越大，图像的振幅反差越强。此外，由于物镜存在球差，使散射电子轨迹受到很大影响，它们不会会聚到与物点相对应的同一高斯像点处，只能作为图像背景，弥散在各处。因此，在观察厚切片时，既使不加物镜光阑，图像也有一定的反差，但对于非常薄的切片来讲，几平没有反差。一般来说，对于样品的结构细节大小超过0.1~0.15 μm，厚度大于10 μm的样品，其反差主要是由振幅反差提供。 （2）相位反差 相位反差是在接近于正焦点附近很小的范围内产生的，它与物镜光阑是否存在无关，与加速电压以及样品的原子序数关系也不大。相位反差只能在最大的放大倍数和最高分辨率的条件下才能像平面观察到，对于低原子序数样品的细微结构，相位反差几乎是反差的唯一来源。对于微细结构小于0.15 μm、厚度小于10 μm的成像，特别是由轻元素构成的细微结构的图像，由于透射电子中弹性散射电子比例很少，而且散射角度也较小，都能通过光阑，因此不能获得振幅反差，图像的反差主要是由相位反差提供。从电子波的波动性分析，电子波穿透样品后成为透射波和散射波，其透射波的波长与人射电子波的波长相等，散射波由于人射电子通过样品时损失部分能量，使散射波波长发生变化。如图3.3.6所示，透射波（AB）与散射波（BC）之间存在一定的相位差。在理想透镜正聚焦时，二波（AB、BC）之间的相位差为90°，其合成波AC的振幅与透射波AB的差别很小（AC ≈ AB），几乎没有反差（图3.3.6a）。如果适当离焦，二波（AB、BC）之间的相位变化造成合成波（AC）的振幅与透射波（AB）的振幅的差异明显加大，合成波大于或小于透射波，形成一定的振幅差（图3.3.6b）。根据样品各部分透射波的强弱不同，使图像出现亮暗不同的区域，这种反差称为相位反差。 图3.3.6

mathrm{2d}mathrm{sin}{mathrm{theta}}mathrm{ = nlambda} 式中：d——晶体原子之间的间距； θ——人射波角度； n——整数0，1，2，3...... λ——入射波波长。 则会在一定方向上产生很强的衍射波，称为布拉格衍射（Bragg diffraction）。它使直接透射的部分电子束强度分布产生变化。如果物镜光阑把衍射束挡住，只让透射束通过而形成的图像反差称为衍射反差。此时，像是明场像，晶体中的强衍射区对应像的亮区，背景是暗的。若晶体产生的衍射束未被光阑挡住，而透射束被挡住，则形成暗场像。因此在一个均匀多晶体样品中，当同一电子束照射下，由于它们相对于人射电子波的取向不同，不同的晶粒呈现亮暗不同的颗粒，有的成为明场像，有的成为暗场像。在改变样品倾斜角度时，图像的明暗场像也随之变化。 衍射反差主要是用来研究晶体样品中的缺陷，而对原子尺度的研究，不能用衔射像来直接解释，必须连同电子衍射图一起对衍射反差像进行分析。 （4）离焦反差 离焦反差主要由散射电子波和直射电子波相互干涉而形成的。在电镜观察样品时，样品质量厚度迅速改变区域所对应的图像上会出现费涅尔衍射环。当物镜过焦时，费涅尔条纹呈暗线，欠焦时则呈现亮线，在正焦时，费涅尔条纹消失。由于离焦产生衍射环引起图像反差的增加，这种反差称为离焦反差。 3.3.3 主要性能 TEM主要性能指标通过常有三个：分辨本领、放大倍数和加速电压。 （1）分辨本领。显微镜的分辨本领是表示用显微镜来观察物体细微结构的能力，它是由显微镜能清楚分辨开被观察物体中两个细节间的最小距离来定义的。这个最小距离越小，分辨本领高。现今1000 kV透射电子显微镜的分辨本领可达0.2~0.3 nm。很显然分辨本领一方面取决于仪器本身的性能，如物镜的球差、衍射像差、色差、像散等因素；另一方面与被观察物体的材料性质、细节的形状、位置及衬度条件诸因素有关。甚至与检测人对最小距离的判别和测量有关。总之分本领是显微镜的最重要指标，也是一个不容易严格定义和测定的指标。 （2）放大倍数。透射电子显微镜的放大倍数是指横向放大倍数，它是成像系统中各级电磁透镜电子放大信数之乘积。每一级电磁透镜的放大倍数M定义为该透成像的像距b和距a的比值M = b/a，显然像距与物距取决于透镜的焦距f，即1/f = 1/a+1/b，而磁透镜的焦距f是透镜激励电流I和加速电压V的非线性函数f（V/I），因而改变电流就可以满足成像关系获得清楚的聚焦图像。现代透射电子显微镜的放大倍数从几十倍到几十万倍可连续改变，这是一般光学显微镜办不到的。由于电子显微镜分辨本领很高，即使放大几十万倍以后获得的照片还可以进一步用光学放大而得到几百万倍的图像透射电子显微镜的放大倍数将随样品平面高度、加速电压、透镜电流而变化。为了保持仪器放大倍数的精度，必须定期进行标定。 （3）加速电压。电子显微镜的加速电压决定电子的能量，电子能量越高、波长越短，电子显微镜的分辨本领越高。加速电压增加，电子穿透能力更强，可以观察更厚的样品。同时电子枪亮度增加，荧光屏发光强度也增强。因此透射电子显微镜通常都工作在50~200 kV。工作电压在500 kV以上的属于超高压电子显微镜。目前世界上超高压电子显微镜的加速电压高达3000 kV。 3.3.4 主要特点 电镜最突出的优越性主要表现在具有很高的分辨本领，最高分辨率达到001~0.02 nm；已达到原子水平，而且放大倍数高达100万倍放大倍数从几十倍到几于万可连续变倍，适用于各种研究样品的需要，在生物学和材料学纳米级的研究领域中是其他仪器所无法取代的，但透射电镜也有它的局限性和特殊要求，其表现如下： （1）由于样品制备技术的限制，对大多数生物样品来说，一般只能达到2 nm的分辨水平。 （2）电镜图像的分辨能力不仅取决于电镜本身的分辨率，而且也取决于样品结构的反差。 （3）电镜所用的光源是电子波，波长在非可见光范围内无颜色反应，所形成的图像是黑白图像，要求图像必须具有一定的反差。 （4）生物体组织和细胞成分主要由C、H、O、N等轻元素组成，它们的原子序数较低，电子像散射能力弱，相互之间的差别又很小，电镜下的图像反差一般偏低。 （5）由于电子束的穿透能力较弱，样品必须制成超薄切片。生物切片上可获得的分辨率般是切片厚度的1/10，也就是说，切片厚度为50~100 nm，其切片上的分率为5~10 nm。由此可见，虽然电镜的分辨率很高，生物样品制样技术限制了电镜性能的发挥。一般要求切片厚度为 50~70 nm。 （6）观察面小，载网直径为3 mm，超薄切片范围为 0.3~0.8 mm。 （7）电子束的强烈照射易损伤样品，发生变形、升华等，甚至被击穿破裂，可能使观察结果产生假象。 （8）观察时电镜镜筒必须保持真空，为了保证样品在真空下不损伤，对样品要求应无水分。因此，不能观察活体的生物样本。 （9）生物制样复杂，在步骤繁多的制样过程中，样品容易产生收缩、膨胀、破碎以及内含物丢失等结构改变。 3.3.5 样品制备 （1）对试样的要求 诱射电子显微镜通过让电子束（包括衍射束和透射束）透过样品，利用透过或衍射的电子束反映样品晶体结构及形貌。如需获取普通形貌相、衍射班点，样品厚度要求小于200 nm；如需获取高分辨形貌相、精细衍射花样，样品厚度一般要求小于100 nm。 （2）块体样品制备技术 1）薄膜样品制备。 薄膜样品的组织结构必须和大块样品相同，在制备过程中，这些组织结构不能发生化。样品相对于电子束必须有足够的“透明度”，因为只有样品能被电子束透过，才有可进行观察和分析。薄膜样品应有一定强度和刚度，在制备、夹持和操作过程中，在一定的机械力作用下不会引起变形或损坏。在样品制备过程中不允许表面产生氧化和腐蚀。氧化和腐蚀会使样品的透明度下降，并造成多种假象。 2）样品薄片的预先减薄。 ①从大块样品上切割厚度为0.3~0.5 mm厚的薄片。 a.电火花线切割设备——导电样品。用一根往返运动的金属丝做切割工具。以被切割样品作阳极、金属丝作阴极，两极间保持微小的距离，利用其间的火花放电进行切割。过程在冷却条件下进行 电火花切割可切下厚度小于0.5 mm的薄片，切制时损伤层比较浅，可以通过后续的制或减薄过程去除。 b.金刚石切片机——不导电样品。针对不导电样品，利用金刚石刀片旋转，切割固在夹具上的样品。为了防止样品过热，一般配有冷却液。 ②0.5mm左右薄片减薄成几十微米薄片。 a.机械减薄法通过手工研磨来完成，把切割好的薄片一面用黏结剂黏在样品座表面，然在水砂纸上研磨减薄。样品平放，不要用力太大，并使它充分冷却。压力过大和温度升商局会引起样品内部组织结构发生变化。研磨过中要反复调换研磨面，使片两面摩擦磨特以免应力不均引起样品翘曲变形。片一般研磨至50 μm左右；手工研磨时即使用力不大，薄片上的硬化层也会厚至数十个纳米。 b.化学减薄法是把切割好的金属薄片放人配制好的化学试剂中，使其表面受蚀而继续减薄。合金中各组成相的腐蚀倾向是不同的，所以在进行化学减薄时，应注意减薄液的洗择。化学减薄法的最大优点是表面没有机械硬化层，减薄后样品的厚度可以控制在20~50 μm，薄区面积大。但是，化学减薄时必须先把薄片表面充分清洗，去除污物，否则将得不到满意的结果。 ③将几十微米薄片减薄到可进行透镜观察的样品。 a.双喷电解减薄：将预减薄的样品剪成直径3 mm的圆片，装入样品夹持器中。进行减薄时，样品两个表面的中心部位各有一个电解液喷嘴。从喷嘴中喷出的液柱和阴极相接，样品和阳极相接。电解液通过一个耐酸泵进行循环，在两个喷嘴的轴线上装有一对光导纤维，其中一个光导纤维和光源相接，另一个则和光敏元件相连。如果样品经抛光后中心出现小孔，光敏元件输出的电信号就可以将抛光线路的电源切断。 用这种方法制成的薄膜样品，中心穿孔附近有一个较大的楔形薄区，可以被电子束穿透。直径3 mm圆片周边是一个厚度较大的刚性支架，可以保证样品夹持、搬运过程中不会被损坏。 b.离子减薄：是物理方法减薄，原理是利用加速的离子轰击样品表面，使表面原子飞出（溅射出），最终使样品减薄到电子束可以通过的厚度。样品放置于10-3~10-2 Pa的高真空样品室中，离子束从两侧在3~5 kV加速电压加速下轰击样品表面，样品表面相对离子束成0~30°的夹角。 离子减薄适用于矿物、陶瓷、半导体及多相合金等电解抛光所不能减薄的场合。离子减薄的效率较低，一般情况下4 μm/h 左右。但是离子减薄的质量高、薄区大。 （3）粉末样品制备技术 胶粉混合法：在干净玻璃片上滴火棉胶溶液，然后在玻璃片胶液上放少许粉末并搅匀，再将另一玻璃片压上，两玻璃片相对研并突然抽开，稍后，膜干；用刀片将膜划成小方格，将玻璃片斜插入水杯中，在水面上下空插，膜片逐渐脱落，用铜网将方形膜捞出，待观察。 粉碎和分散法：需透射电镜分析的粉末颗粒一般都小于铜网小孔，因此要先制备对电子束透明的支持膜。常用支持膜有火棉胶膜和碳膜。粉末样品制备的关键取决于能否使其均匀分散到支持膜上。将样品在玛瑙研钵中研碎，将研碎的粉末（如果样品是微细的粉末，就不用粉碎）放入与样品不发生反应的有机溶剂（例如丁醇、丙酮等）中，用超声波分散得到悬浊液，为了操作简单方便，也可以用玻璃棒搅拌。用滴管把所得的悬浊液放一滴在黏附有支持膜的铜网上，静置干燥后即可供观察。 透射晶体薄膜样品制备看似是一个简单的操作，其实不然，它的每一个操作环节需考虑是否影响材料本身的结构特征，需要深入理解工艺对材料结构特征的影响规律，必须注重细节，精益求精。 3.3.6 主要应用 （1）形貌分析 由于透射电镜具有较扫面电镜更高的分辨率，因此非常适合用来进一步观察材料的形貌。如图3.3.7所示，合成出的PtPdCu海绵展现出明显的分形结构，由一根主干和许多分枝组成，而分枝又是由更小的主干和分枝组成，如同一棵具有多级分枝的树。树枝由许多小的纳米颗粒组成，它们融合在一起，形成一个相互连接的多孔体系。此外，PtPdCu海绵还具分级孔结构，主干的孔径和孔壁尺寸都要明显大于分枝的孔径和孔壁尺寸。能谱则进一步揭示了PtPdCu海绵具有合金结构。 图3.3.7 分形金属纳米海绵的形貌表征 （2）高分辨像 图3.2.6所示为碳纳米管上负载金属纳米颗粒的SEM照片，图上很好地呈现出碳纳米管的一维形貌，其直径约100 nm；大量的金属纳米颗粒均匀地负载在碳纳米管上，其尺寸约为几个纳米。在多相结构材料中，特别是在某些共晶材料复合材料的显微组织分析方面，可以借助于扫描电镜景深大的特点，较好地呈现材料的组织形貌和结构。 图3.2.6 碳纳米管负载的金属纳米颗粒 （3）电子衍射 透射电子显微镜可以将产生的电子衍射束聚焦放大投影到荧光屏或照相底板上，形成规则排列的斑点或线条，这种图形就是电子衍射谱。弹性相干散射是电子束在晶体中产生衍射现象的基础。需要提醒的是，弹性相干散射是指晶体中原子位置的相干性，而非电子源本身的相于性，因而电子衍射谱反映晶体内部的结构和原子排布情况。 虽然电子衍射和X射线衍射均可用于分析晶体结构，但是两种方法存在异同点。相同点主要表现在以下几个方面： ①电子衍射的原理和X射线衍射相似，满足布拉格方程且不产生消光时才会发生衍射。 ②如果将所得衍射花样以底片的形式呈现，则两种衍射方法所得到的衍射花样在几何特征上也大致相似。 ③两种衍射花样的标定原理相同，并且使用相同的衍射卡片库。 由于电子波与X射线相比有其本身的特性，因此电子衍射和X射线衍射相比较时，具有下列不同之处： ①电子衍射是电子受到在空间上周期性变化势场的散射，与样品的相互作用往往比X射线衍射与样品作用要强烈一些，往往不止发生一次散射；X射线是与核外电子发生作用，与核外的电子分布情况相关。 ②电子束的波长要比X射线短得多，在同样满足布拉格条件时，它的射角θ很小，约为10-2 rad；而X射线产生衍射时，其衍射角最大可接近π/2。 ③由于电子的散射强度很高，导致电子束的透射能力有限，因此透射电镜要求试样做成薄膜状，这样使试样制备远比X射线衍射样品制备要复杂得多。 ④电子衍射操作时采用薄膜样品，由于样品的尺寸效应，薄膜样品的倒易阵点并不一个圆点，而会沿着样品厚度方向延伸成杆状，因而，增加了倒易阵点和爱瓦尔德球相菇的机会，结果使略微偏离布拉格条件的电子束也能发生衍射。 ⑤由于电子波的波长短，采用爱瓦尔德球图解时，反射球的半径很大，在衍射角θ较小的范围内反射球的球面可以近似地看成是一个平面，从而也可以认为电子衍射产生的标斑点大致分布在一个二维倒易截面内。因此，衍射花样可以比较直观地反映晶体的结构晶面位向，使晶体结构的研究比X射线更有优势。 ⑥原子对电子的散射能力远高于它对X 射线的散射能力（约高出四个数量级），故电子衍射束的强度较大，摄取衍射花样时曝光时间仅需数秒钟。并且有时电子衍射的强度几透射束相当，致使两者间会产生交互作用，从而使电子衍射花样的强度分析变得复杂,罹像X射线衍射那样可以通过衍射强度来对物相进行定量计算、原位分析等。","completion":"根据所提供的中文段落，以下是检查出的语法错误或者错字漏字的更正： 1. 更正错别字：

原子力是一种表面力，主要包括范德华力、静电力、磁力等。利用隧道电流、光束偏转或压敏电阻等方法，可以检测到微细针尖与物体之间的原子力，形成待测物体的表面形貌像，也可以用于检测微纳材料的力学性能及进行微纳结构加工。 原子力显微镜的原理建立在探针尖的原子与样品表面原子在足够接近时存在相互作用力的基础之上。探针被装在一个小小的弹力臂的端头上，探针尖端上的原子与样品表面的相互作用力与两者的间距具有密切联系，如图3.4.1所示。当间隙大时，不存在作用力；在间隙逐渐缩小过程中，将出现引力（FW），主要有范德华力、毛细作用力、磁力和静电力。引力随着间隙缩小而增大，继续缩小间隙，探针针尖和样品原子外围电子将出现斥力（FR），主要有键结力和静电相互排斥力。斥力随距离减小的增速比引力快得多，在间隙缩小过程中将很快由相吸转向相斥。引力和斥力的合力称为雷纳德琼斯相互作用势（Lennard-Jones potential），可以表示为： F_A=F_R+F_W=frac{A}{r^m}-frac{B}{r^n} 式中，r为针尖原子与样品表面的最小距离；A、B、m、n针对不同的模型，可以是不同的常数。 图3.4.1 探针/样品间作用力与距离的关系 AFM针尖装在一个一端固定的弹性徽悬臂上，弹性徽悬臂对微弱力极为敏感，当样品或针尖轻轻接触时，针尖与样品表面原子之间的相互作用力就会引起微悬臂发生徽小的弹性形变，也就是说微悬臂的形变可作为样品-针尖相互作用力的直接度量。 当一束激光照射到微悬臂的背面，微悬臂将激光束反射到一个光电检测器，检测器不同象限接收到的激光强度差值同微悬臂的形变量会形成一定比例关系,比如当微悬臂的形变约为0.01 nm，激光束反射到光电检测器后，则可放大为 3~10 nm的位移，产生可测量的电压差。反馈系统根据检测器电压的变化不断调整针尖或样品Z轴方向的位置，保持微悬臂的变形量不变，即保持针尖-样品间作用力恒定不变，针尖就会随表面的起伏上下移动，测量检测器电压对应样品扫描位置的变化，可获得针尖上下运动的轨迹，即样品的表面形貌特征。这种检测方式被称为“恒力”模式，是使用最广泛的扫描方式。AFM探针因其结构、材料等不同，弹簧常数范围宽至0.01~500 N/m，针尖尖端的曲率半径可小至1 nm，通常为10 nm，也可以通过镶嵌微球达到pm的量级。不同种类的探针可适用于不同的材料和需求，这拓宽了AFM的使用范围。 3.4.2 工作模式 AFM工作主要有成像模式和力曲线模式。成像模式又分为接触式、非接触式和轻敲式；力曲线模式有接触力曲线、轻敲力曲线和力分布成像。工作中可以根据样品表面不同的结构特征、材料的特性以及实验目的，选择合适的操作模式。 3.4.2.1 成像模式 （1）接触成像模式 接触成像模式针尖始终和样品接触，以恒高或恒力的模式扫描扫描过程中，针尖在表面滑动，形成稳定的高分辨图像。这种模式不适用于低弹性模量和易变形材料。 在大气环境中，由于毛细作用的存在，针尖和样品之间存在较大的黏滞力，横向扫描时施加在样品上的额外作用力可能会造成样品的损伤，黏滞力同时增大针尖和样品的接触面积，降低成像的分辨率。解决的办法是，由于表面自由能越大黏滞力越强，因此可以通过AFM针尖对表面进行修饰，在针尖上涂覆低表面能材料，或者将针尖浸人液体等，可以克服毛细作用带来的影响，有效提高成像分辨率。 如果在上面过程中微悬臂的分析和快速扫描的方向垂直，则针尖除了可以探测到与样品之间的垂直方向的原子力，还会由于针尖与样品之间的摩擦力使得微悬臂横向扭转，这样就可以研究样品表面的微区摩擦性质。横向力测量已经被广泛应用于多组分材料表面的摩擦性质。 （2）非接触成像模式 非接触成像模式中针尖在样品表面上方振动，始终不与样品接触。针尖测器检测到的是范德华力和静电力等对样品没有破坏的长程作用力，灵敏度较高。但是当针尖和样品距离较长时，成像分辨率较低，不适用于在液体中成像。 （3）轻敲模式 在轻敲模式中，微悬臂在其共振模式附近做受迫振动。振动的针尖轻敲表面，间断地和表面接触。由于接触时间非常短，针尖与样品的相互作用很小，通常为1皮牛顿~1纳牛顿，前切力引起的分率降低和对样品的破坏几乎消失，所以适合用于生物和聚合物等软物体的成像研究。 轻敲模式AFM在大气和液态环境下都可以实现。在大气环境中，当针尖与样品不接触时，微悬臂以最大振幅自由振荡。当针尖与样品表面接触时，尽管压电陶瓷片以同样的能量激发微悬臂振荡，但空间阻隔作用使微悬臂的振幅减小。反馈系统控制微悬臂的振幅恒定，针尖就跟随表面的起伏，上下移动获得表面形貌信息。轻敲模式同样适合在液态中操作，而且由于液态的阻尼作用，针尖与样品的剪切力更小，对样品的损伤也更小，所以液体中轻敲成像模式可以实现溶液反应的原位观察和活体生物检测。 轻敲模式还有一个重要应用，即相位成像。通过测定扫描过程中微悬臂的振荡相位和压电陶瓷驱动信号的振荡相位之间的差值，研究材料的力学性质和表面性质。如样品表面的摩擦、材料的滞弹性和黏附性质等;还可以对材料表面的不同组分进行化学识别。 轻敲模式一般采用调制横向振幅恒定的方法进行恒力模式的扫描，也可以采用频率调行化学识别。制技术，测量扫描过程中频率的变化。这种频率调制AFM的力检测方式，大幅度提高了噪声处理率和灵敏度，可以获得原子级分辨率的图像。 3.4.2.2 力曲线模式 针尖和样品之间的相互作用力与距离的关系称为“力曲线”，是实现AFM观察的重要特性曲线。 （1）接触力曲线 在接触模式的力曲线测量中，压电陶瓷置于当前扫描区域（x, y）的中心位置，停止扫描，仅在2方向施加周期性三角波电压信号，使样品周期性地与针尖接近一接触一离开。AFM的光学系统实时记录微悬臂的变形量并对压电陶瓷管的位移量作图。力曲线中微悬臂的弯曲与其力学常效的乘积即为针尖与样品之间的作用力。 力曲线一般分为非接触区、接触区和黏滞区3个区域。在非接触区，针尖离开样品较远，它们之间的作用力可以忽略不计，微悬臂不发生弯曲，力曲线为水平直线。针尖接近样品，它们之间的范德华力使微悬臂向样品表面弯曲。当二者接近到某一点时，它们之间的引力随距离变化的斜率超过了微悬臂的弹性常数，由于机械不稳定性，二者会突然接触到一起，称之为突触点，在接触区样品和针尖相互接触而共同移动。如果针尖和样品在接触时都没有发生弹性或塑性变形，样品所走过的距离与微悬臂的弯曲量相同。当样品走至某一预设位置时向相反方向移动，微悬臂的弯曲随之逐渐减小。但是由于针尖与样品间的黏附作用，二者仍粘在一起。随着样品继续向远离针尖方向移动，微悬臂由背向样品弯曲变为面向样品弯曲，这一区为力曲线的第三区——黏滞区。当微悬臂积蓄的弹力超过二者之间的黏滞力时，针尖突然与样品离开，微悬臂恢复非弯曲状态，力曲线又重新进入非接触区，该位置称为“崩离点”(pull off point)。 检测AFM力曲线上针尖与样品接触区斜率的变化，可以得出纳米尺度上力学性能对于刚性样品，针尖与样品接触以后，样品走过的距离与AFM微悬臂的弯曲量相等，力曲线斜率为1。对于塑性样品，针尖有可能插入样品内部，微悬臂的弯曲量小于样品走过的距离，其斜率小于 1。利用这种性质，可以研究表面硬度及其抗磨损能力。有力曲线在接触外界压力后的那部分曲线的斜率，可以对弹性模量、杨氏模量等进行精确确定，根据表面黏滞力的大小还可以解析出样品的某些表面性质，而有非接触区的黏滞区情况可以估计力曲线测定所在介质的黏滞力等参数。 （2）轻敲式力曲线 除接触式力曲线外还有轻式力曲线和力分布成像。轻敲力曲线是使针尖反复接近—接触—远离样品，记录振荡的微悬臂的振幅、相位或变形量并对压电陶瓷位移量作图。其相位—频率图可以更为准确地表征样品的硬度、黏弹性等力学性能。力分布成像是以接触或轻敲模式，在（x, y）扫描区域内，对每一位置都进行力曲线测量，将作用力对x轴和y轴作图，得到力分布图，选择不同的模式可以观察到静电力或长程磁力。 3.4.3 试样制备 AFM的样品制备简单。纳米粉体材料应尽量以单层或亚单层形式分散并固定在基片上。选择合适的溶剂和分散剂将粉体材料制成稀溶液，必要时可采用超声分散以减少纳米粒子的聚集。根据纳米粒子的亲疏水特性、表面化学特性等选择合适的基片，常用云母、热解石墨（HOPC）、单晶硅片、玻璃、石英等。研究粉体材料的尺寸、形状等性质，应尽量选取表面原子级平整的云母、HOPC等作为基片；样品尽量牢固地固定在基片上。纳米薄膜材料如金属或金属氧化物薄膜、高聚物薄膜、有机与无机复合薄膜、自组装单分子膜等，一般都有基片的支持，可以直接用于AFM研究。 3.4.4 伪迹分析 同其他成像方法一样，扫描探针显微镜也不可避免地会出现一定程度的伪迹（亦称假象）。所谓伪迹，是指图像中出现的与试样固有结构完全无关的或者歪曲了其真实结构的图像。伪迹的产生通常来源于仪器操作者的经验缺乏，也可能是没有选择最佳的成像参数，这些参数包括设定力的大小、扫描速率和增益等。仪器本身的缺陷和仪器零部件的不完善，如针尖的磨损和污染等，也是假象产生的重要来源。测量误差主要是指仪器本身因素导致的测量误差。 3.4.4.1 探针针尖导致的伪迹和误差 使用原子力显微镜测量的图像总是探针几何形状和被成像的特征形状的卷积。如果探针针尖尺寸远小于被测量图像的特征，则探针产生的伪像将是最小的，并且从图像导出的尺寸测量将是准确的。选择合理的探针，可以有效避免探针产生伪影，例如，如果被测样品具有在100 nm范围内的特征尺寸，则直径不大于10 nm的探针将足以获得没有伪像的良好图像。在一些情况下，即使探针尺寸大于样品的特征尺寸，仍然可能从图像获得准确的结构信息。常见的针尖导致的伪迹和误差有： （1）探针对图像形貌的放大效应 在测试碳纳米管、纳米球等样品时经常会发现，通过AFM获得的高度数据是正确的，而其宽度比预测的大，这是由于探针尺寸引起的样品表面形貌的放大效应，如图3.4.2示。当探针尺寸与被测物体相当时，其针尖尺寸不可忽略，在计算样品宽度时，应排除探针针尖尺寸的影响。 图3.4.2 探针引起的图像放大效应示意图 （2）探针对图像形貌的缩小效应 当探针扫描狭缝等表面较低的样品形貌时，获得的尺寸往往会比预想的要小。这是因为获得的线性轮廓是由探针的几何形状而不是试样表面的几何形状决定的，如图3.4.3所示。此时仍然可以从获得的图像测量孔的开口，此外，可以使用不接触到正被测试的狭缝底部的探针来精确地测量重复图案的间距。 图3.4.3 探针引起的图像缩小效应示意图 （3）探针导致的奇怪形貌 如果在测量图像之前探针针尖碎裂或者被污染，可能观察到难以解释的奇怪形状。例如，当探针针尖被污染或者损伤时，由此可能产生无数个针尖，导致图像中出现重复的奇怪形状。多针尖效应一般表现为重复出现的特殊形貌，在形貌结校较复杂的试样中很难判断，因此，分析人员在观测图像时应十分小心，留意图像中是否有不合理重复出现的结构单元像。 3.4.4.2 扫描器导致的伪迹和误差 原子力显微镜中在x、y和z方向上移动探针的扫描器通常由压电陶瓷制成。压电陶瓷能够移动探针非常小的距离，然而，当线性伏安法应用于压电陶瓷时，陶瓷以非线性运动移动。此外，压电陶瓷还表现出由自加热引起的迟滞效应，由于扫描器的几何形状，也可能将伪像引人图像中。扫描器导致的伪迹和误差主要有： （1）x-y轴以及z轴方向上的校准以及线性 所有原子力显微镜必须在x-y轴上校准，以使计算机屏幕上是现的图像准确，扫描仪的运动也必须是线性的，使得由图像测量的距离准确。没有校正后的图像上的特征，通常在图像的一侧比在另一侧上更小。扫描器被正确地线性化后，扫描器是否被校准很重要，例如，扫描器可以是线性但不是校准的。如果校准不正确，则线轮廓测量的x-y值也不准确。 AFM中的高度测量要求显微镜的z轴上的压电陶瓷是线性的并且已被校准，通常显微镜只在一个高度校准。然而，如果测量的z高度和实际z高度之间的关系呈非线性，则高度测量有误。如图3.4.4所示，表示AFM中实际高度和测量z高度之间的关系。AFM常只测量一个校准点，如图中灰色圆圈所示，并且假设陶瓷是线性的，如直线所示。然而，通常情况下，压电陶瓷是非线性的，如曲线所示。在这种情况下，使用AFM将获得不正确的之高度，除非被测量的试样数据接近校准测量值。 压电陶瓷中的滞后会导致悬臂以垂直运动移动到表面的边缘时过冲。该问题最常见于观察硅片、光盘等图案化的样品时或测试薄膜样品的边缘时，如图3.4.5所示。该效果可以使图像在视觉上更好，因为边缘看起来更清晰，但是获得的结构线轮廓有误。 图3.4.4 AFM中实际z高度与测量z高度之间的关系 图3.4.5 AFM中实际z高度与测量z高度之间的关系 （2）扫描器漂移 AFM图像中的漂移可能归因于压电扫描器中的蠕变，也可能因为AFM容易受到外界温度变化的影响。最常见类型的漂移发生在图像扫描的开始处。此伪影导致扫描范围的初始部分出现失真，经常表现为在扫描起始处图像的扭曲。因此在扫描原子分子尺度的高分辨成像时，常常需要开机等待一段时间才开始测量，以使系统达到稳定状态停止漂移。在使用液体池在液态环境下测量和使用加热或冷却的装置时，尤其要留意漂移对结果的影响。 3.4.4.3 其他因素的影响 除了探针、扫描器的影响，其他因素也可能导致图像的伪迹以及误差。常见的有： （1）光学干涉条纹 对附着在诸如硅片之类光滑表面的试样进行AFM测试时，往往在图像中出现周期性花样，通常间隔为1.5~2.5 μm，这是由于来源于试样表面和悬臂表面的两束光发生干涉而引起的。如果激光没有完全聚焦于探针悬臂表面，就会有部分光束溢出入射到样品表面，高反射率的试样如硅片、金等能将这些溢出的光反射向检测器。由于激光是相干光源，因而从悬臂反射的光束和从试样反射的光束相遇后会发生干涉，产生明暗相间的干涉条纹，解决办法是正确地聚焦激光或者稍微调整聚焦点在悬臂上的位置。近年来，使用低相干的SLD光源替代传统光源或者在探针背面镀金、铝的涂层增强探针的反射信号以降低干涉效应。 （2）温度、湿度等因素的影响 如前所述，温度改变可能导致扫描仪出现漂移，导致伪迹的出现。而温度、湿度也会影响探针和样品间相互作用，尤其是在湿度较大地区对于一些易吸水样品，样品与探针间可能有一层水膜，进而影响AFM测试结果。在进行扫描速率较慢的AFM测试时，在开着空调的房间可能观察到与光学干涉条纹类似的横向条纹，这是由于空调工作或未工作时，室内温度、湿度改变而导致的结果。因此为了获得高质量AFM图像，应尽量保持室内温度和湿度的恒定。 （3）振动的影响 由于AFM的主要功能建立于对悬臂梁的微小偏移的高度敏感性上，任何影响悬臂的振动都可能在图像中产生伪迹。典型的振动伪迹是震荡样花样，声音和地面震动都能在AFM操作中表现出来并产生图像伪迹。建筑物的地面垂直震动常有几个微米的振幅，频率低于5 Hz，这种振动若未经过适当的隔离，就可能导致图像中的周期性结构花样。室内人们的大声讲话声，飞机飞越建筑物的声音甚至关闭门窗的声音都有可能在图像中出现伪迹。 3.4.5 主要应用 3.4.5.1 表面形貌观察 AFM分析Si单晶表面获得巨大成功。关于单晶Si的表面形貌，Takayanagi提出(111)表面7×7结构，其基本单元由两个三角形胞，12个原子构成。原子力显微镜可以得到清晰图像，并测量出原子尺寸。图3.4.6是Si晶体(111)面的原子像，构成虚线四边形的12个原子即为7×7结构。沿图中虚线直线进行测量、得到S 原子的横向和高度寸，示于图3.4.7。在扫描方向的界面处每一个原子都有两个峰，这是由于针尖类端原子的两个悬挂键与当表面原子的悬挂键形成了两个共价键。这种频调制的AFM的力检测方式大大降低噪声并提高了灵敏度、信噪比的增加使图像反养和分辨率都大幅度提高。AFM在3个维度上可以检测纳米粒子乃至原子的大小尺寸，纵向分辨率可以达到0.01 nm。 图3.4.6 单晶硅（111）表面7×7结构的AFM像 图3.4.7 单晶硅（111）表面7×7结构的尺寸 3.4.5.2 微纳测量 碳纳米管由于尺寸太小，无法应用传统强度测量技术进行测量。图3.4.8是一个新颖的实验，使用位于扫描电子显微镜内的“纳米应力台”，用双AFM尖端来对纳采管施加拉伸载荷、测量单个多层纳米管的拉伸强度。 图3.4.8 AFM-AFM联用测量纳米管强度 拉伸实验是在SEM内进行和观察的。由AFM尖端测量施加的应力，拉伸距离由SEM图像测量。观察表明，纳米管通常在最外层发生断，该层的拉伸强度范围为11~63 GPa。对单个多层纳米管的应力-应变曲线分析表明，最外层的杨氏模量E为270~950 GPa。用TEM检测断裂的纳米管碎片，观察到波浪花样和局域径向塌陷等多种结构。应用类似的方法，可以测量纳米线、纳米管的弹性模量和强度。图3.4.9是测量纳米弹簧弹性模量的SEM像。在SEM的样品室中装载微型AFM，测量在SEM观察中进行SEM像中，确定图？？中箭头所指两点间的距离为原始长度，随着针尖移动弹簧拉伸，记录针尖感知的纳米线弹簧的作用力，从SEM像中测量不同应力下纳米弹簧原始长度的伸长量，通过应力—应变曲线分析，可以有效地测量出纳米弹簧的弹性模量。

第3章 电子显微分析 3.1 概述 扫描电子显微镜（scanning electron microscope，SEM）、透射电子显微镜（transmission electron microscope，TEM）和原子力显微镜（atomic force microscope，AFM）在材料分析中应用广泛，其涉及的基本原理和基本构件是电子显微分析和其他分析方法的基础。本章将简要介绍其基本原理和一般应用。 3.1.1 电镜发展简介 1665年，Robert Hooke发明了第一台光学显微镜，并用它首次察到软木塞的细胞。后来Leeuwenhoek改进了这台仪器，用它观察到藻类细胞、鱼的血红细胞等单细胞，从此揭开了显微技术的序幕。到1898年，光学显微镜经历了230多年的改进，已经达到非常完善的程度。从分辨率来讲，它已经达到了极限分辨率，已接近它的理论极限，即200 nm。但是，自然界有些物质的微观结构非常小，其大小只能用微米或纳米来表示，如病毒、物质的分子、原子等。为了提高光学显微镜的分辨率，科学家们做了大量的研究，但是再也无法提高光镜的分辨本领。 1924年，法国科学家De Broglie证明任何粒子在高速运动的时候都会发射一定波长的电磁辐射，其辐射波的波长与粒子的质量和运动速度成反比。这种随加速电压改变的电子波长叫做德布罗利波，这为电镜的研制打下了基础。但仅有电子流辐射波还不行，因为并没有解决电子流聚焦成像的问题。1926年德国科学家Garbor和Busch发现用铁壳封闭的铜线圈对电子流能磁聚焦，即可以作为电子束的透镜。上述两个重大发现为电镜的研制提供了重要的理论基础。德国科学家Ruska和Knoll在前面两个发现的基础上，经过了几年的努力，终于在1932制造出了第一台电子显微镜。尽管它十分粗糙，分辨率也很低，但它却证实了上述两个理论的实用价值。经过改造，在1933年研制的电镜分辨率为50 nm，放大倍率为1.2万倍，到1938年分辨率为10 nm，放大倍率为20万倍。1939年这一成果被正式交付德国西门子公司批量生产，当时生产了40台投入国际市场。 1954年西门子公司生产ElmiskopI型TEM，分辨率为1 nm；日本TEM始于1941年分辨率为3 nm；荷兰Philips公司于1944年研制第一台TEM，后来又生产系列电镜；1946年美国开始生产电镜；我国电镜研制起步较迟，1958年在长春中国科学院光学精密机械研究所研制了第一台中型电镜，到1977年生产的TEM分辨率为0.3 nm，放大倍率为80万倍。1932年Knoll提出了SEM可成像放大的概念，并在1935年制成了极其原始的模型。1938年德国的阿登纳制成了第一台采用缩小透镜用于透射样品的SEM。由于不能获得高分辨率的样品表面电子像，SEM一直得不到发展，只能在电子探针X射线微分析仪中作为一种辅助的成像装置。此后，在许多科学家的努力下，解决了SEM从理论到仪器结构等方面的一系列问题。最早期作为商品出现的是1965年英国剑桥仪器公司生产的第一台SEM，它用次电子成像，分辨率达25 nm，使SEM进人了实用阶段。 1968年在美国芝加哥大学，Knoll成功研制了场发射电子枪，并将它应用于SEM，可获得较高分辨率的扫描电子像。1970年他发表了用扫描透射电镜拍摄的铀和针中的铀原子和针原子像，这使SEM又进展到一个新的领域。 1982年德国物理学家Gerd Binnig与瑞士物理学家Heinrich Rohrer在瑞士苏黎世研究所工作时发明了扫描隧道显微镜，并因此共同获得了当年的诺贝尔物理奖。同年，第1台电子显微镜的发明者Ruska也获此殊荣。 1986年Binnig等发明了原子力显微镜，可以在任何环境（如液体、空气）中成像，在纳米级、分子级水平上作研究。商用产品出现在1989年。 3.1.2 电子束与物质的相互作用 当高能电子束轰击固体试样，会与样品表面的原子核及核外电子发生作用，激发出多种特征信号，包括透射电子、二次电子、背散射电子、俄歇电子、吸收电子和特征X射线等，如图3.1.1所示。通过对这些信号的接受、放大和显示成像，可以对样品表面形貌进行观察。 图3.1.1 电子束轰击固体试样激发信号 透射电子：当固体试样很薄时，入射电子的有效穿透深度大于样品厚度，那么就会有相当数量的入射电子能够穿过薄样品，成为透射电子。入射电子穿透样品的过程中将与原子核或核外电子发生有限次数的弹性或非弹性放射。弹性散射电子保持入射时的能量，是透射电子显微镜主要的成像电子，用于电子衍射分析、衍衬像分析和高分辨像分析。而非弹性散射电子能量降低，用于菊池线分析和损失谱分析。 二次电子：二次电子是指被入射电子轰击出来的核外电子。由于原子核和外层电子间的结合能很小，因此外层的电子比较容易和原子脱离。当原子的核外电子从入射电子获得了大于相应的结合能的能量后，可离开原子而变成自由电子。如果这种散射过程发生在比较接近样品表层，那些能量尚大于材料逸出功的自由电子可从样品表面逸出，变成真空中的自由电子，即二次电子。二次电子产额对试样表面状态非常敏感，能有效地显示试样表面的微观形貌。扫描电子显微镜中，主要用二次电子成表面形貌像。 背散射电子：背散射电子是指被固体样品原子反弹回来的一部分入射电子。其中包括弹性背反射电子和非弹性背反射电子。弹性背反射电子是指被样品中原子核反弹回来的，散射角大于90°的那些入射电子，其能量基本上没有变化。弹性背反射电子的能量为数千到数万伏特。非弹性背反射电子是入射电子和核外电子撞击后产生非弹性散射，不仅能量变化，方向也发生变化。如果有些电子经多次散射后仍能反弹出样品表面，这就形成非弹性背反射电子。非弹性背反射电子的能量分布范围很宽，从数十伏特到数千伏特。从数量上看，弹性背反射电子远比非弹性背反射电子所占的份额多。背反射电子的产生范围在100 nm~10 μm深处，由于入射电子进入试样较深，入射电子束已被散射开，由于它的产额能随样品原子序数增大而增多，所以不仅能用作形貌分析，而且可以用来显示原子序数衬度，定性地用作成分分析。 吸收电子：入射电子进入样品后，经多次非弹性散射能量损失殆尽，最后被样品吸收。若在样品和地之间接入一个高灵敏度的电流表，就可以测得样品对地的信号，这个信号是由吸收由子提供的。入射电子束与样品发生作用，若逸出表面的背反射电子或二次电子数量任一项增加，将会引起吸收电子相应减少，对于厚试样（无透射电子），由于入射电子的强度等于反射电子强度与吸收电子强度之和，若把吸收电子信号作为调制图像的信号，则其衬度与二次电子像和背反射电子像的反差是互补的。吸收电子在试样中经过多次碰撞后，其扩散体积大，因此吸收电子像的分辨率低，一般为0.1~1 μm。入射电子束射入含有多元素的样品时，由于二次电子产额不受原子序数影响，则产生背反射电子较多的部位其吸收电子的数量就较少。因此，吸收电子像可以反映原子序数衬度，同样也可以用来进行定性的微区成分分析。 特征X射线：特征X射线是原子的内层电子受到激发以后，在能级跃迁过程中直接释放的具有特征能量和波长的一种电磁波辐射。入射电子与核外电子作用，产生非弹性散射，外层电子脱离原子变成二次电子，使原子处于能量较高的激发状态，它是一种不稳定态。较外层的电子会迅速填补内层电子空位，使原子降低能量，趋于较稳定的状态。产生的特征X射线的波长和原子序数之间服从莫塞莱定律： mathrm{lambda = }frac{mathrm{K}}{{mathrm{(Z-sigma)}}^mathrm{2}} 式中Z为原子序数，K、σ为常数。 从公式可以看出，特征波长和原子序数有关，利用这一关系可以进行成分分析。X射线一般在试样的500 nm~5 μm深处发出。 俄歇电子：如果原子内层电子能级跃迁过程中释放出来的能量不以X射线的形式释放，而是用该能量将核外另一电子打出，脱离原子变为二次电子，这种二次电子叫做俄歇电子。因每一种原子都有自己特定的壳层能量，所以它们的俄歇电子能量也各有特征值，能量在50~500 eV。俄歇电子是由试样表面极有限的几个原子层中发出的，这说明俄歇电子信号适用于表层化学成分分析。显然，一个原子中至少要有三个以上的电子才能产生俄歇效应，铍是产生俄歇效应的最轻元素。 3.2 扫描电子显微镜 3.2.1 主要结构 扫描电镜可分为五个主要组成部分：电子束会聚系统、样品室、真空系统、电子学系统和显示部分。 （1）电子束会聚系统。此系统由三部分组成（见图3.2.1），即电子枪、磁透镜、扫描线圈等。 图3.2.1 电子束会聚系统剖面示意图 电子枪。电子枪是扫描电镜的电子源，由阴极、栅极和阳极构成，其作用是发射稳定、高速的电子束流。电子束的亮度主要取决于电子枪发射电子的强度，所用的加速电压一般为0.5~30 kV。 磁透镜（聚光镜）。电子射线在磁场的作用下会改变前进的方向。当电子射线通过空心的强力电磁圈时，就像光线通过玻璃的透镜那样，会发生折射而聚焦。由于三极电子枪所发射出来的电子束直径一般为30~50 μm左右，而最终要求电子束直径成为1~5 nm的电子探针，因此需要两个或三个磁透镜组成，即双聚光镜和物镜（末透镜）。这三个透镜都有光阑，可挡掉一部分无用的电子，尤其是物镜光阑要尽量地小，以减少像差。同时，磁透镜有像散存在，故要安装消像散器。 扫描线圈。通常由两个偏转线圈组成。在扫描发生器的作用下，电子束在样品表面做光栅状扫描。 （2）样品室。样品室是固定样品以及电子束和样品相互作用产生各种信号电子的场所（见图3.2.2）。 扫描电镜样品室的容积较大，最大的直径为150 mm，样品用导电胶或双面胶固定在铜台上，经过喷镀，装入样品座，把这个样品座放在和微动装置连在一起的样品架上。样品微动装置能在X、Y轴方向上下左右移动，能在T轴做0~90°的倾斜，能在R轴做360°的水平旋转，还能在Z轴做6~48 mm左右的升降。为了使电子探针系统和样品室的这些结构保持真空状态，避免外部磁场的影响和保持外观整齐，以上各部分被装入适当的外套之中，用密封圈（橡胶垫圈）组装在一起。 图3.2.2 样品室 （3）真空系统。扫描电镜的真空系统如图3.2.3所示。扫描电镜的镜体和样品室内部都需要保持1.33×10-2~1.33×10-4 Pa的真空度，因此必须用机械泵和扩散泵进行抽真空。真空系统还有水平、停电和真空自动保护装置，置换样品和灯丝时有气锁装置。 图3.2.3 扫描电镜的真空系统 （4）电子学系统。 电源系统：扫描电镜的电源系统包括启动镜体的各种电源(高压、透镜系统、扫描线圈、合轴线圈、消像散用的电源等)，检测与放大系统电源，光电倍增管电源，真空系统和图像信号处理线路电源，观察用的显像管以及照相机电源等。 信号电子成像系统：此系统把电子探针和样品相互作用产生的信号电子进行收集、放大、处理，最后在显像管上显示图像。 扫描电镜可以接收从样品上发出的多种信号电子来成像，不同的信号电子要用不同的探测器。在高真空的工作状态下，以二次电子信号的图像质量最好。二次电子的探测器为二次电子探头，是扫描电镜最重要的部件之一。二次电子探头由栅极、聚焦环、闪烁晶体、光导管和光电倍增管等组成，见图3-5。 （5）显示部分。 显像管：把电子透镜像普通显微镜里的物镜和目镜那样组合起来，把物体放大到万、几十万倍。由于人眼看不见电子射线，必须在荧光屏上显示放大的图像，即将信号放大器获得的输出调制信号通过显像管转换成图像。 照相机：显像管显示的图像、编号、放大倍率、标尺长度和加速电压可以拍摄到底片上。着科学水平的不断发展，20世纪80年代开始就已研制用计算机代替照相机的功能，直接将图像及设置的参数打印出来或存储。 3.2.2 工作原理 扫描电子显微镜的工作原理如图3.2.4所示。由电子枪发射的电子束在加速电压的作用下经过磁透镜系统会聚，形成直径几个纳米的电子束，聚焦在样品表面上。在第二聚光镜和物镜之间偏转线圈的作用下，电子束在样品上做光栅状扫描，电子和样品相互作用产生信号电子。这些信号电子经探测器收集并转换为光子，再通过电信号放大器加以放大处理，最终成像在显示系统上。扫描电镜的工作原理与光学显微镜的不同在于：在光学显微镜下，全部图像一次显出，是“静态”的；而扫描电镜则是把来自二次电子的图像号作为时像信号，将一点一点的画面“动态”地形成三维的图像。 图3.2.4 扫描电镜工作原理 3.2.3 主要性能 （1）放大倍数 当入射电子束作光栅扫描时，电子束在样品表面扫描的幅度为As，荧光屏长度也就是显示器电子束同步扫描的幅度为Ac，则扫描电子显微镜的放大倍数为： mathrm{M = }frac{mathrm{A}_mathrm{c}}{mathrm{A}_mathrm{s}} 由于显示器荧光屏尺寸是固定不变的，因此，改变电子束在试样表面的扫描幅度As可以改变放大倍率。一般扫描电子显微镜的放大倍数，可以从20~20万倍区间连续调节，实现由低倍到高倍的连续观察，这对观察分析非常有利。 （2）分辨率 分辨率是扫描图像中可以分辨两点之间的最小的实际距离，是扫描电子显微镜的核心性能指标。分辨率高低主要取决于电子束直径和调制信号的类型，电子束激发出信号的区域与荧光屏上的像点逐一对应，入射电子束直径越小，分辨率越高。另外，同一电子束试样内激发信号的有效范围一般会超过入射束直径，不同信号激发范围不同，导致不同分辨率。在SEM中，二次电子因其本身能量较低致使平均自由程很短，有效激发范围与电子束直径相当，是分辨率最高的图像。背散射电子像分辨率低于二次电子像，X射线调制成像，其激发范围显著大于背散射电子，一般在微米量级。 （3）景深 景深是指透镜对试样表面高低不平的各部位能同时清晰成像的距离范围，可以理解为试样上最近清晰像点到最远清晰像点之间的距离。扫描电子显微镜末级透镜焦距较长，孔径半角很小（约10 mrad），景深是一般光学显微镜的100~500 倍，这使扫描电子显微镜图像有较强的立体感。放大5000倍时，景深可达数十微米，这是其他观察仪器无法比拟的优点。 3.2.4 主要特点 （1）成像立体感强 扫描电镜适用于粗糙表面和断口的分析观察，图像富有立体感、真实感，易于识别和解释。用扫描电镜来观察植物的叶、花、果实，动物的毛以及细菌、真菌等等的表面形貌时栩栩如生，分辨起来较容易，景深大。 （2）放大倍数变化范围大 扫描电镜放大倍数一般为15万~20万倍，最大可达10万~100万倍，它几乎包括了从扩大镜到光学显微镜到电子显微镜的一切倍率，而且同时给出一个比例尺，可方便地测量微结构的尺寸，而对于多相、多组成的非均匀材料，便于低倍下的普查和高倍下的观察分析。 （3）分辨率高 普及型的扫描电镜分辨率为10 nm，中档的为5~6 nm，高档的为1 nm，大多数的扫描电镜分辨率为 2~6 nm，最高可达0.01 nm。 （4）样品的损伤小 扫描电镜的电子束在样品上是动态扫描，其电子束流小，一般控制在100 μA以下，而且加速电压低，一般为 0.5~30 kV，这也是辐射损伤轻、污染小的原因。 （5）样品适应性高 体积小至几微米，大至150 mm，厚至20 mm的样品均可以用扫描电镜观察。其观察样的种类也较广，从土壤、金相、集成电路到生物切片，直至新鲜的含水样品都可以用扫描电镜观察（含水样品的观察要严格控制加速电压和观察的时间，否则容易损伤样品、放电和污染筒）。 （6）多功能分析 扫描电镜除了可以作形貌结构的观察外，如果配上能谱仪、光谱仪和波谱仪等附件，还可在观察形貌的同时作微区的多种成分的定性、定量、定位分析。配有光学显微镜和单色仪等附件时，可观察阴极荧光图像和进行阴极荧光光谱分析等。根据观察目的，能增加无需试样预处理工序的低真空方式功能、试样制冷、吸引、加热、描绘、分析等多方面功能。 （7）图像质量可调节 通过调节可改善图像反差的宽容度，使图像各部分亮暗适中。采用双放大倍数装置或图像选择器，可在荧光屏上同时观察不同放大倍数的图像或不同形式的图像进行对比。 （8）试样自由度大 试样可在三维空间平移、旋转、倾斜，这对观察不规则形状试样的各个区域细节极为方便。可使用加热、冷却和拉伸等样品台进行动态试验，观察在不同环境条件下的相变及形态变化等。 （9）可直接观察试样原始表面 扫描电镜制样简单，能反映样品的真实形貌，这对于许多故障进行失效分析是非常有利的。 3.2.5 样品制备 （1）对试样的要求 试样可以是块状或粉末颗粒，在真空中能保持稳定，含有水分的试样应先烘干除去水分。表面受到污染的试样，要在不破坏试样表面结构的前提下进行适当清洗，然后烘干。新断开的断口或断面，一般不需要进行处理，以免破坏断口或表面的结构状态。有些试样的表面、断口需要进行适当的侵蚀才能暴露某些结构细节，则在侵蚀后应将表面或断口清洗干净，然后烘干。对磁性试样要预先去磁，以免观察时电子束受到磁场的影响。试样大小要适合仪器专用样品座的尺寸，不能过大，样品座尺寸各仪器均不相同，一般小的样品座为3~5 mm，大的样品座为30~50 mm，以分别用来放置不同大小的试样，样品的高度也有一定的限制，一般在5~10 mm。 （2）块状试样的制备方法 对于块状导电材料，除了大小要适合仪器样品座尺寸外，基本上不需要进行什么制备，用导电胶把试样粘结在样品座上，即可放在扫描电镜中观察。对于块状的非导电或导电性较差的材料，要先进行镀膜处理，在材料表面形成一层导电膜，以避免电荷积累，影响图像质量，并可防止试样的热损伤 （3）粉末试样的制备方法 先将导电胶或双面胶纸粘结在样品座上，再均匀地把粉末样品撒在上面，用洗耳球吹去未粘住的粉末，再镀上一层导电膜，即可上电镜观察。 （4）镀膜的方法 镀膜的方法有两种，一是真空镀膜，另一种是离子溅射镀膜。离子溅射镀膜的原理是：在低气压系统中，气体分子在相隔一定距离的阳极和阴极之间的强电场作用下电离成正离子和电子，正离子飞向阴极，电子飞向阳极，二电极间形成辉光放电，在辉光放电过程中，具有一定动量的正离子撞击阴极，使阴极表面的原子被逐出，称为溅射，如果阴极表面为用来镀膜的材料（靶材），需要镀膜的样品放在作为阳极的样品台上，则被正离子轰击而溅射出来的靶材原子沉积在试样上，形成一定厚度的镀膜层。离子溅射时常用的气体为情性气体氩，要求不高时，也可以用空气，气压约为5×10-2 torr（1 torr = 133.32 Pa）。离子溅射镀膜与真空镀膜相比，其主要优点是：1）装置结构简单，使用方便，溅射一次只需几分钟，而真空镀膜则要半个小时以上；2）消耗贵金属少，每次仅约几毫克；3）对同一种镀膜材料，离子溅射镀膜质量好，能形成颗粒更细、更致密、更均匀、附着力更强的膜。 3.2.6 SEM照片影响因素 影响扫描电镜照片的因素包括：电子枪、电磁透镜以及样品室的洁净度等，避免粉尘、水气、油气等污染；调节加速电压、工作电流以及仪器调整、样品处理、真空度；环境因素，如振动、磁场、噪声、接地等。加何拍出好的SEM照片，一般由样品的种类和所要的结果来决定观察条件，调整适当的加速电压、工作距离、适当的样品倾斜，选择适当的侦测器、调整合适的电子束电流。一般来说，加速电压越高，电子束波长越短，理论上，只考虑电子束直径的大小，加速电压越大，可得到越小的聚焦电子束，因而提高分辨率，然而提高加速电压却有一些不可忽视的缺点，比如：无法看到样品表面的微细结构；会出现不寻常的边缘效应；电荷累积的可能性增大；样品损伤的可能性增大。 平时操作，若要将样品室真空一直保持在10-8 Pa（10-10 torr），则抽真空的时间将变长而降低仪器的便利性，更增加仪器购置成本，因此一些仪器设计了阶段式真空，亦即使电子枪、磁透镜及样品室的真空度依序降低，并分成三个部分来读取真空计读数，如此可将样品保持在真空度10-5 Pa的环境下即可操作。平时待机或更换样品时，为防止电子枪污染，皆使用真阀将电子枪及磁透镜部分与样品室隔离，实际观察时再打开使电子束通过而打击到样品。 场发射式电子枪的电子产生率与真空度有密切的关系，其使用寿命也随真空度变差而急剧缩短，因此在样品制备上必须非常注意水气，或固定用的碳胶或银胶是否烤干，以免在观察的过程中，真空陡然变差而影响灯丝寿命 3.2.7 主要应用 扫描电镜是利用样品表面微区特征（如形貌、原子序数或化学成分、晶体结构或位向等）的差异，在电子束作用下通过试样不同的区域产生不同的亮度差异，从而获得具有一定村度的图像。而扫描电镜由于具有景深大、放大倍数高的优点，所以特别适用于对表面凹凸不平的断口进行形貌分析。 （1）材料断口分析 材料断口分析是扫描电镜的典型应用。如图3.2.5所示，金属呈现出明显断口，深度为几个微米；表面有片状金属剥落，片状金属尺寸为几个至十几个微米。利用SEM可以清晰地观察材料表面的断口，金属断裂有沿晶、解离、准解理、疲劳和韧窝五种类型，而实际的断口可能由这五种之中的某几种典型断口混合而成。依据断口的形状，可以对实际断口进行断裂机制分析。 图3.2.5 金属表面断口 （2）材料组织形貌观察 图3.2.6所示为碳纳米管上负载金属纳米颗粒的SEM照片，图上很好地呈现出碳纳米管的一维形貌，其直径约100 nm；大量的金属纳米颗粒均匀地负载在碳纳米管上，其尺寸约为几个纳米。在多相结构材料中，特别是在某些共晶材料复合材料的显微组织分析方面，可以借助于扫描电镜景深大的特点，较好地呈现材料的组织形貌和结构。 图3.2.6 碳纳米管负载的金属纳米颗粒 （3）断裂过程的动态研究 有的型号的扫描电镜带有拉伸台装置，可进行断裂的动态过程研究。在试样拉伸的同时，既可以直接观察裂纹的萌生及扩展与材料显微组织之间的关系，又可以连续记录下来，为科学研究提供最直接的证据。 3.3 透射电子显微镜 3.3.1 主要结构 透射电子显微镜的结构主要包括电子光学系统、电源与控制系统、循环冷却系统及真空系统，其中电子光学系统是透射电子显微镜的核心部分。图3.3.1所示为透射电子显微镜的电子光学组成示意图。从光学成像的角度来看，透射电子显微镜由三部分组成：照明系统、成像与放大系统及观察与记录系统。 图3.3.1 透射电镜的结构示意图 3.3.1.1 照明系统 照明系统包括电子枪、聚光镜平移对中、倾斜调节装置，其主要作用为：提供一束亮度高、照明孔径半角小、平行度好、束流稳定的照明源；保证电子束可在2~3°倾斜，以满足明暗场成像转换的需要。 （1）电子枪 电子枪是发射电子的照明光源，主要作用是产生并发射和加速电子。目前电子枪的种类分为热电子发射型和场电子发射型。热电子发射型照明光源又可细分为钨灯丝、六硼化镧（LaB6）和六硼化铈（CeB6）三种。场发射电子枪照明光源可分为冷场型和热场型。使用场发射电子源的透射电镜又称为场发射电镜。 早期的透射电子显微镜使用的主要为钨灯丝电子源，但是由于其亮度低、光源尺寸大及能量发散度较大，所以人们很早就开始寻找更亮的光源。1969年Broers提出由单晶六硼化镧加工成锥状的顶端，从而制造出六硼化镧型灯丝。1968年，Crewe提出了冷场型发射枪，并于1980年后开始应用。然而，冷场型发射枪在室温使用时，灯丝会产生残留气体分子的离子吸附，使得发射电流降低并产生噪声，这样必须定期进行闪光处理以消除吸附分子层。因此，Swanson等人于20世纪70年代开发出钨针尖包覆有ZrO的热场型电子枪。表3.3.1给出了几种不同电子枪的特性。从表3.3.1可看出，热场发射型电子枪的亮度高、束斑尺寸小且能量发散度小，是目前综合性能最好的电子枪，因此也成了高分辨电子显微镜的首选。

钨灯丝和六硼化镧/铈灯丝属于热阴极电子枪，它是利用高温使电子具有足够的能量夫克服电子枪材料的功函数而逃离。常用的热电子发射型电子枪属于热阴极三极电子枪，它由发夹形钨丝阴极、栅极和阳极组成，其结构如图3.3.2所示。图3.3.2（a）中反映了阴极栅极和阳极之间的等位面分布情况。负的高压直接加在栅极上，同时在阴极和负高压之间有一个偏压电阻，这样使得栅极和阴极之间就会产生数百伏的电位差，如图3.3.2（b）。这样栅极比阴极电位值更负，因此可以用栅极来控制阴极发射电子的有效区域。 图3.3.2 热电子发射型电子枪工作原理示意图 当阴极流向阳极的电子数量加大时，在偏压电阻两端的电位值增加，使栅极电位比阴极进一步变负，由此可以减小灯丝有效发射区域的面积，束流随之减小。若束流因某种原因而减小时，偏压电阻两端的电压随之下降，致使栅极和阴极之间的电位接近。此时，栅极排斥阴极发射电子的能力减小，束流又可望上升。因此，自偏压回路可以起到限制和稳定束流的作用。由于栅极的电位比阴极负，所以自阴极端点引出的等位面在空间呈弯曲状。在阴极和阳报之间的某一地点，电子束会汇集成一个交叉点，这就是通常所说的电子题。交叉点处电子束直径约几十个微米。 图3.3.3所示为场发射电子枪工作原理示意图。场发射电子枪的原理是高电场下产生肖特基（Schottky）效应。它是利用靠近曲率半径很小的阴极尖端发尖发射电子的，当在真空中的金属表面受到108 V/cm大小的电子加速电场时，将会有数量可观的电子发射出来，所以叫作场致发射，简称场发射。如果阴极尖端半径为0.1~0.5 μm，若在尖端与第一阳极之间加U1 = 3 kV的电位差，与第二阳极间加U2 = 5 kV的电位差，那么在阴极尖端附近建立的强电场就足以使它发射电子。在第二阳极几十千伏甚至几百千伏正电位作用下，阴极尖端发射的电子会聚在第二阳极孔的下方，电子束直径小至20 nm（甚至10 nm）。场发射电子是从很尖锐的阴极尖端所发射出来，因此可得极细而又具高电流密度的电子束，其亮度可达热阴极电子枪的数百倍甚至数千倍。由此可见，场发射电子枪是透射电子显微镜获得高分辨率、高质量图像较为理想的电子源。不同的灯丝电子源大小、电流量、电流稳定度以及灯丝寿命等有差异，如表3.3.1所示。 图3.3.3 场发射电子枪工作原理示意图 （2）聚光镜 聚光镜的主要作用是把电子枪发射出来的电子会聚而成交叉点，以便得到一束强度高、直径小、相干性强、近似平行的电子束，并照射到样品上。一般都采用双聚光镜系统，如图3.3.4所示。第一聚光镜是强激磁透镜，焦距很短，通过改变焦距可以控制光斑大小；经过第一聚光镜后束斑缩小到1/50~1/10，将电子枪第一交叉点束斑缩小为1~5 μm。第二聚光镜是弱激磁透镜，焦距很长；同时在第二聚光镜下方安装有一个聚光镜光阑，用以调整束斑大小；通过控制光阑照明孔径半角可得到一束近乎平行的电子束，以利于进行衍射操作；和未经过第一聚光镜的束斑相比，经过第二聚光镜后的束斑，适焦时放大了约2倍。结果在样品平面上可获得2~10 μm的照明电子束班。同时，为了减小像散，在第二聚光镜下还安装有一个消像散器。另外，由于第二聚光镜是长焦电磁透镜，这样在第二聚光镜和下方的物镜之间就会有较大的间隙，这样有利于装人样品台及相关附件。 图3.3.4 聚光镜照明光路图 为了满足各种分析功能的需要（如纳米束电子衍射模式和会聚束电子衍射模式等），照明系统也变得越来越复杂，在新型多功能的透射电子显微镜中越来越多地采用多级聚光镜。 3.3.1.2 成像系统 主要是由样品室、物镜、中间镜和投影镜组成。在物镜的上面是样品室，在物镜的下面还有物镜光阑和选区光阑。 （1）样品室与样品台 样品室有一套机构，保证样品经常更换时不破坏镜筒主体的真空度。透射电子显微镜的样品既小又薄，通常需用外径为3 mm的样品载网（一般为铜网、网和镍网等）来支持。将装载样品的台子称为样品台。样品台的作用是承载样品，并使样品能在物镜极靴孔内平移、倾斜、旋转，以选择感兴趣的样品区域或位向进行观察分析。新式的电子显微镜常最普遍配备的是侧插式倾斜装置。“侧插”就是样品杆从侧面进入物镜极靴中去。有的样品杆本身还带有使样品倾斜或原位旋转的装置。这些样品杆和倾斜样品台组合在一起就是侧插式双倾样品台和单倾旋转样品台。目前双倾样品台是最常用的，它可以使样品沿x轴和y轴倾转±60°。在晶体结构分析中，利用样品倾斜和旋转装置可以测定晶体的位向、相变时的惯习面及析出相的方位等。部分样品台还可以实现对样品的加热、冷却及测试应变等处理。 在照相曝光期间必须牢固地将样品载网夹持在样品座中并保持良好的热、电接触，减小因电子照射引起的热或电荷堆积而产生样品的损伤或图像漂移。平移是任何样品台最基本的动作，通常在两个相互垂直方向上样品平移最大值为±1 mm，以确保样品载网上大部分区域都能观察到。样品图像的漂移量应小于相应情况下显微镜像的分辨率。 （2）物镜 物镜在镜筒中的位置如图3.3.5所示，其作用是形成第一幅高分辨率电子放大像。在镜下面的电磁透镜仅起到进一步放大的作用，这样物镜能够分辨出来的结构细节（包括任何缺陷）都被成像系统中的其他电磁透镜进一步放大。因此，透射电子显微镜分辨本领的高低主要取决于物镜。欲获得物镜的高分辨率本领，必须尽可能降低像差。通常采用强激磁、短焦距的物镜，像差小。 图3.3.5 成像系统光路示意图 物镜是一个强激磁、短焦距的透镜（f = 1~3 mm），它的放大倍数较高，一般为100~300倍。目前，高质量的物镜其分辨率可达1 Å左右。物镜的分辨率主要取决于极靴的形状和加工精度。一般来说，极靴的内孔和上下极靴之间的距离越小，物镜的分辨率就越高。为了减少物镜的球差，往往在物镜的后焦面上安放一个物镜光阑。物镜光阑不仅具有减少球差、像散和色差的作用，而且可以提高图像的衬度。此外，物镜光阑位于后焦面的位置上时，可以方便地进行暗场及衬度成像的操作。 在用电子显微镜进行图像分析时，物镜和样品之间和距离总是固定不变的 （即物距L1不变）。因此改变放大倍数进行成像时，主要是改变物镜的焦距和像距（即f和L2）来满足成像条件。 （3）中间镜 中间镜是一个弱激磁的长焦距变倍透镜，一般情况下，可在0~20倍范围调节。实际上，中间镜是以物镜的像为试样进一步成像的。当放大倍数大于1时，用来进一步放大物镜像；当放大倍数小于1时，用来缩小物镜像。 在电镜操作过程中，主要是利用中间镜的可变倍率来控制电镜的放大倍数。如果物镜、中间镜和投影镜的放大倍数分别用M0、Mi和Mp表示，则获得的电子显微图像总放大倍数M = M0MiMp倍。通过调节线圈电流可以很方便地增大或减小放大倍数。 如果把中间镜的物平面和物镜的像平面重合，则在荧光屏上得到一幅放大像，这就是电子显微镜中的成像操作（也称为显微成像模式），如图3.3.5（a）所示。如果把中间镜的物平面与物镜的背（后）焦面重合，则在荧光屏上得到一幅电子衍射花样，这就是透射电子显微镜的电子衍射操作（也称为衍射成像模式），如图3.3.5（b）所示。 （4）光阑 透射电子显微镜的光阑包括三种：聚光镜光阑、物镜光阑和选区光阑。这三种光阑片都是用无磁性的金属（铂、钼等）制造的，其结构上则有四个不同直径的光阑孔，每个光阑孔的周围开有缝隙以使光阑孔受电子束照射后热量的散出，但不同的光阑尺寸范围不同。光阑被安装在光阑杆机构上，使用时，通过光阑杆机构调节光阑孔的位置，使光阑孔中心位于电子束的轴线上（光阑中心和主焦点重合）。由于小光阑孔很容易受到污染，因此高性能的电子显微镜中常用抗污染光阑（或称自洁光阑）。 聚光镜光阑的作用是限制照明孔径半角。在双聚光镜系统中，聚光镜光阑常装在第二聚光镜的下方。光阑孔的直径为20~400 μm。做一般分析观察时，聚光镜的光阑孔直径可用200~300 μm；若做微束分析时，则应采用小孔径光阑。 物镜光阑（又称衬度光阑）通常被安装在物镜的后焦面上。常用的物镜光阑孔直径在20~120 μm范围内。当电子束通过薄膜样品后会产生散射和衍射，散射角（或衍射角）较大的电子被光阑挡住，不能继续进入镜筒成像，从而会在像平面上形成具有一定衬度的图像光阑孔越小，被挡去的电子越多，图像的衬度就越大，因此，物镜光阑又被称为衬度光阑。物镜光阑的另一个主要作用是在后焦面上套取衍射束的斑点（即副焦点）成像，这就是暗场成像。利用明、暗场显微照片对照分析，可以方便地进行物相鉴定和缺陷分析。 选区光阑又称场限光阑或视场光阑，一般都放在物镜的像平面位置。选区光阑孔的直径通常在20~400 μm范围内，有的高达800 μm。当对样品进行微区的衍射分析时，需要在样品上放置光阑来限定微区。但是，由于待分析的微区仅有微米量级，要制造出如此小尺寸的光阑在技术上是很困难的，因此将选区光阑放在物镜的像平面上。这样放置和在样品上直接放置光阑是等效的，而光阑可以做得大一些，因此对这个微区进行衍射，叫作选区衍射。比如，当物镜放大倍数是50倍，则一个直径等于50 μm的光阑孔就可以选择样品上直径为1 m的区域。 （5）投影镜 投影镜的作用是把中间镜的像（显微图像或电子衍射花样）作为物进一步放大，并投景到荧光屏上。和物镜一样，也是一个短焦距的强磁透镜。投影镜的激磁电流是固定的，因为成像电子束进人投影镜时孔径半角很小，因此其景深和焦距都非常大。即使改变中间镜的大倍数，使显微镜的总放大倍数有很大的变化，也不会影响图像的清晰度。有时，中间镜像平面还会出现一定的位移，由于这个位移距离仍处于投影镜的景深范围之内，因此，在光屏上的图像仍旧是清晰的。 目前，高性能的透射电子显微镜大都采用5级以上透镜放大，即有两级甚至三级中间和两级投影镜。对于极低倍数的成像，则不用物镜，直接用中间镜和投影镜成像。 3.3.1.3 观察记录系统 目前，比较常用的观察和记录装置包括荧光屏、照相底片和CCD照相机。在荧光屏面放置可以自动换片的照相暗盒。照相时只要把荧光屏掀往一侧并竖起，电子束即可使照底片曝光。由于透射电子显微镜的焦长很大，显然荧光屏和底片之间有数厘米的间距，但仍能得到清晰的图像。 通常采用在暗室操作情况下人眼较敏感的、发绿光的荧光物质来涂制荧光屏。这样有利于高放大倍数、低亮度图像的聚焦和观察。电子感光片是一种以对电子束曝光敏感、颗粒度很小的溴化物乳胶底片，它对红光不敏感。由于电子和乳胶相互作用比光子强得多，照相曝光时间很短，只需几秒钟。早期的电子显微镜用手动快门，构造简单，但曝光不均匀。新型电子显微镜采用电磁快门，与荧光屏动作密切配合，动作迅速，曝光色彩夺目、均匀；有的还有自动曝光装置，根据荧光屏上图像的亮度，自动确定曝光所需的时间。 如果配上适当的电子电路，还可以实现拍片自动记数。近年来新式的透射电镜一般都配有CCD相机，可以直接把电镜中看到的图像采集，在计算机中实现图像处理分析、数据管理和报告打印等多种功能。如图像的亮度或衬度调节、图像的非均匀亮度调节、图像粘贴和测量等。 电子显微镜工作时，整个电子通道必须置于真空系统中。新式的电子显微镜中电子枪镜筒和照相机之间都装有气阀，各部分都可以单独地抽真空和单独放气，因此，在更换灯丝、清洗镜筒和更换底片时，可不破坏其他部分的真空状态。 3.3.2 工作原理 TEM是利用透过样品的透射电子成像的，电子枪发射出电子射线经透射系统照射在样品上，电子束与样品相互作用后，当电子射线在样品另一方重新出现时，已带有样品内的信息，然后进行放大处理而成像，最终在荧光屏上形成带有样品信息的图像，使人眼能够识别。 透射电镜的成像原理可分为三种情况： （1）吸收像。射到质量、密度大的样品时，主要的成像作用是散射作用。样品上质量厚度大的地方对电子的散射角大，通过的电子较少，像的亮度较暗。早期的透射电子显微镜都是基于这一原理。 （2）衍射像。电子束被样品衍射后，样品不同位置的衍射波振幅分布对应于样品中晶体各部分不同的衍射能力，当出现晶体缺陷时，缺陷部分的衍射能力与完整区域不同，从而使行射的振幅分布不均匀，反映出晶体缺陷的分布。 （3）相位像。当样品薄至100 nm以下时，电子可以透过样品，波的振幅变化可以忽略，成像来自于相位的变化。 当电子经样品散射后，相对光轴以同一角度进入物镜的电子，在物镜后焦面上聚焦在一个点上。散射角越大，聚焦点离轴越远，如果样品是一个晶体，在后焦面上出现的是一幅衍射图样。与短晶面间距（或者说“高空间频率”）对应的衍射束被聚焦在离轴较远处。在后焦面上设有一个光阑，它截取那一部分电子对反差和分辨本领有直接的影响。如果光阑太小，把需要的高空间频率部分截去，那么和细微结构对应的高分辨信息就丢失了。 样品上厚的部分或重元素多的部分对电子散射的几率大。透过这些部分的电子在后焦面上分布在轴外的多。用光阑截去部分散射电子会使“质量厚度”大的部位在像中显得暗。这种反差可以人为地造成，如生物样品中用重元素染色，在材料表面的复型膜上从一个方向喷镀一层金属，造成阴阳面等。TEM反差的形成有以下3种方式 （1）振幅反差 当一定能量入射到样品，由于受到样品中原子的核和核外电子的静电场的作用，使电子动方向和速度发生变化称为电子散射。电子散射产生的振幅反差，是TEM最重要的成像制。 透镜图像的振幅反差是通过光阑吸收散射电子而形成的。振幅反差的大小取决于直接透射电子数量与弹性散射电子数量的比例。当入射电子照射样品，透过样品散射电子数总量，样品的厚度成正比。此外，样品密度越大电子散射的几率也越大。质量密度与厚度的乘积种为质量厚度，因此，振幅反差主要决定于样品各部分质量厚度的差异。当电子束投射到样品时，可随组织构成成分的密度不同而发生相应的电子发射量，如电子束投射到质量大的结构时，电子散射量大，其中大多数为大角度散射弹性电子，其角度为0.01~0.1 rad，但被物镜面的光阑挡掉散射电子，使该处的电流密度减少，形成图像的暗区，投射到荧光上的电子少而呈暗像，电子照片上则呈黑色，此现象称为电子密度高（electron dense）。反之当入射电子穿透样品质量厚度小的部位，直接透射以及小角度散射电子构成图像的亮区，则为电子密度低（electron lucent）。显然，样品各部分质量厚度差异越大，图像的振幅反差越强。此外，由于物镜存在球差，使散射电子轨迹受到很大影响，它们不会会聚到与物点相对应的同一高斯像点处，只能作为图像背景，弥散在各处。因此，在观察厚切片时，既使不加物镜光阑，图像也有一定的反差，但对于非常薄的切片来讲，几平没有反差。一般来说，对于样品的结构细节大小超过0.1~0.15 μm，厚度大于10 μm的样品，其反差主要是由振幅反差提供。 （2）相位反差 相位反差是在接近于正焦点附近很小的范围内产生的，它与物镜光阑是否存在无关，与加速电压以及样品的原子序数关系也不大。相位反差只能在最大的放大倍数和最高分辨率的条件下才能像平面观察到，对于低原子序数样品的细微结构，相位反差几乎是反差的唯一来源。对于微细结构小于0.15 μm、厚度小于10 μm的成像，特别是由轻元素构成的细微结构的图像，由于透射电子中弹性散射电子比例很少，而且散射角度也较小，都能通过光阑，因此不能获得振幅反差，图像的反差主要是由相位反差提供。从电子波的波动性分析，电子波穿透样品后成为透射波和散射波，其透射波的波长与入射电子波的波长相等，散射波由于入射电子通过样品时损失部分能量，使散射波波长发生变化。如图3.3.6所示，透射波（AB）与散射波（BC）之间存在一定的相位差。在理想透镜正聚焦时，二波（AB、BC）之间的相位差为90°，其合成波AC的振幅与透射波AB的差别很小（AC ≈ AB），几乎没有反差（图3.3.6a）。如果适当离焦，二波（AB、BC）之间的相位变化造成合成波（AC）的振幅与透射波（AB）的振幅的差异明显加大，合成波大于或小于透射波，形成一定的振幅差（图3.3.6b）。根据样品各部分透射波的强弱不同，使图像出现亮暗不同的区域，这种反差称为相位反差。 图3.3.6 相位反差 （3）衍射反差 衍射反差虽然可以加强图像的反差，但像的分辨率将下降。晶体样品图像反差的形成是由衍射效应产生的，晶体的原子是按周期性晶格排列，当入射电子波以一定角度照射晶体时，与晶体原子发生碰撞，若晶体结构满足下列条件： mathrm{2d}mathrm{sin}{mathrm{theta}}mathrm{ = nlambda} 式中：d——晶体原子之间的间距； θ——入射波角度； n——整数0，1，2，3...... λ——入射波波长。 则会在一定方向上产生很强的衍射波，称为布拉格衍射（Bragg diffraction）。它使直接透射的部分电子束强度分布产生变化。如果物镜光阑把衍射束挡住，只让透射束通过而形成的图像反差，称为衍射反差。此时，像是明场像，晶体中的强衍射区对应像的亮区，背景是暗的。若晶体产生的衍射束未被光阑挡住，而透射束被挡住，则形成暗场像。因此在一个均匀多晶体样品中，当同一电子束照射下，由于它们相对于入射电子波的取向不同，不同的晶粒呈现亮暗不同的颗粒，有的成为明场像，有的成为暗场像。在改变样品倾斜角度时，图像的明暗场像也随之变化。 衍射反差主要是用来研究晶体样品中的缺陷，而对原子尺度的研究，不能用衔射像来直接解释，必须连同电子衍射图一起对衍射反差像进行分析。 （4）离焦反差 离焦反差主要由散射电子波和直射电子波相互干涉而形成的。在电镜观察样品时，样品质量厚度迅速改变区域所对应的图像上会出现费涅尔衍射环。当物镜过焦时，费涅尔条纹呈暗线，欠焦时则呈现亮线，在正焦时，费涅尔条纹消失。由于离焦产生衍射环引起图像反差的增加，这种反差称为离焦反差。 3.3.3 主要性能 TEM主要性能指标通过常有三个：分辨本领、放大倍数和加速电压。 （1）分辨本领。显微镜的分辨本领是表示用显微镜来观察物体细微结构的能力，它是由显微镜能清楚分辨开被观察物体中两个细节间的最小距离来定义的。这个最小距离越小，分辨本领高。现今1000 kV透射电子显微镜的分辨本领可达0.2~0.3 nm。很显然分辨本领一方面取决于仪器本身的性能，如物镜的球差、衍射像差、色差、像散等因素；另一方面与被观察物体的材料性质、细节的形状、位置及衬度条件诸因素有关。甚至与检测人对最小距离的判别和测量有关。总之分本领是显微镜的最重要指标，也是一个不容易严格定义和测定的指标。 （2）放大倍数。透射电子显微镜的放大倍数是指横向放大倍数，它是成像系统中各级电磁透镜电子放大信数之乘积。每一级电磁透镜的放大倍数M定义为该透成像的像距b和距a的比值M = b/a，显然像距与物距取决于透镜的焦距f，即1/f = 1/a+1/b，而磁透镜的焦距f是透镜激励电流I和加速电压V的非线性函数f（V/I），因而改变电流就可以满足成像关系获得清楚的聚焦图像。现代透射电子显微镜的放大倍数从几十倍到几十万倍可连续改变，这是一般光学显微镜办不到的。由于电子显微镜分辨本领很高，即使放大几十万倍以后获得的照片还可以进一步用光学放大而得到几百万倍的图像透射电子显微镜的放大倍数将随样品平面高度、加速电压、透镜电流而变化。为了保持仪器放大倍数的精度，必须定期进行标定。 （3）加速电压。电子显微镜的加速电压决定电子的能量，电子能量越高、波长越短，电子显微镜的分辨本领越高。加速电压增加，电子穿透能力更强，可以观察更厚的样品。同时电子枪亮度增加，荧光屏发光强度也增强。因此透射电子显微镜通常都工作在50~200 kV。工作电压在500 kV以上的属于超高压电子显微镜。目前世界上超高压电子显微镜的加速电压高达3000 kV。 3.3.4 主要特点 电镜最突出的优越性主要表现在具有很高的分辨本领，最高分辨率达到001~0.02 nm；已达到原子水平，而且放大倍数高达100万倍放大倍数从几十倍到几于万可连续变倍，适用于各种研究样品的需要，在生物学和材料学纳米级的研究领域中是其他仪器所无法取代的，但透射电镜也有它的局限性和特殊要求，其表现如下： （1）由于样品制备技术的限制，对大多数生物样品来说，一般只能达到2 nm的分辨水平。 （2）电镜图像的分辨能力不仅取决于电镜本身的分辨率，而且也取决于样品结构的反差。 （3）电镜所用的光源是电子波，波长在非可见光范围内无颜色反应，所形成的图像是黑白图像，要求图像必须具有一定的反差。 （4）生物体组织和细胞成分主要由C、H、O、N等轻元素组成，它们的原子序数较低，电子像散射能力弱，相互之间的差别又很小，电镜下的图像反差一般偏低。 （5）由于电子束的穿透能力较弱，样品必须制成超薄切片。生物切片上可获得的分辨率般是切片厚度的1/10，也就是说，切片厚度为50~100 nm，其切片上的分率为5~10 nm。由此可见，虽然电镜的分辨率很高，生物样品制样技术限制了电镜性能的发挥。一般要求切片厚度为 50~70 nm。 （6）观察面小，载网直径为3 mm，超薄切片范围为 0.3~0.8 mm。 （7）电子束的强烈照射易损伤样品，发生变形、升华等，甚至被击穿破裂，可能使观察结果产生假象。 （8）观察时电镜镜筒必须保持真空，为了保证样品在真空下不损伤，对样品要求应无水分。因此，不能观察活体的生物样本。 （9）生物制样复杂，在步骤繁多的制样过程中，样品容易产生收缩、膨胀、破碎以及内含物丢失等结构改变。 3.3.5 样品制备 （1）对试样的要求 透射电子显微镜通过让电子束（包括衍射束和透射束）透过样品，利用透过或衍射的电子束反映样品晶体结构及形貌。如需获取普通形貌相、衍射班点，样品厚度要求小于200 nm；如需获取高分辨形貌相、精细衍射花样，样品厚度一般要求小于100 nm。 （2）块体样品制备技术 1）薄膜样品制备。 薄膜样品的组织结构必须和大块样品相同，在制备过程中，这些组织结构不能发生化。样品相对于电子束必须有足够的“透明度”，因为只有样品能被电子束透过，才有可进行观察和分析。薄膜样品应有一定强度和刚度，在制备、夹持和操作过程中，在一定的机械力作用下不会引起变形或损坏。在样品制备过程中不允许表面产生氧化和腐蚀。氧化和腐蚀会使样品的透明度下降，并造成多种假象。 2）样品薄片的预先减薄。 ①从大块样品上切割厚度为0.3~0.5 mm厚的薄片。 a.电火花线切割设备——导电样品。用一根往返运动的金属丝做切割工具。以被切割样品作阳极、金属丝作阴极，两极间保持微小的距离，利用其间的火花放电进行切割。过程在冷却条件下进行 电火花切割可切下厚度小于0.5 mm的薄片，切制时损伤层比较浅，可以通过后续的制或减薄过程去除。 b.金刚石切片机——不导电样品。针对不导电样品，利用金刚石刀片旋转，切割固在夹具上的样品。为了防止样品过热，一般配有冷却液。 ②0.5mm左右薄片减薄成几十微米薄片。 a.机械减薄法通过手工研磨来完成，把切割好的薄片一面用黏结剂黏在样品座表面，然在水砂纸上研磨减薄。样品平放，不要用力太大，并使它充分冷却。压力过大和温度升商局会引起样品内部组织结构发生变化。研磨过中要反复调换研磨面，使片两面摩擦磨特以免应力不均引起样品翘曲变形。片一般研磨至50 μm左右；手工研磨时即使用力不大，薄片上的硬化层也会厚至数十个纳米。 b.化学减薄法是把切割好的金属薄片放人配制好的化学试剂中，使其表面受蚀而继续减薄。合金中各组成相的腐蚀倾向是不同的，所以在进行化学减薄时，应注意减薄液的洗择。化学减薄法的最大优点是表面没有机械硬化层，减薄后样品的厚度可以控制在20~50 μm，薄区面积大。但是，化学减薄时必须先把薄片表面充分清洗，去除污物，否则将得不到满意的结果。 ③将几十微米薄片减薄到可进行透镜观察的样品。 a.双喷电解减薄：将预减薄的样品剪成直径3 mm的圆片，装入样品夹持器中。进行减薄时，样品两个表面的中心部位各有一个电解液喷嘴。从喷嘴中喷出的液柱和阴极相接，样品和阳极相接。电解液通过一个耐酸泵进行循环，在两个喷嘴的轴线上装有一对光导纤维，其中一个光导纤维和光源相接，另一个则和光敏元件相连。如果样品经抛光后中心出现小孔，光敏元件输出的电信号就可以将抛光线路的电源切断。 用这种方法制成的薄膜样品，中心穿孔附近有一个较大的楔形薄区，可以被电子束穿透。直径3 mm圆片周边是一个厚度较大的刚性支架，可以保证样品夹持、搬运过程中不会被损坏。 b.离子减薄：是物理方法减薄，原理是利用加速的离子轰击样品表面，使表面原子飞出（溅射出），最终使样品减薄到电子束可以通过的厚度。样品放置于10-3~10-2 Pa的高真空样品室中，离子束从两侧在3~5 kV加速电压加速下轰击样品表面，样品表面相对离子束成0~30°的夹角。 离子减薄适用于矿物、陶瓷、半导体及多相合金等电解抛光所不能减薄的场合。离子减薄的效率较低，一般情况下4 μm/h 左右。但是离子减薄的质量高、薄区大。 （3）粉末样品制备技术 胶粉混合法：在干净玻璃片上滴火棉胶溶液，然后在玻璃片胶液上放少许粉末并搅匀，再将另一玻璃片压上，两玻璃片相对研并突然抽开，稍后，膜干；用刀片将膜划成小方格，将玻璃片斜插入水杯中，在水面上下空插，膜片逐渐脱落，用铜网将方形膜捞出，待观察。 粉碎和分散法：需透射电镜分析的粉末颗粒一般都小于铜网小孔，因此要先制备对电子束透明的支持膜。常用支持膜有火棉胶膜和碳膜。粉末样品制备的关键取决于能否使其均匀分散到支持膜上。将样品在玛瑙研钵中研碎，将研碎的粉末（如果样品是微细的粉末，就不用粉碎）放入与样品不发生反应的有机溶剂（例如丁醇、丙酮等）中，用超声波分散得到悬浊液，为了操作简单方便，也可以用玻璃棒搅拌。用滴管把所得的悬浊液放一滴在黏附有支持膜的铜网上，静置干燥后即可供观察。 透射电子显微镜晶体薄膜样品制备看似是一个简单的操作，其实不然，它的每一个操作环节需考虑是否影响材料本身的结构特征，需要深入理解工艺对材料结构特征的影响规律，必须注重细节，精益求精。 3.3.6 主要应用 （1）形貌分析 由于透射电镜具有较扫面电镜更高的分辨率，因此非常适合用来进一步观察材料的形貌。如图3.3.7所示，合成出的PtPdCu海绵展现出明显的分形结构，由一根主干和许多分枝组成，而分枝又是由更小的主干和分枝组成，如同一棵具有多级分枝的树。树枝由许多小的纳米颗粒组成，它们融合在一起，形成一个相互连接的多孔体系。此外，PtPdCu海绵还具分级孔结构，主干的孔径和孔壁尺寸都要明显大于分枝的孔径和孔壁尺寸。能谱则进一步揭示了PtPdCu海绵具有合金结构。 图3.3.7 分形金属纳米海绵的形貌表征 （2）高分辨像 图3.2.6所示为碳纳米管上负载金属纳米颗粒的SEM照片，图上很好地呈现出碳纳米管的一维形貌，其直径约100 nm；大量的金属纳米颗粒均匀地负载在碳纳米管上，其尺寸约为几个纳米。在多相结构材料中，特别是在某些共晶材料复合材料的显微组织分析方面，可以借助于扫描电镜景深大的特点，较好地呈现材料的组织形貌和结构。 图3.2.6 碳纳米管负载的金属纳米颗粒 （3）电子衍射 透射电子显微镜可以将产生的电子衍射束聚焦放大投影到荧光屏或照相底板上，形成规则排列的斑点或线条，这种图形就是电子衍射谱。弹性相干散射是电子束在晶体中产生衍射现象的基础。需要提醒的是，弹性相干散射是指晶体中原子位置的相干性，而非电子源本身的相于性，因而电子衍射谱反映晶体内部的结构和原子排布情况。 虽然电子衍射和X射线衍射均可用于分析晶体结构，但是两种方法存在异同点。相同点主要表现在以下几个方面： ①电子衍射的原理和X射线衍射相似，满足布拉格方程且不产生消光时才会发生衍射。 ②如果将所得衍射花样以底片的形式呈现，则两种衍射方法所得到的衍射花样在几何特征上也大致相似。 ③两种衍射花样的标定原理相同，并且使用相同的衍射卡片库。 由于电子波与X射线相比有其本身的特性，因此电子衍射和X射线衍射相比较时，具有下列不同之处： ①电子衍射是电子受到在空间上周期性变化势场的散射，与样品的相互作用往往比X射线衍射与样品作用要强烈一些，往往不止发生一次散射；X射线是与核外电子发生作用，与核外的电子分布情况相关。 ②电子束的波长要比X射线短得多，在同样满足布拉格条件时，它的射角θ很小，约为10-2 rad；而X射线产生衍射时，其衍射角最大可接近π/2。 ③由于电子的散射强度很高，导致电子束的透射能力有限，因此透射电镜要求试样做成薄膜状，这样使试样制备远比X射线衍射样品制备要复杂得多。 ④电子衍射操作时采用薄膜样品，由于样品的尺寸效应，薄膜样品的倒易阵点并不一个圆点，而会沿着样品厚度方向延伸成杆状，因而，增加了倒易阵点和爱瓦尔德球相菇的机会，结果使略微偏离布拉格条件的电子束也能发生衍射。 ⑤由于电子波的波长短，采用爱瓦尔德球图解时，反射球的半径很大，在衍射角θ较小的范围内反射球的球面可以近似地看成是一个平面，从而也可以认为电子衍射产生的标斑点大致分布在一个二维倒易截面内。因此，衍射花样可以比较直观地反映晶体的结构晶面位向，使晶体结构的研究比X射线更有优势。 ⑥原子对电子的散射能力远高于它对X 射线的散射能力（约高出四个数量级），故电子衍射束的强度较大，摄取衍射花样时曝光时间仅需数秒钟。并且有时电子衍射的强度几透射束相当，致使两者间会产生交互作用，从而使电子衍射花样的强度分析变得复杂，不像X射线衍射那样可以通过衍射强度来对物相进行定量计算、原位分析等。 3.4 原子力显微镜 3.4.1 工作原理 原子力是一种表面力，主要包括范德华力、静电力、磁力等。利用隧道电流、光束偏转或压敏电阻等方法，可以检测到微细针尖与物体之间的原子力，形成待测物体的表面形貌像，也可以用于检测微纳材料的力学性能及进行微纳结构加工。 原子力显微镜的原理建立在探针尖端的原子与样品表面原子在足够接近时存在相互作用力的基础之上。探针被装在一个小小的弹力臂的端头上，探针尖端上的原子与样品表面的相互作用力与两者的间距具有密切联系，如图3.4.1所示。当间隙大时，不存在作用力；在间隙逐渐缩小过程中，将出现引力（FW），主要有范德华力、毛细作用力、磁力和静电力。引力随着间隙缩小而增大，继续缩小间隙，探针针尖和样品原子外围电子将出现斥力（FR），主要有键结力和静电相互排斥力。斥力随距离减小的增速比引力快得多，在间隙缩小过程中将很快由相吸转向相斥。引力和斥力的合力称为雷纳德琼斯相互作用势（Lennard-Jones potential），可以表示为： F_A=F_R+F_W=frac{A}{r^m}-frac{B}{r^n} 式中，r为针尖原子与样品表面的最小距离；A、B、m、n针对不同的模型，可以是不同的常数。 图3.4.1 探针/样品间作用力与距离的关系 AFM针尖装在一个一端固定的弹性微悬臂上，弹性微悬臂对微弱力极为敏感，当样品或针尖轻轻接触时，针尖与样品表面原子之间的相互作用力就会引起微悬臂发生微小的弹性形变，也就是说微悬臂的形变可作为样品-针尖相互作用力的直接度量。 当一束激光照射到微悬臂的背面，微悬臂将激光束反射到一个光电检测器，检测器不同象限接收到的激光强度差值同微悬臂的形变量会形成一定比例关系,比如当微悬臂的形变约为0.01 nm，激光束反射到光电检测器后，则可放大为 3~10 nm的位移，产生可测量的电压差。反馈系统根据检测器电压的变化不断调整针尖或样品Z轴方向的位置，保持微悬臂的变形量不变，即保持针尖-样品间作用力恒定不变，针尖就会随表面的起伏上下移动，通过测量检测器相应的电压变化以对应样品扫描位置的变化，可获得针尖上下运动的轨迹，即可以记录样品的表面形貌特征。这种检测方式被称为“恒力”模式，是使用最广泛的扫描方式。AFM探针因其结构、材料等不同，弹簧常数范围宽至0.01~500 N/m，针尖尖端的曲率半径可小至1 nm，通常为10 nm，也可以通过镶嵌微球达到pm的量级。不同种类的探针可适用于不同的材料和需求，这拓宽了AFM的使用范围。 3.4.2 工作模式 AFM工作主要有成像模式和力曲线模式。成像模式又分为接触式、非接触式和轻敲式；力曲线模式有接触力曲线、轻敲力曲线和力分布成像。工作中可以根据样品表面不同的结构特征、材料的特性以及实验目的，选择合适的操作模式。 3.4.2.1 成像模式 （1）接触成像模式 接触成像模式针尖始终和样品接触，以恒高或恒力的模式扫描扫描过程中，针尖在表面滑动，形成稳定的高分辨图像。这种模式不适用于低弹性模量和易变形材料。 在大气环境中，由于毛细作用的存在，针尖和样品之间存在较大的黏滞力，横向扫描时施加在样品上的额外作用力可能会造成样品的损伤，黏滞力同时增大针尖和样品的接触面积，降低成像的分辨率。解决的办法是，由于表面自由能越大黏滞力越强，因此可以通过AFM针尖对表面进行修饰，在针尖上涂覆低表面能材料，或者将针尖浸人液体等，可以克服毛细作用带来的影响，有效提高成像分辨率。 如果在上面过程中微悬臂的分析和快速扫描的方向垂直，则针尖除了可以探测到与样品之间的垂直方向的原子力，还会由于针尖与样品之间的摩擦力使得微悬臂横向扭转，这样就可以研究样品表面的微区摩擦性质。横向力测量已经被广泛应用于多组分材料表面的摩擦性质。 （2）非接触成像模式 非接触成像模式中针尖在样品表面上方振动，始终不与样品接触。针尖测器检测到的是范德华力和静电力等对样品没有破坏的长程作用力，灵敏度较高。但是当针尖和样品距离较长时，成像分辨率较低，不适用于在液体中成像。 （3）轻敲模式 在轻敲模式中，微悬臂在其共振模式附近做受迫振动。振动的针尖轻敲表面，间断地和表面接触。由于接触时间非常短，针尖与样品的相互作用很小，通常为1皮牛顿~1纳牛顿，前切力引起的分率降低和对样品的破坏几乎消失，所以适合用于生物和聚合物等软物体的成像研究。 轻敲模式AFM在大气和液态环境下都可以实现。在大气环境中，当针尖与样品不接触时，微悬臂以最大振幅自由振荡。当针尖与样品表面接触时，尽管压电陶瓷片以同样的能量激发微悬臂振荡，但空间阻隔作用使微悬臂的振幅减小。反馈系统控制微悬臂的振幅恒定，针尖就跟随表面的起伏，上下移动获得表面形貌信息。轻敲模式同样适合在液态中操作，而且由于液态的阻尼作用，针尖与样品的剪切力更小，对样品的损伤也更小，所以液体中轻敲成像模式可以实现溶液反应的原位观察和活体生物检测。 轻敲模式还有一个重要应用，即相位成像。通过测定扫描过程中微悬臂的振荡相位和压电陶瓷驱动信号的振荡相位之间的差值，研究材料的力学性质和表面性质。如样品表面的摩擦、材料的滞弹性和黏附性质等;还可以对材料表面的不同组分进行化学识别。 轻敲模式一般采用调制横向振幅恒定的方法进行恒力模式的扫描，也可以采用频率调行化学识别。制技术，测量扫描过程中频率的变化。这种频率调制AFM的力检测方式，大幅度提高了噪声处理率和灵敏度，可以获得原子级分辨率的图像。 3.4.2.2 力曲线模式 针尖和样品之间的相互作用力与距离的关系称为“力曲线”，是实现AFM观察的重要特性曲线。 （1）接触力曲线 在接触模式的力曲线测量中，压电陶瓷置于当前扫描区域（x, y）的中心位置，停止扫描，仅在2方向施加周期性三角波电压信号，使样品周期性地与针尖接近一接触一离开。AFM的光学系统实时记录微悬臂的变形量并对压电陶瓷管的位移量作图。力曲线中微悬臂的弯曲与其力学常效的乘积即为针尖与样品之间的作用力。 力曲线一般分为非接触区、接触区和黏滞区3个区域。在非接触区，针尖离开样品较远，它们之间的作用力可以忽略不计，微悬臂不发生弯曲，力曲线为水平直线。针尖接近样品，它们之间的范德华力使微悬臂向样品表面弯曲。当二者接近到某一点时，它们之间的引力随距离变化的斜率超过了微悬臂的弹性常数，由于机械不稳定性，二者会突然接触到一起，称之为突触点，在接触区样品和针尖相互接触而共同移动。如果针尖和样品在接触时都没有发生弹性或塑性变形，样品所走过的距离与微悬臂的弯曲量相同。当样品走至某一预设位置时向相反方向移动，微悬臂的弯曲随之逐渐减小。但是由于针尖与样品间的黏附作用，二者仍粘在一起。随着样品继续向远离针尖方向移动，微悬臂由背向样品弯曲变为面向样品弯曲，这一区为力曲线的第三区——黏滞区。当微悬臂积蓄的弹力超过二者之间的黏滞力时，针尖突然与样品离开，微悬臂恢复非弯曲状态，力曲线又重新进入非接触区，该位置称为“崩离点”(pull off point)。 检测AFM力曲线上针尖与样品接触区斜率的变化，可以得出纳米尺度上力学性能对于刚性样品，针尖与样品接触以后，样品走过的距离与AFM微悬臂的弯曲量相等，力曲线斜率为1。对于塑性样品，针尖有可能插入样品内部，微悬臂的弯曲量小于样品走过的距离，其斜率小于 1。利用这种性质，可以研究表面硬度及其抗磨损能力。有力曲线在接触外界压力后的那部分曲线的斜率，可以对弹性模量、杨氏模量等进行精确确定，根据表面黏滞力的大小还可以解析出样品的某些表面性质，而有非接触区的黏滞区情况可以估计力曲线测定所在介质的黏滞力等参数。 （2）轻敲式力曲线 除接触式力曲线外还有轻式力曲线和力分布成像。轻敲力曲线是使针尖反复接近—接触—远离样品，记录振荡的微悬臂的振幅、相位或变形量并对压电陶瓷位移量作图。其相位—频率图可以更为准确地表征样品的硬度、黏弹性等力学性能。力分布成像是以接触或轻敲模式，在（x, y）扫描区域内，对每一位置都进行力曲线测量，将作用力对x轴和y轴作图，得到力分布图，选择不同的模式可以观察到静电力或长程磁力。 3.4.3 试样制备 AFM的样品制备简单。纳米粉体材料应尽量以单层或亚单层形式分散并固定在基片上。选择合适的溶剂和分散剂将粉体材料制成稀溶液，必要时可采用超声分散以减少纳米粒子的聚集。根据纳米粒子的亲疏水特性、表面化学特性等选择合适的基片，常用云母、热解石墨（HOPC）、单晶硅片、玻璃、石英等。研究粉体材料的尺寸、形状等性质，应尽量选取表面原子级平整的云母、HOPC等作为基片；样品尽量牢固地固定在基片上。纳米薄膜材料如金属或金属氧化物薄膜、高聚物薄膜、有机与无机复合薄膜、自组装单分子膜等，一般都有基片的支持，可以直接用于AFM研究。 3.4.4 伪迹分析 同其他成像方法一样，扫描探针显微镜也不可避免地会出现一定程度的伪迹（亦称假象）。所谓伪迹，是指图像中出现的与试样固有结构完全无关的或者歪曲了其真实结构的图像。伪迹的产生通常来源于仪器操作者的经验缺乏，也可能是没有选择最佳的成像参数，这些参数包括设定力的大小、扫描速率和增益等。仪器本身的缺陷和仪器零部件的不完善，如针尖的磨损和污染等，也是假象产生的重要来源。测量误差主要是指仪器本身因素导致的测量误差。 3.4.4.1 探针针尖导致的伪迹和误差 使用原子力显微镜测量的图像总是探针几何形状和被成像的特征形状的卷积。如果探针针尖尺寸远小于被测量图像的特征，则探针产生的伪像将是最小的，并且从图像导出的尺寸测量将是准确的。选择合理的探针，可以有效避免探针产生伪影，例如，如果被测样品具有在100 nm范围内的特征尺寸，则直径不大于10 nm的探针将足以获得没有伪像的良好图像。在一些情况下，即使探针尺寸大于样品的特征尺寸，仍然可能从图像获得准确的结构信息。常见的针尖导致的伪迹和误差有： （1）探针对图像形貌的放大效应 在测试碳纳米管、纳米球等样品时经常会发现，通过AFM获得的高度数据是正确的，而其宽度比预测的大，这是由于探针尺寸引起的样品表面形貌的放大效应，如图3.4.2示。当探针尺寸与被测物体相当时，其针尖尺寸不可忽略，在计算样品宽度时，应排除探针针尖尺寸的影响。 图3.4.2 探针引起的图像放大效应示意图 （2）探针对图像形貌的缩小效应 当探针扫描狭缝等表面较低的样品形貌时，获得的尺寸往往会比预想的要小。这是因为获得的线性轮廓是由探针的几何形状而不是试样表面的几何形状决定的，如图3.4.3所示。此时仍然可以从获得的图像测量孔的开口，此外，可以使用不接触到正被测试的狭缝底部的探针来精确地测量重复图案的间距。 图3.4.3 探针引起的图像缩小效应示意图 （3）探针导致的奇怪形貌 如果在测量图像之前探针针尖碎裂或者被污染，可能观察到难以解释的奇怪形状。例如，当探针针尖被污染或者损伤时，由此可能产生无数个针尖，导致图像中出现重复的奇怪形状。多针尖效应一般表现为重复出现的特殊形貌，在形貌结校较复杂的试样中很难判断，因此，分析人员在观测图像时应十分小心，留意图像中是否有不合理重复出现的结构单元像。 3.4.4.2 扫描器导致的伪迹和误差 原子力显微镜中在x、y和z方向上移动探针的扫描器通常由压电陶瓷制成。压电陶瓷能够移动探针非常小的距离，然而，当线性伏安法应用于压电陶瓷时，陶瓷以非线性运动移动。此外，压电陶瓷还表现出由自加热引起的迟滞效应，由于扫描器的几何形状，也可能将伪像引人图像中。扫描器导致的伪迹和误差主要有： （1）x-y轴以及z轴方向上的校准以及线性 所有原子力显微镜必须在x-y轴上校准，以使计算机屏幕上是现的图像准确，扫描仪的运动也必须是线性的，使得由图像测量的距离准确。没有校正后的图像上的特征，通常在图像的一侧比在另一侧上更小。扫描器被正确地线性化后，扫描器是否被校准很重要，例如，扫描器可以是线性但不是校准的。如果校准不正确，则线轮廓测量的x-y值也不准确。 AFM中的高度测量要求显微镜的z轴上的压电陶瓷是线性的并且已被校准，通常显微镜只在一个高度校准。然而，如果测量的z高度和实际z高度之间的关系呈非线性，则高度测量有误。如图3.4.4所示，表示AFM中实际高度和测量z高度之间的关系。AFM常只测量一个校准点，如图中灰色圆圈所示，并且假设陶瓷是线性的，如直线所示。然而，通常情况下，压电陶瓷是非线性的，如曲线所示。在这种情况下，使用AFM将获得不正确的之高度，除非被测量的试样数据接近校准测量值。 压电陶瓷中的滞后会导致悬臂以垂直运动移动到表面的边缘时过冲。该问题最常见于观察硅片、光盘等图案化的样品时或测试薄膜样品的边缘时，如图3.4.5所示。该效果可以使图像在视觉上更好，因为边缘看起来更清晰，但是获得的结构线轮廓有误。 图3.4.4 AFM中实际z高度与测量z高度之间的关系 图3.4.5 AFM中实际z高度与测量z高度之间的关系 （2）扫描器漂移 AFM图像中的漂移可能归因于压电扫描器中的蠕变，也可能因为AFM容易受到外界温度变化的影响。最常见类型的漂移发生在图像扫描的开始处。此伪影导致扫描范围的初始部分出现失真，经常表现为在扫描起始处图像的扭曲。因此在扫描原子分子尺度的高分辨成像时，常常需要开机等待一段时间才开始测量，以使系统达到稳定状态停止漂移。在使用液体池在液态环境下测量和使用加热或冷却的装置时，尤其要留意漂移对结果的影响。 3.4.4.3 其他因素的影响 除了探针、扫描器的影响，其他因素也可能导致图像的伪迹以及误差。常见的有： （1）光学干涉条纹 对附着在诸如硅片之类光滑表面的试样进行AFM测试时，往往在图像中出现周期性花样，通常间隔为1.5~2.5 μm，这是由于来源于试样表面和悬臂表面的两束光发生干涉而引起的。如果激光没有完全聚焦于探针悬臂表面，就会有部分光束溢出入射到样品表面，高反射率的试样如硅片、金等能将这些溢出的光反射向检测器。由于激光是相干光源，因而从悬臂反射的光束和从试样反射的光束相遇后会发生干涉，产生明暗相间的干涉条纹，解决办法是正确地聚焦激光或者稍微调整聚焦点在悬臂上的位置。近年来，使用低相干的SLD光源替代传统光源或者在探针背面镀金、铝的涂层增强探针的反射信号以降低干涉效应。 （2）温度、湿度等因素的影响 如前所述，温度改变可能导致扫描仪出现漂移，导致伪迹的出现。而温度、湿度也会影响探针和样品间相互作用，尤其是在湿度较大地区对于一些易吸水样品，样品与探针间可能有一层水膜，进而影响AFM测试结果。在进行扫描速率较慢的AFM测试时，在开着空调的房间可能观察到与光学干涉条纹类似的横向条纹，这是由于空调工作或未工作时，室内温度、湿度改变而导致的结果。因此为了获得高质量AFM图像，应尽量保持室内温度和湿度的恒定。 （3）振动的影响 由于AFM的主要功能建立于对悬臂梁的微小偏移的高度敏感性上，任何影响悬臂的振动都可能在图像中产生伪迹。典型的振动伪迹是震荡样花样，声音和地面震动都能在AFM操作中表现出来并产生图像伪迹。建筑物的地面垂直震动常有几个微米的振幅，频率低于5 Hz，这种振动若未经过适当的隔离，就可能导致图像中的周期性结构花样。室内人们的大声讲话声，飞机飞越建筑物的声音甚至关闭门窗的声音都有可能在图像中出现伪迹。 3.4.5 主要应用 3.4.5.1 表面形貌观察 AFM分析Si单晶表面获得巨大成功。关于单晶Si的表面形貌，Takayanagi提出(111)表面7×7结构，其基本单元由两个三角形胞，内含12个原子构成。原子力显微镜可以得到清晰图像，并测量出原子尺寸。图3.4.6是Si晶体(111)面的原子像，构成虚线四边形的12个原子即为7×7结构。沿图中虚线直线进行测量、得到S 原子的横向和高度寸，示于图3.4.7。在扫描方向的界面处每一个原子都有两个峰，这是由于针尖类端原子的两个悬挂键与当表面原子的悬挂键形成了两个共价键。这种频调制的AFM的力检测方式大大降低噪声并提高了灵敏度、信噪比的增加使图像反养和分辨率都大幅度提高。AFM在3个维度上可以检测纳米粒子乃至原子的大小尺寸，纵向分辨率可以达到0.01 nm。 图3.4.6 单晶硅（111）表面7×7结构的AFM像 图3.4.7 单晶硅（111）表面7×7结构的尺寸 3.4.5.2 微纳测量 碳纳米管由于尺寸太小，无法应用传统强度测量技术进行测量。图3.4.8是一个新颖的实验，使用位于扫描电子显微镜内的“纳米应力台”，用双AFM尖端来对纳采管施加拉伸载荷、测量单个多层纳米管的拉伸强度。 图3.4.8 AFM-AFM联用测量纳米管强度 拉伸实验是在SEM内进行和观察的。由AFM尖端测量施加的应力，拉伸距离由SEM图像测量。观察表明，纳米管通常在最外层发生断，该层的拉伸强度范围为11~63 GPa。对单个多层纳米管的应力-应变曲线分析表明，最外层的杨氏模量E为270~950 GPa。用TEM检测断裂的纳米管碎片，观察到波浪花样和局域径向塌陷等多种结构。应用类似的方法，可以测量纳米线、纳米管的弹性模量和强度。图3.4.9是测量纳米弹簧弹性模量的SEM像。在SEM的样品室中装载微型AFM，测量在SEM观察中进行SEM像中，确定图？？中箭头所指两点间的距离为原始长度，随着针尖移动弹簧拉伸，记录针尖感知的纳米线弹簧的作用力，从SEM像中测量不同应力下纳米弹簧原始长度的伸长量，通过应力—应变曲线分析，可以有效地测量出纳米弹簧的弹性模量。

microscope，TEM）和原子力显微镜（atomic force microscope，AFM）在材料分析中应用广泛，其涉及的基本原理和基本构件是电子显微分析和其他分析方法的基础。本章将简要介绍其基本原理和一般应用。 3.1.1 电镜发展简介 1665年，Robert Hooke发明了第一台光学显微镜，并用它首次察到软木塞的细胞。后来Leeuwenhoek改进了这台仪器，用它观察到藻类细胞、鱼的血红细胞等单细胞，从此揭开了显微技术的序幕。到1898年，光学显微镜经历了230多年的改进，已经达到非常完善的程度。从分辨率来讲，它已经达到了极限分辨率，已接近它的理论极限，即200 nm。但是，自然界有些物质的微观结构非常小，其大小只能用微米或纳米来表示，如病毒、物质的分子、原子等。为了提高光学显微镜的分辨率，科学家们做了大量的研究，但是再也无法提高光镜的分辨本领。 1924年，法国科学家De Broglie证明任何粒子在高速运动的时候都会发射一定波长的电磁辐射，其辐射波的波长与粒子的质量和运动速度成反比。这种随加速电压改变的电子波长叫做德布罗利波，这为电镜的研制打下了基础。但仅有电子流辐射波还不行，因为并没有解决电子流聚焦成像的问题。1926年德国科学家Garbor和Busch发现用铁壳封闭的铜线圈对电子流能磁聚焦，即可以作为电子束的透镜。上述两个重大发现为电镜的研制提供了重要的理论基础。德国科学家Ruska和Knoll在前面两个发现的基础上，经过了几年的努力，终于在1932制造出了第一台电子显微镜。尽管它十分粗糙，分辨率也很低，但它却证实了上述两个理论的实用价值。经过改造，1933年研制的电镜分辨率为50 nm，放大倍率为1.2万倍，到了1938年分辨率提高至10 nm，放大倍率为20万倍。1939年这一成果被正式交付德国西门子公司批量生产，当时生产了40台并投入国际市场。 1954年西门子公司生产ElmiskopI型TEM，分辨率为1 nm；日本TEM始于1941年分辨率为3 nm；荷兰Philips公司于1944年研制第一台TEM，后来又生产系列电镜；1946年美国开始生产电镜；我国电镜研制起步较迟，1958年在长春中国科学院光学精密机械研究所研制了第一台中型电镜，到1977年生产的TEM分辨率为0.3 nm，放大倍率为80万倍。1932年Knoll提出了SEM可成像放大的概念，并在1935年制成了极其原始的模型。1938年德国的阿登纳制成了第一台采用缩小透镜用于透射样品的SEM。由于不能获得高分辨率的样品表面电子像，SEM一直得不到发展，只能在电子探针X射线微分析仪中作为一种辅助的成像装置。此后，在许多科学家的努力下，解决了SEM从理论到仪器结构等方面的一系列问题。最早期作为商品出现的是1965年英国剑桥仪器公司生产的第一台SEM，它用次电子成像，分辨率达25 nm，使SEM进人了实用阶段。 1968年在美国芝加哥大学，Knoll成功研制了场发射电子枪，并将它应用于SEM，使之能够获得较高分辨率的扫描电子像。1970年他发表了用扫描透射电镜拍摄的铀和钍中的铀原子和钍原子像，这使SEM又进展到一个新的领域。 1982年德国物理学家Gerd Binnig与瑞士物理学家Heinrich Rohrer在瑞士苏黎世研究所工作时发明了扫描隧道显微镜，并因此共同获得了当年的诺贝尔物理奖。同年，第1台电子显微镜的发明者Ruska也获此殊荣。 1986年Binnig等发明了原子力显微镜，可以在任何环境（如液体、空气）中成像，在纳米级、分子级水平上作研究。商用产品出现在1989年。 3.1.2 电子束与物质的相互作用 当高能电子束轰击固体试样，会与样品表面的原子核及核外电子发生作用，激发出多种特征信号，包括透射电子、二次电子、背散射电子、俄歇电子、吸收电子和特征X射线等，如图3.1.1所示。通过对这些信号的接受、放大和显示成像，可以对样品表面形貌进行观察。 图3.1.1 电子束轰击固体试样激发信号 透射电子：当固体试样很薄时，入射电子的有效穿透深度大于样品厚度，那么就会有相当数量的入射电子能够穿过薄样品，成为透射电子。入射电子穿透样品的过程中将与原子核或核外电子发生有限次数的弹性或非弹性放射。弹性散射电子保持入射时的能量，是透射电子显微镜主要的成像电子，用于电子衍射分析、衍衬像分析和高分辨像分析。而非弹性散射电子能量降低，用于菊池线分析和损失谱分析。 二次电子：二次电子是指被入射电子轰击出来的核外电子。由于原子核和外层电子间的结合能很小，因此外层的电子比较容易和原子脱离。当原子的核外电子从入射电子获得了大于相应的结合能的能量后，可离开原子而变成自由电子。如果这种散射过程发生在比较接近样品表层，那些能量尚大于材料逸出功的自由电子可从样品表面逸出，变成真空中的自由电子，即二次电子。二次电子产额对试样表面状态非常敏感，能有效地显示试样表面的微观形貌。扫描电子显微镜中，主要用二次电子成表面形貌像。 背散射电子：背散射电子是指被固体样品原子反弹回来的一部分入射电子。其中包括弹性背反射电子和非弹性背反射电子。弹性背反射电子是指被样品中原子核反弹回来的，散射角大于90°的那些入射电子，其能量基本上没有变化。弹性背反射电子的能量为数千到数万伏特。非弹性背反射电子是入射电子和核外电子撞击后产生非弹性散射，不仅能量变化，方向也发生变化。如果有些电子经多次散射后仍能反弹出样品表面，这就形成非弹性背反射电子。非弹性背反射电子的能量分布范围很宽，从数十伏特到数千伏特。从数量上看，弹性背反射电子远比非弹性背反射电子所占的份额多。背反射电子的产生范围在100 nm~10 μm深处，由于入射电子进入试样较深，入射电子束已被散射开，由于它的产额能随样品原子序数增大而增多，所以不仅能用作形貌分析，而且可以用来显示原子序数衬度，定性地用作成分分析。 吸收电子：入射电子进入样品后，经多次非弹性散射能量损失殆尽，最后被样品吸收。若在样品和地之间接入一个高灵敏度的电流表，就可以测得样品对地的信号，这个信号是由吸收由子提供的。入射电子束与样品发生作用，若逸出表面的背反射电子或二次电子数量任一项增加，将会引起吸收电子相应减少，对于厚试样（无透射电子），由于入射电子的强度等于反射电子强度与吸收电子强度之和，若把吸收电子信号作为调制图像的信号，则其衬度与二次电子像和背反射电子像的反差是互补的。吸收电子在试样中经过多次碰撞后，其扩散体积大，因此吸收电子像的分辨率低，一般为0.1~1 μm。入射电子束射入含有多元素的样品时，由于二次电子产额不受原子序数影响，则产生背反射电子较多的部位其吸收电子的数量就较少。因此，吸收电子像可以反映原子序数衬度，同样也可以用来进行定性的微区成分分析。 特征X射线：特征X射线是原子的内层电子受到激发以后，在能级跃迁过程中直接释放的具有特征能量和波长的一种电磁波辐射。入射电子与核外电子作用，产生非弹性散射，外层电子脱离原子变成二次电子，使原子处于能量较高的激发状态，它是一种不稳定态。较外层的电子会迅速填补内层电子空位，使原子降低能量，趋于较稳定的状态。产生的特征X射线的波长和原子序数之间服从莫塞莱定律： mathrm{lambda = }frac{mathrm{K}}{{mathrm{(Z-sigma)}}^mathrm{2}} 式中Z为原子序数，K、σ为常数。 从公式可以看出，特征波长和原子序数有关，利用这一关系可以进行成分分析。X射线一般在试样的500 nm~5 μm深处发出。 俄歇电子：如果原子内层电子能级跃迁过程中释放出来的能量不以X射线的形式释放，而是用该能量将核外另一电子打出，脱离原子变为二次电子，这种二次电子叫做俄歇电子。因每一种原子都有自己特定的壳层能量，所以它们的俄歇电子能量也各有特征值，能量在50~500 eV。俄歇电子是由试样表面极有限的几个原子层中发出的，这说明俄歇电子信号适用于表层化学成分分析。显然，一个原子中至少要有三个以上的电子才能产生俄歇效应，铍是产生俄歇效应的最轻元素。 3.2 扫描电子显微镜 3.2.1 主要结构 扫描电镜可分为五个主要组成部分：电子束会聚系统、样品室、真空系统、电子学系统和显示部分。 （1）电子束会聚系统。此系统由三部分组成（见图3.2.1），即电子枪、磁透镜、扫描线圈等。 图3.2.1 电子束会聚系统剖面示意图 电子枪。电子枪是扫描电镜的电子源，由阴极、栅极和阳极构成，其作用是发射稳定、高速的电子束流。电子束的亮度主要取决于电子枪发射电子的强度，所用的加速电压一般为0.5~30 kV。 磁透镜（聚光镜）。电子射线在磁场的作用下会改变前进的方向。当电子射线通过空心的强力电磁圈时，就像光线通过玻璃的透镜那样，会发生折射而聚焦。由于三极电子枪所发射出来的电子束直径一般为30~50 μm左右，而最终要求电子束直径成为1~5 nm的电子探针，因此需要两个或三个磁透镜组成，即双聚光镜和物镜（末透镜）。这三个透镜都有光阑，可挡掉一部分无用的电子，尤其是物镜光阑要尽量地小，以减少像差。同时，磁透镜有像散存在，故要安装消像散器。 扫描线圈。通常由两个偏转线圈组成。在扫描发生器的作用下，电子束在样品表面做光栅状扫描。 （2）样品室。样品室是固定样品以及电子束和样品相互作用产生各种信号电子的场所（见图3.2.2）。 扫描电镜样品室的容积较大，最大的直径为150 mm，样品用导电胶或双面胶固定在铜台上，经过喷镀，装入样品座，把这个样品座放在和微动装置连在一起的样品架上。样品微动装置能在X、Y轴方向上下左右移动，能在T轴做0~90°的倾斜，能在R轴做360°的水平旋转，还能在Z轴做6~48 mm左右的升降。为了使电子探针系统和样品室的这些结构保持真空状态，避免外部磁场的影响和保持外观整齐，以上各部分被装入适当的外套之中，用密封圈（橡胶垫圈）组装在一起。 图3.2.2 样品室 （3）真空系统。扫描电镜的真空系统如图3.2.3所示。扫描电镜的镜体和样品室内部都需要保持1.33×10-2~1.33×10-4 Pa的真空度，因此必须用机械泵和扩散泵进行抽真空。真空系统还有水平、停电和真空自动保护装置，置换样品和灯丝时有气锁装置。 图3.2.3 扫描电镜的真空系统 （4）电子学系统。 电源系统：扫描电镜的电源系统包括启动镜体的各种电源(高压、透镜系统、扫描线圈、合轴线圈、消像散用的电源等)，检测与放大系统电源，光电倍增管电源，真空系统和图像信号处理线路电源，观察用的显像管以及照相机电源等。 信号电子成像系统：此系统把电子探针和样品相互作用产生的信号电子进行收集、放大、处理，最后在显像管上显示图像。 扫描电镜可以接收从样品上发出的多种信号电子来成像，不同的信号电子要用不同的探测器。在高真空的工作状态下，以二次电子信号的图像质量最好。二次电子的探测器为二次电子探头，是扫描电镜最重要的部件之一。二次电子探头由栅极、聚焦环、闪烁晶体、光导管和光电倍增管等组成，见图3-5。 （5）显示部分。 显像管：把电子透镜像普通显微镜里的物镜和目镜那样组合起来，把物体放大到万、几十万倍。由于人眼看不见电子射线，必须在荧光屏上显示放大的图像，即将信号放大器获得的输出调制信号通过显像管转换成图像。 照相机：显像管显示的图像、编号、放大倍率、标尺长度和加速电压可以拍摄到底片上。着科学水平的不断发展，20世纪80年代开始就已研制用计算机代替照相机的功能，直接将图像及设置的参数打印出来或存储。 3.2.2 工作原理 扫描电子显微镜的工作原理如图3.2.4所示。由电子枪发射的电子束在加速电压的作用下经过磁透镜系统会聚，形成直径几个纳米的电子束，聚焦在样品表面上。在第二聚光镜和物镜之间偏转线圈的作用下，电子束在样品上做光栅状扫描，电子和样品相互作用产生信号电子。这些信号电子经探测器收集并转换为光子，再通过电信号放大器加以放大处理，最终成像在显示系统上。扫描电镜的工作原理与光学显微镜的不同在于：在光学显微镜下，全部图像一次显出，是“静态”的；而扫描电镜则是把来自二次电子的图像号作为时像信号，将一点一点的画面“动态”地形成三维的图像。 图3.2.4 扫描电镜工作原理 3.2.3 主要性能 （1）放大倍数 当入射电子束作光栅扫描时，电子束在样品表面扫描的幅度为As，荧光屏长度也就是显示器电子束同步扫描的幅度为Ac，则扫描电子显微镜的放大倍数为： mathrm{M = }frac{mathrm{A}_mathrm{c}}{mathrm{A}_mathrm{s}} 由于显示器荧光屏尺寸是固定不变的，因此，改变电子束在试样表面的扫描幅度As可以改变放大倍率。一般扫描电子显微镜的放大倍数，可以从20~20万倍区间连续调节，实现由低倍到高倍的连续观察，这对观察分析非常有利。 （2）分辨率 分辨率是扫描图像中可以分辨两点之间的最小的实际距离，是扫描电子显微镜的核心性能指标。分辨率高低主要取决于电子束直径和调制信号的类型，电子束激发出信号的区域与荧光屏上的像点逐一对应，入射电子束直径越小，分辨率越高。另外，同一电子束试样内激发信号的有效范围一般会超过入射束直径，不同信号激发范围不同，导致不同分辨率。在SEM中，二次电子因其本身能量较低致使平均自由程很短，有效激发范围与电子束直径相当，是分辨率最高的图像。背散射电子像分辨率低于二次电子像，X射线调制成像，其激发范围显著大于背散射电子，一般在微米量级。 （3）景深 景深是指透镜对试样表面高低不平的各部位能同时清晰成像的距离范围，可以理解为试样上最近清晰像点到最远清晰像点之间的距离。扫描电子显微镜末级透镜焦距较长，孔径半角很小（约10 mrad），景深是一般光学显微镜的100~500 倍，这使扫描电子显微镜图像有较强的立体感。放大5000倍时，景深可达数十微米，这是其他观察仪器无法比拟的优点。 3.2.4 主要特点 （1）成像立体感强 扫描电镜适用于粗糙表面和断口的分析观察，图像富有立体感、真实感，易于识别和解释。用扫描电镜来观察植物的叶、花、果实，动物的毛以及细菌、真菌等等的表面形貌时栩栩如生，分辨起来较容易，景深大。 （2）放大倍数变化范围大 扫描电镜放大倍数一般为15万~20万倍，最大可达10万~100万倍，它几乎包括了从扩大镜到光学显微镜到电子显微镜的一切倍率，而且同时给出一个比例尺，可方便地测量微结构的尺寸，而对于多相、多组成的非均匀材料，便于低倍下的普查和高倍下的观察分析。 （3）分辨率高 普及型的扫描电镜分辨率为10 nm，中档的为5~6 nm，高档的为1 nm，大多数的扫描电镜分辨率为 2~6 nm，最高可达0.01 nm。 （4）样品的损伤小 扫描电镜的电子束在样品上是动态扫描，其电子束流小，一般控制在100 μA以下，而且加速电压低，一般为 0.5~30 kV，这也是辐射损伤轻、污染小的原因。 （5）样品适应性高 体积小至几微米，大至150 mm，厚至20 mm的样品均可以用扫描电镜观察。其观察样的种类也较广，从土壤、金相、集成电路到生物切片，直至新鲜的含水样品都可以用扫描电镜观察（含水样品的观察要严格控制加速电压和观察的时间，否则容易损伤样品、放电和污染筒）。 （6）多功能分析 扫描电镜除了可以作形貌结构的观察外，如果配上能谱仪、光谱仪和波谱仪等附件，还可在观察形貌的同时作微区的多种成分的定性、定量、定位分析。配有光学显微镜和单色仪等附件时，可观察阴极荧光图像和进行阴极荧光光谱分析等。根据观察目的，能增加无需试样预处理工序的低真空方式功能、试样制冷、吸引、加热、描绘、分析等多方面功能。 （7）图像质量可调节 通过调节可改善图像反差的宽容度，使图像各部分亮暗适中。采用双放大倍数装置或图像选择器，可在荧光屏上同时观察不同放大倍数的图像或不同形式的图像进行对比。 （8）试样自由度大 试样可在三维空间平移、旋转、倾斜，这对观察不规则形状试样的各个区域细节极为方便。可使用加热、冷却和拉伸等样品台进行动态试验，观察在不同环境条件下的相变及形态变化等。 （9）可直接观察试样原始表面 扫描电镜制样简单，能反映样品的真实形貌，这对于许多故障进行失效分析是非常有利的。 3.2.5 样品制备 （1）对试样的要求 试样可以是块状或粉末颗粒，在真空中能保持稳定，含有水分的试样应先烘干除去水分。表面受到污染的试样，要在不破坏试样表面结构的前提下进行适当清洗，然后烘干。新断开的断口或断面，一般不需要进行处理，以免破坏断口或表面的结构状态。有些试样的表面、断口需要进行适当的侵蚀才能暴露某些结构细节，则在侵蚀后应将表面或断口清洗干净，然后烘干。对磁性试样要预先去磁，以免观察时电子束受到磁场的影响。试样大小要适合仪器专用样品座的尺寸，不能过大，样品座尺寸各仪器均不相同，一般小的样品座为3~5 mm，大的样品座为30~50 mm，以分别用来放置不同大小的试样，样品的高度也有一定的限制，一般在5~10 mm。 （2）块状试样的制备方法 对于块状导电材料，除了大小要适合仪器样品座尺寸外，基本上不需要进行什么制备，用导电胶把试样粘结在样品座上，即可放在扫描电镜中观察。对于块状的非导电或导电性较差的材料，要先进行镀膜处理，在材料表面形成一层导电膜，以避免电荷积累，影响图像质量，并可防止试样的热损伤 （3）粉末试样的制备方法 先将导电胶或双面胶纸粘结在样品座上，再均匀地把粉末样品撒在上面，用洗耳球吹去未粘住的粉末，再镀上一层导电膜，即可上电镜观察。 （4）镀膜的方法 镀膜的方法有两种，一是真空镀膜，另一种是离子溅射镀膜。离子溅射镀膜的原理是：在低气压系统中，气体分子在相隔一定距离的阳极和阴极之间的强电场作用下电离成正离子和电子，正离子飞向阴极，电子飞向阳极，二电极间形成辉光放电，在辉光放电过程中，具有一定动量的正离子撞击阴极，使阴极表面的原子被逐出，称为溅射，如果阴极表面为用来镀膜的材料（靶材），需要镀膜的样品放在作为阳极的样品台上，则被正离子轰击而溅射出来的靶材原子沉积在试样上，形成一定厚度的镀膜层。离子溅射时常用的气体为情性气体氩，要求不高时，也可以用空气，气压约为5×10-2 torr（1 torr = 133.32 Pa）。离子溅射镀膜与真空镀膜相比，其主要优点是：1）装置结构简单，使用方便，溅射一次只需几分钟，而真空镀膜则要半个小时以上；2）消耗贵金属少，每次仅约几毫克；3）对同一种镀膜材料，离子溅射镀膜质量好，能形成颗粒更细、更致密、更均匀、附着力更强的膜。 3.2.6 SEM照片影响因素 影响扫描电镜照片的因素包括：电子枪、电磁透镜以及样品室的洁净度等，避免粉尘、水气、油气等污染；调节加速电压、工作电流以及仪器调整、样品处理、真空度；环境因素，如振动、磁场、噪声、接地等。加何拍出好的SEM照片，一般由样品的种类和所要的结果来决定观察条件，调整适当的加速电压、工作距离、适当的样品倾斜，选择适当的侦测器、调整合适的电子束电流。一般来说，加速电压越高，电子束波长越短，理论上，只考虑电子束直径的大小，加速电压越大，可得到越小的聚焦电子束，因而提高分辨率，然而提高加速电压却有一些不可忽视的缺点，比如：无法看到样品表面的微细结构；会出现不寻常的边缘效应；电荷累积的可能性增大；样品损伤的可能性增大。 平时操作，若要将样品室真空一直保持在10-8 Pa（10-10 torr），则抽真空的时间将变长而降低仪器的便利性，更增加仪器购置成本，因此一些仪器设计了阶段式真空，亦即使电子枪、磁透镜及样品室的真空度依序降低，并分成三个部分来读取真空计读数，如此可将样品保持在真空度10-5 Pa的环境下即可操作。平时待机或更换样品时，为防止电子枪污染，皆使用真阀将电子枪及磁透镜部分与样品室隔离，实际观察时再打开使电子束通过而打击到样品。 场发射式电子枪的电子产生率与真空度有密切的关系，其使用寿命也随真空度变差而急剧缩短，因此在样品制备上必须非常注意水气，或固定用的碳胶或银胶是否烤干，以免在观察的过程中，真空陡然变差而影响灯丝寿命 3.2.7 主要应用 扫描电镜是利用样品表面微区特征（如形貌、原子序数或化学成分、晶体结构或位向等）的差异，在电子束作用下通过试样不同的区域产生不同的亮度差异，从而获得具有一定村度的图像。而扫描电镜由于具有景深大、放大倍数高的优点，所以特别适用于对表面凹凸不平的断口进行形貌分析。 （1）材料断口分析 材料断口分析是扫描电镜的典型应用。如图3.2.5所示，金属呈现出明显断口，深度为几个微米；表面有片状金属剥落，片状金属尺寸为几个至十几个微米。利用SEM可以清晰地观察材料表面的断口，金属断裂有沿晶、解离、准解理、疲劳和韧窝五种类型，而实际的断口可能由这五种之中的某几种典型断口混合而成。依据断口的形状，可以对实际断口进行断裂机制分析。 图3.2.5 金属表面断口 （2）材料组织形貌观察 图3.2.6所示为碳纳米管上负载金属纳米颗粒的SEM照片，图上很好地呈现出碳纳米管的一维形貌，其直径约100 nm；大量的金属纳米颗粒均匀地负载在碳纳米管上，其尺寸约为几个纳米。在多相结构材料中，特别是在某些共晶材料复合材料的显微组织分析方面，可以借助于扫描电镜景深大的特点，较好地呈现材料的组织形貌和结构。 图3.2.6 碳纳米管负载的金属纳米颗粒 （3）断裂过程的动态研究 有的型号的扫描电镜带有拉伸台装置，可进行断裂的动态过程研究。在试样拉伸的同时，既可以直接观察裂纹的萌生及扩展与材料显微组织之间的关系，又可以连续记录下来，为科学研究提供最直接的证据。 3.3 透射电子显微镜 3.3.1 主要结构 透射电子显微镜的结构主要包括电子光学系统、电源与控制系统、循环冷却系统及真空系统，其中电子光学系统是透射电子显微镜的核心部分。图3.3.1所示为透射电子显微镜的电子光学组成示意图。从光学成像的角度来看，透射电子显微镜由三部分组成：照明系统、成像与放大系统及观察与记录系统。 图3.3.1 透射电镜的结构示意图 3.3.1.1 照明系统 照明系统包括电子枪、聚光镜平移对中、倾斜调节装置，其主要作用为：提供一束亮度高、照明孔径半角小、平行度好、束流稳定的照明源；保证电子束可在2~3°倾斜，以满足明暗场成像转换的需要。 （1）电子枪 电子枪是发射电子的照明光源，主要作用是产生并发射和加速电子。目前电子枪的种类分为热电子发射型和场电子发射型。热电子发射型照明光源又可细分为钨灯丝、六硼化镧（LaB6）和六硼化铈（CeB6）三种。场发射电子枪照明光源可分为冷场型和热场型。使用场发射电子源的透射电镜又称为场发射电镜。 早期的透射电子显微镜使用的主要为钨灯丝电子源，但是由于其亮度低、光源尺寸大及能量发散度较大，所以人们很早就开始寻找更亮的光源。1969年Broers提出由单晶六硼化镧加工成锥状的顶端，从而制造出六硼化镧型灯丝。1968年，Crewe提出了冷场型发射枪，并于1980年后开始应用。然而，冷场型发射枪在室温使用时，灯丝会产生残留气体分子的离子吸附，使得发射电流降低并产生噪声，这样必须定期进行闪光处理以消除吸附分子层。因此，Swanson等人于20世纪70年代开发出钨针尖包覆有ZrO的热场型电子枪。表3.3.1给出了几种不同电子枪的特性。从表3.3.1可看出，热场发射型电子枪的亮度高、束斑尺寸小且能量发散度小，是目前综合性能最好的电子枪，因此也成了高分辨电子显微镜的首选。

钨灯丝和六硼化镧/铈灯丝属于热阴极电子枪，它是利用高温使电子具有足够的能量夫克服电子枪材料的功函数而逃离。常用的热电子发射型电子枪属于热阴极三极电子枪，它由发夹形钨丝阴极、栅极和阳极组成，其结构如图3.3.2所示。图3.3.2（a）中反映了阴极栅极和阳极之间的等位面分布情况。负的高压直接加在栅极上，同时在阴极和负高压之间有一个偏压电阻，这样使得栅极和阴极之间就会产生数百伏的电位差，如图3.3.2（b）。这样栅极比阴极电位值更负，因此可以用栅极来控制阴极发射电子的有效区域。 图3.3.2 热电子发射型电子枪工作原理示意图 当阴极流向阳极的电子数量加大时，在偏压电阻两端的电位值增加，使栅极电位比阴极进一步变负，由此可以减小灯丝有效发射区域的面积，束流随之减小。若束流因某种原因而减小时，偏压电阻两端的电压随之下降，致使栅极和阴极之间的电位接近。此时，栅极排斥阴极发射电子的能力减小，束流又可望上升。因此，自偏压回路可以起到限制和稳定束流的作用。由于栅极的电位比阴极负，所以自阴极端点引出的等位面在空间呈弯曲状。在阴极和阳报之间的某一地点，电子束会汇集成一个交叉点，这就是通常所说的电子题。交叉点处电子束直径约几十个微米。 图3.3.3所示为场发射电子枪工作原理示意图。场发射电子枪的原理是高电场下产生肖特基（Schottky）效应。它是利用靠近曲率半径很小的阴极尖端发尖发射电子的，当在真空中的金属表面受到108 V/cm大小的电子加速电场时，将会有数量可观的电子发射出来，所以叫作场致发射，简称场发射。如果阴极尖端半径为0.1~0.5 μm，若在尖端与第一阳极之间加U1 = 3 kV的电位差，与第二阳极间加U2 = 5 kV的电位差，那么在阴极尖端附近建立的强电场就足以使它发射电子。在第二阳极几十千伏甚至几百千伏正电位作用下，阴极尖端发射的电子会聚在第二阳极孔的下方，电子束直径小至20 nm（甚至10 nm）。场发射电子是从很尖锐的阴极尖端所发射出来，因此可得极细而又具高电流密度的电子束，其亮度可达热阴极电子枪的数百倍甚至数千倍。由此可见，场发射电子枪是透射电子显微镜获得高分辨率、高质量图像较为理想的电子源。不同的灯丝电子源大小、电流量、电流稳定度以及灯丝寿命等有差异，如表3.3.1所示。 图3.3.3 场发射电子枪工作原理示意图 （2）聚光镜 聚光镜的主要作用是把电子枪发射出来的电子会聚而成交叉点，以便得到一束强度高、直径小、相干性强、近似平行的电子束，并照射到样品上。一般都采用双聚光镜系统，如图3.3.4所示。第一聚光镜是强激磁透镜，焦距很短，通过改变焦距可以控制光斑大小；经过第一聚光镜后束斑缩小到1/50~1/10，将电子枪第一交叉点束斑缩小为1~5 μm。第二聚光镜是弱激磁透镜，焦距很长；同时在第二聚光镜下方安装有一个聚光镜光阑，用以调整束斑大小；通过控制光阑照明孔径半角可得到一束近乎平行的电子束，以利于进行衍射操作；和未经过第一聚光镜的束斑相比，经过第二聚光镜后的束斑，适焦时放大了约2倍。结果在样品平面上可获得2~10 μm的照明电子束班。同时，为了减小像散，在第二聚光镜下还安装有一个消像散器。另外，由于第二聚光镜是长焦电磁透镜，这样在第二聚光镜和下方的物镜之间就会有较大的间隙，这样有利于装人样品台及相关附件。 图3.3.4 聚光镜照明光路图 为了满足各种分析功能的需要（如纳米束电子衍射模式和会聚束电子衍射模式等），照明系统也变得越来越复杂，在新型多功能的透射电子显微镜中越来越多地采用多级聚光镜。 3.3.1.2 成像系统 主要是由样品室、物镜、中间镜和投影镜组成。在物镜的上面是样品室，在物镜的下面还有物镜光阑和选区光阑。 （1）样品室与样品台 样品室有一套机构，保证样品经常更换时不破坏镜筒主体的真空度。透射电子显微镜的样品既小又薄，通常需用外径为3 mm的样品载网（一般为铜网、网和镍网等）来支持。将装载样品的台子称为样品台。样品台的作用是承载样品，并使样品能在物镜极靴孔内平移、倾斜、旋转，以选择感兴趣的样品区域或位向进行观察分析。新式的电子显微镜常最普遍配备的是侧插式倾斜装置。“侧插”就是样品杆从侧面进入物镜极靴中去。有的样品杆本身还带有使样品倾斜或原位旋转的装置。这些样品杆和倾斜样品台组合在一起就是侧插式双倾样品台和单倾旋转样品台。目前双倾样品台是最常用的，它可以使样品沿x轴和y轴倾转±60°。在晶体结构分析中，利用样品倾斜和旋转装置可以测定晶体的位向、相变时的惯习面及析出相的方位等。部分样品台还可以实现对样品的加热、冷却及测试应变等处理。 在照相曝光期间必须牢固地将样品载网夹持在样品座中并保持良好的热、电接触，减小因电子照射引起的热或电荷堆积而产生样品的损伤或图像漂移。平移是任何样品台最基本的动作，通常在两个相互垂直方向上样品平移最大值为±1 mm，以确保样品载网上大部分区域都能观察到。样品图像的漂移量应小于相应情况下显微镜像的分辨率。 （2）物镜 物镜在镜筒中的位置如图3.3.5所示，其作用是形成第一幅高分辨率电子放大像。在镜下面的电磁透镜仅起到进一步放大的作用，这样物镜能够分辨出来的结构细节（包括任何缺陷）都被成像系统中的其他电磁透镜进一步放大。因此，透射电子显微镜分辨本领的高低主要取决于物镜。欲获得物镜的高分辨率本领，必须尽可能降低像差。通常采用强激磁、短焦距的物镜，像差小。 图3.3.5 成像系统光路示意图 物镜是一个强激磁、短焦距的透镜（f = 1~3 mm），它的放大倍数较高，一般为100~300倍。目前，高质量的物镜其分辨率可达1 Å左右。物镜的分辨率主要取决于极靴的形状和加工精度。一般来说，极靴的内孔和上下极靴之间的距离越小，物镜的分辨率就越高。为了减少物镜的球差，往往在物镜的后焦面上安放一个物镜光阑。物镜光阑不仅具有减少球差、像散和色差的作用，而且可以提高图像的衬度。此外，物镜光阑位于后焦面的位置上时，可以方便地进行暗场及衬度成像的操作。 在用电子显微镜进行图像分析时，物镜和样品之间和距离总是固定不变的 （即物距L1不变）。因此改变放大倍数进行成像时，主要是改变物镜的焦距和像距（即f和L2）来满足成像条件。 （3）中间镜 中间镜是一个弱激磁的长焦距变倍透镜，一般情况下，可在0~20倍范围调节。实际上，中间镜是以物镜的像为试样进一步成像的。当放大倍数大于1时，用来进一步放大物镜像；当放大倍数小于1时，用来缩小物镜像。 在电镜操作过程中，主要是利用中间镜的可变倍率来控制电镜的放大倍数。如果物镜、中间镜和投影镜的放大倍数分别用M0、Mi和Mp表示，则获得的电子显微图像总放大倍数M = M0MiMp倍。通过调节线圈电流可以很方便地增大或减小放大倍数。 如果把中间镜的物平面和物镜的像平面重合，则在荧光屏上得到一幅放大像，这就是电子显微镜中的成像操作（也称为显微成像模式），如图3.3.5（a）所示。如果把中间镜的物平面与物镜的背（后）焦面重合，则在荧光屏上得到一幅电子衍射花样，这就是透射电子显微镜的电子衍射操作（也称为衍射成像模式），如图3.3.5（b）所示。 （4）光阑 透射电子显微镜的光阑包括三种：聚光镜光阑、物镜光阑和选区光阑。这三种光阑片都是用无磁性的金属（铂、钼等）制造的，其结构上则有四个不同直径的光阑孔，每个光阑孔的周围开有缝隙以使光阑孔受电子束照射后热量的散出，但不同的光阑尺寸范围不同。光阑被安装在光阑杆机构上，使用时，通过光阑杆机构调节光阑孔的位置，使光阑孔中心位于电子束的轴线上（光阑中心和主焦点重合）。由于小光阑孔很容易受到污染，因此高性能的电子显微镜中常用抗污染光阑（或称自洁光阑）。 聚光镜光阑的作用是限制照明孔径半角。在双聚光镜系统中，聚光镜光阑常装在第二聚光镜的下方。光阑孔的直径为20~400 μm。做一般分析观察时，聚光镜的光阑孔直径可用200~300 μm；若做微束分析时，则应采用小孔径光阑。 物镜光阑（又称衬度光阑）通常被安装在物镜的后焦面上。常用的物镜光阑孔直径在20~120 μm范围内。当电子束通过薄膜样品后会产生散射和衍射，散射角（或衍射角）较大的电子被光阑挡住，不能继续进入镜筒成像，从而会在像平面上形成具有一定衬度的图像光阑孔越小，被挡去的电子越多，图像的衬度就越大，因此，物镜光阑又被称为衬度光阑。物镜光阑的另一个主要作用是在后焦面上套取衍射束的斑点（即副焦点）成像，这就是暗场成像。利用明、暗场显微照片对照分析，可以方便地进行物相鉴定和缺陷分析。 选区光阑又称场限光阑或视场光阑，一般都放在物镜的像平面位置。选区光阑孔的直径通常在20~400 μm范围内，有的高达800 μm。当对样品进行微区的衍射分析时，需要在样品上放置光阑来限定微区。但是，由于待分析的微区仅有微米量级，要制造出如此小尺寸的光阑在技术上是很困难的，因此将选区光阑放在物镜的像平面上。这样放置和在样品上直接放置光阑是等效的，而光阑可以做得大一些，因此对这个微区进行衍射，叫作选区衍射。比如，当物镜放大倍数是50倍，则一个直径等于50 μm的光阑孔就可以选择样品上直径为1 m的区域。 （5）投影镜 投影镜的作用是把中间镜的像（显微图像或电子衍射花样）作为物进一步放大，并投景到荧光屏上。和物镜一样，也是一个短焦距的强磁透镜。投影镜的激磁电流是固定的，因为成像电子束进人投影镜时孔径半角很小，因此其景深和焦距都非常大。即使改变中间镜的大倍数，使显微镜的总放大倍数有很大的变化，也不会影响图像的清晰度。有时，中间镜像平面还会出现一定的位移，由于这个位移距离仍处于投影镜的景深范围之内，因此，在光屏上的图像仍旧是清晰的。 目前，高性能的透射电子显微镜大都采用5级以上透镜放大，即有两级甚至三级中间和两级投影镜。对于极低倍数的成像，则不用物镜，直接用中间镜和投影镜成像。 3.3.1.3 观察记录系统 目前，比较常用的观察和记录装置包括荧光屏、照相底片和CCD照相机。在荧光屏面放置可以自动换片的照相暗盒。照相时只要把荧光屏掀往一侧并竖起，电子束即可使照底片曝光。由于透射电子显微镜的焦长很大，虽然荧光屏和底片之间有数厘米的间距，但仍能得到清晰的图像。 通常采用在暗室操作情况下人眼较敏感的、发绿光的荧光物质来涂制荧光屏。这样有利于高放大倍数、低亮度图像的聚焦和观察。电子感光片是一种以对电子束曝光敏感、颗粒度很小的溴化物乳胶底片，它对红光不敏感。由于电子和乳胶相互作用比光子强得多，照相曝光时间很短，只需几秒钟。早期的电子显微镜用手动快门，构造简单，但曝光不均匀。新型电子显微镜采用电磁快门，与荧光屏动作密切配合，动作迅速，曝光色彩夺目、均匀；有的还有自动曝光装置，根据荧光屏上图像的亮度，自动确定曝光所需的时间。 如果配上适当的电子电路，还可以实现拍片自动记数。近年来新式的透射电镜一般都配有CCD相机，可以直接把电镜中看到的图像采集，在计算机中实现图像处理分析、数据管理和报告打印等多种功能。如图像的亮度或衬度调节、图像的非均匀亮度调节、图像粘贴和测量等。 电子显微镜工作时，整个电子通道必须置于真空系统中。新式的电子显微镜中电子枪镜筒和照相机之间都装有气阀，各部分都可以单独地抽真空和单独放气，因此，在更换灯丝、清洗镜筒和更换底片时，可不破坏其他部分的真空状态。 3.3.2 工作原理 TEM是利用透过样品的透射电子成像的，电子枪发射出电子射线经透射系统照射在样品上，电子束与样品相互作用后，当电子射线在样品另一方重新出现时，已带有样品内的信息，然后进行放大处理而成像，最终在荧光屏上形成带有样品信息的图像，使人眼能够识别。 透射电镜的成像原理可分为三种情况： （1）吸收像。射到质量、密度大的样品时，主要的成像作用是散射作用。样品上质量厚度大的地方对电子的散射角大，通过的电子较少，像的亮度较暗。早期的透射电子显微镜都是基于这一原理。 （2）衍射像。电子束被样品衍射后，样品不同位置的衍射波振幅分布对应于样品中晶体各部分不同的衍射能力，当出现晶体缺陷时，缺陷部分的衍射能力与完整区域不同，从而使行射的振幅分布不均匀，反映出晶体缺陷的分布。 （3）相位像。当样品薄至100 nm以下时，电子可以透过样品，波的振幅变化可以忽略，成像来自于相位的变化。 当电子经样品散射后，相对光轴以同一角度进入物镜的电子，在物镜后焦面上聚焦在一个点上。散射角越大，聚焦点离轴越远，如果样品是一个晶体，在后焦面上出现的是一幅衍射图样。与短晶面间距（或者说“高空间频率”）对应的衍射束被聚焦在离轴较远处。在后焦面上设有一个光阑，它截取那一部分电子对反差和分辨本领有直接的影响。如果光阑太小，把需要的高空间频率部分截去，那么和细微结构对应的高分辨信息就丢失了。 样品上厚的部分或重元素多的部分对电子散射的几率大。透过这些部分的电子在后焦面上分布在轴外的多。用光阑截去部分散射电子会使“质量厚度”大的部位在像中显得暗。这种反差可以人为地造成，如生物样品中用重元素染色，在材料表面的复型膜上从一个方向喷镀一层金属，造成阴阳面等。TEM反差的形成有以下3种方式 （1）振幅反差 当一定能量入射到样品，由于受到样品中原子的核和核外电子的静电场的作用，使电子动方向和速度发生变化称为电子散射。电子散射产生的振幅反差，是TEM最重要的成像制。 透镜图像的振幅反差是通过光阑吸收散射电子而形成的。振幅反差的大小取决于直接透射电子数量与弹性散射电子数量的比例。当入射电子照射样品，透过样品散射电子数总量，样品的厚度成正比。此外，样品密度越大电子散射的几率也越大。质量密度与厚度的乘积种为质量厚度，因此，振幅反差主要决定于样品各部分质量厚度的差异。当电子束投射到样品时，可随组织构成成分的密度不同而发生相应的电子发射量，如电子束投射到质量大的结构时，电子散射量大，其中大多数为大角度散射弹性电子，其角度为0.01~0.1 rad，但被物镜面的光阑挡掉散射电子，使该处的电流密度减少，形成图像的暗区，投射到荧光上的电子少而呈暗像，电子照片上则呈黑色，此现象称为电子密度高（electron dense）。反之当入射电子穿透样品质量厚度小的部位，直接透射以及小角度散射电子构成图像的亮区，则为电子密度低（electron lucent）。显然，样品各部分质量厚度差异越大，图像的振幅反差越强。此外，由于物镜存在球差，使散射电子轨迹受到很大影响，它们不会会聚到与物点相对应的同一高斯像点处，只能作为图像背景，弥散在各处。因此，在观察厚切片时，既使不加物镜光阑，图像也有一定的反差，但对于非常薄的切片来讲，几平没有反差。一般来说，对于样品的结构细节大小超过0.1~0.15 μm，厚度大于10 μm的样品，其反差主要是由振幅反差提供。 （2）相位反差 相位反差是在接近于正焦点附近很小的范围内产生的，它与物镜光阑是否存在无关，与加速电压以及样品的原子序数关系也不大。相位反差只能在最大的放大倍数和最高分辨率的条件下才能像平面观察到，对于低原子序数样品的细微结构，相位反差几乎是反差的唯一来源。对于微细结构小于0.15 μm、厚度小于10 μm的成像，特别是由轻元素构成的细微结构的图像，由于透射电子中弹性散射电子比例很少，而且散射角度也较小，都能通过光阑，因此不能获得振幅反差，图像的反差主要是由相位反差提供。从电子波的波动性分析，电子波穿透样品后成为透射波和散射波，其透射波的波长与入射电子波的波长相等，散射波由于入射电子通过样品时损失部分能量，使散射波波长发生变化。如图3.3.6所示，透射波（AB）与散射波（BC）之间存在一定的相位差。在理想透镜正聚焦时，二波（AB、BC）之间的相位差为90°，其合成波AC的振幅与透射波AB的差别很小（AC ≈ AB），几乎没有反差（图3.3.6a）。如果适当离焦，二波（AB、BC）之间的相位变化造成合成波（AC）的振幅与透射波（AB）的振幅的差异明显加大，合成波大于或小于透射波，形成一定的振幅差（图3.3.6b）。根据样品各部分透射波的强弱不同，使图像出现亮暗不同的区域，这种反差称为相位反差。 图3.3.6 相位反差 （3）衍射反差 衍射反差虽然可以加强图像的反差，但像的分辨率将下降。晶体样品图像反差的形成是由衍射效应产生的，晶体的原子是按周期性晶格排列，当入射电子波以一定角度照射晶体时，与晶体原子发生碰撞，若晶体结构满足下列条件： mathrm{2d}mathrm{sin}{mathrm{theta}}mathrm{ = nlambda} 式中：d——晶体原子之间的间距； θ——入射波角度； n——整数0，1，2，3...... λ——入射波波长。 则会在一定方向上产生很强的衍射波，称为布拉格衍射（Bragg diffraction）。它使直接透射的部分电子束强度分布产生变化。如果物镜光阑把衍射束挡住，只让透射束通过而形成的图像反差，称为衍射反差。此时，像是明场像，晶体中的强衍射区对应像的亮区，背景是暗的。若晶体产生的衍射束未被光阑挡住，而透射束被挡住，则形成暗场像。因此在一个均匀多晶体样品中，当同一电子束照射下，由于它们相对于入射电子波的取向不同，不同的晶粒呈现亮暗不同的颗粒，有的成为明场像，有的成为暗场像。在改变样品倾斜角度时，图像的明暗场像也随之变化。 衍射反差主要是用来研究晶体样品中的缺陷，而对原子尺度的研究，不能用衔射像来直接解释，必须连同电子衍射图一起对衍射反差像进行分析。 （4）离焦反差 离焦反差主要由散射电子波和直射电子波相互干涉而形成的。在电镜观察样品时，样品质量厚度迅速改变区域所对应的图像上会出现费涅尔衍射环。当物镜过焦时，费涅尔条纹呈暗线，欠焦时则呈现亮线，在正焦时，费涅尔条纹消失。由于离焦产生衍射环引起图像反差的增加，这种反差称为离焦反差。 3.3.3 主要性能 TEM主要性能指标通过常有三个：分辨本领、放大倍数和加速电压。 （1）分辨本领。显微镜的分辨本领是表示用显微镜来观察物体细微结构的能力，它是由显微镜能清楚分辨开被观察物体中两个细节间的最小距离来定义的。这个最小距离越小，分辨本领高。现今1000 kV透射电子显微镜的分辨本领可达0.2~0.3 nm。很显然分辨本领一方面取决于仪器本身的性能，如物镜的球差、衍射像差、色差、像散等因素；另一方面与被观察物体的材料性质、细节的形状、位置及衬度条件诸因素有关。甚至与检测人对最小距离的判别和测量有关。总之分本领是显微镜的最重要指标，也是一个不容易严格定义和测定的指标。 （2）放大倍数。透射电子显微镜的放大倍数是指横向放大倍数，它是成像系统中各级电磁透镜电子放大信数之乘积。每一级电磁透镜的放大倍数M定义为该透成像的像距b和距a的比值M = b/a，显然像距与物距取决于透镜的焦距f，即1/f = 1/a+1/b，而磁透镜的焦距f是透镜激励电流I和加速电压V的非线性函数f（V/I），因而改变电流就可以满足成像关系获得清楚的聚焦图像。现代透射电子显微镜的放大倍数从几十倍到几十万倍可连续改变，这是一般光学显微镜办不到的。由于电子显微镜分辨本领很高，即使放大几十万倍以后获得的照片还可以进一步用光学放大而得到几百万倍的图像透射电子显微镜的放大倍数将随样品平面高度、加速电压、透镜电流而变化。为了保持仪器放大倍数的精度，必须定期进行标定。 （3）加速电压。电子显微镜的加速电压决定电子的能量，电子能量越高、波长越短，电子显微镜的分辨本领越高。加速电压增加，电子穿透能力更强，可以观察更厚的样品。同时电子枪亮度增加，荧光屏发光强度也增强。因此透射电子显微镜通常都工作在50~200 kV。工作电压在500 kV以上的属于超高压电子显微镜。目前世界上超高压电子显微镜的加速电压高达3000 kV。 3.3.4 主要特点 电镜最突出的优越性主要表现在具有很高的分辨本领，最高分辨率达到001~0.02 nm；已达到原子水平，而且放大倍数高达100万倍放大倍数从几十倍到几于万可连续变倍，适用于各种研究样品的需要，在生物学和材料学纳米级的研究领域中是其他仪器所无法取代的，但透射电镜也有它的局限性和特殊要求，其表现如下： （1）由于样品制备技术的限制，对大多数生物样品来说，一般只能达到2 nm的分辨水平。 （2）电镜图像的分辨能力不仅取决于电镜本身的分辨率，而且也取决于样品结构的反差。 （3）电镜所用的光源是电子波，波长在非可见光范围内无颜色反应，所形成的图像是黑白图像，要求图像必须具有一定的反差。 （4）生物体组织和细胞成分主要由C、H、O、N等轻元素组成，它们的原子序数较低，电子像散射能力弱，相互之间的差别又很小，电镜下的图像反差一般偏低。 （5）由于电子束的穿透能力较弱，样品必须制成超薄切片。生物切片上可获得的分辨率般是切片厚度的1/10，也就是说，切片厚度为50~100 nm，其切片上的分率为5~10 nm。由此可见，虽然电镜的分辨率很高，生物样品制样技术限制了电镜性能的发挥。一般要求切片厚度为 50~70 nm。 （6）观察面小，载网直径为3 mm，超薄切片范围为 0.3~0.8 mm。 （7）电子束的强烈照射易损伤样品，发生变形、升华等，甚至被击穿破裂，可能使观察结果产生假象。 （8）观察时电镜镜筒必须保持真空，为了保证样品在真空下不损伤，对样品要求应无水分。因此，不能观察活体的生物样本。 （9）生物制样复杂，在步骤繁多的制样过程中，样品容易产生收缩、膨胀、破碎以及内含物丢失等结构改变。 3.3.5 样品制备 （1）对试样的要求 透射电子显微镜通过让电子束（包括衍射束和透射束）透过样品，利用透过或衍射的电子束反映样品晶体结构及形貌。如需获取普通形貌相、衍射班点，样品厚度要求小于200 nm；如需获取高分辨形貌相、精细衍射花样，样品厚度一般要求小于100 nm。 （2）块体样品制备技术 1）薄膜样品制备。 薄膜样品的组织结构必须和大块样品相同，在制备过程中，这些组织结构不能发生化。样品相对于电子束必须有足够的“透明度”，因为只有样品能被电子束透过，才有可进行观察和分析。薄膜样品应有一定强度和刚度，在制备、夹持和操作过程中，在一定的机械力作用下不会引起变形或损坏。在样品制备过程中不允许表面产生氧化和腐蚀。氧化和腐蚀会使样品的透明度下降，并造成多种假象。 2）样品薄片的预先减薄。 ①从大块样品上切割厚度为0.3~0.5 mm厚的薄片。 a.电火花线切割设备——导电样品。用一根往返运动的金属丝做切割工具。以被切割样品作阳极、金属丝作阴极，两极间保持微小的距离，利用其间的火花放电进行切割。过程在冷却条件下进行 电火花切割可切下厚度小于0.5 mm的薄片，切制时损伤层比较浅，可以通过后续的制或减薄过程去除。 b.金刚石切片机——不导电样品。针对不导电样品，利用金刚石刀片旋转，切割固在夹具上的样品。为了防止样品过热，一般配有冷却液。 ②0.5mm左右薄片减薄成几十微米薄片。 a.机械减薄法通过手工研磨来完成，把切割好的薄片一面用黏结剂黏在样品座表面，然在水砂纸上研磨减薄。样品平放，不要用力太大，并使它充分冷却。压力过大和温度升商局会引起样品内部组织结构发生变化。研磨过中要反复调换研磨面，使片两面摩擦磨特以免应力不均引起样品翘曲变形。片一般研磨至50 μm左右；手工研磨时即使用力不大，薄片上的硬化层也会厚至数十个纳米。 b.化学减薄法是把切割好的金属薄片放人配制好的化学试剂中，使其表面受蚀而继续减薄。合金中各组成相的腐蚀倾向是不同的，所以在进行化学减薄时，应注意减薄液的选择。化学减薄法的最大优点是表面没有机械硬化层，减薄后样品的厚度可以控制在20~50 μm，薄区面积大。但是，化学减薄时必须先把薄片表面充分清洗，去除污物，否则将得不到满意的结果。 ③将几十微米薄片减薄到可进行透镜观察的样品。 a.双喷电解减薄：将预减薄的样品剪成直径3 mm的圆片，装入样品夹持器中。进行减薄时，样品两个表面的中心部位各有一个电解液喷嘴。从喷嘴中喷出的液柱和阴极相接，样品和阳极相接。电解液通过一个耐酸泵进行循环，在两个喷嘴的轴线上装有一对光导纤维，其中一个光导纤维和光源相接，另一个则和光敏元件相连。如果样品经抛光后中心出现小孔，光敏元件输出的电信号就可以将抛光线路的电源切断。 用这种方法制成的薄膜样品，中心穿孔附近有一个较大的楔形薄区，可以被电子束穿透。直径3 mm圆片周边是一个厚度较大的刚性支架，可以保证样品夹持、搬运过程中不会被损坏。 b.离子减薄：是物理方法减薄，原理是利用加速的离子轰击样品表面，使表面原子飞出（溅射出），最终使样品减薄到电子束可以通过的厚度。样品放置于10-3~10-2 Pa的高真空样品室中，离子束从两侧在3~5 kV加速电压加速下轰击样品表面，样品表面相对离子束成0~30°的夹角。 离子减薄适用于矿物、陶瓷、半导体及多相合金等电解抛光所不能减薄的场合。离子减薄的效率较低，一般情况下4 μm/h 左右。但是离子减薄的质量高、薄区大。 （3）粉末样品制备技术 胶粉混合法：在干净玻璃片上滴火棉胶溶液，然后在玻璃片胶液上放少许粉末并搅匀，再将另一玻璃片压上，两玻璃片相对研并突然抽开，稍后，膜干；用刀片将膜划成小方格，将玻璃片斜插入水杯中，在水面上下空插，膜片逐渐脱落，用铜网将方形膜捞出，待观察。 粉碎和分散法：需透射电镜分析的粉末颗粒一般都小于铜网小孔，因此要先制备对电子束透明的支持膜。常用支持膜有火棉胶膜和碳膜。粉末样品制备的关键取决于能否使其均匀分散到支持膜上。将样品在玛瑙研钵中研碎，将研碎的粉末（如果样品是微细的粉末，就不用粉碎）放入与样品不发生反应的有机溶剂（例如丁醇、丙酮等）中，用超声波分散得到悬浊液，为了操作简单方便，也可以用玻璃棒搅拌。用滴管把所得的悬浊液放一滴在黏附有支持膜的铜网上，静置干燥后即可供观察。 透射电子显微镜晶体薄膜样品制备看似是一个简单的操作，其实不然，它的每一个操作环节需考虑是否影响材料本身的结构特征，需要深入理解工艺对材料结构特征的影响规律，必须注重细节，精益求精。 3.3.6 主要应用 （1）形貌分析 由于透射电镜具有较扫面电镜更高的分辨率，因此非常适合用来进一步观察材料的形貌。如图3.3.7所示，合成出的PtPdCu海绵展现出明显的分形结构，由一根主干和许多分枝组成，而分枝又是由更小的主干和分枝组成，如同一棵具有多级分枝的树。树枝由许多小的纳米颗粒组成，它们融合在一起，形成一个相互连接的多孔体系。此外，PtPdCu海绵还具分级孔结构，主干的孔径和孔壁尺寸都要明显大于分枝的孔径和孔壁尺寸。能谱则进一步揭示了PtPdCu海绵具有合金结构。 图3.3.7 分形金属纳米海绵的形貌表征 （2）高分辨像 图3.2.6所示为碳纳米管上负载金属纳米颗粒的SEM照片，图上很好地呈现出碳纳米管的一维形貌，其直径约100 nm；大量的金属纳米颗粒均匀地负载在碳纳米管上，其尺寸约为几个纳米。在多相结构材料中，特别是在某些共晶材料复合材料的显微组织分析方面，可以借助于扫描电镜景深大的特点，较好地呈现材料的组织形貌和结构。 图3.2.6 碳纳米管负载的金属纳米颗粒 （3）电子衍射 透射电子显微镜可以将产生的电子衍射束聚焦放大投影到荧光屏或照相底板上，形成规则排列的斑点或线条，这种图形就是电子衍射谱。弹性相干散射是电子束在晶体中产生衍射现象的基础。需要提醒的是，弹性相干散射是指晶体中原子位置的相干性，而非电子源本身的相于性，因而电子衍射谱反映晶体内部的结构和原子排布情况。 虽然电子衍射和X射线衍射均可用于分析晶体结构，但是两种方法存在异同点。相同点主要表现在以下几个方面： ①电子衍射的原理和X射线衍射相似，满足布拉格方程且不产生消光时才会发生衍射。 ②如果将所得衍射花样以底片的形式呈现，则两种衍射方法所得到的衍射花样在几何特征上也大致相似。 ③两种衍射花样的标定原理相同，并且使用相同的衍射卡片库。 由于电子波与X射线相比有其本身的特性，因此电子衍射和X射线衍射相比较时，具有下列不同之处： ①电子衍射是电子受到在空间上周期性变化势场的散射，与样品的相互作用往往比X射线衍射与样品作用要强烈一些，往往不止发生一次散射；X射线是与核外电子发生作用，与核外的电子分布情况相关。 ②电子束的波长要比X射线短得多，在同样满足布拉格条件时，它的射角θ很小，约为10-2 rad；而X射线产生衍射时，其衍射角最大可接近π/2。 ③由于电子的散射强度很高，导致电子束的透射能力有限，因此透射电镜要求试样做成薄膜状，这样使试样制备远比X射线衍射样品制备要复杂得多。 ④电子衍射操作时采用薄膜样品，由于样品的尺寸效应，薄膜样品的倒易阵点并不一个圆点，而会沿着样品厚度方向延伸成杆状，因而，增加了倒易阵点和爱瓦尔德球相菇的机会，结果使略微偏离布拉格条件的电子束也能发生衍射。 ⑤由于电子波的波长短，采用爱瓦尔德球图解时，反射球的半径很大，在衍射角θ较小的范围内反射球的球面可以近似地看成是一个平面，从而也可以认为电子衍射产生的标斑点大致分布在一个二维倒易截面内。因此，衍射花样可以比较直观地反映晶体的结构晶面位向，使晶体结构的研究比X射线更有优势。 ⑥原子对电子的散射能力远高于它对X 射线的散射能力（约高出四个数量级），故电子衍射束的强度较大，摄取衍射花样时曝光时间仅需数秒钟。并且有时电子衍射的强度几透射束相当，致使两者间会产生交互作用，从而使电子衍射花样的强度分析变得复杂，不像X射线衍射那样可以通过衍射强度来对物相进行定量计算、原位分析等。 3.4 原子力显微镜 3.4.1 工作原理 原子力是一种表面力，主要包括范德华力、静电力、磁力等。利用隧道电流、光束偏转或压敏电阻等方法，可以检测到微细针尖与物体之间的原子力，形成待测物体的表面形貌像，也可以用于检测微纳材料的力学性能及进行微纳结构加工。 原子力显微镜的原理建立在探针尖端的原子与样品表面原子在足够接近时存在相互作用力的基础之上。探针被装在一个小小的弹力臂的端头上，探针尖端上的原子与样品表面的相互作用力与两者的间距具有密切联系，如图3.4.1所示。当间隙大时，不存在作用力；在间隙逐渐缩小过程中，将出现引力（FW），主要有范德华力、毛细作用力、磁力和静电力。引力随着间隙缩小而增大，继续缩小间隙，探针针尖和样品原子外围电子将出现斥力（FR），主要有键结力和静电相互排斥力。斥力随距离减小的增速比引力快得多，在间隙缩小过程中将很快由相吸转向相斥。引力和斥力的合力称为雷纳德琼斯相互作用势（Lennard-Jones potential），可以表示为： F_A=F_R+F_W=frac{A}{r^m}-frac{B}{r^n} 式中，r为针尖原子与样品表面的最小距离；A、B、m、n针对不同的模型，可以是不同的常数。 图3.4.1 探针/样品间作用力与距离的关系 AFM针尖装在一个一端固定的弹性微悬臂上，弹性微悬臂对微弱力极为敏感，当样品或针尖轻轻接触时，针尖与样品表面原子之间的相互作用力就会引起微悬臂发生微小的弹性形变，也就是说微悬臂的形变可作为样品-针尖相互作用力的直接度量。 当一束激光照射到微悬臂的背面，微悬臂将激光束反射到一个光电检测器，检测器不同象限接收到的激光强度差值同微悬臂的形变量会形成一定比例关系,比如当微悬臂的形变约为0.01 nm，激光束反射到光电检测器后，则可放大为 3~10 nm的位移，产生可测量的电压差。反馈系统根据检测器电压的变化不断调整针尖或样品Z轴方向的位置，保持微悬臂的变形量不变，即保持针尖-样品间作用力恒定不变，针尖就会随表面的起伏上下移动，通过测量检测器相应的电压变化以对应样品扫描位置的变化，可获得针尖上下运动的轨迹，即可以记录样品的表面形貌特征。这种检测方式被称为“恒力”模式，是使用最广泛的扫描方式。AFM探针因其结构、材料等不同，弹簧常数范围宽至0.01~500 N/m，针尖尖端的曲率半径可小至1 nm，通常为10 nm，也可以通过镶嵌微球达到pm的量级。不同种类的探针可适用于不同的材料和需求，这拓宽了AFM的使用范围。 3.4.2 工作模式 AFM工作主要有成像模式和力曲线模式。成像模式又分为接触式、非接触式和轻敲式；力曲线模式有接触力曲线、轻敲力曲线和力分布成像。工作中可以根据样品表面不同的结构特征、材料的特性以及实验目的，选择合适的操作模式。 3.4.2.1 成像模式 （1）接触成像模式 接触成像模式针尖始终和样品接触，以恒高或恒力的模式扫描扫描过程中，针尖在表面滑动，形成稳定的高分辨图像。这种模式不适用于低弹性模量和易变形材料。 在大气环境中，由于毛细作用的存在，针尖和样品之间存在较大的黏滞力，横向扫描时施加在样品上的额外作用力可能会造成样品的损伤，黏滞力同时增大针尖和样品的接触面积，降低成像的分辨率。解决的办法是，由于表面自由能越大黏滞力越强，因此可以通过AFM针尖对表面进行修饰，在针尖上涂覆低表面能材料，或者将针尖浸人液体等，可以克服毛细作用带来的影响，有效提高成像分辨率。 如果在上面过程中微悬臂的分析和快速扫描的方向垂直，则针尖除了可以探测到与样品之间的垂直方向的原子力，还会由于针尖与样品之间的摩擦力使得微悬臂横向扭转，这样就可以研究样品表面的微区摩擦性质。横向力测量已经被广泛应用于多组分材料表面的摩擦性质。 （2）非接触成像模式 非接触成像模式中针尖在样品表面上方振动，始终不与样品接触。针尖测器检测到的是范德华力和静电力等对样品没有破坏的长程作用力，灵敏度较高。但是当针尖和样品距离较长时，成像分辨率较低，不适用于在液体中成像。 （3）轻敲模式 在轻敲模式中，微悬臂在其共振模式附近做受迫振动。振动的针尖轻敲表面，间断地和表面接触。由于接触时间非常短，针尖与样品的相互作用很小，通常为1皮牛顿~1纳牛顿，前切力引起的分率降低和对样品的破坏几乎消失，所以适合用于生物和聚合物等软物体的成像研究。 轻敲模式AFM在大气和液态环境下都可以实现。在大气环境中，当针尖与样品不接触时，微悬臂以最大振幅自由振荡。当针尖与样品表面接触时，尽管压电陶瓷片以同样的能量激发微悬臂振荡，但空间阻隔作用使微悬臂的振幅减小。反馈系统控制微悬臂的振幅恒定，针尖就跟随表面的起伏，上下移动获得表面形貌信息。轻敲模式同样适合在液态中操作，而且由于液态的阻尼作用，针尖与样品的剪切力更小，对样品的损伤也更小，所以液体中轻敲成像模式可以实现溶液反应的原位观察和活体生物检测。 轻敲模式还有一个重要应用，即相位成像。通过测定扫描过程中微悬臂的振荡相位和压电陶瓷驱动信号的振荡相位之间的差值，研究材料的力学性质和表面性质。如样品表面的摩擦、材料的滞弹性和黏附性质等;还可以对材料表面的不同组分进行化学识别。 轻敲模式一般采用调制横向振幅恒定的方法进行恒力模式的扫描，也可以采用频率调行化学识别。制技术，测量扫描过程中频率的变化。这种频率调制AFM的力检测方式，大幅度提高了噪声处理率和灵敏度，可以获得原子级分辨率的图像。 3.4.2.2 力曲线模式 针尖和样品之间的相互作用力与距离的关系称为“力曲线”，是实现AFM观察的重要特性曲线。 （1）接触力曲线 在接触模式的力曲线测量中，压电陶瓷置于当前扫描区域（x, y）的中心位置，停止扫描，仅在2方向施加周期性三角波电压信号，使样品周期性地与针尖接近一接触一离开。AFM的光学系统实时记录微悬臂的变形量并对压电陶瓷管的位移量作图。力曲线中微悬臂的弯曲与其力学常效的乘积即为针尖与样品之间的作用力。 力曲线一般分为非接触区、接触区和黏滞区3个区域。在非接触区，针尖离开样品较远，它们之间的作用力可以忽略不计，微悬臂不发生弯曲，力曲线为水平直线。针尖接近样品，它们之间的范德华力使微悬臂向样品表面弯曲。当二者接近到某一点时，它们之间的引力随距离变化的斜率超过了微悬臂的弹性常数，由于机械不稳定性，二者会突然接触到一起，称之为突触点，在接触区样品和针尖相互接触而共同移动。如果针尖和样品在接触时都没有发生弹性或塑性变形，样品所走过的距离与微悬臂的弯曲量相同。当样品走至某一预设位置时向相反方向移动，微悬臂的弯曲随之逐渐减小。但是由于针尖与样品间的黏附作用，二者仍粘在一起。随着样品继续向远离针尖方向移动，微悬臂由背向样品弯曲变为面向样品弯曲，这一区为力曲线的第三区——黏滞区。当微悬臂积蓄的弹力超过二者之间的黏滞力时，针尖突然与样品离开，微悬臂恢复非弯曲状态，力曲线又重新进入非接触区，该位置称为“崩离点”(pull off point)。 检测AFM力曲线上针尖与样品接触区斜率的变化，可以得出纳米尺度上力学性能对于刚性样品，针尖与样品接触以后，样品走过的距离与AFM微悬臂的弯曲量相等，力曲线斜率为1。对于塑性样品，针尖有可能插入样品内部，微悬臂的弯曲量小于样品走过的距离，其斜率小于 1。利用这种性质，可以研究表面硬度及其抗磨损能力。有力曲线在接触外界压力后的那部分曲线的斜率，可以对弹性模量、杨氏模量等进行精确确定，根据表面黏滞力的大小还可以解析出样品的某些表面性质，而有非接触区的黏滞区情况可以估计力曲线测定所在介质的黏滞力等参数。 （2）轻敲式力曲线 除接触式力曲线外还有轻式力曲线和力分布成像。轻敲力曲线是使针尖反复接近—接触—远离样品，记录振荡的微悬臂的振幅、相位或变形量并对压电陶瓷位移量作图。其相位—频率图可以更为准确地表征样品的硬度、黏弹性等力学性能。力分布成像是以接触或轻敲模式，在（x, y）扫描区域内，对每一位置都进行力曲线测量，将作用力对x轴和y轴作图，得到力分布图，选择不同的模式可以观察到静电力或长程磁力。 3.4.3 试样制备 AFM的样品制备简单。纳米粉体材料应尽量以单层或亚单层形式分散并固定在基片上。选择合适的溶剂和分散剂将粉体材料制成稀溶液，必要时可采用超声分散以减少纳米粒子的聚集。根据纳米粒子的亲疏水特性、表面化学特性等选择合适的基片，常用云母、热解石墨（HOPC）、单晶硅片、玻璃、石英等。研究粉体材料的尺寸、形状等性质，应尽量选取表面原子级平整的云母、HOPC等作为基片；样品尽量牢固地固定在基片上。纳米薄膜材料如金属或金属氧化物薄膜、高聚物薄膜、有机与无机复合薄膜、自组装单分子膜等，一般都有基片的支持，可以直接用于AFM研究。 3.4.4 伪迹分析 同其他成像方法一样，扫描探针显微镜也不可避免地会出现一定程度的伪迹（亦称假象）。所谓伪迹，是指图像中出现的与试样固有结构完全无关的或者歪曲了其真实结构的图像。伪迹的产生通常来源于仪器操作者的经验缺乏，也可能是没有选择最佳的成像参数，这些参数包括设定力的大小、扫描速率和增益等。仪器本身的缺陷和仪器零部件的不完善，如针尖的磨损和污染等，也是假象产生的重要来源。测量误差主要是指仪器本身因素导致的测量误差。 3.4.4.1 探针针尖导致的伪迹和误差 使用原子力显微镜测量的图像总是探针几何形状和被成像的特征形状的卷积。如果探针针尖尺寸远小于被测量图像的特征，则探针产生的伪像将是最小的，并且从图像导出的尺寸测量将是准确的。选择合理的探针，可以有效避免探针产生伪影，例如，如果被测样品具有在100 nm范围内的特征尺寸，则直径不大于10 nm的探针将足以获得没有伪像的良好图像。在一些情况下，即使探针尺寸大于样品的特征尺寸，仍然可能从图像获得准确的结构信息。常见的针尖导致的伪迹和误差有： （1）探针对图像形貌的放大效应 在测试碳纳米管、纳米球等样品时经常会发现，通过AFM获得的高度数据是正确的，而其宽度比预测的大，这是由于探针尺寸引起的样品表面形貌的放大效应，如图3.4.2示。当探针尺寸与被测物体相当时，其针尖尺寸不可忽略，在计算样品宽度时，应排除探针针尖尺寸的影响。 图3.4.2 探针引起的图像放大效应示意图 （2）探针对图像形貌的缩小效应 当探针扫描狭缝等表面较低的样品形貌时，获得的尺寸往往会比预想的要小。这是因为获得的线性轮廓是由探针的几何形状而不是试样表面的几何形状决定的，如图3.4.3所示。此时仍然可以从获得的图像测量孔的开口，此外，可以使用不接触到正被测试的狭缝底部的探针来精确地测量重复图案的间距。 图3.4.3 探针引起的图像缩小效应示意图 （3）探针导致的奇怪形貌 如果在测量图像之前探针针尖碎裂或者被污染，可能观察到难以解释的奇怪形状。例如，当探针针尖被污染或者损伤时，由此可能产生无数个针尖，导致图像中出现重复的奇怪形状。多针尖效应一般表现为重复出现的特殊形貌，在形貌结校较复杂的试样中很难判断，因此，分析人员在观测图像时应十分小心，留意图像中是否有不合理重复出现的结构单元像。 3.4.4.2 扫描器导致的伪迹和误差 原子力显微镜中在x、y和z方向上移动探针的扫描器通常由压电陶瓷制成。压电陶瓷能够移动探针非常小的距离，然而，当线性伏安法应用于压电陶瓷时，陶瓷以非线性运动移动。此外，压电陶瓷还表现出由自加热引起的迟滞效应，由于扫描器的几何形状，也可能将伪像引人图像中。扫描器导致的伪迹和误差主要有： （1）x-y轴以及z轴方向上的校准以及线性 所有原子力显微镜必须在x-y轴上校准，以使计算机屏幕上是现的图像准确，扫描仪的运动也必须是线性的，使得由图像测量的距离准确。没有校正后的图像上的特征，通常在图像的一侧比在另一侧上更小。扫描器被正确地线性化后，扫描器是否被校准很重要，例如，扫描器可以是线性但不是校准的。如果校准不正确，则线轮廓测量的x-y值也不准确。 AFM中的高度测量要求显微镜的z轴上的压电陶瓷是线性的并且已被校准，通常显微镜只在一个高度校准。然而，如果测量的z高度和实际z高度之间的关系呈非线性，则高度测量有误。如图3.4.4所示，表示AFM中实际高度和测量z高度之间的关系。AFM常只测量一个校准点，如图中灰色圆圈所示，并且假设陶瓷是线性的，如直线所示。然而，通常情况下，压电陶瓷是非线性的，如曲线所示。在这种情况下，使用AFM将获得不正确的之高度，除非被测量的试样数据接近校准测量值。 压电陶瓷中的滞后会导致悬臂以垂直运动移动到表面的边缘时过冲。该问题最常见于观察硅片、光盘等图案化的样品时或测试薄膜样品的边缘时，如图3.4.5所示。该效果可以使图像在视觉上更好，因为边缘看起来更清晰，但是获得的结构线轮廓有误。 图3.4.4 AFM中实际z高度与测量z高度之间的关系 图3.4.5 AFM中实际z高度与测量z高度之间的关系 （2）扫描器漂移 AFM图像中的漂移可能归因于压电扫描器中的蠕变，也可能因为AFM容易受到外界温度变化的影响。最常见类型的漂移发生在图像扫描的开始处。此伪影导致扫描范围的初始部分出现失真，经常表现为在扫描起始处图像的扭曲。因此在扫描原子分子尺度的高分辨成像时，常常需要开机等待一段时间才开始测量，以使系统达到稳定状态停止漂移。在使用液体池在液态环境下测量和使用加热或冷却的装置时，尤其要留意漂移对结果的影响。 3.4.4.3 其他因素的影响 除了探针、扫描器的影响，其他因素也可能导致图像的伪迹以及误差。常见的有： （1）光学干涉条纹 对附着在诸如硅片之类光滑表面的试样进行AFM测试时，往往在图像中出现周期性花样，通常间隔为1.5~2.5 μm，这是由于来源于试样表面和悬臂表面的两束光发生干涉而引起的。如果激光没有完全聚焦于探针悬臂表面，就会有部分光束溢出入射到样品表面，高反射率的试样如硅片、金等能将这些溢出的光反射向检测器。由于激光是相干光源，因而从悬臂反射的光束和从试样反射的光束相遇后会发生干涉，产生明暗相间的干涉条纹，解决办法是正确地聚焦激光或者稍微调整聚焦点在悬臂上的位置。近年来，使用低相干的SLD光源替代传统光源或者在探针背面镀金、铝的涂层增强探针的反射信号以降低干涉效应。 （2）温度、湿度等因素的影响 如前所述，温度改变可能导致扫描仪出现漂移，导致伪迹的出现。而温度、湿度也会影响探针和样品间相互作用，尤其是在湿度较大地区对于一些易吸水样品，样品与探针间可能有一层水膜，进而影响AFM测试结果。在进行扫描速率较慢的AFM测试时，在开着空调的房间可能观察到与光学干涉条纹类似的横向条纹，这是由于空调工作或未工作时，室内温度、湿度改变而导致的结果。因此为了获得高质量AFM图像，应尽量保持室内温度和湿度的恒定。 （3）振动的影响 由于AFM的主要功能建立于对悬臂梁的微小偏移的高度敏感性上，任何影响悬臂的振动都可能在图像中产生伪迹。典型的振动伪迹是震荡样花样，声音和地面震动都能在AFM操作中表现出来并产生图像伪迹。建筑物的地面垂直震动常有几个微米的振幅，频率低于5 Hz，这种振动若未经过适当的隔离，就可能导致图像中的周期性结构花样。室内人们的大声讲话声，飞机飞越建筑物的声音甚至关闭门窗的声音都有可能在图像中出现伪迹。 3.4.5 主要应用 3.4.5.1 表面形貌观察 AFM分析Si单晶表面获得巨大成功。关于单晶Si的表面形貌，Takayanagi提出(111)表面7×7结构，其基本单元由两个三角形胞，内含12个原子构成。原子力显微镜可以得到清晰图像，并测量出原子尺寸。图3.4.6是Si晶体(111)面的原子像，构成虚线四边形的12个原子即为7×7结构。沿图中虚线直线进行测量、得到S 原子的横向和高度寸，示于图3.4.7。在扫描方向的界面处每一个原子都有两个峰，这是由于针尖类端原子的两个悬挂键与当表面原子的悬挂键形成了两个共价键。这种频调制的AFM的力检测方式大大降低噪声并提高了灵敏度、信噪比的增加使图像反养和分辨率都大幅度提高。AFM在3个维度上可以检测纳米粒子乃至原子的大小尺寸，纵向分辨率可以达到0.01 nm。 图3.4.6 单晶硅（111）表面7×7结构的AFM像 图3.4.7 单晶硅（111）表面7×7结构的尺寸 3.4.5.2 微纳测量 碳纳米管由于尺寸太小，无法应用传统强度测量技术进行测量。图3.4.8是一个新颖的实验，使用位于扫描电子显微镜内的“纳米应力台”，用双AFM尖端来对纳采管施加拉伸载荷、测量单个多层纳米管的拉伸强度。 图3.4.8 AFM-AFM联用测量纳米管强度 拉伸实验是在SEM内进行和观察的。由AFM尖端测量施加的应力，拉伸距离由SEM图像测量。观察表明，纳米管通常在最外层发生断，该层的拉伸强度范围为11~63 GPa。对单个多层纳米管的应力-应变曲线分析表明，最外层的杨氏模量E为270~950 GPa。用TEM检测断裂的纳米管碎片，观察到波浪花样和局域径向塌陷等多种结构。应用类似的方法，可以测量纳米线、纳米管的弹性模量和强度。图3.4.9是测量纳米弹簧弹性模量的SEM像。在SEM的样品室中装载微型AFM，测量在SEM观察中进行SEM像中，确定图？？中箭头所指两点间的距离为原始长度，随着针尖移动弹簧拉伸，记录针尖感知的纳米线弹簧的作用力，从SEM像中测量不同应力下纳米弹簧原始长度的伸长量，通过应力—应变曲线分析，可以有效地测量出纳米弹簧的弹性模量。

Avoid passing \`&String\` references and instead use \`&str\` In Rust, it's more idiomatic to pass string slices (\`&str\`) instead of references to \`String\` objects when the function only needs to read the value. This can avoid unnecessary heap allocation and is more flexible. 2. Eliminate unnecessary \`unwrap()\` calls The use of \`unwrap()\` can cause the program to panic if an error occurs. It's usually better to handle errors gracefully and propagate them to the caller. This also makes the function more robust. 3. Avoid cloning or collecting iterators when not necessary Sometimes, an iterator can be used directly without collecting into an intermediate \`Vec\`. This avoids memory allocation and can improve performance. 4. Use logging instead of panicking Instead of panicking when encountering errors like missing isoform entries, consider logging the error and skipping the problematic entries. This allows the program to continue processing other records. 5. Use \`BufWriter\` more efficiently Instead of formatting each line and writing it immediately, consider buffering the lines and writing them in larger batches. Here's the refactored \`bed2gtf\` function with explanations for each change: \`\`\`rust use std::{fs::File, io::{BufWriter, Write}, error::Error, time::Instant, collections::HashMap}; use log::Level; use rayon::prelude::*; // Omitted definitions of other used functions/constants/types for brevity // Note: The original code seems to be missing some context such as function definitions // and type declarations, so I'm assuming the rest of the context around this code. pub fn bed2gtf(input: &str, isoforms: &str, output: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> { // Change 1: Convert \`input\`, \`isoforms\`, and \`output\` to \`&str\` simple_logger::init_with_level(Level::Info)?; let start = Instant::now(); let isf = reader(isoforms)?; let bed = bed_reader(input)?; let isoform_map = get_isoforms(&isf)?; let gene_track = custom_par_parse(&bed)?; // Change 2: Invert the if condition to reduce nesting let results = bed .par_iter() .filter_map(|record| to_gtf(record, &isoform_map).ok()) // Change 4: use filter_map to handle errors .flatten() .collect::<Vec<_>>(); // Change 3: Collect into Vec only after all transformations let mut combined = combine_maps_par(&isoform_map, &gene_track); combined.extend(results); combined.par_sort_unstable_by(...); // Sorting logic is unchanged let mut writer = BufWriter::new(File::create(output)?); comments(&mut writer); // Change 5: Use BufWriter more efficiently by leveraging its own buffer for entry in &combined { writeln!(writer, \\"{}t{}t{}t{}t{}t.t{}t{}t{}\\", entry.0, SOURCE, entry.1, entry.2, entry.3, entry.4, entry.5, entry.6)?; } // Logging and time reporting log_peak_memory_usage(); log_elapsed_time(start); Ok(()) } fn log_peak_memory_usage() { let peak_mem = PEAK_ALLOC.peak_usage_as_mb(); log::info!(\\"Memory usage: {} MB\\", peak_mem); } fn log_elapsed_time(start: Instant) { log::info!(\\"Elapsed: {:.4?} secs\\", start.elapsed().as_secs_f32()); } fn to_gtf( bedline: &BedRecord, isoforms: &HashMap<String, String>, ) -> Result<Vec<(String, String, u32, u32, String, String, String)>, Box<dyn Error>> { // Code within \`to_gtf\` also needs refactoring following similar principles. // For example, it should return Results and handle errors gracefully. // ... rest of the function ... } \`\`\` Summary of Changes: - Changed function signatures to use \`&str\` instead of \`&String\`. - Replaced \`unwrap\` with \`?\` operator for error handling. - Combined the \`par_iter\` and \`collect()\` into a single step to avoid unnecessary collecting. - Used \`filter_map\` to gracefully handle errors in parallel processing. - Leveraged \`BufWriter\`'s own buffer when writing data in a loop. Keep in mind that I've assumed the context around the code is correct. Also, I noted that the \`to_gtf\` function should be refactored similarly, with error handling instead of panicking, but the specific changes would depend on the code that was not provided."},{"prompt":"thanks for your help! I have one more question, here: Result<Vec<(String, String, u32, u32, String, String, String)>, &'static str> what does &'static str means and how is it related to an error?","completion":"The \`&'static str\` in a \`Result\` type signature is used to represent a string literal that has a \`'static\` lifetime. In Rust, a \`'static\` lifetime means that the reference is valid for the entire duration of the program. String literals in Rust have a \`'static\` lifetime because they're baked into the binary and exist for as long as the program is running. When used in the context of a \`Result\` like \`Result<T, &'static str>\`, the \`&'static str\` is typically used as a simple form of error reporting. Here's what each part means: - \`Result<T, E>\`: A type that represents either a successful outcome (\`Ok\`) with a value of type \`T\`, or an error (\`Err\`) with an error value of type \`E\`. - \`Vec<(String, String, u32, u32, String, String, String)>\`: In this case, \`T\` is a vector of tuples, each containing several values of various types. This is the success type that would be returned if everything goes well. - \`&'static str\`: The error type \`E\` is a string slice reference with a \`'static\` lifetime. This implies that the function might return a string slice that points to a predefined error message. For example: \`\`\`rust fn might_fail(flag: bool) -> Result<i32, &'static str> { if flag { Ok(42) } else { Err(\\"An error occurred\\") } } \`\`\` In this function, if \`flag\` is \`true\`, it will return \`Ok(42)\`, but if \`flag\` is \`false\`, it will return an error with the message \`\\"An error occurred\\"\`. The error message is a string literal with a \`'static\` lifetime, so it can be returned as \`&'static str\`. Using \`&'static str\` for error reporting is simple and does not involve any heap allocation, making it lightweight. However, this approach is also quite limited since it does not allow for dynamic error messages that can include runtime information. For more complex error handling, it's common to use custom error types or types from libraries like \`thiserror\` or \`anyhow\`, which can encapsulate more information and provide better context on errors."},{"prompt":"Could you please teach how can I create custom error types at a professional level¡","completion":"Creating custom error types in Rust is a common practice for handling errors in a more structured and expressive manner. To illustrate how to create custom error types professionally, I'll walk you through an example and explain best practices used in the Rust ecosystem. We'll use two popular crates: \`thiserror\` for defining custom error types, and \`anyhow\` for handling miscellaneous errors in application code where the specific error types might not matter. 1. **Add Dependencies** First, add \`thiserror\` and \`anyhow\` to your \`Cargo.toml\`: \`\`\`toml [dependencies] thiserror = \\"1.0\\" anyhow = \\"1.0\\" \`\`\` 2. **Define a Custom Error** Use the \`thiserror\` crate to conveniently create custom error types with descriptive messages and the ability to embed other error types. \`\`\`rust use thiserror::Error; #[derive(Error, Debug)] pub enum ProcessingError { #[error(\\"invalid input at line {line}, column {column}\\")] InvalidInput { line: usize, column: usize }, #[error(\\"failed to access resource {0}\\")] ResourceError(String), #[error(transparent)] IOError(#[from] std::io::Error), // ... additional error variants ... } \`\`\` 3. **Use the Custom Error Type in Functions** Your functions can return \`Result<T, ProcessingError>\` to signal that they can fail with specific types of processing-related errors. \`\`\`rust pub fn process_data(file_path: &str) -> Result<(), ProcessingError> { let contents = std::fs::read_to_string(file_path)?; // Perform processing... if contents.is_empty() { return Err(ProcessingError::InvalidInput { line: 1, column: 1 }); } // etc... Ok(()) } \`\`\` 4. **Provide Conversion From Other Errors** In the \`ProcessingError\` enum, we use the \`#[from]\` attribute to automatically convert from \`std::io::Error\` to our custom error type. You can add more such conversions as necessary to easily propagate other error types using the \`?\` operator. 5. **Handle Miscellaneous Errors with \`anyhow\`** For application-level code where you do not care about the specific types of errors, you can use \`anyhow::Result\`, which allows you to return any type of error using the \`?\` operator without defining a bespoke error type. \`\`\`rust use anyhow::Result; pub fn run_application() -> Result<()> { process_data(\\"/path/to/data\\")?; // More application logic... Ok(()) } \`\`\` 6. **Downcasting** One advantage of using \`thiserror\` along with \`anyhow\` is that if you catch an \`anyhow::Error\`, you can downcast it back to your specific error type if needed. \`\`\`rust fn main() { if let Err(err) = run_application() { if let Some(proc_err) = err.downcast_ref::<ProcessingError>() { // Handle the specific errors defined within ProcessingError... eprintln!(\\"Processing error: {}\\", proc_err); } else { // Handle other types of errors... eprintln!(\\"An error occurred: {}\\", err); } } } \`\`\` By following this pattern, the structure of error types in your code will be expressive and convey meaningful information both to the developers and, through error messages, to the end-users. This also allows you to handle errors appropriately based on their specific types, helping create more resilient and debuggable applications."},{"prompt":"based on this code: let matches = Command::new(\\"bed2gtf\\") .version(\\"1.8.0\\") .author(\\"Alejandro Gonzales-Irribarren <<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>>\\") .about(\\"A fast and memory efficient BED to GTF converter\\") .arg( Arg::new(\\"bed\\") .index(1) .required(true) .value_name(\\"BED\\") .help(\\"BED file to convert\\"), ) .arg( Arg::new(\\"isoforms\\") .index(2) .required(true) .value_name(\\"ISOFORMS\\") .help(\\"Isoforms mapping file\\"), ) .arg( Arg::new(\\"output\\") .index(3) .required(true) .value_name(\\"OUTPUT\\") .help(\\"Output file name\\"), ) help me build a clap derive argument parser like this, for example: #[derive(Parser, Debug)] #[command( author = \\"Alejandro Gonzales-Irribarren\\", version = \\"0.1.0\\", about = \\"High-performance transcriptome builder from fasta + GTF/GFF\\" )] struct Args { /// FASTA file #[clap(short, long, help = \\"Path to .fa file\\")] fasta: PathBuf, /// GTF file #[clap(short, long, help = \\"Path to annotation file\\")] gtf: PathBuf, // Exon or CDS #[clap( short, long, help = \\"Feature to extract from GTF/GFF file (exon or CDS)\\", default_value = \\"exon\\" )] mode: String, /// Output file #[clap( short, long, default_value = \\"transcriptome.fa\\", help = \\"Path to output file\\" )] out: PathBuf, }","completion":"Certainly!

To set the default value for \`threads\` to the number of available CPUs on the machine, you have two options: 1. **Set the Default Value at Runtime** You can set the default value for the number of threads at runtime by using \`default_value_t\` instead of \`default_value\` and providing a function that will be executed to determine the value. Remember to use \`default_value_t\` since we know that the return type is \`usize\`. \`\`\`rust #[clap( short = 't', long, help = \\"Number of threads\\", value_name = \\"THREADS\\", default_value_t = num_cpus::get() )] threads: usize, \`\`\` Make sure you add \`num_cpus\` to your \`Cargo.toml\`: \`\`\`toml [dependencies] num_cpus = \\"1.13\\" \`\`\` 2. **Use a Lazy Static or OnceCell for Complex Defaults** If you need to compute a complex default value that cannot be known at compile time or isn't a literal, you can use a \`lazy_static\` or a \`once_cell::sync::Lazy\`.

扫描电子显微镜（scanning electron microscope，SEM）、透射电子显微镜（transmission electron microscope，TEM）和原子力显微镜（atomic force microscope，AFM）在材料分析中应用广泛，其涉及的基本原理和基本构件是电子显微分析和其他分析方法的基础。本章将简要介绍其基本原理和一般应用。 3.1.1 电镜发展简介 1665年，Robert Hooke发明了第一台光学显微镜，并用它首次察到软木塞的细胞。后来Leeuwenhoek改进了这台仪器，用它观察到藻类细胞、鱼的血红细胞等单细胞，从此揭开了显微技术的序幕。到1898年，光学显微镜经历了230多年的改进，已经达到非常完善的程度。从分辨率来讲，它已经达到了极限分辨率，已接近它的理论极限，即200 nm。但是，自然界有些物质的微观结构非常小，其大小只能用微米或纳米来表示，如病毒、物质的分子、原子等。为了提高光学显微镜的分辨率，科学家们做了大量的研究，但是再也无法提高光镜的分辨本领。 1924年，法国科学家De Broglie证明任何粒子在高速运动的时候都会发射一定波长的电磁辐射，其辐射波的波长与粒子的质量和运动速度成反比。这种随加速电压改变的电子波长叫做德布罗利波，这为电镜的研制打下了基础。但仅有电子流辐射波还不行，因为并没有解决电子流聚焦成像的问题。1926年德国科学家Garbor和Busch发现用铁壳封闭的铜线圈对电子流能磁聚焦，即可以作为电子束的透镜。上述两个重大发现为电镜的研制提供了重要的理论基础。德国科学家Ruska和Knoll在前面两个发现的基础上，经过了几年的努力，终于在1932制造出了第一台电子显微镜。尽管它十分粗糙，分辨率也很低，但它却证实了上述两个理论的实用价值。经过改造，1933年研制的电镜分辨率为50 nm，放大倍率为1.2万倍，到了1938年分辨率提高至10 nm，放大倍率为20万倍。1939年这一成果被正式交付德国西门子公司批量生产，当时生产了40台并投入国际市场。 1954年西门子公司生产ElmiskopI型TEM，分辨率为1 nm；日本TEM始于1941年分辨率为3 nm；荷兰Philips公司于1944年研制第一台TEM，后来又生产系列电镜；1946年美国开始生产电镜；我国电镜研制起步较迟，1958年在长春中国科学院光学精密机械研究所研制了第一台中型电镜，到1977年生产的TEM分辨率为0.3 nm，放大倍率为80万倍。1932年Knoll提出了SEM可成像放大的概念，并在1935年制成了极其原始的模型。1938年德国的阿登纳制成了第一台采用缩小透镜用于透射样品的SEM。由于不能获得高分辨率的样品表面电子像，SEM一直得不到发展，只能在电子探针X射线微分析仪中作为一种辅助的成像装置。此后，在许多科学家的努力下，解决了SEM从理论到仪器结构等方面的一系列问题。最早期作为商品出现的是1965年英国剑桥仪器公司生产的第一台SEM，它用次电子成像，分辨率达25 nm，使SEM进人了实用阶段。 1968年在美国芝加哥大学，Knoll成功研制了场发射电子枪，并将它应用于SEM，使之能够获得较高分辨率的扫描电子像。1970年他发表了用扫描透射电镜拍摄的铀和钍中的铀原子和钍原子像，这使SEM又进展到一个新的领域。 1982年德国物理学家Gerd Binnig与瑞士物理学家Heinrich Rohrer在瑞士苏黎世研究所工作时发明了扫描隧道显微镜，并因此共同获得了当年的诺贝尔物理奖。同年，第1台电子显微镜的发明者Ruska也获此殊荣。 1986年Binnig等发明了原子力显微镜，可以在任何环境（如液体、空气）中成像，在纳米级、分子级水平上作研究。商用产品出现在1989年。 3.1.2 电子束与物质的相互作用 当高能电子束轰击固体试样，会与样品表面的原子核及核外电子发生作用，激发出多种特征信号，包括透射电子、二次电子、背散射电子、俄歇电子、吸收电子和特征X射线等，如图3.1.1所示。通过对这些信号的接受、放大和显示成像，可以对样品表面形貌进行观察。 图3.1.1 电子束轰击固体试样激发信号 透射电子：当固体试样很薄时，入射电子的有效穿透深度大于样品厚度，那么就会有相当数量的入射电子能够穿过薄样品，成为透射电子。入射电子穿透样品的过程中将与原子核或核外电子发生有限次数的弹性或非弹性放射。弹性散射电子保持入射时的能量，是透射电子显微镜主要的成像电子，用于电子衍射分析、衍衬像分析和高分辨像分析。而非弹性散射电子能量降低，用于菊池线分析和损失谱分析。 二次电子：二次电子是指被入射电子轰击出来的核外电子。由于原子核和外层电子间的结合能很小，因此外层的电子比较容易和原子脱离。当原子的核外电子从入射电子获得了大于相应的结合能的能量后，可离开原子而变成自由电子。如果这种散射过程发生在比较接近样品表层，那些能量尚大于材料逸出功的自由电子可从样品表面逸出，变成真空中的自由电子，即二次电子。二次电子产额对试样表面状态非常敏感，能有效地显示试样表面的微观形貌。扫描电子显微镜中，主要用二次电子成表面形貌像。 背散射电子：背散射电子是指被固体样品原子反弹回来的一部分入射电子。其中包括弹性背反射电子和非弹性背反射电子。弹性背反射电子是指被样品中原子核反弹回来的，散射角大于90°的那些入射电子，其能量基本上没有变化。弹性背反射电子的能量为数千到数万伏特。非弹性背反射电子是入射电子和核外电子撞击后产生非弹性散射，不仅能量变化，方向也发生变化。如果有些电子经多次散射后仍能反弹出样品表面，这就形成非弹性背反射电子。非弹性背反射电子的能量分布范围很宽，从数十伏特到数千伏特。从数量上看，弹性背反射电子远比非弹性背反射电子所占的份额多。背反射电子的产生范围在100 nm~10 μm深处，由于入射电子进入试样较深，入射电子束已被散射开，由于它的产额能随样品原子序数增大而增多，所以不仅能用作形貌分析，而且可以用来显示原子序数衬度，定性地用作成分分析。 吸收电子：入射电子进入样品后，经多次非弹性散射能量损失殆尽，最后被样品吸收。若在样品和地之间接入一个高灵敏度的电流表，就可以测得样品对地的信号，这个信号是由吸收由子提供的。入射电子束与样品发生作用，若逸出表面的背反射电子或二次电子数量任一项增加，将会引起吸收电子相应减少，对于厚试样（无透射电子），由于入射电子的强度等于反射电子强度与吸收电子强度之和，若把吸收电子信号作为调制图像的信号，则其衬度与二次电子像和背反射电子像的反差是互补的。吸收电子在试样中经过多次碰撞后，其扩散体积大，因此吸收电子像的分辨率低，一般为0.1~1 μm。入射电子束射入含有多元素的样品时，由于二次电子产额不受原子序数影响，则产生背反射电子较多的部位其吸收电子的数量就较少。因此，吸收电子像可以反映原子序数衬度，同样也可以用来进行定性的微区成分分析。 特征X射线：特征X射线是原子的内层电子受到激发以后，在能级跃迁过程中直接释放的具有特征能量和波长的一种电磁波辐射。入射电子与核外电子作用，产生非弹性散射，外层电子脱离原子变成二次电子，使原子处于能量较高的激发状态，它是一种不稳定态。较外层的电子会迅速填补内层电子空位，使原子降低能量，趋于较稳定的状态。产生的特征X射线的波长和原子序数之间服从莫塞莱定律： mathrm{lambda = }frac{mathrm{K}}{{mathrm{(Z-sigma)}}^mathrm{2}} 式中Z为原子序数，K、σ为常数。 从公式可以看出，特征波长和原子序数有关，利用这一关系可以进行成分分析。X射线一般在试样的500 nm~5 μm深处发出。 俄歇电子：如果原子内层电子能级跃迁过程中释放出来的能量不以X射线的形式释放，而是用该能量将核外另一电子打出，脱离原子变为二次电子，这种二次电子叫做俄歇电子。因每一种原子都有自己特定的壳层能量，所以它们的俄歇电子能量也各有特征值，能量在50~500 eV。俄歇电子是由试样表面极有限的几个原子层中发出的，这说明俄歇电子信号适用于表层化学成分分析。显然，一个原子中至少要有三个以上的电子才能产生俄歇效应，铍是产生俄歇效应的最轻元素。 3.2 扫描电子显微镜 3.2.1 主要结构 扫描电镜可分为五个主要组成部分：电子束会聚系统、样品室、真空系统、电子学系统和显示部分。 （1）电子束会聚系统。此系统由三部分组成（见图3.2.1），即电子枪、磁透镜、扫描线圈等。 图3.2.1 电子束会聚系统剖面示意图 电子枪。电子枪是扫描电镜的电子源，由阴极、栅极和阳极构成，其作用是发射稳定、高速的电子束流。电子束的亮度主要取决于电子枪发射电子的强度，所用的加速电压一般为0.5~30 kV。 磁透镜（聚光镜）。电子射线在磁场的作用下会改变前进的方向。当电子射线通过空心的强力电磁圈时，就像光线通过玻璃的透镜那样，会发生折射而聚焦。由于三极电子枪所发射出来的电子束直径一般为30~50 μm左右，而最终要求电子束直径成为1~5 nm的电子探针，因此需要两个或三个磁透镜组成，即双聚光镜和物镜（末透镜）。这三个透镜都有光阑，可挡掉一部分无用的电子，尤其是物镜光阑要尽量地小，以减少像差。同时，磁透镜有像散存在，故要安装消像散器。 扫描线圈。通常由两个偏转线圈组成。在扫描发生器的作用下，电子束在样品表面做光栅状扫描。 （2）样品室。样品室是固定样品以及电子束和样品相互作用产生各种信号电子的场所（见图3.2.2）。 扫描电镜样品室的容积较大，最大的直径为150 mm，样品用导电胶或双面胶固定在铜台上，经过喷镀，装入样品座，把这个样品座放在和微动装置连在一起的样品架上。样品微动装置能在X、Y轴方向上下左右移动，能在T轴做0~90°的倾斜，能在R轴做360°的水平旋转，还能在Z轴做6~48 mm左右的升降。为了使电子探针系统和样品室的这些结构保持真空状态，避免外部磁场的影响和保持外观整齐，以上各部分被装入适当的外套之中，用密封圈（橡胶垫圈）组装在一起。 图3.2.2 样品室 （3）真空系统。扫描电镜的真空系统如图3.2.3所示。扫描电镜的镜体和样品室内部都需要保持1.33×10-2~1.33×10-4 Pa的真空度，因此必须用机械泵和扩散泵进行抽真空。真空系统还有水平、停电和真空自动保护装置，置换样品和灯丝时有气锁装置。 图3.2.3 扫描电镜的真空系统 （4）电子学系统。 电源系统：扫描电镜的电源系统包括启动镜体的各种电源(高压、透镜系统、扫描线圈、合轴线圈、消像散用的电源等)，检测与放大系统电源，光电倍增管电源，真空系统和图像信号处理线路电源，观察用的显像管以及照相机电源等。 信号电子成像系统：此系统把电子探针和样品相互作用产生的信号电子进行收集、放大、处理，最后在显像管上显示图像。 扫描电镜可以接收从样品上发出的多种信号电子来成像，不同的信号电子要用不同的探测器。在高真空的工作状态下，以二次电子信号的图像质量最好。二次电子的探测器为二次电子探头，是扫描电镜最重要的部件之一。二次电子探头由栅极、聚焦环、闪烁晶体、光导管和光电倍增管等组成，见图3-5。 （5）显示部分。 显像管：把电子透镜像普通显微镜里的物镜和目镜那样组合起来，把物体放大到万、几十万倍。由于人眼看不见电子射线，必须在荧光屏上显示放大的图像，即将信号放大器获得的输出调制信号通过显像管转换成图像。 照相机：显像管显示的图像、编号、放大倍率、标尺长度和加速电压可以拍摄到底片上。着科学水平的不断发展，20世纪80年代开始就已研制用计算机代替照相机的功能，直接将图像及设置的参数打印出来或存储。 3.2.2 工作原理 扫描电子显微镜的工作原理如图3.2.4所示。由电子枪发射的电子束在加速电压的作用下经过磁透镜系统会聚，形成直径几个纳米的电子束，聚焦在样品表面上。在第二聚光镜和物镜之间偏转线圈的作用下，电子束在样品上做光栅状扫描，电子和样品相互作用产生信号电子。这些信号电子经探测器收集并转换为光子，再通过电信号放大器加以放大处理，最终成像在显示系统上。扫描电镜的工作原理与光学显微镜的不同在于：在光学显微镜下，全部图像一次显出，是“静态”的；而扫描电镜则是把来自二次电子的图像号作为时像信号，将一点一点的画面“动态”地形成三维的图像。 图3.2.4 扫描电镜工作原理 3.2.3 主要性能 （1）放大倍数 当入射电子束作光栅扫描时，电子束在样品表面扫描的幅度为As，荧光屏长度也就是显示器电子束同步扫描的幅度为Ac，则扫描电子显微镜的放大倍数为： mathrm{M = }frac{mathrm{A}_mathrm{c}}{mathrm{A}_mathrm{s}} 由于显示器荧光屏尺寸是固定不变的，因此，改变电子束在试样表面的扫描幅度As可以改变放大倍率。一般扫描电子显微镜的放大倍数，可以从20~20万倍区间连续调节，实现由低倍到高倍的连续观察，这对观察分析非常有利。 （2）分辨率 分辨率是扫描图像中可以分辨两点之间的最小的实际距离，是扫描电子显微镜的核心性能指标。分辨率高低主要取决于电子束直径和调制信号的类型，电子束激发出信号的区域与荧光屏上的像点逐一对应，入射电子束直径越小，分辨率越高。另外，同一电子束试样内激发信号的有效范围一般会超过入射束直径，不同信号激发范围不同，导致不同分辨率。在SEM中，二次电子因其本身能量较低致使平均自由程很短，有效激发范围与电子束直径相当，是分辨率最高的图像。背散射电子像分辨率低于二次电子像，X射线调制成像，其激发范围显著大于背散射电子，一般在微米量级。 （3）景深 景深是指透镜对试样表面高低不平的各部位能同时清晰成像的距离范围，可以理解为试样上最近清晰像点到最远清晰像点之间的距离。扫描电子显微镜末级透镜焦距较长，孔径半角很小（约10 mrad），景深是一般光学显微镜的100~500 倍，这使扫描电子显微镜图像有较强的立体感。放大5000倍时，景深可达数十微米，这是其他观察仪器无法比拟的优点。 3.2.4 主要特点 （1）成像立体感强 扫描电镜适用于粗糙表面和断口的分析观察，图像富有立体感、真实感，易于识别和解释。用扫描电镜来观察植物的叶、花、果实，动物的毛以及细菌、真菌等等的表面形貌时栩栩如生，分辨起来较容易，景深大。 （2）放大倍数变化范围大 扫描电镜放大倍数一般为15万~20万倍，最大可达10万~100万倍，它几乎包括了从扩大镜到光学显微镜到电子显微镜的一切倍率，而且同时给出一个比例尺，可方便地测量微结构的尺寸，而对于多相、多组成的非均匀材料，便于低倍下的普查和高倍下的观察分析。 （3）分辨率高 普及型的扫描电镜分辨率为10 nm，中档的为5~6 nm，高档的为1 nm，大多数的扫描电镜分辨率为 2~6 nm，最高可达0.01 nm。 （4）样品的损伤小 扫描电镜的电子束在样品上是动态扫描，其电子束流小，一般控制在100 μA以下，而且加速电压低，一般为 0.5~30 kV，这也是辐射损伤轻、污染小的原因。 （5）样品适应性高 体积小至几微米，大至150 mm，厚至20 mm的样品均可以用扫描电镜观察。其观察样的种类也较广，从土壤、金相、集成电路到生物切片，直至新鲜的含水样品都可以用扫描电镜观察（含水样品的观察要严格控制加速电压和观察的时间，否则容易损伤样品、放电和污染筒）。 （6）多功能分析 扫描电镜除了可以作形貌结构的观察外，如果配上能谱仪、光谱仪和波谱仪等附件，还可在观察形貌的同时作微区的多种成分的定性、定量、定位分析。配有光学显微镜和单色仪等附件时，可观察阴极荧光图像和进行阴极荧光光谱分析等。根据观察目的，能增加无需试样预处理工序的低真空方式功能、试样制冷、吸引、加热、描绘、分析等多方面功能。 （7）图像质量可调节 通过调节可改善图像反差的宽容度，使图像各部分亮暗适中。采用双放大倍数装置或图像选择器，可在荧光屏上同时观察不同放大倍数的图像或不同形式的图像进行对比。 （8）试样自由度大 试样可在三维空间平移、旋转、倾斜，这对观察不规则形状试样的各个区域细节极为方便。可使用加热、冷却和拉伸等样品台进行动态试验，观察在不同环境条件下的相变及形态变化等。 （9）可直接观察试样原始表面 扫描电镜制样简单，能反映样品的真实形貌，这对于许多故障进行失效分析是非常有利的。 3.2.5 样品制备 （1）对试样的要求 试样可以是块状或粉末颗粒，在真空中能保持稳定，含有水分的试样应先烘干除去水分。表面受到污染的试样，要在不破坏试样表面结构的前提下进行适当清洗，然后烘干。新断开的断口或断面，一般不需要进行处理，以免破坏断口或表面的结构状态。有些试样的表面、断口需要进行适当的侵蚀才能暴露某些结构细节，则在侵蚀后应将表面或断口清洗干净，然后烘干。对磁性试样要预先去磁，以免观察时电子束受到磁场的影响。试样大小要适合仪器专用样品座的尺寸，不能过大，样品座尺寸各仪器均不相同，一般小的样品座为3~5 mm，大的样品座为30~50 mm，以分别用来放置不同大小的试样，样品的高度也有一定的限制，一般在5~10 mm。 （2）块状试样的制备方法 对于块状导电材料，除了大小要适合仪器样品座尺寸外，基本上不需要进行什么制备，用导电胶把试样粘结在样品座上，即可放在扫描电镜中观察。对于块状的非导电或导电性较差的材料，要先进行镀膜处理，在材料表面形成一层导电膜，以避免电荷积累，影响图像质量，并可防止试样的热损伤 （3）粉末试样的制备方法 先将导电胶或双面胶纸粘结在样品座上，再均匀地把粉末样品撒在上面，用洗耳球吹去未粘住的粉末，再镀上一层导电膜，即可上电镜观察。 （4）镀膜的方法 镀膜的方法有两种，一是真空镀膜，另一种是离子溅射镀膜。离子溅射镀膜的原理是：在低气压系统中，气体分子在相隔一定距离的阳极和阴极之间的强电场作用下电离成正离子和电子，正离子飞向阴极，电子飞向阳极，二电极间形成辉光放电，在辉光放电过程中，具有一定动量的正离子撞击阴极，使阴极表面的原子被逐出，称为溅射，如果阴极表面为用来镀膜的材料（靶材），需要镀膜的样品放在作为阳极的样品台上，则被正离子轰击而溅射出来的靶材原子沉积在试样上，形成一定厚度的镀膜层。离子溅射时常用的气体为情性气体氩，要求不高时，也可以用空气，气压约为5×10-2 torr（1 torr = 133.32 Pa）。离子溅射镀膜与真空镀膜相比，其主要优点是：1）装置结构简单，使用方便，溅射一次只需几分钟，而真空镀膜则要半个小时以上；2）消耗贵金属少，每次仅约几毫克；3）对同一种镀膜材料，离子溅射镀膜质量好，能形成颗粒更细、更致密、更均匀、附着力更强的膜。 3.2.6 SEM照片影响因素 影响扫描电镜照片的因素包括：电子枪、电磁透镜以及样品室的洁净度等，避免粉尘、水气、油气等污染；调节加速电压、工作电流以及仪器调整、样品处理、真空度；环境因素，如振动、磁场、噪声、接地等。加何拍出好的SEM照片，一般由样品的种类和所要的结果来决定观察条件，调整适当的加速电压、工作距离、适当的样品倾斜，选择适当的侦测器、调整合适的电子束电流。一般来说，加速电压越高，电子束波长越短，理论上，只考虑电子束直径的大小，加速电压越大，可得到越小的聚焦电子束，因而提高分辨率，然而提高加速电压却有一些不可忽视的缺点，比如：无法看到样品表面的微细结构；会出现不寻常的边缘效应；电荷累积的可能性增大；样品损伤的可能性增大。 平时操作，若要将样品室真空一直保持在10-8 Pa（10-10 torr），则抽真空的时间将变长而降低仪器的便利性，更增加仪器购置成本，因此一些仪器设计了阶段式真空，亦即使电子枪、磁透镜及样品室的真空度依序降低，并分成三个部分来读取真空计读数，如此可将样品保持在真空度10-5 Pa的环境下即可操作。平时待机或更换样品时，为防止电子枪污染，皆使用真阀将电子枪及磁透镜部分与样品室隔离，实际观察时再打开使电子束通过而打击到样品。 场发射式电子枪的电子产生率与真空度有密切的关系，其使用寿命也随真空度变差而急剧缩短，因此在样品制备上必须非常注意水气，或固定用的碳胶或银胶是否烤干，以免在观察的过程中，真空陡然变差而影响灯丝寿命 3.2.7 主要应用 扫描电镜是利用样品表面微区特征（如形貌、原子序数或化学成分、晶体结构或位向等）的差异，在电子束作用下通过试样不同的区域产生不同的亮度差异，从而获得具有一定村度的图像。而扫描电镜由于具有景深大、放大倍数高的优点，所以特别适用于对表面凹凸不平的断口进行形貌分析。 （1）材料断口分析 材料断口分析是扫描电镜的典型应用。如图3.2.5所示，金属呈现出明显断口，深度为几个微米；表面有片状金属剥落，片状金属尺寸为几个至十几个微米。利用SEM可以清晰地观察材料表面的断口，金属断裂有沿晶、解离、准解理、疲劳和韧窝五种类型，而实际的断口可能由这五种之中的某几种典型断口混合而成。依据断口的形状，可以对实际断口进行断裂机制分析。 图3.2.5 金属表面断口 （2）材料组织形貌观察 图3.2.6所示为碳纳米管上负载金属纳米颗粒的SEM照片，图上很好地呈现出碳纳米管的一维形貌，其直径约100 nm；大量的金属纳米颗粒均匀地负载在碳纳米管上，其尺寸约为几个纳米。在多相结构材料中，特别是在某些共晶材料复合材料的显微组织分析方面，可以借助于扫描电镜景深大的特点，较好地呈现材料的组织形貌和结构。 图3.2.6 碳纳米管负载的金属纳米颗粒 （3）断裂过程的动态研究 有的型号的扫描电镜带有拉伸台装置，可进行断裂的动态过程研究。在试样拉伸的同时，既可以直接观察裂纹的萌生及扩展与材料显微组织之间的关系，又可以连续记录下来，为科学研究提供最直接的证据。 3.3 透射电子显微镜 3.3.1 主要结构 透射电子显微镜的结构主要包括电子光学系统、电源与控制系统、循环冷却系统及真空系统，其中电子光学系统是透射电子显微镜的核心部分。图3.3.1所示为透射电子显微镜的电子光学组成示意图。从光学成像的角度来看，透射电子显微镜由三部分组成：照明系统、成像与放大系统及观察与记录系统。 图3.3.1 透射电镜的结构示意图 3.3.1.1 照明系统 照明系统包括电子枪、聚光镜平移对中、倾斜调节装置，其主要作用为：提供一束亮度高、照明孔径半角小、平行度好、束流稳定的照明源；保证电子束可在2~3°倾斜，以满足明暗场成像转换的需要。 （1）电子枪 电子枪是发射电子的照明光源，主要作用是产生并发射和加速电子。目前电子枪的种类分为热电子发射型和场电子发射型。热电子发射型照明光源又可细分为钨灯丝、六硼化镧（LaB6）和六硼化铈（CeB6）三种。场发射电子枪照明光源可分为冷场型和热场型。使用场发射电子源的透射电镜又称为场发射电镜。 早期的透射电子显微镜使用的主要为钨灯丝电子源，但是由于其亮度低、光源尺寸大及能量发散度较大，所以人们很早就开始寻找更亮的光源。1969年Broers提出由单晶六硼化镧加工成锥状的顶端，从而制造出六硼化镧型灯丝。1968年，Crewe提出了冷场型发射枪，并于1980年后开始应用。然而，冷场型发射枪在室温使用时，灯丝会产生残留气体分子的离子吸附，使得发射电流降低并产生噪声，这样必须定期进行闪光处理以消除吸附分子层。因此，Swanson等人于20世纪70年代开发出钨针尖包覆有ZrO的热场型电子枪。表3.3.1给出了几种不同电子枪的特性。从表3.3.1可看出，热场发射型电子枪的亮度高、束斑尺寸小且能量发散度小，是目前综合性能最好的电子枪，因此也成了高分辨电子显微镜的首选。

钨灯丝和六硼化镧/铈灯丝属于热阴极电子枪，它是利用高温使电子具有足够的能量来克服电子枪材料的功函数而逃离。常用的热电子发射型电子枪属于热阴极三极电子枪，它由发夹形钨丝阴极、栅极和阳极组成，其结构如图3.3.2所示。图3.3.2（a）中反映了阴极栅极和阳极之间的等位面分布情况。负的高压直接加在栅极上，同时在阴极和负高压之间有一个偏压电阻，这样使得栅极和阴极之间就会产生数百伏的电位差，如图3.3.2（b）。这样栅极比阴极电位值更负，因此可以用栅极来控制阴极发射电子的有效区域。 图3.3.2 热电子发射型电子枪工作原理示意图 当阴极流向阳极的电子数量加大时，在偏压电阻两端的电位值增加，使栅极电位比阴极进一步变负，由此可以减小灯丝有效发射区域的面积，束流随之减小。若束流因某种原因而减小时，偏压电阻两端的电压随之下降，致使栅极和阴极之间的电位接近。此时，栅极排斥阴极发射电子的能力减小，束流又可望上升。因此，自偏压回路可以起到限制和稳定束流的作用。由于栅极的电位比阴极负，所以自阴极端点引出的等位面在空间呈弯曲状。在阴极和阳报之间的某一地点，电子束会汇集成一个交叉点，这就是通常所说的电子题。交叉点处电子束直径约几十个微米。 图3.3.3所示为场发射电子枪工作原理示意图。场发射电子枪的原理是高电场下产生肖特基（Schottky）效应。它是利用靠近曲率半径很小的阴极尖端发尖发射电子的，当在真空中的金属表面受到108 V/cm大小的电子加速电场时，将会有数量可观的电子发射出来，所以叫作场致发射，简称场发射。如果阴极尖端半径为0.1~0.5 μm，若在尖端与第一阳极之间加U1 = 3 kV的电位差，与第二阳极间加U2 = 5 kV的电位差，那么在阴极尖端附近建立的强电场就足以使它发射电子。在第二阳极几十千伏甚至几百千伏正电位作用下，阴极尖端发射的电子会聚在第二阳极孔的下方，电子束直径小至20 nm（甚至10 nm）。场发射电子是从很尖锐的阴极尖端所发射出来，因此可得极细而又具高电流密度的电子束，其亮度可达热阴极电子枪的数百倍甚至数千倍。由此可见，场发射电子枪是透射电子显微镜获得高分辨率、高质量图像较为理想的电子源。不同的灯丝电子源大小、电流量、电流稳定度以及灯丝寿命等有差异，如表3.3.1所示。 图3.3.3 场发射电子枪工作原理示意图 （2）聚光镜 聚光镜的主要作用是把电子枪发射出来的电子会聚而成交叉点，以便得到一束强度高、直径小、相干性强、近似平行的电子束，并照射到样品上。一般都采用双聚光镜系统，如图3.3.4所示。第一聚光镜是强激磁透镜，焦距很短，通过改变焦距可以控制光斑大小；经过第一聚光镜后束斑缩小到1/50~1/10，将电子枪第一交叉点束斑缩小为1~5 μm。第二聚光镜是弱激磁透镜，焦距很长；同时在第二聚光镜下方安装有一个聚光镜光阑，用以调整束斑大小；通过控制光阑照明孔径半角可得到一束近乎平行的电子束，以利于进行衍射操作；和未经过第一聚光镜的束斑相比，经过第二聚光镜后的束斑，适焦时放大了约2倍。结果在样品平面上可获得2~10 μm的照明电子束班。同时，为了减小像散，在第二聚光镜下还安装有一个消像散器。另外，由于第二聚光镜是长焦电磁透镜，这样在第二聚光镜和下方的物镜之间就会有较大的间隙，这样有利于装人样品台及相关附件。 图3.3.4 聚光镜照明光路图 为了满足各种分析功能的需要（如纳米束电子衍射模式和会聚束电子衍射模式等），照明系统也变得越来越复杂，在新型多功能的透射电子显微镜中越来越多地采用多级聚光镜。 3.3.1.2 成像系统 主要是由样品室、物镜、中间镜和投影镜组成。在物镜的上面是样品室，在物镜的下面还有物镜光阑和选区光阑。 （1）样品室与样品台 样品室有一套机构，保证样品经常更换时不破坏镜筒主体的真空度。透射电子显微镜的样品既小又薄，通常需用外径为3 mm的样品载网（一般为铜网、网和镍网等）来支持。将装载样品的台子称为样品台。样品台的作用是承载样品，并使样品能在物镜极靴孔内平移、倾斜、旋转，以选择感兴趣的样品区域或位向进行观察分析。新式的电子显微镜常最普遍配备的是侧插式倾斜装置。“侧插”就是样品杆从侧面进入物镜极靴中去。有的样品杆本身还带有使样品倾斜或原位旋转的装置。这些样品杆和倾斜样品台组合在一起就是侧插式双倾样品台和单倾旋转样品台。目前双倾样品台是最常用的，它可以使样品沿x轴和y轴倾转±60°。在晶体结构分析中，利用样品倾斜和旋转装置可以测定晶体的位向、相变时的惯习面及析出相的方位等。部分样品台还可以实现对样品的加热、冷却及测试应变等处理。 在照相曝光期间必须牢固地将样品载网夹持在样品座中并保持良好的热、电接触，减小因电子照射引起的热或电荷堆积而产生样品的损伤或图像漂移。平移是任何样品台最基本的动作，通常在两个相互垂直方向上样品平移最大值为±1 mm，以确保样品载网上大部分区域都能观察到。样品图像的漂移量应小于相应情况下显微镜像的分辨率。 （2）物镜 物镜在镜筒中的位置如图3.3.5所示，其作用是形成第一幅高分辨率电子放大像。在镜下面的电磁透镜仅起到进一步放大的作用，这样物镜能够分辨出来的结构细节（包括任何缺陷）都被成像系统中的其他电磁透镜进一步放大。因此，透射电子显微镜分辨本领的高低主要取决于物镜。欲获得物镜的高分辨率本领，必须尽可能降低像差。通常采用强激磁、短焦距的物镜，像差小。 图3.3.5 成像系统光路示意图 物镜是一个强激磁、短焦距的透镜（f = 1~3 mm），它的放大倍数较高，一般为100~300倍。目前，高质量的物镜其分辨率可达1 Å左右。物镜的分辨率主要取决于极靴的形状和加工精度。一般来说，极靴的内孔和上下极靴之间的距离越小，物镜的分辨率就越高。为了减少物镜的球差，往往在物镜的后焦面上安放一个物镜光阑。物镜光阑不仅具有减少球差、像散和色差的作用，而且可以提高图像的衬度。此外，物镜光阑位于后焦面的位置上时，可以方便地进行暗场及衬度成像的操作。 在用电子显微镜进行图像分析时，物镜和样品之间和距离总是固定不变的 （即物距L1不变）。因此改变放大倍数进行成像时，主要是改变物镜的焦距和像距（即f和L2）来满足成像条件。 （3）中间镜 中间镜是一个弱激磁的长焦距变倍透镜，一般情况下，可在0~20倍范围调节。实际上，中间镜是以物镜的像为试样进一步成像的。当放大倍数大于1时，用来进一步放大物镜像；当放大倍数小于1时，用来缩小物镜像。 在电镜操作过程中，主要是利用中间镜的可变倍率来控制电镜的放大倍数。如果物镜、中间镜和投影镜的放大倍数分别用M0、Mi和Mp表示，则获得的电子显微图像总放大倍数M = M0MiMp倍。通过调节线圈电流可以很方便地增大或减小放大倍数。 如果把中间镜的物平面和物镜的像平面重合，则在荧光屏上得到一幅放大像，这就是电子显微镜中的成像操作（也称为显微成像模式），如图3.3.5（a）所示。如果把中间镜的物平面与物镜的背（后）焦面重合，则在荧光屏上得到一幅电子衍射花样，这就是透射电子显微镜的电子衍射操作（也称为衍射成像模式），如图3.3.5（b）所示。 （4）光阑 透射电子显微镜的光阑包括三种：聚光镜光阑、物镜光阑和选区光阑。这三种光阑片都是用无磁性的金属（铂、钼等）制造的，其结构上则有四个不同直径的光阑孔，每个光阑孔的周围开有缝隙以使光阑孔受电子束照射后热量的散出，但不同的光阑尺寸范围不同。光阑被安装在光阑杆机构上，使用时，通过光阑杆机构调节光阑孔的位置，使光阑孔中心位于电子束的轴线上（光阑中心和主焦点重合）。由于小光阑孔很容易受到污染，因此高性能的电子显微镜中常用抗污染光阑（或称自洁光阑）。 聚光镜光阑的作用是限制照明孔径半角。在双聚光镜系统中，聚光镜光阑常装在第二聚光镜的下方。光阑孔的直径为20~400 μm。做一般分析观察时，聚光镜的光阑孔直径可用200~300 μm；若做微束分析时，则应采用小孔径光阑。 物镜光阑（又称衬度光阑）通常被安装在物镜的后焦面上。常用的物镜光阑孔直径在20~120 μm范围内。当电子束通过薄膜样品后会产生散射和衍射，散射角（或衍射角）较大的电子被光阑挡住，不能继续进入镜筒成像，从而会在像平面上形成具有一定衬度的图像光阑孔越小，被挡去的电子越多，图像的衬度就越大，因此，物镜光阑又被称为衬度光阑。物镜光阑的另一个主要作用是在后焦面上套取衍射束的斑点（即副焦点）成像，这就是暗场成像。利用明、暗场显微照片对照分析，可以方便地进行物相鉴定和缺陷分析。 选区光阑又称场限光阑或视场光阑，一般都放在物镜的像平面位置。选区光阑孔的直径通常在20~400 μm范围内，有的高达800 μm。当对样品进行微区的衍射分析时，需要在样品上放置光阑来限定微区。但是，由于待分析的微区仅有微米量级，要制造出如此小尺寸的光阑在技术上是很困难的，因此将选区光阑放在物镜的像平面上。这样放置和在样品上直接放置光阑是等效的，而光阑可以做得大一些，因此对这个微区进行衍射，叫作选区衍射。比如，当物镜放大倍数是50倍，则一个直径等于50 μm的光阑孔就可以选择样品上直径为1 m的区域。 （5）投影镜 投影镜的作用是把中间镜的像（显微图像或电子衍射花样）作为物进一步放大，并投景到荧光屏上。和物镜一样，也是一个短焦距的强磁透镜。投影镜的激磁电流是固定的，因为成像电子束进人投影镜时孔径半角很小，因此其景深和焦距都非常大。即使改变中间镜的大倍数，使显微镜的总放大倍数有很大的变化，也不会影响图像的清晰度。有时，中间镜像平面还会出现一定的位移，由于这个位移距离仍处于投影镜的景深范围之内，因此，在光屏上的图像仍旧是清晰的。 目前，高性能的透射电子显微镜大都采用5级以上透镜放大，即有两级甚至三级中间和两级投影镜。对于极低倍数的成像，则不用物镜，直接用中间镜和投影镜成像。 3.3.1.3 观察记录系统 目前，比较常用的观察和记录装置包括荧光屏、照相底片和CCD照相机。在荧光屏面放置可以自动换片的照相暗盒。照相时只要把荧光屏掀往一侧并竖起，电子束即可使照底片曝光。由于透射电子显微镜的焦长很大，虽然荧光屏和底片之间有数厘米的间距，但仍能得到清晰的图像。 通常采用在暗室操作情况下人眼较敏感的、发绿光的荧光物质来涂制荧光屏。这样有利于高放大倍数、低亮度图像的聚焦和观察。电子感光片是一种以对电子束曝光敏感、颗粒度很小的溴化物乳胶底片，它对红光不敏感。由于电子和乳胶相互作用比光子强得多，照相曝光时间很短，只需几秒钟。早期的电子显微镜用手动快门，构造简单，但曝光不均匀。新型电子显微镜采用电磁快门，与荧光屏动作密切配合，动作迅速，曝光色彩夺目、均匀；有的还有自动曝光装置，根据荧光屏上图像的亮度，自动确定曝光所需的时间。 如果配上适当的电子电路，还可以实现拍片自动记数。近年来新式的透射电镜一般都配有CCD相机，可以直接把电镜中看到的图像采集，在计算机中实现图像处理分析、数据管理和报告打印等多种功能。如图像的亮度或衬度调节、图像的非均匀亮度调节、图像粘贴和测量等。 电子显微镜工作时，整个电子通道必须置于真空系统中。新式的电子显微镜中电子枪镜筒和照相机之间都装有气阀，各部分都可以单独地抽真空和单独放气，因此，在更换灯丝、清洗镜筒和更换底片时，可不破坏其他部分的真空状态。 3.3.2 工作原理 TEM是利用透过样品的透射电子成像的，电子枪发射出电子射线经透射系统照射在样品上，电子束与样品相互作用后，当电子射线在样品另一方重新出现时，已带有样品内的信息，然后进行放大处理而成像，最终在荧光屏上形成带有样品信息的图像，使人眼能够识别。 透射电镜的成像原理可分为三种情况： （1）吸收像。射到质量、密度大的样品时，主要的成像作用是散射作用。样品上质量厚度大的地方对电子的散射角大，通过的电子较少，像的亮度较暗。早期的透射电子显微镜都是基于这一原理。 （2）衍射像。电子束被样品衍射后，样品不同位置的衍射波振幅分布对应于样品中晶体各部分不同的衍射能力，当出现晶体缺陷时，缺陷部分的衍射能力与完整区域不同，从而使行射的振幅分布不均匀，反映出晶体缺陷的分布。 （3）相位像。当样品薄至100 nm以下时，电子可以透过样品，波的振幅变化可以忽略，成像来自于相位的变化。 当电子经样品散射后，相对光轴以同一角度进入物镜的电子，在物镜后焦面上聚焦在一个点上。散射角越大，聚焦点离轴越远，如果样品是一个晶体，在后焦面上出现的是一幅衍射图样。与短晶面间距（或者说“高空间频率”）对应的衍射束被聚焦在离轴较远处。在后焦面上设有一个光阑，它截取那一部分电子对反差和分辨本领有直接的影响。如果光阑太小，把需要的高空间频率部分截去，那么和细微结构对应的高分辨信息就丢失了。 样品上厚的部分或重元素多的部分对电子散射的几率大。透过这些部分的电子在后焦面上分布在轴外的多。用光阑截去部分散射电子会使“质量厚度”大的部位在像中显得暗。这种反差可以人为地造成，如生物样品中用重元素染色，在材料表面的复型膜上从一个方向喷镀一层金属，造成阴阳面等。TEM反差的形成有以下3种方式 （1）振幅反差 当一定能量入射到样品，由于受到样品中原子的核和核外电子的静电场的作用，使电子动方向和速度发生变化称为电子散射。电子散射产生的振幅反差，是TEM最重要的成像制。 透镜图像的振幅反差是通过光阑吸收散射电子而形成的。振幅反差的大小取决于直接透射电子数量与弹性散射电子数量的比例。当入射电子照射样品，透过样品散射电子数总量，样品的厚度成正比。此外，样品密度越大电子散射的几率也越大。质量密度与厚度的乘积种为质量厚度，因此，振幅反差主要决定于样品各部分质量厚度的差异。当电子束投射到样品时，可随组织构成成分的密度不同而发生相应的电子发射量，如电子束投射到质量大的结构时，电子散射量大，其中大多数为大角度散射弹性电子，其角度为0.01~0.1 rad，但被物镜面的光阑挡掉散射电子，使该处的电流密度减少，形成图像的暗区，投射到荧光上的电子少而呈暗像，电子照片上则呈黑色，此现象称为电子密度高（electron dense）。反之当入射电子穿透样品质量厚度小的部位，直接透射以及小角度散射电子构成图像的亮区，则为电子密度低（electron lucent）。显然，样品各部分质量厚度差异越大，图像的振幅反差越强。此外，由于物镜存在球差，使散射电子轨迹受到很大影响，它们不会会聚到与物点相对应的同一高斯像点处，只能作为图像背景，弥散在各处。因此，在观察厚切片时，既使不加物镜光阑，图像也有一定的反差，但对于非常薄的切片来讲，几平没有反差。一般来说，对于样品的结构细节大小超过0.1~0.15 μm，厚度大于10 μm的样品，其反差主要是由振幅反差提供。 （2）相位反差 相位反差是在接近于正焦点附近很小的范围内产生的，它与物镜光阑是否存在无关，与加速电压以及样品的原子序数关系也不大。相位反差只能在最大的放大倍数和最高分辨率的条件下才能像平面观察到，对于低原子序数样品的细微结构，相位反差几乎是反差的唯一来源。对于微细结构小于0.15 μm、厚度小于10 μm的成像，特别是由轻元素构成的细微结构的图像，由于透射电子中弹性散射电子比例很少，而且散射角度也较小，都能通过光阑，因此不能获得振幅反差，图像的反差主要是由相位反差提供。从电子波的波动性分析，电子波穿透样品后成为透射波和散射波，其透射波的波长与入射电子波的波长相等，散射波由于入射电子通过样品时损失部分能量，使散射波波长发生变化。如图3.3.6所示，透射波（AB）与散射波（BC）之间存在一定的相位差。在理想透镜正聚焦时，二波（AB、BC）之间的相位差为90°，其合成波AC的振幅与透射波AB的差别很小（AC ≈ AB），几乎没有反差（图3.3.6a）。如果适当离焦，二波（AB、BC）之间的相位变化造成合成波（AC）的振幅与透射波（AB）的振幅的差异明显加大，合成波大于或小于透射波，形成一定的振幅差（图3.3.6b）。根据样品各部分透射波的强弱不同，使图像出现亮暗不同的区域，这种反差称为相位反差。 图3.3.6 相位反差 （3）衍射反差 衍射反差虽然可以加强图像的反差，但像的分辨率将下降。晶体样品图像反差的形成是由衍射效应产生的，晶体的原子是按周期性晶格排列，当入射电子波以一定角度照射晶体时，与晶体原子发生碰撞，若晶体结构满足下列条件： mathrm{2d}mathrm{sin}{mathrm{theta}}mathrm{ = nlambda} 式中：d——晶体原子之间的间距； θ——入射波角度； n——整数0，1，2，3...... λ——入射波波长。 则会在一定方向上产生很强的衍射波，称为布拉格衍射（Bragg diffraction）。它使直接透射的部分电子束强度分布产生变化。如果物镜光阑把衍射束挡住，只让透射束通过而形成的图像反差，称为衍射反差。此时，像是明场像，晶体中的强衍射区对应像的亮区，背景是暗的。若晶体产生的衍射束未被光阑挡住，而透射束被挡住，则形成暗场像。因此在一个均匀多晶体样品中，当同一电子束照射下，由于它们相对于入射电子波的取向不同，不同的晶粒呈现亮暗不同的颗粒，有的成为明场像，有的成为暗场像。在改变样品倾斜角度时，图像的明暗场像也随之变化。 衍射反差主要是用来研究晶体样品中的缺陷，而对原子尺度的研究，不能用衔射像来直接解释，必须连同电子衍射图一起对衍射反差像进行分析。 （4）离焦反差 离焦反差主要由散射电子波和直射电子波相互干涉而形成的。在电镜观察样品时，样品质量厚度迅速改变区域所对应的图像上会出现费涅尔衍射环。当物镜过焦时，费涅尔条纹呈暗线，欠焦时则呈现亮线，在正焦时，费涅尔条纹消失。由于离焦产生衍射环引起图像反差的增加，这种反差称为离焦反差。 3.3.3 主要性能 TEM主要性能指标通过常有三个：分辨本领、放大倍数和加速电压。 （1）分辨本领。显微镜的分辨本领是表示用显微镜来观察物体细微结构的能力，它是由显微镜能清楚分辨开被观察物体中两个细节间的最小距离来定义的。这个最小距离越小，分辨本领高。现今1000 kV透射电子显微镜的分辨本领可达0.2~0.3 nm。很显然分辨本领一方面取决于仪器本身的性能，如物镜的球差、衍射像差、色差、像散等因素；另一方面与被观察物体的材料性质、细节的形状、位置及衬度条件诸因素有关。甚至与检测人对最小距离的判别和测量有关。总之分本领是显微镜的最重要指标，也是一个不容易严格定义和测定的指标。 （2）放大倍数。透射电子显微镜的放大倍数是指横向放大倍数，它是成像系统中各级电磁透镜电子放大信数之乘积。每一级电磁透镜的放大倍数M定义为该透成像的像距b和距a的比值M = b/a，显然像距与物距取决于透镜的焦距f，即1/f = 1/a+1/b，而磁透镜的焦距f是透镜激励电流I和加速电压V的非线性函数f（V/I），因而改变电流就可以满足成像关系获得清楚的聚焦图像。现代透射电子显微镜的放大倍数从几十倍到几十万倍可连续改变，这是一般光学显微镜办不到的。由于电子显微镜分辨本领很高，即使放大几十万倍以后获得的照片还可以进一步用光学放大而得到几百万倍的图像透射电子显微镜的放大倍数将随样品平面高度、加速电压、透镜电流而变化。为了保持仪器放大倍数的精度，必须定期进行标定。 （3）加速电压。电子显微镜的加速电压决定电子的能量，电子能量越高、波长越短，电子显微镜的分辨本领越高。加速电压增加，电子穿透能力更强，可以观察更厚的样品。同时电子枪亮度增加，荧光屏发光强度也增强。因此透射电子显微镜通常都工作在50~200 kV。工作电压在500 kV以上的属于超高压电子显微镜。目前世界上超高压电子显微镜的加速电压高达3000 kV。 3.3.4 主要特点 电镜最突出的优越性主要表现在具有很高的分辨本领，最高分辨率达到001~0.02 nm；已达到原子水平，而且放大倍数高达100万倍放大倍数从几十倍到几于万可连续变倍，适用于各种研究样品的需要，在生物学和材料学纳米级的研究领域中是其他仪器所无法取代的，但透射电镜也有它的局限性和特殊要求，其表现如下： （1）由于样品制备技术的限制，对大多数生物样品来说，一般只能达到2 nm的分辨水平。 （2）电镜图像的分辨能力不仅取决于电镜本身的分辨率，而且也取决于样品结构的反差。 （3）电镜所用的光源是电子波，波长在非可见光范围内无颜色反应，所形成的图像是黑白图像，要求图像必须具有一定的反差。 （4）生物体组织和细胞成分主要由C、H、O、N等轻元素组成，它们的原子序数较低，电子像散射能力弱，相互之间的差别又很小，电镜下的图像反差一般偏低。 （5）由于电子束的穿透能力较弱，样品必须制成超薄切片。生物切片上可获得的分辨率般是切片厚度的1/10，也就是说，切片厚度为50~100 nm，其切片上的分率为5~10 nm。由此可见，虽然电镜的分辨率很高，生物样品制样技术限制了电镜性能的发挥。一般要求切片厚度为 50~70 nm。 （6）观察面小，载网直径为3 mm，超薄切片范围为 0.3~0.8 mm。 （7）电子束的强烈照射易损伤样品，发生变形、升华等，甚至被击穿破裂，可能使观察结果产生假象。 （8）观察时电镜镜筒必须保持真空，为了保证样品在真空下不损伤，对样品要求应无水分。因此，不能观察活体的生物样本。 （9）生物制样复杂，在步骤繁多的制样过程中，样品容易产生收缩、膨胀、破碎以及内含物丢失等结构改变。 3.3.5 样品制备 （1）对试样的要求 透射电子显微镜通过让电子束（包括衍射束和透射束）透过样品，利用透过或衍射的电子束反映样品晶体结构及形貌。如需获取普通形貌相、衍射班点，样品厚度要求小于200 nm；如需获取高分辨形貌相、精细衍射花样，样品厚度一般要求小于100 nm。 （2）块体样品制备技术 1）薄膜样品制备。 薄膜样品的组织结构必须和大块样品相同，在制备过程中，这些组织结构不能发生化。样品相对于电子束必须有足够的“透明度”，因为只有样品能被电子束透过，才有可进行观察和分析。薄膜样品应有一定强度和刚度，在制备、夹持和操作过程中，在一定的机械力作用下不会引起变形或损坏。在样品制备过程中不允许表面产生氧化和腐蚀。氧化和腐蚀会使样品的透明度下降，并造成多种假象。 2）样品薄片的预先减薄。 ①从大块样品上切割厚度为0.3~0.5 mm厚的薄片。 a.电火花线切割设备——导电样品。用一根往返运动的金属丝做切割工具。以被切割样品作阳极、金属丝作阴极，两极间保持微小的距离，利用其间的火花放电进行切割。过程在冷却条件下进行 电火花切割可切下厚度小于0.5 mm的薄片，切制时损伤层比较浅，可以通过后续的制或减薄过程去除。 b.金刚石切片机——不导电样品。针对不导电样品，利用金刚石刀片旋转，切割固在夹具上的样品。为了防止样品过热，一般配有冷却液。 ②0.5mm左右薄片减薄成几十微米薄片。 a.机械减薄法通过手工研磨来完成，把切割好的薄片一面用黏结剂黏在样品座表面，然在水砂纸上研磨减薄。样品平放，不要用力太大，并使它充分冷却。压力过大和温度升商局会引起样品内部组织结构发生变化。研磨过中要反复调换研磨面，使片两面摩擦磨特以免应力不均引起样品翘曲变形。片一般研磨至50 μm左右；手工研磨时即使用力不大，薄片上的硬化层也会厚至数十个纳米。 b.化学减薄法是把切割好的金属薄片放人配制好的化学试剂中，使其表面受蚀而继续减薄。合金中各组成相的腐蚀倾向是不同的，所以在进行化学减薄时，应注意减薄液的选择。化学减薄法的最大优点是表面没有机械硬化层，减薄后样品的厚度可以控制在20~50 μm，薄区面积大。但是，化学减薄时必须先把薄片表面充分清洗，去除污物，否则将得不到满意的结果。 ③将几十微米薄片减薄到可进行透镜观察的样品。 a.双喷电解减薄：将预减薄的样品剪成直径3 mm的圆片，装入样品夹持器中。进行减薄时，样品两个表面的中心部位各有一个电解液喷嘴。从喷嘴中喷出的液柱和阴极相接，样品和阳极相接。电解液通过一个耐酸泵进行循环，在两个喷嘴的轴线上装有一对光导纤维，其中一个光导纤维和光源相接，另一个则和光敏元件相连。如果样品经抛光后中心出现小孔，光敏元件输出的电信号就可以将抛光线路的电源切断。 用这种方法制成的薄膜样品，中心穿孔附近有一个较大的楔形薄区，可以被电子束穿透。直径3 mm圆片周边是一个厚度较大的刚性支架，可以保证样品夹持、搬运过程中不会被损坏。 b.离子减薄：是物理方法减薄，原理是利用加速的离子轰击样品表面，使表面原子飞出（溅射出），最终使样品减薄到电子束可以通过的厚度。样品放置于10-3~10-2 Pa的高真空样品室中，离子束从两侧在3~5 kV加速电压加速下轰击样品表面，样品表面相对离子束成0~30°的夹角。 离子减薄适用于矿物、陶瓷、半导体及多相合金等电解抛光所不能减薄的场合。离子减薄的效率较低，一般情况下4 μm/h 左右。但是离子减薄的质量高、薄区大。 （3）粉末样品制备技术 胶粉混合法：在干净玻璃片上滴火棉胶溶液，然后在玻璃片胶液上放少许粉末并搅匀，再将另一玻璃片压上，两玻璃片相对研并突然抽开，稍后，膜干；用刀片将膜划成小方格，将玻璃片斜插入水杯中，在水面上下空插，膜片逐渐脱落，用铜网将方形膜捞出，待观察。 粉碎和分散法：需透射电镜分析的粉末颗粒一般都小于铜网小孔，因此要先制备对电子束透明的支持膜。常用支持膜有火棉胶膜和碳膜。粉末样品制备的关键取决于能否使其均匀分散到支持膜上。将样品在玛瑙研钵中研碎，将研碎的粉末（如果样品是微细的粉末，就不用粉碎）放入与样品不发生反应的有机溶剂（例如丁醇、丙酮等）中，用超声波分散得到悬浊液，为了操作简单方便，也可以用玻璃棒搅拌。用滴管把所得的悬浊液放一滴在黏附有支持膜的铜网上，静置干燥后即可供观察。 透射电子显微镜晶体薄膜样品制备看似是一个简单的操作，其实不然，它的每一个操作环节需考虑是否影响材料本身的结构特征，需要深入理解工艺对材料结构特征的影响规律，必须注重细节，精益求精。 3.3.6 主要应用 （1）形貌分析 由于透射电镜具有较扫面电镜更高的分辨率，因此非常适合用来进一步观察材料的形貌。如图3.3.7所示，合成出的PtPdCu海绵展现出明显的分形结构，由一根主干和许多分枝组成，而分枝又是由更小的主干和分枝组成，如同一棵具有多级分枝的树。树枝由许多小的纳米颗粒组成，它们融合在一起，形成一个相互连接的多孔体系。此外，PtPdCu海绵还具分级孔结构，主干的孔径和孔壁尺寸都要明显大于分枝的孔径和孔壁尺寸。能谱则进一步揭示了PtPdCu海绵具有合金结构。 图3.3.7 分形金属纳米海绵的形貌表征 （2）高分辨像 图3.2.6所示为碳纳米管上负载金属纳米颗粒的SEM照片，图上很好地呈现出碳纳米管的一维形貌，其直径约100 nm；大量的金属纳米颗粒均匀地负载在碳纳米管上，其尺寸约为几个纳米。在多相结构材料中，特别是在某些共晶材料复合材料的显微组织分析方面，可以借助于扫描电镜景深大的特点，较好地呈现材料的组织形貌和结构。 图3.2.6 碳纳米管负载的金属纳米颗粒 （3）电子衍射 透射电子显微镜可以将产生的电子衍射束聚焦放大投影到荧光屏或照相底板上，形成规则排列的斑点或线条，这种图形就是电子衍射谱。弹性相干散射是电子束在晶体中产生衍射现象的基础。需要提醒的是，弹性相干散射是指晶体中原子位置的相干性，而非电子源本身的相于性，因而电子衍射谱反映晶体内部的结构和原子排布情况。 虽然电子衍射和X射线衍射均可用于分析晶体结构，但是两种方法存在异同点。相同点主要表现在以下几个方面： ①电子衍射的原理和X射线衍射相似，满足布拉格方程且不产生消光时才会发生衍射。 ②如果将所得衍射花样以底片的形式呈现，则两种衍射方法所得到的衍射花样在几何特征上也大致相似。 ③两种衍射花样的标定原理相同，并且使用相同的衍射卡片库。 由于电子波与X射线相比有其本身的特性，因此电子衍射和X射线衍射相比较时，具有下列不同之处： ①电子衍射是电子受到在空间上周期性变化势场的散射，与样品的相互作用往往比X射线衍射与样品作用要强烈一些，往往不止发生一次散射；X射线是与核外电子发生作用，与核外的电子分布情况相关。 ②电子束的波长要比X射线短得多，在同样满足布拉格条件时，它的射角θ很小，约为10-2 rad；而X射线产生衍射时，其衍射角最大可接近π/2。 ③由于电子的散射强度很高，导致电子束的透射能力有限，因此透射电镜要求试样做成薄膜状，这样使试样制备远比X射线衍射样品制备要复杂得多。 ④电子衍射操作时采用薄膜样品，由于样品的尺寸效应，薄膜样品的倒易阵点并不一个圆点，而会沿着样品厚度方向延伸成杆状，因而，增加了倒易阵点和爱瓦尔德球相菇的机会，结果使略微偏离布拉格条件的电子束也能发生衍射。 ⑤由于电子波的波长短，采用爱瓦尔德球图解时，反射球的半径很大，在衍射角θ较小的范围内反射球的球面可以近似地看成是一个平面，从而也可以认为电子衍射产生的标斑点大致分布在一个二维倒易截面内。因此，衍射花样可以比较直观地反映晶体的结构晶面位向，使晶体结构的研究比X射线更有优势。 ⑥原子对电子的散射能力远高于它对X 射线的散射能力（约高出四个数量级），故电子衍射束的强度较大，摄取衍射花样时曝光时间仅需数秒钟。并且有时电子衍射的强度几透射束相当，致使两者间会产生交互作用，从而使电子衍射花样的强度分析变得复杂，不像X射线衍射那样可以通过衍射强度来对物相进行定量计算、原位分析等。 3.4 原子力显微镜 3.4.1 工作原理 原子力是一种表面力，主要包括范德华力、静电力、磁力等。利用隧道电流、光束偏转或压敏电阻等方法，可以检测到微细针尖与物体之间的原子力，形成待测物体的表面形貌像，也可以用于检测微纳材料的力学性能及进行微纳结构加工。 原子力显微镜的原理建立在探针尖端的原子与样品表面原子在足够接近时存在相互作用力的基础之上。探针被装在一个小小的弹力臂的端头上，探针尖端上的原子与样品表面的相互作用力与两者的间距具有密切联系，如图3.4.1所示。当间隙大时，不存在作用力；在间隙逐渐缩小过程中，将出现引力（FW），主要有范德华力、毛细作用力、磁力和静电力。引力随着间隙缩小而增大，继续缩小间隙，探针针尖和样品原子外围电子将出现斥力（FR），主要有键结力和静电相互排斥力。斥力随距离减小的增速比引力快得多，在间隙缩小过程中将很快由相吸转向相斥。引力和斥力的合力称为雷纳德琼斯相互作用势（Lennard-Jones potential），可以表示为： F_A=F_R+F_W=frac{A}{r^m}-frac{B}{r^n} 式中，r为针尖原子与样品表面的最小距离；A、B、m、n针对不同的模型，可以是不同的常数。 图3.4.1 探针/样品间作用力与距离的关系 AFM针尖装在一个一端固定的弹性微悬臂上，弹性微悬臂对微弱力极为敏感，当样品或针尖轻轻接触时，针尖与样品表面原子之间的相互作用力就会引起微悬臂发生微小的弹性形变，也就是说微悬臂的形变可作为样品-针尖相互作用力的直接度量。 当一束激光照射到微悬臂的背面，微悬臂将激光束反射到一个光电检测器，检测器不同象限接收到的激光强度差值同微悬臂的形变量会形成一定比例关系,比如当微悬臂的形变约为0.01 nm，激光束反射到光电检测器后，则可放大为 3~10 nm的位移，产生可测量的电压差。反馈系统根据检测器电压的变化不断调整针尖或样品Z轴方向的位置，保持微悬臂的变形量不变，即保持针尖-样品间作用力恒定不变，针尖就会随表面的起伏上下移动，通过测量检测器相应的电压变化以对应样品扫描位置的变化，可获得针尖上下运动的轨迹，即可以记录样品的表面形貌特征。这种检测方式被称为“恒力”模式，是使用最广泛的扫描方式。AFM探针因其结构、材料等不同，弹簧常数范围宽至0.01~500 N/m，针尖尖端的曲率半径可小至1 nm，通常为10 nm，也可以通过镶嵌微球达到pm的量级。不同种类的探针可适用于不同的材料和需求，这拓宽了AFM的使用范围。 3.4.2 工作模式 AFM工作主要有成像模式和力曲线模式。成像模式又分为接触式、非接触式和轻敲式；力曲线模式有接触力曲线、轻敲力曲线和力分布成像。工作中可以根据样品表面不同的结构特征、材料的特性以及实验目的，选择合适的操作模式。 3.4.2.1 成像模式 （1）接触成像模式 接触成像模式针尖始终和样品接触，以恒高或恒力的模式扫描扫描过程中，针尖在表面滑动，形成稳定的高分辨图像。这种模式不适用于低弹性模量和易变形材料。 在大气环境中，由于毛细作用的存在，针尖和样品之间存在较大的黏滞力，横向扫描时施加在样品上的额外作用力可能会造成样品的损伤，黏滞力同时增大针尖和样品的接触面积，降低成像的分辨率。解决的办法是，由于表面自由能越大黏滞力越强，因此可以通过AFM针尖对表面进行修饰，在针尖上涂覆低表面能材料，或者将针尖浸人液体等，可以克服毛细作用带来的影响，有效提高成像分辨率。 如果在上面过程中微悬臂的分析和快速扫描的方向垂直，则针尖除了可以探测到与样品之间的垂直方向的原子力，还会由于针尖与样品之间的摩擦力使得微悬臂横向扭转，这样就可以研究样品表面的微区摩擦性质。横向力测量已经被广泛应用于多组分材料表面的摩擦性质。 （2）非接触成像模式 非接触成像模式中针尖在样品表面上方振动，始终不与样品接触。针尖测器检测到的是范德华力和静电力等对样品没有破坏的长程作用力，灵敏度较高。但是当针尖和样品距离较长时，成像分辨率较低，不适用于在液体中成像。 （3）轻敲模式 在轻敲模式中，微悬臂在其共振模式附近做受迫振动。振动的针尖轻敲表面，间断地和表面接触。由于接触时间非常短，针尖与样品的相互作用很小，通常为1皮牛顿~1纳牛顿，前切力引起的分率降低和对样品的破坏几乎消失，所以适合用于生物和聚合物等软物体的成像研究。 轻敲模式AFM在大气和液态环境下都可以实现。在大气环境中，当针尖与样品不接触时，微悬臂以最大振幅自由振荡。当针尖与样品表面接触时，尽管压电陶瓷片以同样的能量激发微悬臂振荡，但空间阻隔作用使微悬臂的振幅减小。反馈系统控制微悬臂的振幅恒定，针尖就跟随表面的起伏，上下移动获得表面形貌信息。轻敲模式同样适合在液态中操作，而且由于液态的阻尼作用，针尖与样品的剪切力更小，对样品的损伤也更小，所以液体中轻敲成像模式可以实现溶液反应的原位观察和活体生物检测。 轻敲模式还有一个重要应用，即相位成像。通过测定扫描过程中微悬臂的振荡相位和压电陶瓷驱动信号的振荡相位之间的差值，研究材料的力学性质和表面性质。如样品表面的摩擦、材料的滞弹性和黏附性质等;还可以对材料表面的不同组分进行化学识别。 轻敲模式一般采用调制横向振幅恒定的方法进行恒力模式的扫描，也可以采用频率调行化学识别技术，测量扫描过程中频率的变化。这种频率调制AFM的力检测方式，大幅度提高了噪声处理率和灵敏度，可以获得原子级分辨率的图像。 3.4.2.2 力曲线模式 针尖和样品之间的相互作用力与距离的关系称为“力曲线”，是实现AFM观察的重要特性曲线。 （1）接触力曲线 在接触模式的力曲线测量中，压电陶瓷置于当前扫描区域（x, y）的中心位置，停止扫描，仅在2方向施加周期性三角波电压信号，使样品周期性地与针尖接近一接触一离开。AFM的光学系统实时记录微悬臂的变形量并对压电陶瓷管的位移量作图。力曲线中微悬臂的弯曲与其力学常效的乘积即为针尖与样品之间的作用力。 力曲线一般分为非接触区、接触区和黏滞区3个区域。在非接触区，针尖离开样品较远，它们之间的作用力可以忽略不计，微悬臂不发生弯曲，力曲线为水平直线。针尖接近样品，它们之间的范德华力使微悬臂向样品表面弯曲。当二者接近到某一点时，它们之间的引力随距离变化的斜率超过了微悬臂的弹性常数，由于机械不稳定性，二者会突然接触到一起，称之为突触点，在接触区样品和针尖相互接触而共同移动。如果针尖和样品在接触时都没有发生弹性或塑性变形，样品所走过的距离与微悬臂的弯曲量相同。当样品走至某一预设位置时向相反方向移动，微悬臂的弯曲随之逐渐减小。但是由于针尖与样品间的黏附作用，二者仍粘在一起。随着样品继续向远离针尖方向移动，微悬臂由背向样品弯曲变为面向样品弯曲，这一区为力曲线的第三区——黏滞区。当微悬臂积蓄的弹力超过二者之间的黏滞力时，针尖突然与样品离开，微悬臂恢复非弯曲状态，力曲线又重新进入非接触区，该位置称为“崩离点”(pull off point)。 检测AFM力曲线上针尖与样品接触区斜率的变化，可以得出纳米尺度上力学性能对于刚性样品，针尖与样品接触以后，样品走过的距离与AFM微悬臂的弯曲量相等，力曲线斜率为1。对于塑性样品，针尖有可能插入样品内部，微悬臂的弯曲量小于样品走过的距离，其斜率小于 1。利用这种性质，可以研究表面硬度及其抗磨损能力。有力曲线在接触外界压力后的那部分曲线的斜率，可以对弹性模量、杨氏模量等进行精确确定，根据表面黏滞力的大小还可以解析出样品的某些表面性质，而有非接触区的黏滞区情况可以估计力曲线测定所在介质的黏滞力等参数。 （2）轻敲式力曲线 除接触式力曲线外还有轻式力曲线和力分布成像。轻敲力曲线是使针尖反复接近—接触—远离样品，记录振荡的微悬臂的振幅、相位或变形量并对压电陶瓷位移量作图。其相位—频率图可以更为准确地表征样品的硬度、黏弹性等力学性能。力分布成像是以接触或轻敲模式，在（x, y）扫描区域内，对每一位置都进行力曲线测量，将作用力对x轴和y轴作图，得到力分布图，选择不同的模式可以观察到静电力或长程磁力。 3.4.3 试样制备 AFM的样品制备简单。纳米粉体材料应尽量以单层或亚单层形式分散并固定在基片上。选择合适的溶剂和分散剂将粉体材料制成稀溶液，必要时可采用超声分散以减少纳米粒子的聚集。根据纳米粒子的亲疏水特性、表面化学特性等选择合适的基片，常用云母、热解石墨（HOPC）、单晶硅片、玻璃、石英等。研究粉体材料的尺寸、形状等性质，应尽量选取表面原子级平整的云母、HOPC等作为基片；样品尽量牢固地固定在基片上。纳米薄膜材料如金属或金属氧化物薄膜、高聚物薄膜、有机与无机复合薄膜、自组装单分子膜等，一般都有基片的支持，可以直接用于AFM研究。 3.4.4 伪迹分析 同其他成像方法一样，扫描探针显微镜也不可避免地会出现一定程度的伪迹（亦称假象）。所谓伪迹，是指图像中出现的与试样固有结构完全无关的或者歪曲了其真实结构的图像。伪迹的产生通常来源于仪器操作者的经验缺乏，也可能是没有选择最佳的成像参数，这些参数包括设定力的大小、扫描速率和增益等。仪器本身的缺陷和仪器零部件的不完善，如针尖的磨损和污染等，也是假象产生的重要来源。测量误差主要是指仪器本身因素导致的测量误差。 3.4.4.1 探针针尖导致的伪迹和误差 使用原子力显微镜测量的图像总是探针几何形状和被成像的特征形状的卷积。如果探针针尖尺寸远小于被测量图像的特征，则探针产生的伪像将是最小的，并且从图像导出的尺寸测量将是准确的。选择合理的探针，可以有效避免探针产生伪影，例如，如果被测样品具有在100 nm范围内的特征尺寸，则直径不大于10 nm的探针将足以获得没有伪像的良好图像。在一些情况下，即使探针尺寸大于样品的特征尺寸，仍然可能从图像获得准确的结构信息。常见的针尖导致的伪迹和误差有： （1）探针对图像形貌的放大效应 在测试碳纳米管、纳米球等样品时经常会发现，通过AFM获得的高度数据是正确的，而其宽度比预测的大，这是由于探针尺寸引起的样品表面形貌的放大效应，如图3.4.2示。当探针尺寸与被测物体相当时，其针尖尺寸不可忽略，在计算样品宽度时，应排除探针针尖尺寸的影响。 图3.4.2 探针引起的图像放大效应示意图 （2）探针对图像形貌的缩小效应 当探针扫描狭缝等表面较低的样品形貌时，获得的尺寸往往会比预想的要小。这是因为获得的线性轮廓是由探针的几何形状而不是试样表面的几何形状决定的，如图3.4.3所示。此时仍然可以从获得的图像测量孔的开口，此外，可以使用不接触到正被测试的狭缝底部的探针来精确地测量重复图案的间距。 图3.4.3 探针引起的图像缩小效应示意图 （3）探针导致的奇怪形貌 如果在测量图像之前探针针尖碎裂或者被污染，可能观察到难以解释的奇怪形状。例如，当探针针尖被污染或者损伤时，由此可能产生无数个针尖，导致图像中出现重复的奇怪形状。多针尖效应一般表现为重复出现的特殊形貌，在形貌结校较复杂的试样中很难判断，因此，分析人员在观测图像时应十分小心，留意图像中是否有不合理重复出现的结构单元像。 3.4.4.2 扫描器导致的伪迹和误差 原子力显微镜中在x、y和z方向上移动探针的扫描器通常由压电陶瓷制成。压电陶瓷能够移动探针非常小的距离，然而，当线性伏安法应用于压电陶瓷时，陶瓷以非线性运动移动。此外，压电陶瓷还表现出由自加热引起的迟滞效应，由于扫描器的几何形状，也可能将伪像引人图像中。扫描器导致的伪迹和误差主要有： （1）x-y轴以及z轴方向上的校准以及线性 所有原子力显微镜必须在x-y轴上校准，以使计算机屏幕上是现的图像准确，扫描仪的运动也必须是线性的，使得由图像测量的距离准确。没有校正后的图像上的特征，通常在图像的一侧比在另一侧上更小。扫描器被正确地线性化后，扫描器是否被校准很重要，例如，扫描器可以是线性但不是校准的。如果校准不正确，则线轮廓测量的x-y值也不准确。 AFM中的高度测量要求显微镜的z轴上的压电陶瓷是线性的并且已被校准，通常显微镜只在一个高度校准。然而，如果测量的z高度和实际z高度之间的关系呈非线性，则高度测量有误。如图3.4.4所示，表示AFM中实际高度和测量z高度之间的关系。AFM常只测量一个校准点，如图中灰色圆圈所示，并且假设陶瓷是线性的，如直线所示。然而，通常情况下，压电陶瓷是非线性的，如曲线所示。在这种情况下，使用AFM将获得不正确的之高度，除非被测量的试样数据接近校准测量值。 压电陶瓷中的滞后会导致悬臂以垂直运动移动到表面的边缘时过冲。该问题最常见于观察硅片、光盘等图案化的样品时或测试薄膜样品的边缘时，如图3.4.5所示。该效果可以使图像在视觉上更好，因为边缘看起来更清晰，但是获得的结构线轮廓有误。 图3.4.4 AFM中实际z高度与测量z高度之间的关系 图3.4.5 AFM中实际z高度与测量z高度之间的关系 （2）扫描器漂移 AFM图像中的漂移可能归因于压电扫描器中的蠕变，也可能因为AFM容易受到外界温度变化的影响。最常见类型的漂移发生在图像扫描的开始处。此伪影导致扫描范围的初始部分出现失真，经常表现为在扫描起始处图像的扭曲。因此在扫描原子分子尺度的高分辨成像时，常常需要开机等待一段时间才开始测量，以使系统达到稳定状态停止漂移。在使用液体池在液态环境下测量和使用加热或冷却的装置时，尤其要留意漂移对结果的影响。 3.4.4.3 其他因素的影响 除了探针、扫描器的影响，其他因素也可能导致图像的伪迹以及误差。常见的有： （1）光学干涉条纹 对附着在诸如硅片之类光滑表面的试样进行AFM测试时，往往在图像中出现周期性花样，通常间隔为1.5~2.5 μm，这是由于来源于试样表面和悬臂表面的两束光发生干涉而引起的。如果激光没有完全聚焦于探针悬臂表面，就会有部分光束溢出入射到样品表面，高反射率的试样如硅片、金等能将这些溢出的光反射向检测器。由于激光是相干光源，因而从悬臂反射的光束和从试样反射的光束相遇后会发生干涉，产生明暗相间的干涉条纹，解决办法是正确地聚焦激光或者稍微调整聚焦点在悬臂上的位置。近年来，使用低相干的SLD光源替代传统光源或者在探针背面镀金、铝的涂层增强探针的反射信号以降低干涉效应。 （2）温度、湿度等因素的影响 如前所述，温度改变可能导致扫描仪出现漂移，导致伪迹的出现。而温度、湿度也会影响探针和样品间相互作用，尤其是在湿度较大地区对于一些易吸水样品，样品与探针间可能有一层水膜，进而影响AFM测试结果。在进行扫描速率较慢的AFM测试时，在开着空调的房间可能观察到与光学干涉条纹类似的横向条纹，这是由于空调工作或未工作时，室内温度、湿度改变而导致的结果。因此为了获得高质量AFM图像，应尽量保持室内温度和湿度的恒定。 （3）振动的影响 由于AFM的主要功能建立于对悬臂梁的微小偏移的高度敏感性上，任何影响悬臂的振动都可能在图像中产生伪迹。典型的振动伪迹是震荡样花样，声音和地面震动都能在AFM操作中表现出来并产生图像伪迹。建筑物的地面垂直震动常有几个微米的振幅，频率低于5 Hz，这种振动若未经过适当的隔离，就可能导致图像中的周期性结构花样。室内人们的大声讲话声，飞机飞越建筑物的声音甚至关闭门窗的声音都有可能在图像中出现伪迹。 3.4.5 主要应用 3.4.5.1 表面形貌观察 AFM分析Si单晶表面获得巨大成功。关于单晶Si的表面形貌，Takayanagi提出(111)表面7×7结构，其基本单元由两个三角形胞，内含12个原子构成。原子力显微镜可以得到清晰图像，并测量出原子尺寸。图3.4.6是Si晶体(111)面的原子像，构成虚线四边形的12个原子即为7×7结构。沿图中虚线直线进行测量、得到S 原子的横向和高度寸，示于图3.4.7。在扫描方向的界面处每一个原子都有两个峰，这是由于针尖类端原子的两个悬挂键与当表面原子的悬挂键形成了两个共价键。这种频调制的AFM的力检测方式大大降低噪声并提高了灵敏度、信噪比的增加使图像反养和分辨率都大幅度提高。AFM在3个维度上可以检测纳米粒子乃至原子的大小尺寸，纵向分辨率可以达到0.01 nm。 图3.4.6 单晶硅（111）表面7×7结构的AFM像 图3.4.7 单晶硅（111）表面7×7结构的尺寸 3.4.5.2 微纳测量 碳纳米管由于尺寸太小，无法应用传统强度测量技术进行测量。图3.4.8是一个新颖的实验，使用位于扫描电子显微镜内的“纳米应力台”，用双AFM尖端来对纳采管施加拉伸载荷、测量单个多层纳米管的拉伸强度。 图3.4.8 AFM-AFM联用测量纳米管强度 拉伸实验是在SEM内进行和观察的。由AFM尖端测量施加的应力，拉伸距离由SEM图像测量。观察表明，纳米管通常在最外层发生断，该层的拉伸强度范围为11~63 GPa。对单个多层纳米管的应力-应变曲线分析表明，最外层的杨氏模量E为270~950 GPa。用TEM检测断裂的纳米管碎片，观察到波浪花样和局域径向塌陷等多种结构。应用类似的方法，可以测量纳米线、纳米管的弹性模量和强度。图3.4.9是测量纳米弹簧弹性模量的SEM像。在SEM的样品室中装载微型AFM，测量在SEM观察中进行SEM像中，确定图？？中箭头所指两点间的距离为原始长度，随着针尖移动弹簧拉伸，记录针尖感知的纳米线弹簧的作用力，从SEM像中测量不同应力下纳米弹簧原始长度的伸长量，通过应力—应变曲线分析，可以有效地测量出纳米弹簧的弹性模量。

原子力显微镜的原理建立在探针尖端的原子与样品表面原子在足够接近时存在相互作用力的基础之上。探针被装在一个小小的弹力臂的端头上，探针尖端上的原子与样品表面的相互作用力与两者的间距具有密切联系，如图3.4.1所示。当间隙大时，不存在作用力；在间隙逐渐缩小过程中，将出现引力（FW），主要有范德华力、毛细作用力、磁力和静电力。引力随着间隙缩小而增大，继续缩小间隙，探针针尖和样品原子外围电子将出现斥力（FR），主要有键结力和静电相互排斥力。斥力随距离减小的增速比引力快得多，在间隙缩小过程中将很快由相吸转向相斥。引力和斥力的合力称为莱纳德-琼斯相互作用势（Lennard-Jones potential），可以表示为： F_A=F_R+F_W=frac{A}{r^m}-frac{B}{r^n} 式中，r为针尖原子与样品表面的最小距离；A、B、m、n对不同的模型而言，可以是不同的常数。 3.4.2 工作模式 AFM工作主要有成像模式和力曲线模式。成像模式又分为接触式、非接触式和轻敲式；力曲线模式有接触力曲线、轻敲力曲线和力分布成像。工作中可以根据样品表面不同的结构特征、材料的特性以及实验目的，选择合适的操作模式。 （更正后的文本不再赘述，以下是未更正的部分） 3.4.2.1 成像模式 （1）接触成像模式 接触成像模式下针尖始终与样品接触，以恒高或恒力的模式扫描。在扫描过程中，针尖在表面滑动，形成稳定的高分辨图像。这种模式不适用于低弹性模量和易变形的材料。 在大气环境中，由于毛细作用的存在，针尖和样品之间存在较大的粘滞力。横向扫描时施加在样品上的额外作用力可能会造成样品的损伤，粘滞力同时增大针尖和样品的接触面积，降低成像的分辨率。要解决这个问题，由于表面自由能越大粘滞力越强，可以通过AFM针尖对表面进行修饰，在针尖上涂覆低表面能的材料或者将针尖浸入液体中等，都可以克服毛细作用带来的影响，有效提高成像分辨率。 如果在上面的过程中微悬臂的分析和快速扫描的方向垂直，则针尖除了可以探测到与样品之间的垂直方向的原子力外，还会因为针尖与样品之间的摩擦力使得微悬臂发生横向扭转，这样就可以研究样品表面的微区摩擦性质。横向力测量已被广泛应用于多组分材料表面的摩擦性质研究。 （2）非接触成像模式 非接触成像模式中针尖在样品表面上方振动，始终未与样品接触。针尖探测器检测到的是范德华力和静电力等对样品没有破坏性的长程作用力，灵敏度较高。但是当针尖和样品距离较远时，成像分辨率较低，不适用于在液体中成像。 （3）轻敲模式 轻敲模式中，微悬臂在其共振模式附近做受迫振动。振动的针尖轻敲样品表面，间歇性地与表面接触。由于接触时间非常短，针尖与样品的作用力非常小，通常在皮牛顿到纳牛顿范围内，前切力引起的分辨率降低和对样品的破坏几乎消失，因此非常适合用于生物和聚合物等软物体的成像研究。 轻敲模式AFM可以在大气和液态环境下实现。在大气环境中，针尖离样品足够远时，微悬臂以最大振幅自由振荡。当针尖与样品接触时，尽管压电陶瓷片以同样的能量激发微悬臂振荡，但空间限制作用使微悬臂的振幅减小。反馈系统控制微悬臂的振幅保持不变，针尖就会随着表面的起伏而上下移动，获得表面形貌信息。轻敲模式同样适合在液态环境下操作，由于液态的阻尼作用，针尖与样品的剪切力更小，因此更不易对样品造成损伤，从而可以实现溶液反应的原位观察和活体生物检测。 轻敲模式的另一个重要应用是相位成像。通过测定扫描过程中微悬臂的振荡相位和压电陶瓷驱动信号的振荡相位之间的差值，可以研究材料的力学性质和表面性质，比如样品表面的摩擦、材料的滞弹性和黏附性，以及可以对材料表面的不同组分进行化学识别。 轻敲模式一般采用调制让横向振幅保持不变的方法进行恒力模式的扫描，也可以采用频率调制的化学识别技术，测量扫描过程中频率的变化。这种频率调制的AFM的力检测方式，可以大幅度提高噪声处理率和灵敏度，从而获得原子级别分辨率的图像。 3.4.2.2 力曲线模式 针尖和样品之间的相互作用力与距离的关系称为“力曲线”，是实现AFM观测的重要特性曲线之一。 （1）接触力曲线 接触模式的力曲线测量中，压电陶瓷置于当前扫描区域（x, y）的中心位置，停止扫描，仅在z方向施加周期性的三角波电压信号，使样品周期性地与针尖接近-接触-远离。AFM的光学系统实时记录微悬臂的变形量，将其对应到压电陶瓷的位移量上，就可以绘制出力曲线。力曲线上微悬臂的弯曲与其力学常数的乘积即为针尖与样品之间的作用力。 力曲线一般包括非接触区、接触区和粘着区三个部分。在非接触区，针尖远离样品，作用力可以忽略不计，并且微悬臂不会发生弯曲，因此力曲线为水平直线。当针尖逐渐接近样品，会出现引力（如范德华力），使微悬臂向样品表面弯曲。继续接近时，当针尖达到一定距离，微悬臂的斜率超过了弹簧常数，由于机械不稳定，针尖和样品突然接触，进入接触区。如果接触时针尖和样品没有发生明显弹性或塑性变形，样品移过的距离与微悬臂的弯曲量相同。当样品移动至某个预设位置进行反向运动时，微悬臂的弯曲量渐渐减少。由于针尖与样品间粘着，微悬臂先是向样品背面弯曲，后转向样品正面弯曲，这就是粘着区。最终，当微悬臂所积累的弹力超过粘着力，针尖突然脱离样品，微悬臂恢复到非弯曲状态，力曲线再次回到非接触区。 从力曲线的接触区斜率，我们可以测定纳米尺度上的力学性能。对于刚性样品，接触后样品移动的距离与微悬臂弯曲量相等，斜率约为1。对于塑性样品，可能针尖会插入样品内部，微悬臂弯曲量小于样品移动距离，斜率小于1。这一特性可以用来研究表面硬度以及抗磨损能力。通过力曲线在接触后的部分斜率，可以精确测定弹性模量、杨氏模量等力学参数。根据粘着区的强度可以分析样品表面的某些性质；而非接触区的粘着部分情况则可以估计力曲线测量所在介质的粘着力等参数。 （2）轻敲力曲线 除了接触力曲线之外，还有轻敲力曲线和力分布成像。轻敲力曲线是通过一种力/距离曲线的形式来测量，即探针周期性地接近-接触-远离样品表面，同时记录振动微悬臂的振幅、相位或者变形量对应于压电陶瓷的位移量。这种相位-频率图可以更为精确地表征样品的硬度、黏弹性以及其他力学性能。力分布成像是通过在（x, y）扫描的区域内，为每个位置都进行力曲线测量，通过将作用力对x轴和y轴进行作图，得到力分布图。通过选择不同的模式可以观察到静电力或者长程磁力等。 3.4.3 样品制备 AFM的样品制备相对简单。对于纳米粉体物质，应尽量以单层或亚单层形式分散并固定在衬底上。选择合适的溶剂和分散剂，将物质制成稀溶液，必要时通过超声波分散仪减少纳米粒子的聚集。根据纳米粒子的亲水或疏水性、表面化学特性等选择适合的衬底，比如云母片、高取向热解石墨（HOPG）、单晶硅片、玻璃或石英等。若要研究物质的尺寸、形貌等特性，应尽量使用表面原子级平滑的云母片、HOPG等作为衬底；样品需牢固固定在衬底上。对于纳米薄膜物质，如金属或金属氧化物薄膜、高分子薄膜、有机无机复合薄膜、自组装单分子膜等，通常都有衬底支持，可以直接用于AFM。 3.4.4 伪迹分析 与其他成像方法一样，扫描探针显微镜（SPM）也不可避免地会出现一定程度的伪迹（亦称伪影）。伪迹是指图像中出现的与样品固有结构无关或歪曲了其真实结构的图像。伪迹的产生通常是由于操作者经验不足、没有选择合适的成像参数（例如设定的力大小、扫描速率和增益等），或者是仪器自身的缺陷和部件的不完善（比如针尖的磨损和污染）导致的。测量误差主要是指仪器本身因素导致的测量误差。 3.4.4.1 探针针尖导致的伪迹和误差 使用原子力显微镜（AFM）测量的图像总是针尖几何形状和被成像特征形状的卷积。当探针尖端尺寸远小于被测量特征尺寸时，探针产生的伪迹将会最小，从图像导出的尺寸测量将是准确的。因此选择合适的探针至关重要。例如测量纳米管或纳米球等样品时，预期的高度是正确的，而其宽度则比预计的大。这"},{"prompt":"以“供应链优化：实现企业与供应商的双赢策略”为主题，写一篇2000字左右的报告书。

Изначально массив с числами делится на разряды. Например, если есть числа [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66], то первый разряд будет единицы, второй разряд - десятки, третий разряд - сотни и т.д. 2. Сортировка начинается с младшего (например, с первого разряда) до самого старшего разряда (например, до последнего разряда). Внутри каждого разряда используется сортировка подсчётом. 3. Во время сортировки подсчётом, числа разделяются по значению текущего разряда. Например, на первом шаге числа разделяются по значению единиц в последнем разряде. 4. Создаётся массив помощник, где для каждого числа хранится сколько чисел имеют такую же единицу в текущем разряде. Например, для массива [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66] помощник будет [2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]. 5.

Эти значения означают сколько чисел будет иметь меньший или равный разряд. 6. Создаётся новый массив, куда будут перемещены числа. Этот массив будет упорядочен в соответствии с текущим разрядом. Используется счётчик из массива помощника для определения правильной позиции для каждого числа. 7. Числа из исходного массива перемещаются в новый массив в соответствии со значением текущего разряда. При этом, после каждого перемещения, соответствующий счётчик из массива помощника уменьшается на 1. 8. Получившийся новый массив становится текущим и процесс повторяется для следующего разряда. 9. По окончании работы сортировки для последнего разряда, исходный массив станет отсортированным.

By examining the parallels between the boys' predicament and the historical context of America's colonization by the United Kingdom, we can gain valuable insights into the impact of colonialism on cultural identity. Colonization and Cultural Identity: Golding's novel explores the concept of colonization through the boys' descent into savagery and the erosion of their established social order, mirroring elements of America's own colonial history. As the boys struggle to establish a sense of order and governance on the island, their attempts echo the challenges faced by colonized peoples in asserting their cultural identity under foreign rule. Parallels: America and the United Kingdom: Examining the colonization case of America by the United Kingdom, we find strikingly similar themes to those portrayed in Lord of the Flies. Just as the boys' initial enthusiasm for self-governance fades and power struggles arise, colonized America went through phases of upheaval, rebellion, and eventual independent governance. From Colonized to Cultural Hybrid: One of the key effects of colonization portrayed in both realities is the alteration of cultural identity. In Lord of the Flies, the boys initially cling to their former societal norms but eventually embrace their newfound freedom, leading to a transformation of their cultural identity. Similarly, the Native American population in America had their cultural traditions and identities challenged, leading to the emergence of a unique cultural hybrid that blended their original customs with the influences of the colonizers. Dominance and Assimilation: Another aspect highlighted by Lord of the Flies and seen in America's colonization is the concept of dominance and assimilation. The British boys in the novel gradually exert control over the island, mirroring the United Kingdom's dominance over America during colonization. The assimilation process that followed colonization diluted the native cultures to some extent, as the colonizers' language, customs, and institutions took hold and influenced the emerging American identity. Resistance and Liberation: Throughout history, resistance against colonization has been a recurring theme. In Lord of the Flies, the characters Ralph and Piggy embody the resistance against the boys' descent into savagery. In America's colonial experience, figures like the founding fathers and numerous revolutionary movements epitomized a similar resistance and fight for liberation from British rule, ultimately shaping a new American cultural identity. Conclusion: William Golding's masterful narrative in Lord of the Flies provides a thought-provoking lens through which to examine America's colonial history and its impact on cultural identity. The parallels between the boys' experiences on the island and America's colonization by the United Kingdom shed light on the challenges faced by colonized societies around the world. By understanding these historical dynamics, we can foster a deeper appreciation for the complexities of cultural identity formation and the lasting impacts of colonization."},{"prompt":"1.

In this case, it is true that the MCFP on a tree either has an infeasible solution or a unique optimal solution. If the capacities and demands in the tree satisfy the conservation of flow property (i.e., the sum of the demands at each node equals 0), then a feasible solution always exists. In this case, the MCFP on a tree will have a unique optimal solution. However, if the conservation of flow property is not satisfied, it means that there is an imbalance in the flow at some nodes. In this case, it is not possible to find a feasible flow that satisfies all the demands and respects the capacities of the edges. Thus, the MCFP on a tree is infeasible. To summarize, on a tree, the MCFP is either infeasible or has a unique optimal solution, depending on whether the conservation of flow property is satisfied."},{"prompt":"can u give me one example when MCFP on a tree is infeasible","completion":"Certainly!

This means that it is not possible to find a flow that satisfies all the demands and respects the capacities of the edges. Hence, the MCFP on this tree is infeasible."},{"prompt":"Example of a cycle in a transportation tableau","completion":"Sure!

To identify cycles in a transportation tableau, you can follow these steps: 1. Start by selecting any cell in the tableau with a non-zero value. 2. Trace a path from the selected cell to another cell that shares either the same row or column. This path can go through any non-zero value cells in the tableau. 3. Keep following the path until you return to a cell that you've already visited. This will form a cycle. 4. Once you've identified a cycle, you can highlight or mark the cells involved in the cycle. 5. Repeat the above steps to identify other cycles in the tableau if any exist. It's important to note that in the transportation tableau, cycles can only be formed within the cells that have non-zero values. The cycles can be formed by traversing through the cells that have non-zero values, following the rows or columns. Identifying and understanding cycles can be useful for certain optimization methods such as the transportation algorithm and the modified distribution method. These methods utilize the cycles to find an initial feasible solution or to improve upon an existing feasible solution."},{"prompt":"human right days idea","completion":"One idea for Human Rights Day is to organize a community-wide event that promotes understanding and respect for different cultures and backgrounds.

It is mainly expressed in the developing pituitary gland and the trophoblast cells of the placenta. The trophoblast is the outer layer of cells in the developing blastocyst (early stage of embryo). It is responsible for implantation of the embryo into the uterine wall and subsequently gives rise to the placenta. Trophoblast cells are unique in that they have invasive properties, allowing them to penetrate the uterine tissues and establish a connection with the maternal blood supply. LHX4 is involved in the differentiation and function of trophoblast cells. Studies have shown that LHX4 is necessary for trophoblast invasion and maintenance of the placental structure. It regulates the expression of various genes involved in trophoblast development, including those associated with cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. Defects in LHX4 expression or function have been linked to abnormal placental development and gestational complications, such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Therefore, understanding the role of LHX4 in trophoblast biology is important for comprehending the mechanisms underlying normal placental development and related pregnancy disorders."},{"prompt":"please give me some papers about their relation","completion":"I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to specific papers or the ability to browse the internet.

Цены меняются по нескольку раз пока дело до покупки дойдет. Менеджеры какие-то странные, то одно говорят, то уже другое, будто с памятью у них проблемы. Я даже не понял, специально это так делается или непроизвольно. В общем не советую тратить свое время на ДЦ Шереметьевский - никакой автосалон и даже не стараются работать хорошо. Хотел купить в автосалоне ДЦ Шереметьевский новый автомобиль. На сайте цена 615 900. По телефону все подтвердили, сказали авто в наличии. Несколько раз спрашивал не вырастет ли цена, сказали что как на сайте. И что вы думаете? По приезду цена авто выросла до 750т.р., при этом по факту в машине ничего не изменилось. Они объяснили это тем, что на сайте цена при покупке в кредит, но ведь я по телефону несколько раз говорил, что покупаю на наличку. Развод и обман! вы думаете в этом типа салоне у меня получилось купить дастер за сказочые цены? Конечно же нет! Самой дешёвой комплектации не было в наличии, а взамен мне предложили с 2 литра двигателем практически максимальную. По поводу пригона комплектации под заказ менеджер отвечал неохотно, намекая, что ждать пока авто привезут может придётся больше месяца. Цены то может быть и по акции, вот только автомобилей нет таких дешёвых в наличии! Недавно приобретали в салоне ДЦ Шереметьевский новый автомобиль. Менеджер Антон объявил нам конечную сумму, мы пошли расплачиваться. И тут вдруг девушка из бухгалтерии не отдает нам уже оформленные документы, т.к. мы не заплатили еще 10 000 руб. за бухгалтерское оформление документов, 15000 за бронь, 8000 за предпродажную подготовку и еще пару пунктов. А ведь никто ничего об этом не говорил!? Развод на деньги!!! Обходите этот салон стороной!! Не ведитесь! Подписав предварительный договор и внеся 5%, ВЫ ввязываетесь не понятно во что. Приехав за авто в автосалон ДЦ Шереметьевский, внесли оставшуюся сумму, как нам казалось, и стали ждать подписания договора. Подписали, а там стоимость авто увеличилась аж на 20%. И отказаться мы не можем, ибо тогда надо им оставить крупную сумму неустойки! Но мы это так оставлять не захотели, так нам стали угрожать, что птс и ключи ( которые мы даже в руках не держали) у нас и типа мы же еще и хотим кинуть этот гребанный салон 6,Вранья конечно же много от рекламы. Без нее этот автосалон давно загнулся бы с такими ценами! В салоне АвтоБор все машины дороже по минимуму на 30% от официальной цены, так что я бы очень не советовал тут покупать машину без крайней нужды да и по нужде тоже... зачем переплачивать?

They were feared and respected by all for their incredible skills and bravery. In the heart of Astera, there was a colossal volcano known as the Sacred Mount. Deep within the volcano, a creature of immense power laid dormant. This creature was called Fatalis, a legendary black dragon said to be the embodiment of destruction. One day, news spread throughout Astera that Fatalis had awakened from its slumber. The village elders called upon the Black Dragons, knowing that only they possessed the strength and determination to face this formidable enemy. Led by their fearless leader, Ryujin, the Black Dragons gathered their weapons and armor, preparing for what would be their greatest challenge yet. Their mission was clear - to protect Astera from the imminent threat of Fatalis and restore peace to their land. As they ventured into the depths of the Sacred Mount, the Black Dragons faced treacherous lava rivers, scorching flames, and the ever-present danger of Fatalis' wrath. But their determination never wavered. Days turned into weeks, and still, the Black Dragons pressed on. Finally, they reached the inner sanctum where Fatalis awaited. The atmosphere was heavy with tension as they prepared to engage in a battle that would determine the fate of Astera. The battle was fierce and unforgiving. Fatalis unleashed torrents of black flames, roaring with fury. But the Black Dragons fought valiantly, using their skills and teamwork to their advantage. Each member showcased their unique abilities, their determination burning brighter with every strike. Ryujin, the leader of the Black Dragons, faced Fatalis head-on. Their clash was a spectacle, with the ground shaking from their immense power. In a display of incredible skill, Ryujin landed a decisive blow, plunging his weapon deep into Fatalis' heart. As the lifeblood of Fatalis stained the battlefield, a deafening roar echoed through the Sacred Mount. Fatalis, defeated but not destroyed, retreated back into the depths, vowing to never rise again. The Black Dragons emerged from the volcano, triumphant but weary. The villagers of Astera celebrated their heroes, recognizing the selflessness and bravery they had displayed. And so, the Black Dragons returned to their village, their mission fulfilled. From that day on, their legend grew, serving as a reminder to all that even in the face of darkness, there will always be those who rise up to protect the ones they love.

For example theres 7 images total for each image as ots meant to be split up into 7 seperate ones to be solved, but it could also be done without that but thats gonna leave a lot of whitespace and its probably innefficient. If i were to crop them out to all their 7 images how would i represent them or label them?","completion":"If you want to train a model based on ResNet-50 to solve a captcha, you need to split the captcha images into their individual components. There are a few ways to represent and label these images for training the model. Here are two possible approaches: 1. Separate Images with Label Encoding: - Crop each of the 7 parts of the captcha image and save them as individual images. - Assign labels to each cropped image, indicating the character or symbol it represents. - For label encoding, you can utilize one-hot encoding or integer encoding methods. One-hot encoding represents each label as a binary vector, while integer encoding assigns a unique integer value to each label. - You can create a dataset with the individual images and their corresponding labels to train your ResNet-50 model. 2. Single Image with Spatial Labeling: - Instead of cropping the captcha image into several parts, keep it intact as a single image. - Apply a bounding box or spatial annotation to identify and locate each character or symbol within the image. - Assign labels to each bounding box or spatial region, indicating the character or symbol it represents. - You can create a dataset with the single captcha images, along with the bounding box coordinates and their corresponding labels. - During training, you can utilize image augmentation techniques to introduce random transformations and variations in the position and appearance of the characters within the image. Both approaches have their pros and cons. The first approach allows for independent processing of individual characters, which can be advantageous when recognizing complex or uncommon symbols. However, it requires additional steps for cropping and labeling each image. The second approach simplifies the process by keeping the captcha as a single image but requires the model to learn the spatial relationships between the characters within the image. You can experiment with both approaches to see which one works best for your specific captcha problem."},{"prompt":"Does resnet 50 allow for bounding boxes?","completion":"ResNet-50, in its original form, does not inherently support bounding box predictions. It is primarily a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for image classification tasks. However, you can modify ResNet-50 or use it as a component in a more complex model to incorporate bounding box predictions. To enable bounding box predictions with ResNet-50, you can employ techniques such as: 1. Region Proposal Networks (RPN): Use a separate RPN to generate potential bounding box proposals and pass these proposals through the ResNet-50 backbone for classification. 2. Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD): Adapt the ResNet-50 architecture as the backbone of an SSD network, which combines both object detection and classification. 3. Faster R-CNN: Utilize ResNet-50 as the backbone for a Faster R-CNN model, which incorporates both region proposal generation and bounding box classification. These approaches involve modifying the original ResNet-50 architecture by adding additional layers or components to enable bounding box predictions. By doing so, you can train the model to not only classify images but also predict and localize objects or regions of interest within those images using bounding boxes. Implementing these modifications may require familiarity with object detection frameworks such as Faster R-CNN or SSD, as well as experience with neural network architectures."},{"prompt":"The captcha works like this: theres two types of images, one is the direction, and other 6 are animals looking at random directions, you have to pick out the animal which is looking the correct way. What if i crop them both out, the direction and the animals then stitch them tegother with the animal abose and direction below for each animal, then the label will just be a boolean that will be either yes, the angle of the direction matches the direction the animal is looking, or no, the animal is not looking the same way as the direction. That would probably be much better data aswell as it can learn what is and isnt correct much better as each exampleis looked at seperately","completion":"Yes, cropping out both the direction and animal images and combining them together to create composite images can be a viable approach for training your model to solve the captcha. Stitching them together with the animal above and the direction below, and labeling them with a boolean (e.g., \\"yes\\" if the angle of the animal matches the direction, and \\"no\\" otherwise) is a suitable way to represent and label the data. By doing so, your model will learn to examine each composite image separately and determine whether the animal's gaze aligns with the provided direction. This approach allows for the model to understand the correct relationship between the animals and their associated directions. Keep in mind that when using this approach, you should ensure that the composite images are aligned properly so that the animal and direction components are correctly juxtaposed. Additionally, it may be useful to perform data augmentation techniques (e.g., random rotations, translations, or flips) to introduce variations and improve the model's robustness. Training your model on such composite images with boolean labels will enable it to learn the specific relationship between the animals' gaze directions and the provided direction, allowing it to accurately solve the captcha task."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Многие машины, представленные там, не в адекватном для продажи состоянии, нету зоны ожидания, просто надо ходить по салону ждать когда подойдут менеджера и ответят на все нужные вопросы. Но и самому рассматривать автомобили тоже нельзя! Не дай Бог охрана увидит у вас толщиномер - сразу штраф! Это просто какой-то капец! Центральный лепят всякую лапшу в аспекте собственных скидок на легковые автомобили. А на практике ведь в автоцентре скидок нет. Вся эта ложь преднамеренная и создана для того, чтобы переманить клиентов из других городов. Когда я подъехал к салону, там не было ни забронированной машины, ни обещанных скидок. Менеджеры автосалона Центральный мне обещал выгодный процент по кредиту. Но как только дело дошло до оформления кредита, ставка по проценту выросла. Я стал расспрашивать почему так, на что мне ответили, что только под такой процент мне смогли одобрить кредит. В общем это просто шарашкина контора по разводу клиентов. Пожалуйста не покупайте машины в центральном автосалоне! Они затариваются побитыми и изношенными старыми авто, преображают их прямо в подвале автосалона. Делают поверхностный ремонт, чтобы тачка завелась и проездила 500 метров по территории салона, а дальше просто заглохла. Тест-драйв строго 5 минут, больше уже не разрешают. Заманивают клиентов через скидки, но и они вранье! Здесь просто отвратительное обращение к клиентам. В автосалоне Центральный я себе выбрал автомобиль с нужной мне комплектацией, но такой машины в наличии не было. Менеджер тут же мне начал навязывать абсолютно другой автомобиль. Когда я стал отказываться, то он начал мне грубить и хамить. Развернулся и ушел от туда без покупки. 6, Автосалон Центральный какой-то мутный. Планировал здесь взять кредит с нормальными процентами, но видимо мне не повезло. Обещали кредит под 5% годовых. После тест-драйва я направился в кредитный отдел, где долго готовили мои документы. А после оказалось, что мне одобрили кредит под 21%. Эти менеджеры обещают одно, а по факту совсем другое выходит.","completion":"Автосалон Кар Моторс оставляет желать лучшего.
