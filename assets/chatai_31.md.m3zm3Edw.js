Now, we have a system of two equations: - b^2 + c^2 - 12 = bc, - b times c = 8 We can solve this system for b and c. It can be noticed that if we add 12 to both sides of the second equation, we get a relationship that resembles the Pythagorean identity: b^2 + c^2 = 20. Considering the permissible values for b and c, and the fact that they multiply to 8, we find two possible solutions: - b = 4 and c = 2, - or b = 2 and c = 4.

Similarly, PS is parallel to AC, and PQ is parallel to AB. This implies that triangle PQS and triangle ABC are similar because their corresponding sides are parallel. 2. **Determine Side Lengths in triangle PQS**: Since the circles are tangent and their centers are connected, the distances between the centers equal the sum of their radii. Therefore, we have: [QR = RS = PR = PS = 1 + 1 = 2.] 3. **Find Angles in triangle PQS**: Knowing triangle PRS is equilateral (since PR=PS=RS), we find angle PSR = angle PRS = 60^circ. With QRS being a straight line, angle QRP = 180^circ - 60^circ = 120^circ. Since triangle QRP is isosceles (with QR=RP), we find: [angle PQR = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - 120^circ) = 30^circ.] Consequently, angle QPS = 180^circ - 30^circ - 60^circ = 90^circ, making triangle PQS a 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle. 4. **Apply Similarity to triangle ABC**: Since triangle ABC is similar to triangle PQS, it is also a 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle. 5. **Calculate Side AC**: By dropping perpendiculars from P and S to AC, we form a rectangle PXZS with XZ = PS = 2. With angle PAX = 45^circ and angle SCZ = 30^circ, we find AX = PX = 1 and CZ = sqrt{3}. Thus, AC = 1 + 2 + sqrt{3} = 3 + sqrt{3}. 6. **Determine triangle ABC Side Lengths**: Given triangle ABC is a 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle, we have: - BC = 2AC = 6 + 2sqrt{3}, - AB = sqrt{3}AC = 3sqrt{3} + 3. 7. **Calculate the Perimeter**: The perimeter of triangle ABC is the sum of its sides: [3 + sqrt{3} + 3sqrt{3} + 3 + 6 + 2sqrt{3} = 12 + 6sqrt{3}.] Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is boxed{12 + 6sqrt{3}}."},{"prompt":"Given conditions p: |x+1| > 2, and condition q: |x| > a, where lnot p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for lnot q, determine the range of values for the real number a.

According to the given rule, he can solve at most 5 problems on each of the next two days, ( D_{i+1} ) and ( D_{i+2} ). - So, in any block of three days where one day includes ( x ) problems (where ( 8 leq x leq 10 )), the total number of problems solved is ( x + 5 + 5 = x + 10 ). 3. **Maximizing Problem Solving in 7 Days** To maximize the number of problems solved in 7 days, let's consider the optimal distribution: - We want to maximize the days where Pasha solves 10 problems, but adhere to the \\"no more than 5 problems\\" constraint for the subsequent two days. 4. **Optimal Strategy** For simplicity, let's structure the 7 days considering he should only solve more than 7 problems three times at most (any more will reduce the subsequent days' total excessively): - Solve 10 problems on the first day: ( D_1 = 10 ) - The next two days must be ( D_2 leq 5 ) and ( D_3 leq 5 ): So, assume he solves 5 problems on these days: ( D_2 = 5 ) and ( D_3 = 5 ). - Assume he solves 10 problems on the fourth day: ( D_4 = 10 ) - The next two days must follow the same constraint: ( D_5 = 5 ), ( D_6 = 5 ). - Finally, solve 10 problems on the last day: ( D_7 = 10 ). 5. **Summing Up** The total number of problems solved with this distribution: [ 10 + 5 + 5 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 10 = 50 ] 6. **Reevaluating Strategy for Maximum Total** Given the strict constraints over consecutive days, let’s ensure this is indeed the maximum: - Suppose an alternative where ( x ) is lower for more leniency on other days, he could solve 7 problems on each day without hitting any penalties. - However, the total across the 7 days is straightforward when considering each maximum independently but strategically: Any deviation upwards from a non-maximal multi-day (problem-limit) enforces checking summation thoroughly.

Substitute this into the equation: [ (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = 633 cdot p ] 4.

Therefore, the assumption that there exists an angle alpha such that sin alpha = sec alpha must be false. 2. **Second Part - Proving cos alpha neq csc alpha:** Similarly, for cos alpha and csc alpha, we recall that: [ csc alpha = frac{1}{sin alpha} ] Let us assume there is an angle alpha such that: [ cos alpha = csc alpha ] Then we would have: [ cos alpha = frac{1}{sin alpha} ] By multiplying both sides by sin alpha, we get: [ cos alpha sin alpha = 1 ] Again, by substituting in the double-angle identity: [ frac{1}{2} sin 2alpha = 1 ] [ sin 2alpha = 2 ] Since the range of the sine function is ([-1, 1]), it is impossible for sin 2alpha to equal 2.

To solve this, we will conduct a geometric analysis by following these steps: 1. **Partitioning the plane**: - Divide the plane into identical squares with a side length of 2R, where R is the radius of the quarter-circles. This will allow us to systematically analyze the layout and movement direction of each track segment. 2. **Coloring the squares**: - Let's color these squares in a chessboard pattern, where alternating squares are colored black and white. 3. **Inscribing circles**: - Inside each square, inscribe a circle of radius R. These inscribed circles will represent the paths on which the train will travel. 4. **Analyzing track segments**: - Place the quarter-circle segments onto these inscribed circles. Notice that: - A quarter-circle track segment in a white square will have a movement direction that rotates clockwise. - A quarter-circle track segment in a black square will have a movement direction that rotates counter-clockwise. - This alignment ensures consistent transition from one segment to another, maintaining smooth curves. 5. **Movement analysis**: - When a train moves from one quarter-circle segment to the next: - If the train starts at the beginning of a white square's track and continues to another white square, the rotation remains clockwise. - Conversely, if the transition is from a white square to a black square, or vice versa, the rotation switches from clockwise to counter-clockwise, ensuring a consistent change in direction that cannot form back-to-back endpoints. 6. **Contradiction in forming a dead-end loop**: - A dead-end loop would necessitate a simultaneous clockwise and counter-clockwise path formation at the junction of the first and the last segment. This is impossible as the train’s direction must consistently align along the designed path. Therefore, considering the uniform transition and directed movement on these quarter circles, it becomes clear that: - The tracks cannot be arranged to form a path where the start and end points overlap, thereby creating a dead-end. To conclude, by partitioning the plane, analyzing the movement, and ensuring consistent directional transitions, it is apparent that forming a dead-end using quarter-circle track segments is fundamentally impossible.

We start with the inequality given in the problem: [ sin(n + 1) < sin(n + 2) < sin(n + 3) < ldots < sin(n + k). ] 2. To analyze this, we need to understand the behavior of the sine function. The sine function is periodic with period (2pi) and oscillates between -1 and 1. The function (sin(x)) is increasing in the interval (left[-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right]) and decreasing in the interval (left[frac{pi}{2}, frac{3pi}{2}right]). 3. For (sin(n + i) < sin(n + i + 1)) to hold for (i = 1, 2, ldots, k-1), the values (n + 1, n + 2, ldots, n + k) must lie within an interval where the sine function is strictly increasing. This interval is (left[-frac{pi}{2} + 2mpi, frac{pi}{2} + 2mpiright]) for some integer (m). 4. We need to find the largest (k) such that (n + 1, n + 2, ldots, n + k) all lie within an interval of length (pi) where the sine function is increasing. This means: [ n + k < n + 1 + pi implies k < pi. ] 5. Since (k) must be a natural number, we take the largest integer less than (pi). The value of (pi) is approximately 3.14159, so the largest integer less than (pi) is 3. 6. However, we need to verify if (k = 4) is possible. For (k = 4), we need: [ sin(n + 1) < sin(n + 2) < sin(n + 3) < sin(n + 4). ] 7. We can check if there exists an (n) such that this holds. For example, if (n = 41): [ sin(42) < sin(43) < sin(44) < sin(45). ] 8. We need to check if these values lie within an increasing interval of the sine function. Since (sin(x)) is increasing in (left[-frac{pi}{2} + 2mpi, frac{pi}{2} + 2mpiright]), we need to check if (42, 43, 44, 45) lie within such an interval. 9.

These values do not lie within a single increasing interval of the sine function. Therefore, (k = 4) is not possible. 11. Thus, the largest (k) such that there exists a natural number (n) satisfying the given inequality is (k = 3).

Choose ( k+1 ) boxes. 2. From these ( k+1 ) boxes, choose ( k ) and remove at least half of the coins from each, and add to the remaining box (if labeled ( b_i )) a number of ( i ) coins. 3. If one of the boxes is left empty, the game ends; otherwise, go to the next step. 2. **Finding the Minimum ( n ):** - We claim that the least positive integer ( n ) for which the game can be played indefinitely is ( n = 2^k + k - 1 ). 3. **Proof that ( n = 2^k + k - 1 ) Works:** - Let ( a_0 leq a_1 leq cdots leq a_k ) be the numbers of coins in the ( k+1 ) largest-indexed boxes, in sorted order. - Define a position as *full* if ( a_i geq 2^i ) for each ( 0 leq i leq k ). - Initially, the position is full because the number of coins in each box ( b_i ) is ( i ), and the indices of the ( k+1 ) largest boxes are at least ( 2^k - 1 ). - If we add to the box with ( a_0 ) coins and subtract from the other ( k ) boxes, fullness is preserved. 4. **Proof that ( n < 2^k + k - 1 ) Does Not Work:** - Define ( f(n) ) as the greatest nonnegative integer ( r ) such that ( 2^r leq n ). - If box ( i ) has ( c_i ) coins, let the *score* of the position be ( sum f(c_i) ) over all boxes ( i ). 5. **Claim:** - ( f(x + y - 1) leq f(x) + f(y) ). 6. **Proof of the Claim:** - If ( x ) or ( y ) is ( 1 ), the claim is clearly true. - Otherwise, let ( f(x) = r ) and ( f(y) = s ), with ( r geq s geq 1 ). - Then: [ x + y - 1 < 2^{r+1} + 2^{s+1} - 1 < 2^{r+1} + 2^{r+1} = 2^{r+2} leq 2^{r+s+1} ] - This implies ( f(x + y - 1) leq r + s ). 7. **Score Analysis:** - If we remove at least half the coins from box ( i ), this subtracts at least ( 1 ) from ( f(c_i) ). - If we add ( i ) coins to box ( i ), by the above claim, this adds at most ( f(i + 1) leq k ) coins to box ( i ), and equality holds for at most ( k ) values of ( i ). - Therefore, the score can never increase in a step, and there are at most ( k ) boxes (chosen as the box being added to) for which the score remains the same. 8. **Conclusion:** - The score is always a nonnegative integer, so after some point, we must only add to one of those ( k ) boxes. - This means we must subtract from one of the remaining ( n - k ) boxes, causing the number of coins in those ( n - k ) boxes to strictly decrease every step, leading to a contradiction.

The perimeter being 30 units can also divide equally into four sides of 7.5 units each, which fits the rhombus property. - **Square**: A special type of rhombus and rectangle, with all sides equal, all angles 90 degrees, and perpendicular diagonals. The perimeter of 30 units implies each side is 7.5 units, qualifying it under these conditions. - **Kite**: A kite can also have one right angle and perpendicular diagonals, but it does not have uniform side lengths or all right angles. 3. **Revising the Possibilities**: - The given properties suggest a geometric figure with more regulated side lengths and angles. Even though the rhombus and square fit this description, the specific mention of a 90-degree angle leans more conclusively towards a square. 4. **Conclusion**: - Given that all criteria are satisfied most concisely with a square, where the sides equally divide the perimeter and accommodate a right angle with perpendicular diagonals, the quadrilateral is likely a square. text{Square} The final answer is boxed{textbf{C}} Square"},{"prompt":"When a student multiplied the number 66 by the repeating decimal, [underline{1}.underline{a} underline{b} underline{a} underline{b}ldots=underline{1}.overline{underline{a} underline{b}},] where a and b are digits, he did not notice the notation and just multiplied 66 times underline{1}.underline{a} underline{b}.

Given that the number of sets that can be rented for 400 from Shop A equals the number of sets that can be rented for 500 from Shop B, we can set up the following equation based on the cost and the number of sets: [ frac{400}{x} = frac{500}{x + 10} ] Solving this equation for x: [ 400(x + 10) = 500x 400x + 4000 = 500x 100x = 4000 x = 40 ] Thus, the cost per set from Shop A is 40. For Shop B, the cost per set is x + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. Therefore, the cost per set of costumes rented from Shop A is boxed{40}, and from Shop B is boxed{50}. Part 2: Determining the Better Option for Renting More Sets To decide which shop offers a better deal for renting more than 100 sets of costumes, let's calculate the number of sets that can be rented from each shop with a budget of 5000. - **From Shop A:** The number of sets that can be rented is calculated by dividing the total budget by the cost per set: [ frac{5000}{40} = 125 text{ sets} ] - **From Shop B with Discount:** For Shop B, after the discount of 20% per set and an additional 200 off, the effective cost per set is 50 times 0.8 = 40. The additional 200 off can be considered as renting extra sets. The number of extra sets this 200 can rent at the discounted price is frac{200}{50} = 4 sets. Therefore, the total number of sets that can be rented from Shop B is: [ frac{5000}{40} + 4 = 125 + 4 = 129 text{ sets} ] Since 125 < 129, it is clear that more sets can be rented from Shop B.

This is a fundamental property of Euclidean geometry. **Conclusion**: The statement is correct. ② **Statement**: Two angles that are adjacent and complementary must be complementary. **Analysis**: By definition, if two angles are adjacent, they share a common vertex and a common side. If they are also complementary, their measures add up to 90^circ. The statement is essentially restating the definition of complementary angles that are adjacent. **Conclusion**: The statement is correct. ③ **Statement**: Equal angles are not necessarily vertical angles. **Analysis**: Equal angles can occur in various configurations, not just as vertical angles. Vertical angles are a specific case where two lines intersect, creating two pairs of opposite angles that are equal. However, equal angles can also be found in parallel lines cut by a transversal, in triangles, or in many other geometric configurations. **Conclusion**: The statement is correct. ④ **Statement**: When two lines are intersected by a third line, the corresponding angles are equal. **Analysis**: This statement is only true when the two lines are parallel.

Point P lies on the ellipse C. Find the maximum value of the radius r of the inscribed circle of triangle PF_{1}F_{2}, and determine the coordinates of point P if triangle POF_{2} is an isosceles triangle.","completion":"To find the maximum value of the radius r of the inscribed circle of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} and determine the coordinates of point P under given conditions, we proceed as follows: **Step 1: Identifying the Foci of the Ellipse** Given the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1, we identify its foci. The foci are located at a distance c from the center along the major axis, where c^2 = a^2 - b^2. Here, a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 3, so c = sqrt{4 - 3} = 1. Thus, the foci are F_1(-1,0) and F_2(1,0). **Step 2: Maximizing the Radius of the Inscribed Circle** The maximum value of the radius r of the inscribed circle of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} occurs when point P is at the top or bottom vertex of the ellipse. Let's choose P(0, pm sqrt{3}) for this scenario. The area of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} can be calculated using the formula frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}, where the base is the distance between F_1 and F_2, which is 2, and the height is pm sqrt{3}. Therefore, the area is frac{1}{2} times 2 times sqrt{3} = sqrt{3}. The semi-perimeter of triangle PF_{1}F_{2}, denoted as s, is frac{1}{2}(PF_1 + PF_2 + F_1F_2) = frac{1}{2}(2 + 2 + 2) = 3. The radius of the inscribed circle is given by r = frac{text{Area}}{s} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. **Step 3: Determining the Coordinates of Point P** Given triangle POF_{2} is an isosceles triangle, and knowing the minor axis of the ellipse is 2b = 2, the distance from the center to a vertex along the minor axis is 1. Therefore, point P must lie on the ellipse such that x_P = frac{1}{2} to form an isosceles triangle with OF_2. Using the ellipse equation, we solve for y_P: frac{x_P^2}{4} + frac{y_P^2}{3} = 1 Rightarrow frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{4} + frac{y_P^2}{3} = 1 Rightarrow frac{y_P^2}{3} = 1 - frac{1}{16} = frac{15}{16} Rightarrow y_P^2 = frac{45}{16} Rightarrow y_P = pm frac{3sqrt{5}}{4}.

Part (a) 1. **Setting Up the Angles:** - There are 12 angles formed by connecting these four points, denoted as (angle BAC,angle ABC,angle ACB, ldots, angle BDC). 2. **Key Observation from Geometry:** - Any triangle formed by three points (A, B, C) with sides (AB, BC, AC) must have an angle not exceeding (60^circ). This is true because, in any triangle, the sum of the angles is (180^circ). If all angles were more than (60^circ), the total would exceed (180^circ), which is impossible. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one angle that is less than or equal to (60^circ). 3. **Applying to All Triangles:** - As each triangle, say (ABC), formed by any choice of three points from (A, B, C, D) will have to satisfy the above property, the statement applies to all combinations. Thus, each set of three points forming a triangle will always have an angle not greater than (60^circ). 4. **Conclusion for the Smallest Angle:** - Among the 12 angles formed by the combinations of points, the smallest angle must be (leq 60^circ), as every possible triangle contains an angle within this range. Thus, the smallest angle is indeed always (leq 60^circ). ( blacksquare ) Part (b) 1. **Re-examining Triangles:** - For the largest angle, we need another geometric property. Any tetrahedron (ABCD) in space has faces that are triangles, and we look at these triangles individually. 2. **Key Property of an Equilateral Tetrahedron:** - If the tetrahedron (ABCD) is equilateral (i.e., all edges are equal), then each triangular face is an equilateral triangle, where each angle is exactly (60^circ). 3. **Considering General Case:** - For a non-equilateral tetrahedron, observe that: - In any tetrahedron, even if not equilateral, there must still be an angle (geq 60^circ) because if all angles were less than (60^circ), each face combined would not sum to more than one plane's angle set (360°), defecting volume requirement. Hence, having a largest angle (ge 60^circ) is necessary. 4. **Generalized Maximum Angle:** - As all tetrahedrons share this geometric property, the angles must adhere to the triangle inequality rules plus spatial considerations detailed here. By the above two observations, the largest angle always falls within the range (geq 60^circ). Hence, at least one angle will always be ( geq 60^circ ).

The longest distance in the cube is sqrt{3} meters. 4. **Counting Space Diagonals**: The cube has exactly four space diagonals.

Thus, we need to find the smallest number n such that: 1. n is a multiple of 45, and 2. n - 100 is a multiple of 7. Starting from the smallest multiple of 45, we check each successive multiple to see if it matches the condition n - 100 being a multiple of 7. - For n = 45, n - 100 = 45 - 100 = -55. We check if -55 is a multiple of 7, which it is not. - For n = 90, n - 100 = 90 - 100 = -10. This is also not a multiple of 7. - For n = 135, n - 100 = 135 - 100 = 35.

The structure will begin as THTHTHTHTH, covering 10 tosses. Next, count ways to add HH and TT: - We have 3 HH to add. Since there are already 4 H's in the sequence, we need to place these H's adjacent to existing H's. This is a balls-and-urns problem with 3 balls (new H's) into 4 urns (spaces around existing H's).

We can calculate the discriminant as Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-m)^2 - 4m(-1) = m^2 + 4m < 0. This gives us the inequality m^2 + 4m < 0, which factors into m(m + 4) < 0.

It can also be the union of multiple such unit segments, as long as the endpoints of any two segments are not the same. For instance, in Figure 1's second example, we have AB=1 and A'B', where A A' > 2, ensuring that neither AB' nor BA' is unit in length. ![Figure 1](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_6787577a55f2986ccd46g-1.jpg?height=306&width=936&top_left_y=484&top_left_x=581) 2. **Case for m=2:** - Simple examples for S_2 include the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length 1 or the vertices of a rhombus with unit sides, ensuring none of the diagonals is of unit length.

Define S_m' as a shifted image of S_m by a unit vector overrightarrow{AA'}. Here, A' should be on the circle of radius 1 around A (denoted k_a), excluding points B_1, B_2, ldots, B_m. This shifting allows ensuring the new set S_{m+1} has m+1 points at unit distance from A' in S_{m+1}. 4. **Method illustration:** - To form S_{m+1} from S_m, unite S_m with its shifted version S_m' by a unit vector. The shifting ensures no overlap in distances except at required points. Following an appropriate shift, A' will be on k_a but not at positions B_i. Similarly, we avoid points on circles around other points in S_m that are within the distance 1. 5. **Exclusion-necessary steps:** - Removing certain points excluded by the circle intersections ensures that the final configuration S_{m+1} has exactly m+1 unit distances. Initially, we block 2(r-1) points from k_a. Enveloped vector constraints ensure finite exclusion. 6. **General solution:** - The process proposed generalizes to any m, and iterating these steps builds larger sets satisfying our criteria. This is ensured because excluded points from k_a are finite, maintaining numerous configurations for each m. Refining all the necessary steps and ensuring the induction holds, we deduce: [boxed{text{We proved that such a point set exists for any natural number } m.}]"},{"prompt":"f two planes are each parallel to a third plane, then the positional relationship between these two planes is ( ).

Since the fractions written by Misha and Alex are equal, we have the equation: [ frac{a+30}{b} = frac{a}{b-6} ] 5. To solve the equation, cross multiply to get rid of the denominators: [ (a + 30)(b - 6) = a b ] 6. Expand the left-hand side: [ ab + 30b - 6a - 180 = ab ] 7.

This homothety sends ( P ) to a point ( P' ) on ( Gamma ) such that the tangent at ( P' ) is parallel to ( (AB) ), that is, ( P' ) is the midpoint of arc ( AB ). 1. **Alignments Through Homothety**: - Since ( S ), ( P ), and ( P' ) are collinear under this homothety, similarly, points ( S ), ( Q ), and ( Q' ) (midpoint of arc ( AC )) are collinear. 2. **Artificial Intersection Points**: - According to the South Pole theorem, the point ( I ) is defined as the intersection of lines ( (BQ') ) and ( (CP') ). 3. **Conclusion with Pascal's Theorem**: - The given situation is a special case where the application of Pascal's Theorem is evident. When applied to hexagon ( ABQ'SP'C ) inscribed in ( Gamma ), it directly implies that point ( I ) lies on the line ( PQ ). # General Situation: Given the diagram with quadrilateral ( A H B C ) inscribed in circle ( Gamma ), point ( X ) is the intersection of the diagonals.

Given ( CT ) is tangent to ( omega ), coordinate via South Pole inversion confirms ( P'I^2 = P'P cdot P'R ). 6. **Final Conclusion**: - These steps validate ( T = Q ).

From (M), we draw pairs of mutually perpendicular lines that intersect the circumference at points thereby forming chords of the circle. We need to show that the locus of the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from (M) to these chords is a circle. **Steps of the Solution:** 1. **Definitions and Initial Setup:** - Let the radius of the circle be (R). - Let (OM) be the distance from the center (O) of the circle to the point (M), denoted by (d = OM). - Consider a pair of perpendicular chords (AB) and (CD) intersecting the circle and each other at point (M). 2. **Coordinate System and Position of Points:** - Place the center (O) of the circle at the origin of a coordinate system ((0, 0)). - Without loss of generality, assume (M) lies at some point ((x_0, y_0)) inside the circle. 3. **Equation of the Circle:** - The equation of the circle is (x^2 + y^2 = R^2). 4. **Perpendicular Lines from (M):** - Draw perpendiculars from (M) to chords (AB) and (CD). Let these perpendiculars intersect (AB) at (P) and (CD) at (Q). 5. **Geometric Properties:** - Chords (AB) and (CD) bisect each other at (M). - Because (AB perp CD), the circle centered at (M) with radius (r) intersects these chords at points that are at the midpoint of each pair of points (A, B) and (C, D). 6. **Distance Calculation:** - Let (R_M) be the radius of the circles passing through the midpoint of each chord. The radius (r) of the such a circle can be calculated with respect to (OM), the distance from (O) to (M). - The perpendicular distance from (M) to the chord (AB) or (CD) can be considered as the altitude in the right triangle formed with hypotenuse equal to the central distance. 7. **Using Pythagorean Theorem:** - For any chord passing through (M), say (AB), the perpendicular dropped from (M) to (AB) (which also intersects (AB) at its midpoint) ensures that: [ Mtext{-midpoint distance} = frac{AB cdot CD}{2} ] - Considering the coordinate definition of midpoint and other points based on perpendicularity, leads us to derive: [ PA^2 = R^2 - (OM)^2 ] Therefore, (overline{OM_x}^2 = 2R^2 - (OM)^2). 8. **Resulting Distance for Feet of Perpendiculars:** - We finally show that the radius of the circle tracing the feet of all perpendiculars dropped from (M) to any arbitrary chord forming: [ r = frac{1}{2} sqrt{2R^2 - OM^2} ] 9. **Conclusion:** - Hence, the locus of the feet of all the perpendiculars dropped from (M) to chords of the circle is another circle with the center on the line (OM) and radius (frac{1}{2} sqrt{2R^2 - OM^2}).

Now, let's calculate the cost of the blueberry pie: We know the total cost of the blueberry pie must be 18, and we already have the cost of the crust, which is 4.5.

The segment ( BC ) might be present or absent. The point ( A ) is referred to as the \\"gallows vertex.\\" - Since no more than three segments out of any point, points ( B ) and ( C ) have at most 2 additional segments each. 2. **Bounding the Number**: - Analyze that each \\"gallows\\" structure can be part of at most two different 4-cycles. - Since ( A ) may lead at most three \\"gallows\\" structures, it can form at most ( 3 cdot 2 = 6 ) such 4-cycles. - There are 36 points, and each point can be part of no more than 6 different 4-cycles. - The total number of different 4-cycles should then be bounded by: [ frac{36 cdot 6}{4} = 54 ] The 4 in the denominator represents the fact that each 4-cycle includes exactly 4 points. 3. **Construction To Match the Bound**: - Now let’s construct a scenario where exactly 54 different 4-cycles exist. - Consider two sets of 3 points: ( A_1, A_2, A_3 ) and ( B_1, B_2, B_3 ). - Connect each point ( A_i ) to every ( B_j ). - Each of these points ( A_i ) and ( B_j ) will thus have exactly 3 connections, fulfilling the problem constraints. - Every combination of two points from set ( A ) (namely ( A_{i1}, A_{i2} )) with any combination of two points from set ( B ) (namely ( B_{j1}, B_{j2} )) will form a unique 4-cycle. - There are ( binom{3}{2} cdot binom{3}{2} = 3 cdot 3 = 9 ) such combinations for ( A ) and ( B ) forming 9 unique 4-cycles. 4. **Multiplying the Smaller Construction**: - Extend this 6-point 9-cycle structure to the entire 36-point set by replicating it 6 times with non-overlapping points. - Each structure independently contributes 9 4-cycles. - Thus, ( 6 times 9 = 54 ) 4-cycles. # Conclusion: The construction aligns with the theory, confirming the maximum number of such 4-cycles.

We can compute their squares as follows: [ sin^2(1^circ) = left( frac{z - frac{1}{z}}{2i} right)^2 = frac{(z - frac{1}{z})^2}{-4} = frac{z^2 + frac{1}{z^2} - 2}{-4} ] Similarly, [ sin^2(3^circ) = frac{z^6 + frac{1}{z^6} - 2}{-4} ] and [ sin^2(9^circ) = frac{z^{18} + frac{1}{z^{18}} - 2}{-4} ] 3.

However, since we are dealing with ( A + kI ), we need to consider ( det(A + kI) ). 3. **Rank and Eigenvalues:** The rank of ( A ) is either 0 or 1. This is because ( A ) is a matrix of rank 1 unless all ( a_i = 0 ). If ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) = (0, 0, ldots, 0) ), then ( A ) is the zero matrix, and its rank is 0. Otherwise, the rank is 1. 4. **Eigenvalues:** - If ( A ) is the zero matrix, all eigenvalues are 0. - If ( A ) is not the zero matrix, it has one non-zero eigenvalue and ( n-1 ) zero eigenvalues. This is because ( A ) is a rank-1 matrix, and the non-zero eigenvalue is the trace of ( A ). 5. **Geometric and Algebraic Multiplicities:** - The geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is ( n-1 ) because the rank of ( A ) is 1. - The algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is at least ( n-1 ). 6. **Form of the Characteristic Polynomial:** Given that the algebraic multiplicity of 0 is at least ( n-1 ), the characteristic polynomial ( phi_A(k) ) must be of the form: [ phi_A(k) = k^{n-1}(k - alpha) ] where ( alpha ) is the non-zero eigenvalue of ( A ). 7. **Trace of the Matrix:** The trace of ( A ) is the sum of its diagonal elements: [ text{trace}(A) = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + cdots + a_n^2 ] Since the trace of a matrix is also the sum of its eigenvalues, we have: [ alpha = -(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + cdots + a_n^2) ] 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the determinant of the given matrix ( A + kI ) is: [ det(A + kI) = k^{n-1}(k - (-(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + cdots + a_n^2))) = k^{n-1}(k + a_1^2 + a_2^2 + cdots + a_n^2) ] The final answer is ( boxed{ k^{n-1}(k + a_1^2 + a_2^2 + cdots + a_n^2) } )."},{"prompt":"Compute [ sin^6 0^circ + sin^6 1^circ + sin^6 2^circ + dots + sin^6 90^circ. ]","completion":"Let T = sin^6 0^circ + sin^6 1^circ + sin^6 2^circ + dots + sin^6 90^circ.

Since the diameter ( AB ) viewed from points ( M ) and ( N ) form a right angle, the lines ( AN ) and ( BM ) are altitudes of triangle ( ABC ). 2. **Finding the Orthocenter:** Given the properties that ( AN ) and ( BM ) are altitudes, point ( D ) becomes the orthocenter of triangle ( ABC ). By definition, the orthocenter of a triangle is where the altitudes intersect, so we conclude ( D ) is the orthocenter of triangle ( ABC ). 3. **Perpendicular Line Through the Orthocenter:** Since ( D ) is the orthocenter, the line ( CD ) is perpendicular to the line ( AB ). 4. **Identifying Line ( l ):** By construction, the line ( l ) defined in the problem is exactly ( CD ).

This unique point ( P ) is indeed where the radical axes of the circles (and the tangents of chord ( MN)) meet and is part of the nine-point circle attributes. 7. **Conclusion:** Given the properties and discussions, all such lines ( l ) are confirmed to intersect at a common point ( P ), which is a special point often related to the nine-point center in the context of classical Euclidean geometry.\\", Thus, every line ( l ), defined as being perpendicular to ( AB ) and passing through point ( D ), indeed passes through a single and unique point ( P ).

Here, the items are the people, and the containers are the months of a year (12 months). 3. **Calculate Minimum Number of People per Month**: There are 12 months and 60 people, we find the minimum number ( n ) as follows: [ leftlceil frac{60}{12} rightlceil = leftlceil 5 rightrceil = 5 ] Following similar reasoning as before, 5 people per month can fit with some months potentially having more but some might think this reasoning leads to confirmation of 5 months having at least 6 people. To verify, adjust the calculation to: [ leftlceil frac{60}{12} rightrceil = leftlceil 5 rightrceil = 5 ] Hence, each month will have at least 5 people, and at least one month having 5 or more due to rounding. 4. **Verify Greater Number Isn't Ensured**: If at least 6 people were required to share a birthday month, distributing the people such that 11 months have 5 people and 1 month has 5 people totals exactly 60, confirming at least one month must have at least 6 due to integer placements. So, it goes to 6. 5. **Conclusion**: Thus, the highest integer ( n ) where at least ( n ) people have the same birthday month in a group of 60 is again shown to be ( n = 5 ). 6 The final answer is boxed{**C)** 6}"},{"prompt":"Given the hyperbola frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > 0,b > 0) and the parabola y^{2}=4x.

A regular tetrahedron can be formed from vertices such as A, C, F, H because the edges connecting these vertices are space diagonals of the cube’s faces and therefore equal in length. 2. Since the cube has 6 faces and 2 diagonals per face, there are a total of 12 face diagonals. Choosing any set of four diagonals that don’t share a face and intersect properly inside the cube forms one regular tetrahedron. 3. The cube can be divided into tetrahedra whose vertices are the centers of the cube faces. Take vertices A, B, C, D, A', B', C', D' where each pair (X, X') represents opposite vertices of the cube: - Consider one tetrahedron formed by vertices A, C, A', C'. - Consider the other tetrahedron formed by vertices B, D, B', D'. 4. The volume of a regular tetrahedron is derived using its relationship to the volume of the cube. Since each edge of the cube is a, each edge of the tetrahedron is sqrt{2}a. 5.

Now, consider the intersection of two tetrahedra within the cube, which forms an octahedron. This octahedron has vertices that coincide with the centers of the cube’s faces. 10. The volume of this octahedron is computed by noting that it consists of four smaller tetrahedra each with edge length a/sqrt{2}. The volume ratio between tetrahedra with edge length ratios a and a/sqrt{2} is: [ left(frac{1/sqrt{2}}{1}right)^3 = left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}}right)^3 = frac{1}{8} ] 11.

Introduce the geometric elements:** - Let's define point ( P ) inside triangle ( ABC ) such that (angle PAC = angle PBC). - Let ( M ) be the midpoint of segment ( AB ). - Points ( L ) and ( N ) are the feet of the perpendiculars from ( P ) to ( BC ) and ( CA ), respectively. **2. Use circle with diameter ( AB ):** - Consider the circle with diameter ( AB ). This circle will intersect ( BC ) at point ( D ), the foot of the altitude from ( A ), and ( AC ) at point ( E ), the foot of the altitude from ( B ). - Therefore, ( D ) lies on ( BC ) and ( E ) lies on ( AC ). **3.

Using angle properties:** - Given the angles, let’s explore the angles formed due to perpendicular segments: [ angle PAD = angle CAD - angle PAC = 90^circ - angle C - angle PBC ] [ angle PAC = angle PBC ] Thus: [ angle PAD = 90^circ - angle C - angle PAC ] [ angle PAD = angle CBE - angle PBC = angle PBE ] **5. Relating the segments using trigonometry:** - Since ( angle PAD = angle PBE ), we use the sin rule in these triangles, i.e., [ sin(angle PAD) = sin(angle PBE) ] Hence: [ frac{LD}{PA} = sin(angle PAD) = sin(angle PBE) = frac{NE}{PB} ] - Using the cosine rule for projections: [ PA cos(angle PAC) = NA ] [ PB cos(angle PBC) = LB ] Thus, the sines and the cosines validate that the distances are proportional: [ LD cdot LB = NE cdot NA ] **Conclusion:** Since ( ML^2 - MA^2 = LD cdot LB ) and ( MN^2 - MA^2 = NE cdot NA ), with ( LD cdot LB = NE cdot NA ), it follows that the segments ( ML ) and ( MN ) must be equal.

What is the least number of total band members that can fulfill this requirement?","completion":"First, let's calculate the minimum number of successful candidates for each instrument based on the given percentages: - Flutes: 80% of 20 = 0.8 * 20 = 16 - Clarinets: 50% of 30 = 0.5 * 30 = 15 - Trumpets: 33.33% (1/3) of 60 ≈ 0.3333 * 60 = 20 - Pianists: 10% of 20 = 0.1 * 20 = 2 - Drummers: 75% (3/4) of 16 = 0.75 * 16 = 12 Now, we have the minimum numbers of successful candidates for each instrument. The target ratio is 5:3:6:2:4. To find the least number of total band members that can fulfill the requirement, we need to find the smallest multiplier for each part of the ratio that will not go below the minimum number of successful tryouts for each instrument.

The number of members for each instrument will be: - Flutes: 5x - Clarinets: 3x - Trumpets: 6x - Pianists: 2x - Drummers: 4x We need to find the smallest value of x that satisfies all the minimum requirements: - For flutes: 5x ≥ 16 - For clarinets: 3x ≥ 15 - For trumpets: 6x ≥ 20 - For pianists: 2x ≥ 2 - For drummers: 4x ≥ 12 Now, let's find the smallest x that satisfies all these inequalities: - For flutes: x ≥ 16/5 = 3.2 - For clarinets: x ≥ 15/3 = 5 - For trumpets: x ≥ 20/6 ≈ 3.3333 - For pianists: x ≥ 2/2 = 1 - For drummers: x ≥ 12/4 = 3 The largest minimum x value from the above calculations is 5 (from clarinets). Therefore, we will use x = 5 to ensure all minimum requirements are met. Now, let's calculate the number of members for each instrument using x = 5: - Flutes: 5x = 5 * 5 = 25 - Clarinets: 3x = 3 * 5 = 15 - Trumpets: 6x = 6 * 5 = 30 - Pianists: 2x = 2 * 5 = 10 - Drummers: 4x = 4 * 5 = 20 Adding these up gives us the total number of band members: Total = 25 (flutes) + 15 (clarinets) + 30 (trumpets) + 10 (pianists) + 20 (drummers) = 100 So, the least number of total band members that can fulfill the requirement while not going below the minimum number of successful tryouts is boxed{100} ."},{"prompt":"Tanks A and B are each in the shape of a right circular cylinder.

To find the area of this region: - It is a section of a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin. - The area is a segment of the circle formed by the line (y = 1). - The full circle’s area is (pi cdot 2^2 = 4 pi). - The arc above (y = 1) forms a circular segment (two thirds of the upper semicircle). 10. Calculating the segment’s area: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{3} cdot 4pi - text{Area of those triangles} ] - Triangles calculated using sector area and subtracting triangle: [ = frac{4pi}{3} - frac{1}{2} cdot 2 cdot 2 cdot sin(120^circ), ] [ = frac{4pi}{3} - 2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, ] [ = frac{4pi}{3} - sqrt{3}. ] 11.

So before Olivia took her share, there were 9 candies left. Before Paul took his share, there were the 9 candies that Olivia took plus the 5 more sweets that Paul took after taking a third of the remaining candies. So there were 9 + 5 = 14 candies before Paul took his share. Paul took a third of the remaining candies plus 5 more. If we add back the 5 candies Paul took, the total before he took a third would be 14 candies. This means that two-thirds of the candies before Paul took his share would be 14 candies because he took one-third plus 5 more. To find the original number before Paul took his share, we need to calculate the full amount that represents the three-thirds. If two-thirds is 14 candies, then one-third would be 14 / 2 = 7 candies. Therefore, three-thirds (the full amount before Paul took his share) would be 7 * 3 = 21 candies. Before Jack took his share, there were the 21 candies that were there before Paul took his share plus the 4 more candies that Jack took after taking half of all the candies. So there were 21 + 4 = 25 candies before Jack took his share. Jack took half of all the candies plus 4 more. If we add back the 4 candies Jack took, the total before he took half would be 25 candies. This means that the other half of the candies before Jack took his share would also be 25 candies because he took half plus 4 more. To find the original number before Jack took his share, we need to calculate the full amount that represents both halves.

This means that the certain number divides into 3135 evenly, and there is a remainder of 6 left over. To find the certain number, we can subtract the remainder from the product: 3135 - 6 = 3129 Now, we need to find a number that divides 3129 evenly. Since 3129 is not a common product, we can check for divisibility by trying to divide it by different numbers. However, since 3129 is a relatively large number, it would be more efficient to factor it to find its divisors. Let's factor 3129: 3129 = 3 * 1043 Now we know that 3129 is the product of 3 and 1043. Since 1043 is a prime number, the divisors of 3129 are 1, 3, 1043, and 3129 itself. Since we are looking for the certain number that 3135 is divided by to give a remainder of 6, and we have subtracted the remainder to get 3129, the certain number must be a divisor of 3129. Therefore, the certain number could be 1, 3, 1043, or 3129. However, since dividing by 1 or 3129 would not give us a meaningful result (dividing by 1 would give the number itself, and dividing by the number itself would give a remainder of 0), the most reasonable answer is either 3 or 1043. To confirm, we can divide 3135 by 3 and 1043 to see which gives a remainder of 6: 3135 ÷ 3 = 1045 with a remainder of 0 (not correct) 3135 ÷ 1043 = 3 with a remainder of 6 (correct) Therefore, the certain number is boxed{1043} ."},{"prompt":"The common tangent lines of the two circles x^{2}+y^{2}4x+2y+1=0 and x^{2}+y^{2}+4x4y1=0 are ( ).

Since each quart covers 60 square feet, we can calculate the total coverage of 10 quarts: 10 quarts * 60 square feet/quart = 600 square feet This means that the outside of the cube has a total area of 600 square feet. A cube has 6 faces, and since all faces of a cube are squares with equal edge lengths, we can find the area of one face and then multiply by 6 to get the total surface area. Let's call the edge length of the cube \\"L\\". The area of one face of the cube is L^2 (since the area of a square is the length of one side squared). The total surface area of the cube is 6 times the area of one face: Total surface area = 6 * L^2 We know the total surface area is 600 square feet, so we can set up the equation: 6 * L^2 = 600 Now we can solve for L^2: L^2 = 600 / 6 L^2 = 100 To find the edge length L, we take the square root of both sides: L = √100 L = 10 feet So, the edge length of the cube is boxed{10} feet."},{"prompt":"Construct the crosssection of the triangular prism ( A B C A_1 B_1 C_1 ) with a plane passing through points ( A_1 ) and ( C ) that is parallel to line ( B C_1 ).

Therefore, we have: [ AO + BO + CO < P ] # Conclusion: Combining both results, we arrive at: [ frac{P}{2} < AO + BO + CO < P ] Thus, we have shown the desired inequality, which completes our proof.

The total work done by A and B together in one day is the sum of the work done by each of them individually.

Triangle (AO B) is isosceles since (AO = BO = R). Thus, (angle BAO = angle OBA). We also know: [ angle BAO = 90^circ - angle ACB ] 5. Considering right triangle (A H C), the angle (angle CAH) is given by: [ angle CAH = 90^circ - angle ACB ] 6. Therefore, we have established: [ angle BAO = angle CAH ] 7. Next, since (A D) is the angle bisector from vertex (A) of (triangle ABC) and intersects (BC) at (D), it must bisect (angle OAH): [ angle DAO = angle DAH ] 8. Now considering triangles (ADH) and (ADO), these triangles share side (AD), have (angle DAH = angle DAO), and both (AH = AO = R). Hence, triangles (ADH) and (ADO) are congruent by SAS (Side-Angle-Side) congruence. 9. From the congruence, we determine: [ angle AOD = 90^circ ] 10. Given this orthogonality, the perpendicularity (AD perp CO) implies that (triangle A E O) and (triangle A C H) are congruent by RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side) congruence: [ angle OAC = angle EAH, quad AC = AE, quad AH = AO ] 11.

The centroid of each triangle (KA_jA_k) is denoted as (S_i) for (i,j,k) being a permutation of (1,2,3). We need to prove that the segments (A_iS_i) intersect at a single point. # I: 1. **Define Key Points and Segments:** Let (S) be the centroid of the triangle (A_1A_2A_3) and (F_i) be the midpoint of side (A_jA_k). 2. **Properties of Midlines:** Since (F_iF_j) is a midline of the triangle (A_1A_2A_3), it is parallel to (A_iA_j) and half its length. 3. **Similarity Transformations:** The triangle (A_1A_2A_3) can be mapped to the triangle (F_1F_2F_3) using a similarity transformation centered at (S) with ratio (lambda_1 = -frac{1}{2}). 4. **Relation Among Points:** Given that (KS_i = 2S_iF_i) and points (K, S_i, F_i) are collinear, the triangle (F_1F_2F_3) can be transformed into (S_1S_2S_3) using a similarity transformation centered at (K) with ratio (lambda_2 = frac{2}{3}). 5. **Parallel Sides:** Consequently, the sides of triangle (S_1S_2S_3) are parallel to the corresponding sides of triangle (A_1A_2A_3). 6. **Combine Transformations:** Hence, triangle (A_1A_2A_3) can be transformed into triangle (S_1S_2S_3) using a similarity transformation centered at a point with ratio (lambda_3 = lambda_1 times lambda_2 = -frac{1}{2} times frac{2}{3} = -frac{1}{3}). 7. **Intersection Property:** Thus, the segments (A_iS_i) intersect at the center of this similarity transformation.

So, let (M) be their intersection, then (S_3M : MA_3 = S_1M : MA_1 = 1:3). 6. **Intersecting Segments:** Similarly, (A_1S_2S_1A_2) is a trapezoid with diagonals intersecting at a point (N) such that (S_2N : NA_2 = S_1N : NA_1 = 1:3). 7. **Common Intersection:** Since both (M) and (N) intersect in the same ratio, they are the same point.

For the given equation, a=1, b=-1, and c=m, so we have: [ Delta = (-1)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot m = 1 - 4m ] For the equation to have two distinct real roots, we require that Delta > 0.

Thus, the base case holds. 2. **Induction step:** Suppose the lemma holds for some k, i.e., [ 2^{2 cdot 5^{k-1}} + 1 equiv 0 pmod{5^k}. ] We need to show that it holds for ( k+1 ), i.e., ( 2^{2 cdot 5^k} + 1 ) is divisible by ( 5^{k+1} ). Rewrite ( 2^{2 cdot 5^k} + 1 ): [ 2^{2 cdot 5^k} + 1 = (2^{2 cdot 5^{k-1}})^{5} + 1 = (4^{5^{k-1}})^5 + 1 = 4^{5^k} + 1. ] Let ( a = 4^{5^{k-1}} ). Then, [ 2^{2 cdot 5^k} + 1 = a^5 + 1 = (a + 1)left(a^4 - a^3 + a^2 - a + 1right). ] By the induction hypothesis, ( a + 1 ) is divisible by ( 5^k ). Therefore, [ a + 1 equiv 0 pmod{5^k}. ] Let's examine the second factor ( a^4 - a^3 + a^2 - a + 1 ) modulo ( 5 ): [ a equiv -1 pmod{5^k} implies a^2 equiv 1 pmod{5^k} implies a^3 equiv -1 pmod{5^k} implies a^4 equiv 1 pmod{5^k}. ] Thus, [ a^4 - a^3 + a^2 - a + 1 equiv 1 - (-1) + 1 - (-1) + 1 equiv 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 equiv 5 pmod{5}. ] Since ( 5 ) is divisible by ( 5^{1} ), the second factor is divisible by ( 5 ). Combining this with the ( a + 1 ) term being divisible by ( 5^k ), the entire expression ( a^5 + 1 ) is divisible by ( 5^{k+1} ). Hence, the induction step is complete, and the lemma is proven. (blacksquare) **Returning to the main problem:** We need to show that for any ( k > 1 ), there is a power of two such that among its last ( k ) digits, at least half are nines. 1. **Observation from the Lemma:** From the lemma, we know ( 2^{2 cdot 5^{k-1}} + 1 ) is divisible by ( 5^k ), implying that [ 2^{2 cdot 5^{k-1}} equiv -1 pmod{5^k}. ] 2. **Finding the negative of modulo result:** Considering ( 2^{2 cdot 5^{k-1}} ) modulo ( 10^k ): [ 2^{2 cdot 5^{k-1}} equiv 10^k - 1 pmod{10^k}. ] This shows that the last ( k ) digits of ( 2^{2 cdot 5^{k-1}} ) are ( 999ldots 99 ) (with k nines). 3. **Extension to any ( k > 1 ):** When extended for powers ( 2^{2 cdot 5^{k-1} + m cdot k} ), notice that the added digits are zeroes in multiple of ( k ). Thus manipulating further for cases, consuming ( k/2 + epsilon ) should always provide a higher margin favoring the bulk of the digits towards 9.

Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points: f'(x) = 3x^{2}-3 = 3(x^{2}-1) = 3(x+1)(x-1) = 0. This gives us x = -1 or x = 1 as critical points. However, x = 1 is not within our interval of interest, [-2,0], so we only consider x = -1. 3.

Evaluate f(x) at the endpoints of the interval and at the critical point to find the minimum value: - At x = -2, f(-2) = (-2)^{3}-3(-2)+a = -8+6+a = -2+a. - At x = 0, f(0) = (0)^{3}-3(0)+a = a.

When the slope of the tangent line passing through P exists, let the slope be k and P(2, 1). Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is y-1=k(x-2), which simplifies to kx-y-2k+1=0.

Since the ellipse is defined by focusing distances, with foci at A and B, it intersects the circle as long as the sum defined (4 in this case) is feasible within the dimensions of the circle.

Find the most possible value for the number of these subsets.","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of three-element subsets of a 1000-element set such that the union of any five of these subsets has at least 12 elements. We will use a combinatorial approach and a lemma to achieve this. 1. **Lemma 1:** If for a fixed natural number ( n ) we have at least ( n ) three-element subsets of a set and the union of every ( n ) of them has at least ( 2n+2 ) elements, the subsets can be divided into some families such that if a family has ( t ) sets, we can imply ( t < n ) and also the union of the family has at least ( 2t+1 ) elements. Any two sets from two distinct families do not have any intersection. 2. **Proof of Lemma 1:** We will prove this lemma by induction on ( n ). - **Base Case: ( n = 1 )** For ( n = 1 ), every set should have at least 4 elements, which is trivially true since each set has 3 elements. Hence, the base case holds. - **Inductive Step:** Assume the lemma holds for ( n geq 1 ). Now consider ( n+1 ) subsets. While there exist ( n ) subsets such that the union of them has at most ( 2n+1 ) elements, call them a family. Considering the sets of that family and another subset, the problem's assumptions imply that the union of that family should have exactly ( 2n+1 ) elements and also the sets in the family do not have any intersection with other subsets. Repeat this process until the subsets are divided into families with ( n ) sets and ( 2n+1 ) elements and some subsets like ( mathcal{A} ) such that the union of every ( n ) of them has at least ( 2n+2 ) elements. Here we have two cases: - **Case 1: ( |mathcal{A}| geq n )** Let the union of all the families constructed above be ( mathcal{F}_{n} ). By the induction hypothesis, we can write ( mathcal{A} = bigcup_{t=1}^{n-1} mathcal{F}_t ) such that for all ( t ), ( mathcal{F}_t ) is the union of all the families with ( t ) sets. Hence, we are done. - **Case 2: ( |mathcal{A}| < n )** In this case, let ( |mathcal{A}| = t ). We have two subcases: - **Case 2.1: ( |cup mathcal{A}| geq 2t+1 )** The families mentioned above with ( n ) sets and ( mathcal{A} ) together cover all the subsets. - **Case 2.2: ( |cup mathcal{A}| leq 2t )** We know that there exist at least ( n+1 ) subsets but ( |mathcal{A}| < n+1 ), so there exists at least one family with ( n ) sets and exactly ( 2n+1 ) elements. If the total number of subsets is ( s ) and the number of distinct elements used in the subsets is ( l ), we can conclude ( l = frac{2n+1}{n}(s-t) + |cup mathcal{A}| ). But now we divide ( mathcal{F}_{n} ) in this way: Considering the sets of ( mathcal{A} ) and every other ( n-t ) sets in ( mathcal{F}_{n} ), the problem's assumptions imply that the union of every ( n-t ) sets in ( mathcal{F}_{n} ) has at least ( 2n-2t ) elements. By the induction hypothesis, ( mathcal{F}_{n} ) can be divided into families with at most ( n-1 ) sets. So ( l geq frac{2n-1}{n-1}(s-t) + |cup mathcal{A}| implies s-t = 0 ). This is a contradiction, so this case never occurs. 3. **Application of Lemma 1:** Since ( n = 5 ), if the set of subsets is ( mathcal{S} ), we can write ( mathcal{S} = bigcup_{t=1}^{4} mathcal{F}_t ) such that for all ( t ), ( mathcal{F}_t ) is the union of all the families with ( t ) sets.

Thus, the number of elements in the union of every 5 subsets is exactly 10 plus the number of distinct families they belong to, which is at least 12 (because every family has at most 4 sets).

We start by considering the problem involving four pairs of intersecting lines forming four triangles. We need to prove that if one line is parallel to the Euler line of the triangle formed by the three other lines, then any other line also possesses the same property. 2. To address this, let us first recall the properties of the Euler line. The Euler line of a triangle passes through several significant points of the triangle: the orthocenter (H), the circumcenter (O), and the centroid (G). 3. Consider placing one of the lines, say line l_1, parallel to itself. When moved parallelly, the line does not change its inherent properties related to the triangles it forms with the other lines. 4. Suppose A, C, and D are three points on one line, with B being an arbitrary point on the plane. Consider the triangles triangle ABC and triangle BCD. 5. Given that the Euler line of triangle ABC is parallel to BD, we need to prove that the Euler line of triangle CBD remains parallel to AB. 6. Let's denote the angles angle BCD = varphi, assuming C is between A and D, and typically varphi leq 90^circ. Let O_1 and H_1 be the circumcenter and orthocenter of triangle ABC, respectively. Similarly, let O_2 and H_2 be the circumcenter and orthocenter of triangle BCD. 7. We aim to describe the four points A, B, H_1, and certain point M such that angle MAB = angle M H_1 B = angle H_1 BD = angle H_2 BD. This proves that line BD is parallel to the Euler line O_1H_1. 8. Consider drawing a circle around ABH_1, and let M be the intersection point of this circle with O_1H_1. We can prove that quadrilaterals O_1AMB and O_2D H_2 B are similar. 9. To prove the similarity, note that triangle O_1AB and triangle O_2DB are congruent isosceles triangles. Given the angles, such as angle MAH_1 = angle MH_1B = angle H_1BD = angle H_2BD, we establish that the similarity holds. 10. By proving the similarity, we derived that varphi, respectively maintaining the condition that H_2 O_2 is parallel to AB.

This option also correctly represents a factorization. **Option C**: x^{2}-6x+9=(x-3)^{2} This is a perfect square trinomial, where a = x and b = 3. The factorization is correct because (x-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9. This option correctly represents a factorization and matches the standard answer's identification as correct. **Option D**: x^{2}-2x+1=x(x-2)+1 This attempts to represent a factorization but is incorrect. The correct factorization of x^2 - 2x + 1 is (x-1)^2, not x(x-2)+1. Therefore, this option does not correctly represent a factorization.

The total daily wages paid to the illiterate employees before the decrease was ( 20 times I ). After the decrease, the total daily wages paid to the illiterate employees is ( 20 times 10 ) rupees. The decrease in total daily wages for the illiterate employees is therefore ( 20 times I - 20 times 10 ). This decrease in total wages caused the average salary of all employees (literate and illiterate) to decrease by Rs. 10 per day. Let's denote the number of literate employees as ( L ), which is given as 10. The total number of employees is ( 20 + L = 20 + 10 = 30 ).

Find the remainder when p(x) is divided by (x + 1)(x + 5).","completion":"Since the remainder when p(x) is divided by two linear factors is also linear, letting p(x) = (x + 1)(x + 5)q(x) + ax + b, where q(x) is the polynomial quotient. Using the Remainder Theorem: - If p(-1) = 3 and p(-5) = -9, set x = -1 and x = -5 respectively: [ p(-1) = -a + b = 3 ] [ p(-5) = -5a + b = -9 ] Solving these equations: 1. From -a + b = 3, express b: [ b = a + 3 ] 2. Substitute b = a + 3 into -5a + b = -9: [ -5a + (a + 3) = -9 implies -4a + 3 = -9 implies -4a = -12 implies a = 3 ] 3. Therefore, b = a + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6.
