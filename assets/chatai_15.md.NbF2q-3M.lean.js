This is because each ( x in S ) is generated by either tripling and adding 0 or 1, effectively building a base-3 number from digits 0 and 1. 5. **Count the number of such representations below 2008:** We are looking for ternary (base-3) numbers, using only digits 0 and 1, that are less than 2008. First convert 2008 to base-3. [ 2008_{10} = 2202001_3 ] This has 7 digits in base-3. Any valid integer in ( S ) (with only digits 0 and 1) that is less than ( 2008 ) has at most 7 digits in base-3. 6. **Counting the ternary digits:** The valid numbers range from: [ 1_{10} = 1_3, 2_{10} = 2_3, ldots, 1097_{10} = 1100010_3 ] Hence, we need the count of 7-digit numbers formed using digits 0 and 1. For 7-digit numbers with base-3, each position can either be 0 or 1, giving: [ 2^7 = 128 ] Valid 7-digit numbers exclude 0 (0000000).

Thus, asin(2016)+asin(-2016)=0. Furthermore, since (2016)^3 = (-2016)^3, b(2016)^3 + b(-2016)^3 = 2b(2016)^3. However, without knowing the value of b, we cannot simplify this expression further. Nonetheless, since asin 2016=0, b(2016)^3 and b(-2016)^3 are equal, and f'(2017)-f'(-2017)=0, the equation simplifies to 8 + 2b(2016)^3. boxed{f(2016)+f(-2016)+f'(2017)-f'(-2017)=8+2b(2016)^3}"},{"prompt":"a mathematics competition, the sum of the scores of Bill and Dick equalled the sum of the scores of Ann and Carol.

So, we have P(A) = boxed{frac{1}{10}}. # Part (2): Independence of Events A and B If A and B are independent: For events A and B to be independent, the following condition must hold: P(AB) = P(A)P(B). - Event AB represents drawing a ball labeled m-2 first and 2 second. - With replacement, the probability of any specific ball being drawn is frac{1}{10} for each draw. - Thus, P(AB) = frac{1}{10} times frac{1}{10} = frac{1}{100}. - We know P(A) = frac{1}{10}.

Hence, f(x)=frac{2x}{x+1} (x neq -1). Method 1: Assume there exists a constant c that meets the requirement, i.e., f(x)+f(c-x)=4 holds for x neq -1. Specifically, when x=0, we have f(0)+f(c)=4, which implies frac{2c}{c+1}=4. Solving this equation gives c=-2. Now we prove that f(x)+f(-2-x)=4 holds for x neq -1. In fact, when x neq -1, f(x)+f(-2-x)= frac{2x}{x+1} + frac{2(-2-x)}{(-2-x)+1} = frac{2x}{x+1} + frac{-4-2x}{-x-1} = frac{4x+4}{x+1} = 4.

Therefore, we can write the following ratios using the properties of excircles: [ frac{AE}{AT} = frac{h}{s - e} ] and [ frac{CB}{CF} = 1 + frac{BF}{CF} = 1 + frac{r_e}{r_a} = 1 + frac{s - a}{s - e} = frac{h}{s - e} ] 4. **Establish the Equality:** From the above ratios, we have: [ frac{AE}{AT} = frac{CB}{CF} ] This implies: [ AE cdot CF = AT cdot CB ] 5. **Conclusion:** Since ( AT ) and ( CB ) are segments of the rhombus and are independent of the choice of the tangent ( l ), the product ( AE cdot CF ) is also independent of the choice of the tangent ( l ).

This trivially satisfies the condition where each box contains exactly one ball. Therefore, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** - Assume that it is possible to arrange the balls such that each of the n-1 boxes B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{n-1} contains exactly one ball through the permitted operations. 3. **Inductive Step:** - We need to show that it is possible to extend this arrangement to n boxes B_1, B_2, ldots, B_n. - To do this, consider any given configuration of n balls in n boxes. If every box already contains exactly one ball, we are done. Otherwise, some boxes contain more than one ball while others may be empty. 4. **Operations Impact on Configuration:** - Consider the sum of the squared positions of the balls. Let the position of the i-th ball be p_i: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2 ] - The allowed operations affect S as follows: - Moving a ball from B_1 to B_2 increases the sum by 1^2 - 2^2 = -3. - Moving a ball from B_n to B_{n-1} increases the sum by n^2 - (n-1)^2 = 2n - 1. - Moving two balls from B_i to B_{i-1} and B_{i+1} changes the sum by (i^2 + i^2) - ((i-1)^2 + (i+1)^2) = 2i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1 + i^2 + 2i + 1) = 0. Notice that though this operation doesn't change the sum S, it redistributes the balls. 5. **Reduction to Simplified Problem:** - Suppose after a finite number of steps, one ball reaches either position 1 or position n, the sum of squares is bounded by n^3. - Let without loss of generality, one ball reach position n. We can then redistribute the remaining balls in boxes B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{n-1}. - By our inductive hypothesis, an arrangement can be reached where boxes B_1, ldots, B_{n-1} each hold exactly one ball. 6. **Final Adjustment:** - If a ball was initially at position n and then shifted to n-1, it can be moved between n-1 and n to adjust the final configuration until each box contains one ball. Thus, it is shown that using the operations permitted, one can always reach a state where each of the n boxes contains exactly one ball. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{It is always possible to reach a configuration where all boxes contain exactly one ball.}} ]"},{"prompt":"From points A and B, a motorist and a cyclist set off towards each other, but not at the same time.

We list out the numbers up to 100 that are divisible by 3: [ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99. ] 3. From this list, extract and count the numbers containing the digit 3: [ 3, 30, 33, 36, 39, 63, 93. ] There are 7 such numbers. 4. Subtract the count of numbers containing the digit 3 (which is 7) from the total count of numbers divisible by 3 (which is 33): [ 33 - 7 = 26. ] Thus, there are 26 numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3 and do not contain the digit 3.

We can change one of the primes dividing (a_m) into a (2), creating a new even number (b_m) with (ell) divisors. Thus, we have a new sequence of evens (b_1 < b_2 < cdots) all with (ell) divisors and obeying (b_i < a_i) for all (i). This implies that the (m)-th smallest even number with (ell) divisors is strictly less than the (m)-th smallest odd number with (ell) divisors. Hence, (f_ell(x) geq g_ell(x)). 6. **Summation Analysis:** Notice that: [ sum_{k=1}^n d(2k) > sum_{k=1}^n d(2k-1) Longleftrightarrow sum_{k=2}^n kf_k(n) > sum_{k=1}^n kg_k(n) ] We see (g_2(n) > f_2(n)) since this just counts primes.

We can factor it similarly to how 4343 was factored: [4747 = 4700 + 47 = 47 times (100 + 1) = 47 times 101.] Since 47 and 101 are both primes, 4747 is not a prime number because it has at least these two factors. Similarly, for the third number, 474747: [474747 = 470000 + 4700 + 47 = 47 times (10000 + 100 + 1) = 47 times 10101.] We know 47 is prime. To check if 10101 is prime, notice 10101 = 101 times 101, showing it is not prime. This factorization pattern will apply to all subsequent numbers in the list, using 47 as a repetitive factor, and therefore, none of these numbers are prime except for the first one, 47.

Let (M) lie on edge (AB) and (N) lie on edge (BC) (Figure 1). 3. Observe the face (ABD). Assume point (M) does not coincide with either (A) or (B).

For a > 0, setting f'(x) = 0 gives: [ x = sqrt{a}. ] - For x in (0, sqrt{a}), we find f'(x) > 0, meaning f(x) is monotonically increasing. - For x in (sqrt{a}, +infty), we find f'(x) < 0, meaning f(x) is monotonically decreasing. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, sqrt{a}) and monotonically decreasing on (sqrt{a}, +infty). Part (2)①: Finding the Range of Real Number a 1. From the monotonicity analysis, when a leqslant 0, f(x) cannot have two zeros as it is monotonically decreasing. 2.

Therefore, the axis of symmetry is x = 1, and the relationship between m and c is m > c.

Consider a regular 45-gon, which has 45 vertices and 45 edges. We are tasked with placing the numbers (0, 1, ldots, 9) on the vertices of this polygon in such a way that every pair of distinct numbers is connected by an edge. 2. Each vertex is to be labeled with one of the numbers from ( {0, 1, ldots, 9} ). Let's choose an arbitrary number ( a ) from this set. By the problem's requirements, this number ( a ) must be connected by an edge to every other number in the set via the polygon's edges. 3. Since ( a ) must have connections to the other 9 numbers (as there are 10 numbers in total), there will be 9 edges that emanate from the vertex labeled ( a ). 4. Suppose that we try to place the number ( a ) on one of the vertices of our 45-gon. For ( a ) to be connected to every one of the other 9 distinct numbers, it needs separate vertices and edges for each connection. 5. However, the key point is that if every number must be similarly connected to 9 other numbers, it indicates a need for connectivity that quickly reveals inconsistencies in vertex assignment: - Each number needs to occupy at least 5 vertices in the polygon. This is derived from the requirement that each number must connect to every other number by a separate edge. 6. Count the total number of assignments required for all numbers: [ 10 text{ numbers} times 5 text{ vertices per number} = 50 text{ vertices required}. ] 7. This requires us to have 50 vertices.

To prove that ( angle MAN = angle MCN ), we need to consider the circle with diameter ( AM ). Here are the detailed steps: - The points ( N ) and ( C ) lie on the circle with diameter ( AM ). 5. Since ( AM ) is the diameter of the circle with center at the midpoint of ( AM ), the angle ( angle MAN ) is inscribed in the semicircle, meaning ( angle MAN ) is a right angle because it subtends the diameter ( AM ) (Thales' theorem). 6. Similarly, ( angle MCN ) also subtends the same arc of the circle since: - ( MN ) is a perpendicular dropped from ( M ) to ( N ), implying ( MN ) is still the radius of the semicircle and thus forms ( angle MCN ). 7. Therefore, (angle MCN) also subtends the same chord as (angle MAN). 8. These inscribed angles ( angle MAN ) and ( angle MCN ) subtend the same arc ( AN ). 9.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the bridge length and the time taken. Speed in m/s = Speed in kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 60000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 16.6666666667 m/s (approximately) Now, we can use the formula for distance: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken to cross the bridge is given as 29.997600191984642 seconds.

The derivative of the function is f'(x) = frac{1 - x}{x}. Solving f'(x) = 0 gives x = 1. When x in (0, 1), f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is increasing on (0, 1). When x in (1, +infty), f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is decreasing on (1, +infty). Also, fleft( frac{1}{e} right) = -1 - frac{1}{e} - m and fleft( e right) = 1 - e - m. Since fleft( frac{1}{e} right) - fleft( e right) = -2 - frac{1}{e} + e > 0, the minimum value of f(x) on left[ frac{1}{e}, e right] is boxed{1 - e - m}.

To find: The minimum possible length of arc P_{2} Q_{2}. 1. We start by noting that angle P_{1}P P_{2} is the external angle formed by the tangents from point P to the circle. This angle is subtended by an arc of the circle at the center O. Similarly, angle Q_{1}Q Q_{2} is subtended by another arc of the circle at the center O. 2. The subtended angle at the center of the circle by the tangents at point P is twice the external angle. Therefore, the angle subtended at the circle's center by the tangents through P is: [ 2 times 45^circ = 90^circ ] 3. Similarly, the angle subtended at the circle’s center by the tangents through Q is: [ 2 times 30^circ = 60^circ ] 4. To find the minimum possible length of the arc P_{2} Q_{2}, we need to find the angle between P_{2} and Q_{2} (denoted as angle P_{2}O Q_{2}) that lies on the circle, taking into account that the line PQ passes through O. 5. The position of the points P_2 and Q_2 on the circle results in the angle subtended at O by these points on either side of O respecting tangential properties.

However, as suggested by the provided solution step (45^circ - 30^circ = 15^circ), it appears an inconsistency occurred.

A: sqrt{7} B: msqrt{m} C: sqrt{a^2 + 1} D: 3sqrt[3]{3}","completion":"To determine which of the given expressions is a quadratic radical, we analyze each option step by step: A: -sqrt{7} is considered. Since the radicand (the number under the radical) is 7 and the index (the root) is 2 (implied for square roots), this is a square root. However, the presence of a negative sign does not disqualify it as a quadratic radical, but rather it's the nature of the radicand and the index that matters. Thus, the explanation that it is not a quadratic radical when -7 < 0 is incorrect because the radicand is actually 7, not -7. The correct consideration should be about the nature of the radical itself, not the sign in front of it. However, since it's a square root of a positive number, it technically qualifies as a quadratic radical, but let's analyze further options for the best fit. B: msqrt{m} is analyzed. This expression depends on the value of m. For it to be a quadratic radical, m must be squared inside the radical, which is not the case here. Therefore, this expression is not a standard form of a quadratic radical for any value of m because it involves m both inside and outside the radical in a manner that does not form a perfect square under the radical. C: sqrt{a^2 + 1} is considered. This is a square root (quadratic radical) of an expression where a^2 + 1 is always positive for any real number a, since a^2 geq 0 for all a and adding 1 ensures the expression under the square root is always greater than 0. This fits the definition of a quadratic radical perfectly. D: 3sqrt[3]{3} is evaluated. This expression involves a cube root (indicated by the root index of 3), not a square root.

First, we observe that quadrilateral ( A B_{2} A^{*} C_{2} ) is a cyclic quadrilateral. This implies that: [ angle AC_{2}A^{*} = angle A^{*}B_{2}B_1 ] 2. Similarly, quadrilateral ( A B_{1} A^{*} C_{1} ) is also a cyclic quadrilateral. Hence: [ angle AB_{1}A^{*} = angle A^{*}C_{1}C_2 ] 3. Considering the similarity of triangles ( A^{*}C_{1}C_{2} ) and ( A^{*}B_{1}B_{2} ) due to the above angle equalities, we have similar triangles: [ triangle A^{*}C_{1}C_{2} sim triangle A^{*}B_{1}B_{2} ] 4. The corresponding sides in these similar triangles are proportional, so the ratio of the corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the corresponding heights. Thus: [ frac{|B_{1}B_{2}|}{|C_{1}C_{2}|} = frac{|A^{*}T_{B}|}{|A^{*}T_{C}|} ] where ( T_{B} ) and ( T_{C} ) are the foot of the perpendiculars from ( A^{*} ) to ( AB ) and ( AC ) respectively. 5. Knowing the relationship between sine and the length of the perpendiculars from a point to a side: [ sin angle BA A^{*} = frac{|A^{*}T_{B}|}{|AA^{*}|}, quad text{and} quad sin angle CA A^{*} = frac{|A^{*}T_{C}|}{|AA^{*}|} ] 6. Hence: [ frac{sin angle BA A^{*}}{sin angle CA A^{*}} = frac{|A^{*}T_{B}|}{|A^{*}T_{C}|} = frac{|B_{1}B_{2}|}{|C_{1}C_{2}|} ] 7. Similarly, for the other angles at vertices ( B ) and ( C ), we have: [ frac{sin angle AC C^{*}}{sin angle BC C^{*}} = frac{|A_{1}A_{2}|}{|B_{1}B_{2}|}, quad text{and} quad frac{sin angle CB B^{*}}{sin angle AB B^{*}} = frac{|C_{1}C_{2}|}{|A_{1}A_{2}|} ] 8. Multiplying these ratios together, we obtain: [ frac{sin angle BA A^{*}}{sin angle CA A^{*}} cdot frac{sin angle AC C^{*}}{sin angle BC C^{*}} cdot frac{sin angle CB B^{*}}{sin angle AB B^{*}} = frac{|B_{1} B_{2}|}{|C_{1} C_{2}|} cdot frac{|A_{1} A_{2}|}{|B_{1} B_{2}|} cdot frac{|C_{1} C_{2}|}{|A_{1} A_{2}|} = 1 ] We have thus verified that the product is indeed equal to 1, satisfying the condition of Ceva's Theorem in its trigonometric form.

We know that ( a_1 neq a_2 ) and ( b_1 neq b_2 ) because the sums and products of the largest numbers are distinct. 3. **Compare the ratios of the largest numbers:** We need to compare the ratios ( frac{a_1}{a_2} ) and ( frac{b_1}{b_2} ).

Since 58 is even, we can either use two odd primes or one odd and the prime 2 (the only even prime). 3. **Checking Possible Pairs**: - First check 2 + p = 58 implies p = 56. Since 56 can be factored as 2 times 28, it's not prime. - Then, check pairs of odd primes. We need to check all primes less than 58. - 3 + 55 = 58 but 55 is not prime (55 = 5 times 11). - 5 + 53 = 58, check if 53 is a prime: it is. - 11 + 47 = 58, check if 47 is a prime: it is. - 17 + 41 = 58, check if 41 is a prime: it is. - 29 + 29 = 58, this uses the same prime twice, still valid. 4. **Count the Valid Pairs**: - Valid prime pairs are (5, 53), (11, 47), (17, 41), and (29, 29). 5. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, there are four ways to write 58 as the sum of two primes.

We are given that the boat takes 3 hours to cover a certain distance downstream and 6 hours to cover the same distance upstream. Let's denote the distance traveled in both cases as ( D ) km. Using the formula for distance (( D = speed times time )), we can write two equations: For downstream: [ D = (12 + c) times 3 ] For upstream: [ D = (12 - c) times 6 ] Since the distance ( D ) is the same in both cases, we can set the two equations equal to each other: [ (12 + c) times 3 = (12 - c) times 6 ] Expanding both sides: [ 36 + 3c = 72 - 6c ] Combining like terms: [ 3c + 6c = 72 - 36 ] [ 9c = 36 ] Dividing both sides by 9: [ c = 4 ] Now that we have the speed of the current, we can find the distance ( D ) by plugging ( c ) back into one of the original equations.

The sum of the first n terms, S_n, can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S_n = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d) Substituting the values of a_1 and d into the formula, we get: S_n = frac{n}{2}left(2left(-frac{56}{3}right) + (n-1)8right) Simplifying and factoring, we obtain: S_n = boxed{frac{12n^2 - 68n}{3}}"},{"prompt":"Both (a) and (b) are positive integers and (b > 2).

This means solving the inequality 2x^{2}-x-3geqslant 0. Let's break this down step-by-step: 1. **Find the Intervals Where the Function is Defined**: The inequality 2x^{2}-x-3geqslant 0 can be solved by factoring the quadratic or using the quadratic formula. The roots of the corresponding equation 2x^{2}-x-3=0 are found as follows: [ x = frac{-(-1) pm sqrt{(-1)^{2}-4cdot2cdot(-3)}}{2cdot2} = frac{1 pm sqrt{1+24}}{4} = frac{1 pm sqrt{25}}{4} ] This simplifies to: [ x = frac{1 pm 5}{4} ] Giving us the roots x = frac{3}{2} and x = -1. 2. **Determine the Sign of the Quadratic in Each Interval**: The quadratic 2x^{2}-x-3 changes its sign at the roots. Thus, we test values in each interval to determine where it is positive: - For x < -1, the quadratic is positive (e.g., plug in x = -2). - Between -1 and frac{3}{2}, it is negative (e.g., plug in x = 0). - For x > frac{3}{2}, it is again positive (e.g., plug in x = 2).

Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive, the quadratic function is decreasing for x < frac{1}{4} and increasing for x > frac{1}{4}.

Since angle ACB < 180^circ, we have: [ frac{1}{3} angle ACB < frac{1}{3} times 180^circ = 60^circ. ] This implies that angle H_1CH_2 is an acute angle. Consequently, triangle H_1CH_2 will have angles at H_1 and H_2 such that at most one of them can be obtuse. 3. **Analyzing angle H_1:** Suppose angle H_2CH_1 is acute. Then, H_2C intersects perpendicularly at some point T within segment H_1C, given by right triangle principles. 4. **Analyzing triangle H_1DC:** Since angle H_1CH_2 is acute, perpendiculars from H_1 to H_2C (constructed within triangle H_1DC) will also intersect H_2C at some internal point D. This implies D is within the segment H_1C, confirming that angle H_1DC < 90^circ. 5. **Construct Right Triangle:** Note that triangle triangle H_1DC is isosceles, as CD is also an altitude bisecting angle H_1C, making H_1T = TD. 6. **Implication on Lengths:** Considering TH_2 parallel DE and the properties of triangle congruence and division, it follows: [ H_1H_2 = H_2E. ] Thus, by a similar triangle inequality, H_1H_2 < H_2B. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the middle segment H_1H_2 cannot be the longest segment among the three.

When the three edges are mutually perpendicular, the tetrahedron P-ABC forms an octant of a cube, where the three edges are the radii of the sphere inscribed in the cube.

The mass of candies in a box priced i units is denoted as a_i. # Step-by-Step Solution: Part (a): Given: ( n = 10 ) and ( k = 3 ). 1. **Define sequences and inequalities**: - Let ( m_j = j frac{n}{k} ) for ( j = 1, 2, ldots, k ). - We need to ensure ( n_j geq m_j ) for the numbers ( n_1 < n_2 < ldots < n_k ) which represent the indices of the boxes we need to buy. 2. **Assume the contrary**: - Suppose for some ( j ), ( n_j < m_j ). - By definition: ( m_j = j cdot frac{10}{3} ). - Hence, ( m_1 = frac{10}{3} approx 3.33 ), ( m_2 = frac{20}{3} approx 6.67 ), and ( m_3 = 10 ). 3. **Check the contrary assumption**: - If ( n_j < m_j ) for some ( j ), it implies we chose fewer boxes of lower numbers and it leads to an insufficient mass (violating the requirement). 4. **Selection of boxes**: - Hence, we should consider ( n_1 = 4 ), ( n_2 = 7 ), and ( n_3 = 10 ). 5. **Verification of requirement**: - Consider the weights of candies ( a_4, a_7, ) and ( a_{10} ) (where ( a_1 leq a_2 leq ldots leq a_{10} ) as given). - The sum ( a_4 + a_7 + a_{10} ) must be checked to fulfill the requirement: [ sum_{j=1}^k a_{n_j} geq 3 cdot frac{sum_{i=1}^{10} a_i}{10} ] Thus: [ a_4 + a_7 + a_{10} geq frac{1}{3} left( sum_{i=2}^{4} a_i + sum_{i=5}^{7} a_i + sum_{i=8}^{10} a_i right) ] ensures the total mass criterion is satisfied. **Conclusion for Part (a)**: [ boxed{4, 7, 10} ] Part (b): For any natural numbers ( n geq k ): 1. **General formulation**: - Define ( n_j = leftlceil frac{j cdot n}{k} rightrceil ) for ( j = 1, 2, ldots, k ). - Here, ( leftlceil x rightrceil ) denotes the ceiling function which rounds up to the nearest integer. 2. **Selecting indices**: - This ensures ( n_j ) indices are appropriately spaced to incorporate at least the required amount of weight while minimizing the selection cost. 3. **Specific selection**: - For ( j = k ), ( n = leftlceil frac{k cdot n}{k} rightrceil = n ). **Conclusion for Part (b)**: [ boxed{text{indices of boxes as} leftlceil frac{n}{k} rightrceil, leftlceil frac{2n}{k} rightrceil, ldots, n} ] Thus, from the above steps and proving the conditions, the solution confirms that the minimum required boxes are indeed correctly selected for given conditions."},{"prompt":"Given that tan A tan B tan C > 0, determine the nature of triangle ABC with A, B, and C as its internal angles.

[ 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 35 ] 3. **Last Digit**: The last digit of the sum is (5), since (35) ends with (5). 4. **Effect of Replacement**: Since we can replace any digit of the number with the last digit of the sum of its digits, and the sum of the digits remains (35), the last digit would always be (5). 5. **Odd and Even Digits**: Now observe that (133355555) predominantly consists of the digits (1, 3, 5). Specifically, the digits are (1) and (3) (which are both odd) and (5) (which is also odd). 6. **Nature of Sum of Odd Digits**: The sum of any odd numbers is odd. Here, all the digits are odd, summing them yields an odd number: - If we sum all such digits and their subsequent transformations, the result will always be odd. 7. **Transformation Restriction**: To form (123456789), we need the presence of even digits in specific positions: (2, 4, 6) and (8). However, since our transformation rules based on the sum preserve the parity (odd to odd and even to even), starting solely with odd digits means we can never produce even digits. 8. **Conclusion**: Since it is impossible to introduce even numbers like (2, 4, 6) and (8) through these transformations, we cannot transform (133355555) into (123456789). Therefore, the transformation is not possible. [ boxed{text{No}} ]"},{"prompt":"Walking at 5/6th of its usual speed, a cab is 12 minutes late.

When the cab walks at ( frac{5}{6} ) of its usual speed, its new speed is ( frac{5}{6}S ). Since speed and time are inversely proportional (when the distance is constant), we can set up a proportion to find the relationship between the usual time and the time it takes when the cab is walking at the slower speed. Let ( T' ) be the time it takes for the cab to cover the journey at the slower speed. We know that ( T' = T + 12 ) minutes because the cab is 12 minutes late. Using the inverse proportionality of speed and time: ( frac{S}{frac{5}{6}S} = frac{T'}{T} ) Simplifying the left side of the equation: ( frac{S}{frac{5}{6}S} = frac{6}{5} ) So we have: ( frac{6}{5} = frac{T + 12}{T} ) Now we can solve for ( T ): ( 6T = 5(T + 12) ) ( 6T = 5T + 60 ) Subtract ( 5T ) from both sides: ( T = 60 ) minutes So the usual time for the cab to cover the journey is boxed{60} minutes."},{"prompt":"The recruits were standing in a row one behind the other, all facing the same direction.

We need to check if ( S_k ) is finite in this case. 5. **Pick the smallest prime divisor ( q ) of ( n ):** Let ( q ) be the smallest prime divisor of ( n ). Since ( n ) divides ( a^n + b^n ), we have: [ a^n + b^n equiv 0 pmod{q} ] Given ( a + b = 2^m ), we can write: [ (2^m - b)^n + b^n equiv 0 pmod{q} ] This implies: [ (2^m cdot b^{-1} - 1)^n equiv -1 pmod{q} ] 6. **Determine the order of ( 2^m cdot b^{-1} - 1 ) modulo ( q ):** The order of ( 2^m cdot b^{-1} - 1 ) modulo ( q ) must divide ( gcd(2n, q-1) = 2 ). Therefore, the order can be either 1 or 2. 7. **Analyze the possible orders:** - If the order is 1, then ( 2^m cdot b^{-1} - 1 equiv 1 pmod{q} ), which contradicts the fact that ( gcd(a, b) = 1 ) and ( q ) is an odd prime. - If the order is 2, then: [ (2^m cdot b^{-1} - 1)^2 equiv 1 pmod{q} ] This implies: [ 2^m cdot b^{-1} equiv 2 pmod{q} ] However, this leads to: [ 0 equiv (2^m cdot b^{-1} - 1) + 1 equiv 2 pmod{q} ] which is a contradiction. 8. **Conclude that ( n = 1 ):** The contradictions imply that ( n = 1 ), ensuring that ( S_k ) is finite.

Here, ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) denote the centers for the transformations that scale the polygon ( M ) into ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ), respectively. 3. **Points on the Perimeter:** Consider a point ( A ) on the boundary of ( M ) which is the farthest from the line connecting ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ).

The maximum distance of any point on ( M_1 ) or ( M_2 ) to ( O_1 O_2 ) would be reduced by the factor ( k ). 5. **Distance Argument:** Given the scaling factor ( 0 < k < 1 ), the farthest distance from any point in ( M_1 ) or ( M_2 ) to the line ( O_1 O_2 ) is strictly less than the corresponding distance in ( M ).

Let's verify that this sequence satisfies the conditions: 1. **Almost sure convergence xi_n rightarrow 0**: - Given xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], for large n, the interval [0, frac{1}{n}] shrinks. - The probability that xi falls into the interval [0, frac{1}{n}] is frac{1}{n}. - Hence, for large n, almost surely xi will be outside the interval [0, frac{1}{n}]. - Therefore, I_{[0, frac{1}{n}]}(xi) rightarrow 0 almost surely. - Given 0 leq n cdot I_{[0, frac{1}{n}]}(xi) leq n cdot 0 = 0, we have xi_n rightarrow 0 almost surely as n rightarrow infty. 2. **Expectation condition mathrm{E}[xi_n] = 1**: - Compute the expectation of xi_n: [ mathrm{E}[xi_n] = mathrm{E}[n cdot I_{[0, frac{1}{n}]}(xi)]. ] - The expected value of the indicator function I_{[0, frac{1}{n}]}(xi) is simply the probability that xi lies in the interval [0, frac{1}{n}]: [ mathrm{E}[I_{[0, frac{1}{n}]}(xi)] = mathbb{P}(xi in [0, frac{1}{n}]) = frac{1}{n}. ] - Substitute this into the original expectation: [ mathrm{E}[xi_n] = n cdot mathrm{E}[I_{[0, frac{1}{n}]}] = n cdot frac{1}{n} = 1. ] - Thus, mathrm{E}[xi_n] = 1 for all n geq 1. Since both conditions are satisfied, we have successfully constructed a sequence of random variables xi_n such that xi_n rightarrow 0 almost surely and mathrm{E}[xi_n] = 1 for all n geq 1. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Find the asymptote equations and the eccentricity of the hyperbola frac{y^{2}}{4}x^{2}=1.","completion":"To find the asymptote equations, we consider the equation frac{y^{2}}{4}-x^{2}=0.

We start by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of these two distances: [ text{LCM}(5000, 3000) = frac{5000 times 3000}{gcd(5000, 3000)} ] Since (5000 = 5 times 10^3) and (3000 = 3 times 10^3), the greatest common divisor (GCD) is (1000).

We are further required to give an example for each ( n > 4 ) where the point ( P ) lies outside the convex hull of the points ( A_i ). 2. **Choosing Points**: Let ( n = 3m ). We choose points as follows: - Points along the x-axis: ( (1, 0, 0), (2, 0, 0), ldots, (m, 0, 0) ) - Points along the y-axis: ( (0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 0), ldots, (0, m, 0) ) - Points along the z-axis: ( (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2), ldots, (0, 0, m) ) 3. **Defining ( P ) and the Sum**: Let ( P ) be ( (x, y, z) ). The sum we need to minimize is: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{m} |x - i| + sum_{j=1}^{m} |y - j| + sum_{k=1}^{m} |z - k| + 2m|x| + 2m|y| + 2m|z| ] Here, ( 2m|x| ), ( 2m|y| ), and ( 2m|z| ) are the terms corresponding to the points along the y and z axes for ( x ), and similarly for the other coordinates. 4. **Minimizing Separately**: Let's start by minimizing ( S ) with respect to ( x ). Consider the sum: [ S_x = 2m |x| + sum_{i=1}^{m} |x - i| ] Notice that (|x| ) cannot be decreased without increasing the other terms significantly. If we increase (|x|) by ( k ), the term ( 2m|x| ) will be increased by ( 2mk ). However, other terms are decreased at most by ( mk ). Hence, net increase in ( S ) will be at least ( mk ) which is not beneficial. Similarly, if we decrease (|x|), we clearly see that the sum will increase. Therefore, the minimum value is obtained when (|x| = 0 ) or ( x = 0 ). 5. **Repeat for y and z**: By the same reasoning, the sum involving ( y ) and ( z ) are minimized when ( y = 0 ) and ( z = 0 ). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the point ( P ) that minimizes the sum ( S ) is at ( (0,0,0) ). 7. **Outside the Convex Hull**: Observing the chosen points, we see that all these points lie on the positive axes for ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ). Hence, the origin ( (0,0,0) ) does not lie within the convex hull of these points. For other values ( n = 3m-1 ) and ( n = 3m-2 ): If ( n = 3m-1 ), drop the point ( (0, 0, m) ). If ( n = 3m-2 ), drop the points ( (0, 0, m) ) and ( (0, m, 0) ). The argument remains the same for minimizing each coordinate separately. For ( n > 6 ), similar reasoning applies as the number of points ensures that the term ( 2m-2 ) remains greater than ( m ). Even if ( n = 5 ), the same logic holds since we work with terms such as ( 3|x| + |x| + |x-1| ). Thus, our example proves that for each ( n > 4 ), the point ( P ) at the origin lies outside the convex hull of the given points.

According to the problem, 4/5 of the eggs are blue, so the number of blue eggs is (4/5)E. The remaining eggs are purple, so the number of purple eggs is E - (4/5)E = (1/5)E. Now, we are told that half of the purple eggs have five pieces of candy each, so the number of purple eggs with five pieces of candy is (1/2)(1/5)E = (1/10)E. For the blue eggs, 1/4 of them have five pieces of candy each, so the number of blue eggs with five pieces of candy is (1/4)(4/5)E = (1/5)E.

Since each vertex has 2 neighbors, this leaves us with 10 - 1 - 2 = 7 non-adjacent vertices to choose from (the -1 is because we can't choose the same vertex again). Step 3: Each diagonal is counted twice because choosing vertex A and then vertex B forms the same diagonal as choosing vertex B and then vertex A. To correct for this, we divide the count by 2.

Observe that each term involving 9, 3m, and 3n is divisible by 3, except for the constant term 1: [ 9mn + 3m + 3n + 1 = 3(3mn + m + n) + 1 ] 6. From the above expression, it is evident that ( 3(3mn + m + n) ) is divisible by 3, leaving a remainder of 1 when the whole expression is divided by 3. 7. Therefore, the product ( (3m + 1)(3n + 1) ) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. Hence, we conclude that if both numbers give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, their product also gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.

Next, divide each number by the sequence’s lowest common multiple (LCM). Although specific LCM calculations are unnecessary, let's simplify each term assuming each number is distinct and mutually prime (which they are). The simplified sequence thus is itself.

This step simplifies the function into a form that can be more easily analyzed. The expression (x-a)^{2}+(e^{2x+2}-2a)^{2} represents the square of the distance between two points: the moving point M(x,e^{2x+2}) on the graph of g(x)=e^{2x+2}, and the moving point N(a,2a) on the line y=2x. Thus, our problem becomes one of finding the minimum distance between a point on the curve g(x) and a point on the line y=2x. To find the condition for the minimum distance, we need the slopes of the tangent to the curve g(x) at any point and the slope of the line y=2x. The derivative of g(x), g'(x)=2e^{2x+2}, gives us the slope of the tangent to the curve. Since the slope of the line y=2x is constant at 2, the condition for the minimum distance is when these slopes are equal, leading to the equation 2e^{2x+2}=2. Solving 2e^{2x+2}=2 for x, we find x=-1. At this point, the minimum distance d from the point (-1,1) on the curve to the line y=2x can be calculated to be frac{3}{sqrt{5}}. Consequently, f(x), representing the square of the distance, must be greater than or equal to d^{2}=frac{9}{5}. If there exists x_{0} such that f(x_{0})leqslantfrac{9}{5}, it implies that f(x_{0})=frac{9}{5}, indicating that the line segment connecting M and N is perpendicular to the line y=2x, and point N is the foot of the perpendicular from M to this line. Given the slope of the line segment MN is frac{2a-1}{a-(-1)}=frac{2a-1}{a+1}, and it should be perpendicular to the line y=2x (which has a slope of 2), we set up the equation for perpendicular lines: frac{2a-1}{a+1}times 2=-1. Solving frac{2a-1}{a+1}times 2=-1 for a, we find a=frac{1}{5}. Therefore, the ratio frac{x_0}{a}=frac{-1}{frac{1}{5}}=-5.

To carry out this construction, we'll use geometric principles and some construction techniques involving normal vectors and plane angles. Step 2: Identifying the normal vector to the plane First, we need to find a normal vector to the given plane Sleft(s_{1},s_{2}right). Let n = left(n^{prime}, n^{prime prime}right) be this normal vector. This normal vector will be perpendicular to any plane passing through it. Step 3: Setting up the basic geometric tools To ensure our x_{1,4} axis is correctly positioned, we need: - A point Aleft(A^{prime}, A^{prime prime}right) on the normal line extending from our given plane. - Consider this point A as the apex of a 45^circ semi-angle cone. Step 4: Constructing the cone and its base Construct the base circle of this 45^circ semi-angle cone. This has its apex at point A. The intersection of the normal line’s first trace (or frontal trace in a three-dimensional space) and the base circle will help determine the required tangents. Step 5: Establishing the tangents to the base circle The tangents drawn from the first trace of the normal line to this base circle determine the directions of possible solutions for the x_{1,4} axis. These tangents are the directions in which the plane Sleft(s_{1}, s_{2}right) will be perpendicular to the desired plane bisectors. Step 6: Evaluating scenarios based on alpha_1 angle 1. If the first viewing angle alpha_1 of the given plane is greater than 45^circ, then we will have two possible solutions for the x_{1,4} axis. 2. If alpha_1 leq 45^circ, then there is either one solution or no solution, depending on the specific configuration. Thus the final construction and analysis of the problem would involve evaluating whether alpha_1 is greater than or less than 45^circ to determine the number of possible solutions. # Conclusion: 1. Calculate the normal vector to the plane Sleft(s_{1}, s_{2}right). 2. Identify a point on this normal vector and construct a 45^circ cone with this point as the apex. 3. Draw tangents from the trace of this normal vector to the base of the cone. 4. Analyze based on whether alpha_1 is greater than or less than 45^circ to find the number of solutions.

Prove that the sphere passing through the orthocenters of the faces also passes through the perpendicular projections of the vertices onto the opposite faces.","completion":"1. **Problem Setup**: Consider a tetrahedron with both its inscribed and circumscribed spheres being concentric. We need to prove that the sphere passing through the orthocenter of any of its faces also passes through the perpendicular projection of a vertex onto the opposite face. 2. **Assumptions**: Without loss of generality, we assume the tetrahedron is not regular since for a regular tetrahedron this condition is trivially met. We will use the notation from the given diagram (Figure 1). 3. **Notation & Key Points**: - Let ( K ) be the point where the inscribed sphere touches the face ( ABC ). - The distance from any vertex ( A ) to ( K ) is ( KA = sqrt{R^2 - r^2} ), where ( R ) is the radius of the circumscribed sphere and ( r ) is the radius of the inscribed sphere. - Therefore, ( KB = KC = sqrt{R^2 - r^2} ), signifying ( K ) as the circumcenter of triangle ( ABC ), and the radius of this circumcircle is ( sqrt{R^2 - r^2} ). 4. **Triangle Properties**: - Similarly, the radius of the circumcircle of the other faces (( ABD ), ( ACD ), and ( BCD )) will also be ( sqrt{R^2 - r^2} ). - Hence, ( angle ACB ) and ( angle ADB ) are identical owing to the circles having the same radii for the same chords. This implies the angles marked similarly in the diagram are equal. 5. **Angle Relationships**: - Considering the sum of angles for triangles ( ABC ) and ( BCD ): [ epsilon + delta + gamma = epsilon + alpha + phi ] Therefore, [ delta + gamma = alpha + phi quad text{(1)} ] - Similarly, [ delta + phi = alpha + gamma quad text{(2)} ] 6. **Angle Equality**: - From equations (1) and (2), we deduce ( gamma = phi ) and similarly ( alpha = delta ) and ( beta = epsilon ). - This implies the tetrahedron sides are symmetrically arranged such that opposite and skew edges are equal. 7. **Midpoints and Symmetry**: - Let ( F ) be the midpoint of edge ( BC ). - Due to congruence of ( ABC ) and ( DCB ), we have ( AF = DF ). Hence, triangles ( ADF ) and ( DAF ) denote symmetric properties. - Let ( A_1 ) and ( D_1 ) be points such that the segments ( AA_1 ) and ( DD_1 ) (centroids from ( A ) and ( D )) are equal in length. 8. **Centroid and Sphere's Intersection**: - Since all faces are congruent, the lengths of medians (centroid lines) are equal. The centroid divides each median in a ( 3:1 ) ratio. - Therefore, the centroid of the tetrahedron coincides with the center ( O ) of the circumscribed sphere. 9. **Projections and Circumcenter**: - Let ( S ) be the centroid of ( triangle ABC ). The perpendicular projection of ( O ) onto ( triangle ABC ) is ( K ), the circumcenter. - Hence, ( KS ) determines the Euler line of ( triangle ABC ). 10. **Proving the Required Orthogonality**: - On the Euler line, the relation ( KM = 3 cdot KS ) holds. - Using the theorem of parallel intercepts: [ VK: KS = DO: OS = 3: 1 ] - Thus, ( VK = 3 KS ), leading to ( VK = KM ). 11. **Final Conclusion**: - From ( VK = KM ), it follows ( OV = OM ). Here, ( K ), ( M ), and ( O ) determine the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ). - The distances are independent of the choice of face, confirming that the required property holds for any projection and orthocenter intersection on the concentric spheres.

Let's first understand the problem. We need to determine if there exists a positive integer ( n > 1 ) such that ( n ) is a power of 2 and one of the numbers obtained by permuting its decimal digits is a power of 3. 2. We start by noting that if ( n ) is a power of 2, then ( n = 2^a ) for some integer ( a geq 1 ). 3. Next, we need to check if any permutation of the digits of ( 2^a ) can be a power of 3. Let's denote this permutation as ( m ). Therefore, we need to check if ( m = 3^b ) for some integer ( b geq 0 ). 4. To proceed, we use the property of numbers modulo 3.

This means ( 2^a ) is never divisible by 3. 7. The divisibility rule for 3 states that a number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since ( 2^a ) is not divisible by 3, the sum of its digits is not divisible by 3. 8. Therefore, any permutation of the digits of ( 2^a ) will also not be divisible by 3, as the sum of the digits remains unchanged under permutation. 9.

Let ( log_{sin x} cos x = a ) where ( 0 < a < 1 ). 3.

Recalling properties of logarithms, we can further simplify the numerator (log_{sin x} sqrt{tan x}): [ log_{sin x} sqrt{tan x} = frac{1}{2} log_{sin x} tan x ] 5. Now we expand ( log_{sin x} tan x ): [ log_{sin x} tan x = log_{sin x} left(frac{sin x}{cos x}right) = log_{sin x} sin x - log_{sin x} cos x ] 6.

Applying Lemma 1 to ( n = frac{i^2 + (L(i))^2}{p} ) and ( a = frac{i^2}{p} ), we obtain: [ leftlfloor frac{i^2}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{i^2 + (L(i))^2}{p} - frac{i^2}{p} rightrfloor = frac{i^2 + (L(i))^2}{p} - 1 ] Equivalently, [ leftlfloor frac{i^2}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{(L(i))^2}{p} rightrfloor = frac{i^2}{p} + frac{(L(i))^2}{p} - 1 ] 6. Since ( 2 cdot frac{i^2 + (L(i))^2}{p} ) is an integer, while ( frac{2i^2}{p} ) is a non-integer, applying Lemma 1 to ( n = 2 cdot frac{i^2 + (L(i))^2}{p} ) and ( a = frac{2i^2}{p} ), we obtain: [ leftlfloor frac{2i^2}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2 cdot frac{i^2 + (L(i))^2}{p} - frac{2i^2}{p} rightrfloor = 2 cdot frac{i^2 + (L(i))^2}{p} - 1 ] Equivalently, [ leftlfloor frac{2i^2}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2(L(i))^2}{p} rightrfloor = frac{2i^2}{p} + frac{2(L(i))^2}{p} - 1 ] 7.

First, let's find the number of ways to choose 3 non-defective pencils out of the 5 non-defective ones. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) Where: - C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. - n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers from 1 to n). - k! is the factorial of k. For the non-defective pencils: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5 - 3)!) C(5, 3) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) C(5, 3) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) C(5, 3) = 10 Now, let's find the total number of ways to choose any 3 pencils out of the 7: C(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!)

So, we have S(triangle ACD) = S(triangle ADE) = 2. 2. Let point K divide the side DE in the ratio (DK : KE = x : (1 - x)). 3.

Since there are 2 red balls and 3 yellow balls, and we are drawing two balls without replacement, the total number of outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 5, which is binom{5}{2} = 10. - **Step 2:** Identify the favorable outcomes. The favorable outcomes are those in which both balls drawn are red. Since there are 2 red balls, the number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of 2 is binom{2}{2} = 1. - **Step 3:** Calculate the probability. The probability of drawing two red balls is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is frac{1}{10}.

By Remark 27, we have ( X_3 = T ). 4. **Tangents and Equalities**: Hence, ( gamma_1 ) is tangent to circle ( omega_1 ) at ( X_1 ) and circle ( omega_3 ) at ( X_3 ). The common tangents are the lines ( (BC) ) and ( (AD) ). 5. **Chasing Tangency Points**: - Since ( F ) is given to be equidistant from the tangency points on ((AB), (BC), (CD),) and ((DA)), we know that [ FX_1 = FX_3. ] - Also, we have [ FY_2 = FZ_2 quad text{and} quad FZ_4 = FY_4, ] leading to the equalities [ X_1Y_2 = X_3Z_2 quad text{and} quad Z_4X_1 = X_3Y_4. ] 6. **Using Additional Equalities**: - It follows that [ Z_4X_1 = Y_1X_4 ] and [ Y_4X_3 = Z_3X_4. ] 7. **Concluding Tangency Setup**: - Observing the equalities [ Y_1Z_3 = 2Z_4X_1 ] and [ Z_1Y_3 = 2X_1Y_2, ] we notice that [ Z_1Y_3 = Y_1Z_3, ] verifying that [ Z_4X_1 = X_1Y_2, ] thence yielding [ Y_1X_4 = Z_1X_2 ] and thus illustrating that [ EX_4 = EX_2. ] 8. **Construct Second Circle ( gamma_2 )**: - Consequently, there exists a circle ( gamma_2 ) that is tangent to lines ((AB)) and ((CD)) at ( X_4 ) and ( X_2 ). - Again invoking Remark 27, the points ( X_4, X_2 ), and ( F ) are collinear. **Conclusion**: Hence, if the points ( X_1, X_3 ), and ( E ) are collinear, the points ( X_2, X_4 ), and ( F ) are also collinear, as stated.

If 5 boys can paint a 30 m long fence in 1.8 days, then the rate at which they paint is: Rate = Length of fence / Time taken Rate = 30 m / 1.8 days Now, let's calculate the rate per boy per day: Rate per boy per day = Rate / Number of boys Rate per boy per day = (30 m / 1.8 days) / 5 boys Rate per boy per day = 30 m / (1.8 * 5) days Rate per boy per day = 30 m / 9 days Rate per boy per day = 10/3 m/day Now we know that each boy can paint 10/3 meters of fence in one day. Let's find out how much 2 boys can paint in 3 days: Total length painted by 2 boys in 3 days = Rate per boy per day * Number of boys * Time taken Total length painted by 2 boys in 3 days = (10/3 m/day) * 2 boys * 3 days Total length painted by 2 boys in 3 days = (10/3 m/day) * 6 Total length painted by 2 boys in 3 days = 20 m Therefore, the length of the fence that the 2 boys are painting is boxed{20} meters."},{"prompt":"The sum of two nonzero real numbers is 5 times their product.

By De Moivre's Theorem, z^4 = r^4 text{cis}(4theta). 2. **Equilateral Triangle Condition**: Since 0, z, and z^4 form an equilateral triangle, the distances from 0 to z and from 0 to z^4 must be equal. This implies r = r^4. Solving r^4 = r, we get r = 1 (since r neq 0 as z is nonzero). 3. **Rotation by 120^circ**: To maintain an equilateral triangle, the angle between z and z^4 must be 120^circ or 240^circ. Thus, 4theta - theta = pm 120^circ. Simplifying, we get 3theta = pm 120^circ + 2pi k for some integer k. 4. **Solving for theta**: - For 3theta = 120^circ, theta = 40^circ. - For 3theta = -120^circ, theta = -40^circ but considering positive angles, theta = 320^circ. 5. **Counting Distinct Solutions**: The distinct solutions for theta in degrees are 40^circ and 320^circ. Each corresponds to a unique z on the unit circle, since z = text{cis}(theta). 6. **Conclusion**: There are two distinct nonzero complex numbers z that satisfy the given conditions.
