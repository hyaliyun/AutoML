Given that there are 3 good products and 2 defective ones among the 5 products, and we are selecting 2 products, we can break down the probability of selecting exactly 1 good product into steps: 1. Calculate the number of ways to select 1 good product out of 3. This can be done using the combination formula C_n^r = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. For selecting 1 good product, it is C_3^1 = frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = 3. 2. Calculate the number of ways to select 1 defective product out of 2. Using the combination formula again, it is C_2^1 = frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = 2. 3. Calculate the total number of ways to select 2 products out of 5, which is C_5^2 = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10. 4. The probability of selecting exactly 1 good product is the product of the number of ways to select 1 good and 1 defective product divided by the total number of ways to select 2 products from 5.

Suppose for contradiction that Delta(t) < 1 minute 51 seconds left(frac{111}{60} text{ minutes}right) at all times during the game. 3.

Let's demonstrate a setup where the absolute difference in times shown by clocks never exceeds 2 minutes: 2. Consider an example where: - Player 1 uses time tau = frac{300}{158} minutes for the first move. - Each subsequent move by either player requires 2tau minutes, except the last move by Player 2 who spends some remaining time to total exactly 150 minutes. 3. Thus: - For 40 total moves including both, for each k-th move, the difference Delta(t) = |t_i - (t_{i+k})| where t_i, t_{i+k} are the times taken by players: [ 79 times 2tau + tau = 150 text{ minutes} ] - Each k tau < 2 minutes.

The amount of work done is directly proportional to the number of people and the number of days they work.

The second group of people does half of the work in 5 days, which is W/2. This means that each person in the second group does (W/2)/P2 amount of work in 5 days. Since the work done by each person in a given time is the same for both groups, we can set up the following equation: (W/P1)/20 = ((W/2)/P2)/5 Simplifying both sides by W, we get: 1/(P1*20) = (1/2)/(P2*5) Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for the ratio of P2 to P1: P2*5*2 = P1*20 10*P2 = 20*P1 P2/P1 = 20/10 P2/P1 = 2 So, the ratio of the number of people in the second group to the number of people in the first group is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"ABC is a triangle, and E and F are points on the segments BC and CA respectively, such that frac{CE}{CB}+frac{CF}{CA}=1 and angle CEF=angle CAB .

Given that ABC is a triangle, and E and F are points on the segments BC and CA respectively, such that frac{CE}{CB} + frac{CF}{CA} = 1 and angle CEF = angle CAB. 2. Let frac{CE}{CB} = k and frac{CF}{CA} = 1 - k. This implies that k + (1 - k) = 1, which is consistent with the given condition. 3. Since angle CEF = angle CAB, triangles CEF and CAB are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. 4. Let M be the midpoint of EF. Since M is the midpoint, CM is the median of triangle CEF. 5. Let G be the point of intersection between CM and AB. 6. Since AFEB is cyclic, it follows that CG is the C-symmedian of triangle ABC. This is because the C-median of triangle CEF intersects AB at G, and AFEB being cyclic implies that CG is the C-symmedian of triangle ABC. 7. By the properties of the symmedian, we have frac{AG}{BG} = frac{b^2}{a^2}, where a = BC and b = CA. 8. Given that CE cdot CB = CF cdot CA, we have k cdot a^2 = (1 - k) cdot b^2. Solving for k, we get: [ k cdot a^2 = (1 - k) cdot b^2 implies k a^2 = b^2 - k b^2 implies k (a^2 + b^2) = b^2 implies k = frac{b^2}{a^2 + b^2} ] 9. Therefore, frac{k}{1 - k} = frac{b^2}{a^2}. 10.

The cost price of each item is 2. According to longterm sales data, it is found that when the selling price of this stationery is 3 per item, 500 items can be sold per day. If the selling price increases by 0.1, the sales volume will decrease by 10 items. The Price Bureau stipulates that the selling price cannot exceed 240% of the cost price. (1) If this type of stationery is to achieve a daily profit of 800, what should be the selling price per item? (2) How should it be priced to maximize the daily profit of this type of stationery? What is the maximum profit?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Selling Price for a 800 Daily Profit 1. **Setting up the equation based on given conditions:** Let x be the selling price per item to achieve a daily profit of 800. The profit from selling each item is (x - 2) dollars (selling price minus cost price). The number of items sold decreases by 10 for every 0.1 increase in price above 3. Therefore, the number of items sold can be expressed as 500 - frac{x - 3}{0.1} times 10. The profit equation becomes: (x - 2) left(500 - frac{x - 3}{0.1} times 10right) = 800 2. **Simplifying the equation:** Expanding and simplifying gives us: x^2 - 10x + 24 = 0 3. **Solving the quadratic equation:** Solving for x yields two solutions: x_1 = 4 and x_2 = 6. 4. **Applying the Price Bureau's restriction:** The selling price cannot exceed 240% of the cost price, which is 2 times 240% = 4.8. Therefore, we discard x = 6. Hence, the selling price per item should be boxed{4 text{ dollars}} to achieve a profit of 800 per day. Part 2: Maximizing the Daily Profit 1. **Expressing the daily profit w as a function of price x:** Let w be the daily profit when the selling price is x dollars per item. The profit function is given by: w = (x - 2) left(500 - frac{x - 3}{0.1} times 10right) 2. **Simplifying the profit function:** After simplification, we get: w = -100x^2 + 1000x - 1600 = -100(x - 5)^2 + 900 3. **Determining the price for maximum profit:** The profit function is maximized when x = 5, but due to the Price Bureau's restriction, x cannot exceed 4.8. Therefore, the maximum profit occurs when x = 4.8. 4. **Calculating the maximum profit:** Substituting x = 4.8 into the profit function: w_{text{max}} = -100 times (4.8 - 5)^2 + 900 = 896 Therefore, to maximize the daily profit, the selling price should be boxed{4.8 text{ dollars}} per item, resulting in a maximum daily profit of boxed{896 text{ dollars}}."},{"prompt":"Let {a_n} be a positive geometric sequence, given that a_2=2, and a_3a_4a_5=2^9.

The moves continue until the water can no longer fill new cells. How should Vasya act so that, in the end, water fills as few cells as possible?","completion":"1. **Initial Configuration and Setup**: - We have a 14 times 14 grid where the top row is completely filled with water. - Vasya can place 3 sandbags in any free cells in each move. - Water flows into adjacent (by side) cells if they are not occupied by sandbags. 2. **Understanding Flow Mechanism**: - On the first move, Vasya places 3 sandbags in the second row. - Since each move allows water to flow to all adjacent cells that aren’t blocked by sandbags, after the first move, there will be at most 3 sandbags, but 11 other cells could be filled with water in the second row. 3. **Second Move Consideration**: - After placing the sandbags on the first move, water would occupy 1 + 11 = 12 cells (1 row of 14 cells but with 3 blocked). - On the second move, Vasya places sandbags in the third row similarly. - Now, considering the positions of the sandbags, and because water flows to every adjacent open cell, by the end of the second move, there will be at most 7 additional sandbags in the first and second rows combined. 4. **Calculations and Estimations**: - After the second move, water will reach the third row with at least 14 - 7 = 7 columns open. - Analyzing systematically: - First move: At minimum, 11 cells newly occupied by water. - Second move: At minimum, 7 new cells occupied by water. [ text{Total cells occupied by water after second move: } 14 (text{first row} ) + 11 (text{second row} ) = 25 text{ cells} ] 5. **Further Moves**: - On the third move, similar logic follows: - Third row: at minimum, 4 more cells since 7 vertical columns from above can bring water down. - Fourth move: on proceeding, at minimum, 1 more cell in the third row’s unblocked cells. [ text{Adding additional cells: } 25 (text{after second move}) + 7 (text{third row}) + 4 (text{fourth row}) + 1 (text{fifth row}) = 37 text{ cells} ] 6. **Minimal Fill Argument**: - Reviewing combinatorial placements, Vasya cannot prevent water from occupying less than 37 cells if he strategically places sandbags such as blocking exactly as shown in above steps. 7. **Effective Strategy to Minimize Filled Cells**: - To achieve exactly 37 cells filled: - Vasya places sandbags in each subsequent row effectively as needed at critical cells to block additional flow efficiently. 8. **Illustration Confirmation**: - Refer to the given image illustrating possible blockage and minimal water fill. **Conclusion**: Water will fill at minimum 37 cells, ensuring the minimal spread given any particular strategic placement by Vasya. Therefore, the detailed step-by-step confirmation is correct, showing that Vasya can ensure water occupies at least 37 cells in optimal blocking distribution.

Let us assume an irregular n-gon is inscribed around a circle ( S ). 2. Inscribe a regular ( n )-gon around the same circle, and denote the circle circumscribed around this regular ( n )-gon as ( S_1 ). 3.

Therefore, the area inside ( S_1 ) enclosed by the regular n-gon is greater than that enclosed by the irregular n-gon. 8.

Let us consider any two tram stops A and B situated at vertices or intersections of diagonals. 2. Assume that the tram routes passing through stops A and B are along diagonals XY and MN, respectively. 3. We need to verify the cases of diagonal intersections to determine the number of transfers needed to travel from stop A to stop B. Case 1: Direct Intersection 4. If the diagonals XY and MN intersect at a single point, say P, then stop A can be connected to stop B directly or with a single transfer at point P. Case 2: No Direct Intersection 5. If the diagonals XY and MN do not intersect directly, consider the quadrilateral formed by these diagonals, indicated as XYMN. 6. By the problem's setup, considering that no three diagonals meet at a single point and each intersection is unique, there must exist diagonals within the quadrilateral XYMN that do intersect. Let these be XN and YM, intersecting at point O. 7. Without loss of generality, assume a tram route exists along diagonal YM passing through point O. Confirming the Path with Transfers 8. Given this configuration, a possible travel route from A to B would be: - Take the tram from A to Y - Transfer at point Y - Take the tram from Y to M - Finally, transfer at point M - Reach stop B from M 9. This travel path ensures that no more than two transfers (A rightarrow Y, Y rightarrow M, M rightarrow B) are needed. Conclusion: 10.

Suppose we are given an expression, we move from left to right: - Replace each opening parenthesis by a step to the right. - Replace each plus by a step upwards. - Given that the number of opening parenthesis in the expression equals the number of steps to the right, and each is paired with a summation sign, we form a path starting from ((0, 0)) to ((n-1, n-1)). This path must ensure that at any point in time, steps to the right are not fewer than steps upwards. 2. **Form the Path:** Move stepwise from point ((0,0)) to ((n-1, n-1)): - Replace each right step with an opening parenthesis. - Each step upwards is replaced by a plus sign. The derived path does not move above the line ( y = x ). 3. **Reverse Mapping:** - Start from the point ((0,0)) and replace each step to the right with an opening parenthesis, and each upward step with a plus sign. - Write down the variables before each addition sign and at the end of the derived expression. - Ensure the expression’s validity by placing the closing parenthesis correctly. 4. **Conclusion:** Thus, the constructed bijection confirms the number of ways is indeed ( C_n ).

Starting with the condition \\"frac{2}{a} < 1\\", we can manipulate this inequality to understand its implications. We have: [ frac{2}{a} < 1 implies 1 - frac{2}{a} = frac{a-2}{a} > 0 ] This step involves basic algebraic manipulation, subtracting the entire equation by frac{2}{a} and simplifying. 2. The inequality frac{a-2}{a} > 0 can be further analyzed by considering the factors separately, leading to: [ a(a-2) > 0 ] This step is a result of multiplying both sides by a, assuming a neq 0 to avoid division by zero, which is a critical consideration in inequality problems. 3. Solving the inequality a(a-2) > 0 gives us two intervals for a: a < 0 or a > 2. This is derived by considering the points where the expression changes sign, which are at a = 0 and a = 2. The sign of the expression in intervals determined by these points tells us where the expression is positive. 4. Now, examining the condition \\"a^2 > 4\\", we can rewrite it as: [ a^2 > 4 implies a < -2 text{ or } a > 2 ] This step involves recognizing that the inequality describes a range of values for a that do not include the interval between -2 and 2, inclusive. Comparing the intervals derived from both conditions, we see that while both conditions require a > 2, the first condition also allows for a < 0, which is not included in the solution set for a^2 > 4. Therefore, having frac{2}{a} < 1 is necessary for a^2 > 4 because without it, a could not be greater than 2.

In base 10, the digit '7' can appear in any of the three possible digit places in a three-digit number (hundreds, tens, and ones). 1.

At x = frac{2}{a}, both inequalities must be equal, leading to the equation: [ left(frac{2}{a}right)^2 + bleft(frac{2}{a}right) - 4 = 0 ] Solving this equation for b gives: [ b = 2a - frac{2}{a} ] Thus, we need to find the minimum value of b + frac{3}{a}, which simplifies to: [ b + frac{3}{a} = 2a + frac{1}{a} ] To minimize this expression, we apply the AM-GM inequality: [ 2a + frac{1}{a} geq 2sqrt{2a cdot frac{1}{a}} = 2sqrt{2} ] Equality holds when 2a = frac{1}{a}, or a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

Let's assume the total number of days taken to complete the project is ( x ) days. A quits 10 days before the project is completed, so A works for ( x - 10 ) days. In ( x - 10 ) days, A completes ( (x - 10) times frac{1}{20} ) of the project. B works for the entire duration of ( x ) days, so B completes ( x times frac{1}{20} ) of the project. The sum of the work done by A and B should equal the entire project, which is 1 (or 100%). So we have: ( (x - 10) times frac{1}{20} + x times frac{1}{20} = 1 ) Now, let's solve for ( x ): ( frac{x - 10}{20} + frac{x}{20} = 1 ) Multiply through by 20 to clear the denominators: ( x - 10 + x = 20 ) Combine like terms: ( 2x - 10 = 20 ) Add 10 to both sides: ( 2x = 30 ) Divide by 2: ( x = 15 ) So the project will be completed in boxed{15} days."},{"prompt":"Given that a, b, and c are lines, and alpha, beta, and gamma are planes, which of the following statements is correct?

Therefore: [ f(2(n_0 - 2)) = f(2) cdot f(n_0 - 2) = 2 cdot (n_0 - 2) ] Since n_0 geq 4, we have: [ 2(n_0 - 2) geq n_0 ] Hence, it leads to: [ f(2(n_0 - 2)) = 2(n_0 - 2) geq f(n_0) > n_0 ] Which is a contradiction as 2(n_0 - 2) geq n_0 implies f(n_0) leq n_0. - **Case 2: n_0 is even**: Since n_0 is even, 2 and n_0 - 1 are coprime. Therefore: [ f(2(n_0 - 1)) = f(2) cdot f(n_0 - 1) = 2 cdot (n_0 - 1) ] Since n_0 geq 4, we have: [ 2(n_0 - 1) geq n_0 ] Hence, it leads to: [ f(2(n_0 - 1)) = 2(n_0 - 1) geq f(n_0) > n_0 ] Which is a contradiction as 2(n_0 - 1) geq n_0 implies f(n_0) leq n_0. 7. **Conclusion**: Both cases (odd and even n_0) lead to contradictions.

For n = 1005, we get the term a_{1005}, and for n = 1006, we get the term a_{1006}.

We also need to determine the smallest such ( N ). 2. **Defining a Beautiful Set:** A set ( S ) is called beautiful if for any three distinct elements ( x, y, z in S ), at least one of them divides ( x + y + z ). 3. **Example to Show ( N geq 6 ):** Consider the set ( S = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 193, 3467} ).

If an odd prime ( q ) divides ( b ), then ( q mid a_i, a_j, a_k ), so ( q ) divides all ( a_i ) along with ( b ), contradicting the maximality condition. Therefore, ( b ) is a power of two. - If any ( b neq a_1, a_2, dots, a_n ) satisfies ( 4 mid b ), then all ( a_i ) are even. Choosing ( n_s = 2 ), we see ( S ) admits at most one odd term, and we're done. - If all ( b ) are ( < 4 ), then every element of ( S ) is divisible by ( n_s = p ) except possibly ( b = 1, 2 ), so once again we're done. **Case 2:** No odd prime divides three elements of ( S ). - Let ( T ) be the set of odd elements of ( S ).

Hence, the sets cannot all share a common element. - It follows that one of ( i, j, k ) is ( 4 ), and we can WLOG assign ( a_1, a_2, a_4 mid a_5 + a_6 ), ( a_1, a_3 mid a_4 + a_6 ), and ( a_2, a_3 mid a_4 + a_5 ). - By the same reasoning, we can look at the \\"missing\\" triples to deduce ( a_5 mid a_3 + a_6 ), ( a_4 mid a_2 + a_6 ), and ( a_4 mid a_1 + a_5 ). - Finally, we have ( a_4 mid (a_2 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_5) - (a_5 + a_6) = a_1 + a_2 ), hence ( 2a_4 leq a_1 + a_2 ), contradiction. 5. **Conclusion:** We have exhausted all cases, so the answer is ( N = 6 ).

Según el enunciado, el radio de la circunferencia inscrita del triángulo es ( r ). 2. **División del triángulo en pequeños triángulos semejantes:** Dividimos cada lado del triángulo en ( n ) partes iguales. Esto implica que: - Cada lado original del triángulo se divide en ( n ) segmentos de longitud ( frac{text{longitud del lado}}{n} ). - Se traen rectas paralelas a los otros dos lados desde los puntos de división. Haciendo esto, se forman ( n^{2} ) triángulos pequeños dentro del triángulo original, todos ellos siendo semejantes al triángulo original y de razón de semejanza ( frac{1}{n} ). 3. **Círculos en los triángulos pequeños:** En cada uno de estos ( n^{2} ) triángulos semejantes, el radio de la circunferencia inscrita es proporcional al radio de la circunferencia inscrita del triángulo original.

A tangent line to the circle intersects the xaxis at point A and the yaxis at point B. Find the minimum length of the line segment AB.","completion":"To find the tangent line to the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1, we must recognize that the radius of the circle to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. Let the point of tangency be (x_0, y_0) on the circle, then we have x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 1. The slope of the radius at this point is frac{y_0}{x_0} (since the radius is the line segment from the origin to the point (x_0, y_0)), hence the slope of the tangent line, which is perpendicular to the radius, is -frac{x_0}{y_0} (a result of the negative reciprocal between perpendicular slopes). The equation of the tangent line can be written as: y - y_0 = -frac{x_0}{y_0}(x - x_0) Let's now find where this line intersects the x-axis and y-axis. For the x-axis (y=0): 0 - y_0 = -frac{x_0}{y_0}(x - x_0) x_0^2 = y_0 x Since x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 1, this means x = x_0^2 + x_0^2 = 2x_0^2. Similarly, for the y-axis (x=0): y - y_0 = -frac{x_0}{y_0}(- x_0) y_0^2 = x_0 y This results in y = y_0^2 + y_0^2 = 2y_0^2. So the coordinates of points A and B become (2x_0^2, 0) and (0, 2y_0^2) respectively. The length of AB = the Euclidean distance between A and B =sqrt{(2x_0^2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 2y_0^2)^2} = 2sqrt{x_0^4 + y_0^4}.

So the minimum length of AB becomes 2sqrt{x_0^4 + y_0^4} geq 2sqrt{1} = 2. Note that the equality holds when x_0 = y_0 = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, where the point (x_0, y_0) lies on the circle at a 45-degree angle to the x-axis. This is when the tangent line makes a 45-degree angle with both axes, and consequently, the length of AB is shortest.

This means the function has a root, satisfying the condition of the problem. Thus, a=0 is included in the range. 2. **Case 0 < a leq frac{1}{2}:** - We first find the derivative of f(x), denoted as f'(x), to analyze the monotonicity of f(x): [ f'(x) = acos(ax) - acos(x) = a(cos(ax) - cos(x)). ] - Using the trigonometric identity for the difference of cosines, we get: [ f'(x) = -2asinleft(frac{(a+1)x}{2}right)sinleft(frac{(a-1)x}{2}right). ] - Since 0 < a leq frac{1}{2} and x in (0, 2pi), we find that sinleft(frac{(a-1)x}{2}right) < 0 and the sign of sinleft(frac{(a+1)x}{2}right) changes within the interval, affecting the monotonicity of f(x).

This is because the function values at specific points within the interval change signs, indicating the presence of a root. 4. **Case a < -frac{1}{2}:** - By considering varphi(a) = sin(ax) - asin(x) and varphi(-a) = -varphi(a), we observe that f(x) is an odd function with respect to a. This symmetry about the origin implies that if f(x) has roots for a > frac{1}{2}, it also has roots for a < -frac{1}{2}. 5. **Combining Cases:** - From the analysis above, we find that the function f(x) = sin(ax) - asin(x) has roots in the interval (0, 2pi) for a > frac{1}{2}, a < -frac{1}{2}, and a=0. Therefore, the range of real number a for which the function f(x) has a root in the interval (0, 2pi) is (-infty, -frac{1}{2}) cup (frac{1}{2}, +infty) cup {0}.

Let's consider the functions ( f(x) = arcsin x ) and ( g(x) = 2 arcsin frac{x}{sqrt{2}} ). 2.

Consider the expression ((4a - 3b)^2). Since the square of any real number is non-negative, we have: [ (4a - 3b)^2 geq 0 ] 3. Expanding ((4a - 3b)^2), we get: [ (4a - 3b)^2 = 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2 ] Therefore, [ 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2 geq 0 ] 4. Using the Pythagorean identity (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), we can rewrite the inequality: [ 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2 geq 0 ] 5. Notice that (25(a^2 + b^2) = 25c^2). We can compare this with the expanded form: [ 25(a^2 + b^2) = 25c^2 ] 6. Now, we need to show that: [ 25c^2 geq 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2 ] 7. Since (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), we can substitute (c^2) back into the inequality: [ 25c^2 geq 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2 ] 8. Dividing both sides by 25, we get: [ c^2 geq frac{16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2}{25} ] 9. To show that (3a + 4b leq 5c), we can use the fact that: [ (3a + 4b)^2 leq (5c)^2 ] 10. Expanding both sides, we get: [ 9a^2 + 24ab + 16b^2 leq 25c^2 ] 11. Since (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), we can substitute (c^2) back into the inequality: [ 9a^2 + 24ab + 16b^2 leq 25(a^2 + b^2) ] 12. This simplifies to: [ 9a^2 + 24ab + 16b^2 leq 25a^2 + 25b^2 ] 13. Rearranging terms, we get: [ 0 leq 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2 ] 14. This is true since ((4a - 3b)^2 geq 0). 15. Therefore, we have shown that: [ 3a + 4b leq 5c ] 16. Equality holds when ((4a - 3b)^2 = 0), which implies: [ 4a = 3b implies frac{a}{b} = frac{3}{4} ] 17. Using the Pythagorean theorem, if (a = 3k) and (b = 4k), then: [ c = sqrt{(3k)^2 + (4k)^2} = sqrt{9k^2 + 16k^2} = sqrt{25k^2} = 5k ] 18. Thus, equality holds when (a : b : c = 3 : 4 : 5).

The ratio of Toyota to Honda vehicles is T:H. According to the information given, 40% of the Toyota vehicles and 60% of the Honda vehicles were SUVs. This means that 0.4T of the Toyota vehicles and 0.6H of the Honda vehicles were SUVs. The total number of SUVs bought is the sum of Toyota SUVs and Honda SUVs, which is given as 52. Therefore, we can write the equation: 0.4T + 0.6H = 52 We need to find the ratio T:H, but we have only one equation and two unknowns. To find the ratio, we can express one variable in terms of the other using the equation above. Let's solve for T in terms of H: 0.4T = 52 - 0.6H T = (52 - 0.6H) / 0.4 T = 130 - 1.5H Now we have T expressed in terms of H. To find the ratio T:H, we can set H to any value that makes T a whole number since we're looking for a ratio, not the actual numbers of vehicles. Let's set H to 2 (as a trial value to make the math simpler): T = 130 - 1.5(2) T = 130 - 3 T = 127 Now we have T = 127 when H = 2. However, this doesn't give us a whole number ratio. Let's try another value for H that is a multiple of 10 (since 1.5H should be a whole number to make T a whole number). Let's set H to 20: T = 130 - 1.5(20) T = 130 - 30 T = 100 Now we have T = 100 when H = 20. This gives us a whole number ratio.

A regular hexagon is chosen because it satisfies the conditions optimally (as regular polygons are generally easy to work with, ensuring proper utilization of stick lengths). 3. **Verification of Regular Hexagon**: For a regular hexagon, each side length is equal. Thus, if we use all the matchsticks to form a hexagon, each side of the hexagon would be: [ frac{24 , mathrm{cm}}{6} = 4 , mathrm{cm} ] However, given each matchstick is only 2 , mathrm{cm}, this seems infeasible as described. Hence, another approach is necessary. 4. **Area and Shape Consideration**: Instead, consider other regular configurations like a square where sides may form a shape with appropriate area. Let's check plausibility for smaller polygon configurations. For simplification, reconsider a simpler configuration – could be triangulation or smaller subdivisions reasonable using existing match lengths. 5. **Evaluate for Triangle Formation**: Exploring smaller forms such as equilateral triangles, where total layout could better subdivide into areas like: [ text{Area of equilateral triangle side length } a, text{ is } frac{sqrt{3} a^2}{4} ] For side a =2 cm, typical triangle segmentation needs could better fitted collectively then hex to reach nearby required forms aggregately. # Conclusion From structured assessment steps, valid formation remains plausible while considering fundamental restrictions with original stick lengths causing no breaking.

Prove that all these lines pass through the same point. (This is also true for the case of internal tangency of the circles.)","completion":": Given: A line and a circle, along with all other circles that are tangent to both (externally or internally). For each case, consider a line through the points of tangency. We need to show that all of these lines pass through a single point. # Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Concept of Homothety:** - Two circles are said to be homothetic if there is a homothety (a kind of transformation that enlarges or reduces shapes while preserving their angles) that maps one circle onto the other. - The point of tangency between the two circles is called the homothety center. 2. **Tangent properties and homothety:** - A tangent to a circle at the point of tangency remains tangent when transformed under homothety. In particular, if we transform a tangent of one circle, it becomes a tangent of the second circle, and their tangency points are images of each other. 3. **Tangents to the given circles:** - Let's denote the given line as (L). Consider a circle (omega) tangent to (L) at point (P) and another given circle (C) at point (Q). - We draw the line through (P) and (Q), we denote it as the tangent line (T). 4. **Existence of Homotheties:** - There are two points (homothety centers) we need to consider: - The external homothety center, for homothety mapping (omega) onto (C) such that the circles are externally tangent. Let's denote this point (H_{text{ext}}). - The internal homothety center, for homothety mapping (omega) onto (C) such that the circles are internally tangent. Let's denote this point (H_{text{int}}). 5. **Characterization of the tangents through homothety centers:** - When (omega) and (L) maintain tangency as the tangency point moves, the tangent lines to (omega) that are parallel to (L) will pass through (H_{text{ext}}) in the case of external tangency. - When we consider internal tangency, similar logic applies and these lines will pass through (H_{text{int}}). 6. **Conclusion of the central intersection point(s):** - Therefore, given that the transformations result in tangent lines passing through the same homothety point, all tangents derived in this manner (from variable points of tangency) must intersect at (H_{text{ext}}) for the case of external tangency and (H_{text{int}}) for internal tangency. Thus, we have proven that all the lines through the points of tangency for tangents to (omega) and (C) indeed pass through a single specific point, depending on the nature (internal or external) of their tangency.

Assume without loss of generality that the vertices of triangle Delta ABC are labeled such that angle A < angle B < angle C, and let angle A = alpha. 3. We consider all possible triangles obtained by rotating Delta ABC around its circumcenter O with small angles theta such that theta < alpha. These triangles are congruent to T. 4. Each edge of these triangles will have a specific arrangement of colors. Since there are 1992 colors and each edge is covered with points in these 1992 colors, we can represent whether an edge contains points of a particular color with a table. 5. Construct a table to represent the presence of each color on the edges of the triangles formed by rotating Delta ABC around O.

Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows: [ k^{circ} + 2k^{circ} + 3k^{circ} = 180^{circ} ] Simplifying the equation: [ 6k^{circ} = 180^{circ} ] Dividing both sides by 6 to solve for k^{circ}: [ k^{circ} = frac{180^{circ}}{6} = 30^{circ} ] Now that we have the value of k^{circ}, we can find the measures of all angles in the triangle: - The smallest angle is k^{circ} = 30^{circ}. - The second angle is 2k^{circ} = 2 times 30^{circ} = 60^{circ}. - The largest angle is 3k^{circ} = 3 times 30^{circ} = 90^{circ}.

This means D H is perpendicular to the base ABC. 2. **Dropping Perpendiculars from the Apex:** Drop perpendiculars from vertex D to the sides of the base triangle ABC: - D M perpendicular to AB - D N perpendicular to BC - D K perpendicular to AC Thus, M, N, and K are the feet of these perpendiculars on AB, BC, and AC respectively. 3. **Analyzing Orthogonality:** Since D H is perpendicular to the plane ABC, the projections of the lines DM, DN, and DK onto the plane ABC will be perpendicular to the corresponding sides: - H M perp AB - H N perp BC - H K perp AC Therefore, DH, DNH, and DKH are the line angles created by the lateral faces of the pyramid with the base plane ABC. 4. **Equivalent Angles Condition:** According to the problem, the faces ABD, BCD, and ACD form equal angles with the plane ABC. Therefore, it follows that the angles: angle DMH = angle DNH = angle DKH Since we have right triangles DMH, DNH, and DKH with these equal acute angles, we can conclude, by the principle of congruence of right triangles (one leg and one acute angle being the same), that: MH = NH = KH 5. **Equal Distances from the Perpendicular Projections:** Since MH = NH = KH, point H is equidistant from the three sides AB, BC, and AC of the triangle ABC. 6. **Conclusion about the Point H:** The point H, being equidistant from the three sides of the triangle ABC, must either be the incenter (center of the circle inscribed within the triangle) or one of the excenters (centers of the circles touching one side of the triangle and the extensions of the other two sides).

First Proof Using the Extended Eisenstein Criterion 1. **Eisenstein Criterion Application**: - Suppose ( f(x) ) satisfies the extended Eisenstein criterion: - For a polynomial ( f(x) ), there exists a prime number ( p ) such that: - ( p ) divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient. - ( p^2 ) does not divide the constant term. - From this criterion, ( f(x) ) must have an irreducible factor of degree not less than ( n - 1 ). 2. **Irreducibility**: - Since ( f(x) ) adheres to the properties specified by the extended Eisenstein criterion and has no integral zeros, it must be irreducible. Second Solution with Analysis of Polynomial Value at Zero 1. **Assume Factorization**: - Suppose ( f(x) = g(x) h(x) ), where ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) are nonconstant polynomials with integer coefficients. 2. **Constant Term Analysis**: - Given ( |f(0)| = 3 ): - Either ( |g(0)| = 1 ) or ( |h(0)| = 1 ). - Without loss of generality, assume ( |g(0)| = 1 ). Hence, these roots ( g(x) ) at ( x=0 ). 3. **Product and Zero Analysis**: - Let ( g(x) = (x - alpha_{1})(x - alpha_{2}) cdots (x - alpha_{k}) ) for some ( k geq 1 ). This represents ( k ) roots of ( g(x) ). - Then ( |alpha_{1} alpha_{2} cdots alpha_{k}| = 1 ). 4. **Polynomials at -5**: - Given the polynomial identity at -5: - [alpha_{i}^{n-1} (alpha_{i} + 5) = -3] - Taking the product over all roots ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ): - [ |alpha_{1}^{n-1} (alpha_{1} + 5) cdots alpha_{k}^{n-1} (alpha_{k} + 5)| = |(-3)^k| ] - Simplifying, it follows: - [ |(alpha_{1} + 5)(alpha_{2} + 5) cdots (alpha_{k} + 5)| = 3^k ] - Since the polynomial ( f(x) ) is satisfied ( f(-5) = g(-5) h(-5) = 3 ): - The only possibility is deg ( g = k = 1 ). 5. **Contradiction**: - ( deg(g(x)) = 1 ) implies it must have one integral root, but since ( f(x) ) has no integral zeros this is impossible.

Plugging in ( y = 1 ), we get ( p_0(x, 1) = f(x, 1) - x = 0 ). This implies ( f(x, 1) = x ). 3. Since ( p_0(x, 1) - x = 0 ) and ( deg(p_0(x, 1) - x) leq deg_x f(x, y) < n ), the polynomial ( p_0(x, 1) - x ) must be the zero polynomial. Therefore, ( p_0(x, 1) = x ). 4. This implies that ( y - 1 mid y f(x, y) - x ). Therefore, ( y - 1 mid p_0(x, y) ). Hence, we can write ( p_0(x, y) = (y - 1) p_1(x, y) ) for some polynomial ( p_1 ). 5. Plugging in ( y = 2 ), we get ( p_1(x, 2) = 0 ) for all ( x = 1, 2, dots, n - 1 ). Since ( deg p_1(x, 2) < n - 1 ), ( p_1(x, 2) equiv 0 ). This shows that ( p_1(x, y) = (y - 2) p_2(x, y) ). 6. Continuing this process, we get: [ y p_0(x, y) - x = p_{n-1}(x, y) prod_{i=1}^{n-1} (y - i) ] 7. Due to the ( -x ) on the left-hand side, ( p_{n-1}(x, y) ) can't be constant. Hence, due to the degree condition, ( p_{n-1}(x, y) ) must be linear in ( x ). Comparing the constant coefficients in front of ( x ) on both sides implies that: [ p_{n-1}(x, y) = frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} x + p_n(y) ] for some linear polynomial ( p_n(y) ). 8.

To find ( f(0, 0) ), we need to compute the constant coefficient in front of ( y ) on the right-hand side, which is equal to ( frac{1}{n!} prod_{i=1}^{n-1} i = frac{1}{n} ).

Hence, the pair ((1,1)) is a solution. - Let's proceed with (a geq 2) and (b geq 2). 4. **Analyzing the General Case**: Given (a^{a^2} geq a^b = b^{a^2}), by lemma, we get three cases: 1. (b geq a^2) 2. (b = 2) and (a^2 = 3) 3. (b = 2) and (a^2 = 4) 5. **Case Analysis**: - (a^2 = 3) is impossible because there are no integers (a) such that (a^2 = 3). - Pair ((2, 2)) does not yield a solution as (2^2 = 4) is not equal to (2^{2^2} = 16). 6. **Exploring (b geq a^2)**: If (b geq a^2), then if (p) is a prime number, we can write (b cdot v_p(a) = a^2 cdot v_p(b)). Hence (v_p(a) leq v_p(b)), implying that (a) divides (b). Let's denote (b = ac). [ a^{ac} = (ac)^{a^2} ] This equivalence simplifies to: [ a^{ac} = a^{a^2} c^{a^2} ] It follows that: [ a^{a(c-1)} = c^{a^2} ] Which means (a^{c-1} = c) is an integer, thus (c - 1 geq 0). This implies: [ a^{c-1} geq (c-1)^a ] As in the lemma, this leads us to (c - 1 leq 2) or (c - 1 geq a). Consequently, (a mid c). 7. **Refinement**: Let (c = ad): [ a^{a(d-1)} = (ad)^a implies a^{a(d-1)} = a^a d^a implies a^{a(d-2)} = d ] This shows that (d leq 4). 8. **Checking Possible (d)**: - If (d = 2): - [ a^{a(2-1)} = d = 1 implies 1 = 0 quad (text{contradiction}) ] - If (d = 3): - [ a^{a(3-1)} = 3 implies a^a = 3 implies a = 3, quad b = 27 ] - Solution: ((3, 27)) - If (d = 4): - [ a^{a(4-1)} = 4 implies a^3 = 4 implies a = 2, quad b = 16 ] - Solution: ((2, 16)) # Conclusion: The pairs ((3, 27)) and ((2, 16)) are solutions: [ boxed{(3, 27), (2, 16)} ] The complete set of strictly positive integer pairs ((a, b)) satisfying (a^{b} = b^{a^2}) are ((1, 1)), ((2, 16)), and ((3, 27))."},{"prompt":"A certain amount of money is divided among Maya, Annie, and Saiji so that Maya receives half as much as Annie and Annie half as much as Saiji.

Given that (cos alpha = frac{1}{2}). We need to find the possible values of (alpha). The cosine function has the property that (cos theta = cos (2pi k pm theta) ) where (k) is any integer. 2.

First, let’s recall that (cos(theta)) is periodic with a period (2pi). This means: [ cos(alpha) = cosleft(pm frac{pi}{3} + 2 pi kright) = frac{1}{2}, ] and, [ cos(2alpha) = cosleft(pm frac{2 pi}{3} + 4 pi kright). ] For ( cos 2alpha) to be (frac{1}{2}), (pm frac{2 pi}{3} + 4 pi k) must be one of the angles where cosine equals (frac{1}{2}). However, we know that (cosleft(pm frac{2 pi}{3} + 4 pi kright)) actually equals (-frac{1}{2}) instead of (frac{1}{2}). 5. Since (cosleft(pm frac{2 pi}{3} + 4 pi kright) neq frac{1}{2}), there’s a contradiction here because (cos alpha) and (cos 2 alpha) cannot both equal (frac{1}{2}). 6. Consequently, the given equation (cos alpha = frac{1}{2}) does not hold for (2alpha) values derived from it. Therefore, in the second case, when trying to solve (2cosalpha = cos 2alpha), there are no solutions.

Let ( f(n) ) denote the number of heavy subsets of ( M ). 2. **Determine the number of heavy subsets with ( k ) elements:** To form a heavy subset with ( k ) elements, we need to choose ( k ) elements from the set ( {k, k+1, ldots, n} ).

On an island, there are knights, who always tell the truth, and liars, who always lie. During a celebration for the opening of the new football season, 50 football fans are seated around a round table: 25 fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and 25 fans of the \\"Super Lions\\". Each of them declared: \\"The fan to my right is a fan of the 'Super Eagles'.\\" Could it be that there are an equal number of liars among the fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and the fans of the \\"Super Lions\\"? : 1. Assume there are ( k ) liars among the fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and ( k ) liars among the fans of the \\"Super Lions\\". 2. Then, the total number of liars is ( 2k ). 3. Each fan claims that the fan to their right is a fan of the \\"Super Eagles\\". If this declaration is a lie, it means the fan to the right is actually a fan of the \\"Super Lions\\". Conversely, if the declaration is true, the fan to the right is genuinely a fan of the \\"Super Eagles\\". 4. If there are ( 2k ) liars, the statements \\"The fan to my right is a fan of the ‘Super Eagles’\\" are lies an even number of times, i.e., ( 2k ) times. 5. Therefore, the number of times the statement \\"The fan to my right is a fan of the ‘Super Eagles’\\" is false implies that there must be an even number of times this claim is false and therefore, according to the claim, an even number of \\"Super Lions\\" must appear twice consecutively. 6. However, recall the seating arrangement specifies exactly 25 fans from each team. If there were ( 2k ) fans representing an incorrect statement based on lies, this would imply that ( 2k ) is an even number representing inconsistencies around the table. 7. But since the fans are alternately seated and ( k ) is half the consistent fans which should account for fan types (Super Eagles and Super Lions) equally, its count would be odd versus evenly altering statements contrary to seating counts. 8. As there are 25 fans of each team (which is odd in summation for 50 and alternating roundly), such an arrangement would be impossible because, for every incorrect assertion (per fan seat adjacency) to be uniformly even-numbered (distributing knights and liars) contradicts the count variability. 9. Hence an equal number of liars among the fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and the fans of the \\"Super Lions\\" is incorrect based on logical seating criteria and consistent truth-lie parity distribution. **Conclusion:** Therefore, it is impossible to have an equal number of liars among the fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and the fans of the \\"Super Lions\\" sitting as described. boxed{text{no}}"},{"prompt":"Kyle has a newspaperdelivery route.

Since the sampling is stratified, we assume the proportion of male and female in the group to be the same as in the class.

This implies that points (B), (K), and (M) are collinear. - Since (triangle IMO) is isosceles, the angle (angle IMO = 30^circ). 3. **Calculation of Angles:** - The angle (angle OAJ) can be found using: [ angle OAJ = angle IAJ - angle IAO = angle CAJ - angle CAM = angle JAM ] This means that both (AJ) and (OJ) are bisectors of (triangle AOM). 4. **Bisectors and Angle Relationships:** - Since (AJ) and (OJ) are bisectors, (MJ) is also a bisector of (triangle AOM). - For any triangle, the angle between the bisectors can be expressed in terms of the third angle.

So, the total number of ways to pick any two shoes from 18 shoes is: [ C(18, 2) = frac{18!}{2!(18-2)!} = frac{18 times 17}{2 times 1} = 9 times 17 ] Now, we can set up the equation for the probability: [ P(text{matching pair}) = frac{9}{9 times 17} = frac{1}{17} ] The given probability is ( 0.058823529411764705 ), which is approximately ( frac{1}{17} ) (since ( frac{1}{17} approx 0.058823529411764705 )).

Thus, by the problem's condition, we have: [ x = frac{a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{k}}{k} ] Hence, the age of this female can be expressed in terms of the ages of male citizens, satisfying our goal for (n = 1). 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for any group of (n) female citizens, each female's age can be expressed as a linear combination of the male citizens' ages, i.e., [ x_j = c_{j1}a_{1} + c_{j2}a_{2} + cdots + c_{jm}a_{m} ] for some constants (c_{ji} geq 0) and (1 leq j leq n). 4. **Inductive Step:** We now consider the situation where there are (n+1) female citizens. Choose any one of them, say (A) with age (x_{A}), who knows (k) citizens. By the induction hypothesis, the age of each of the other (n) female citizens can be expressed as: [ x_i = c_{i1}a_{1} + c_{i2}a_{2} + cdots + c_{im}a_{m} + c_{ix}x_A, quad 1 leq i leq n ] where (c_{ij} geq 0) and (c_{i1} + c_{i2} + cdots + c_{im} + c_{ix} = 1), using the induction hypothesis. 5. **Summing the Ages of the Citizens Known by (A):** In this scenario, the sum of the ages of the (k) citizens known by (A) can be written as: [ text{Sum of ages} = k x_A = b_{1}a_{1} + b_{2}a_{2} + cdots + b_{m}a_{m} + b_{0}x_A ] where (b_{i} geq 0) and (b_{1} + b_{2} + cdots + b_{m} + b_{0} = k). Since (A) knows at least one male citizen who does not contribute to the coefficient of (x_A), we have (b_{0} leq k - 1). 6. **Solving for (x_A):** Rearrange the equation to solve for the age (x_A): [ k x_A - b_{0} x_A = b_{1}a_{1} + b_{2}a_{2} + cdots + b_{m}a_{m} ] [ x_A (k - b_{0}) = b_{1}a_{1} + b_{2}a_{2} + cdots + b_{m}a_{m} ] Hence, [ x_A = frac{b_{1}a_{1} + b_{2}a_{2} + cdots + b_{m}a_{m}}{k - b_{0}} ] This shows that (x_A) is still a linear combination of (a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{m}) with non-negative coefficients, preserving the induction hypothesis. # Conclusion: By mathematical induction, we have shown that the age of each female citizen in the city can indeed be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of the ages of the male citizens, with non-negative coefficients.

Therefore, the tangent line from ( P ) to the circle can be constructed using the geometric mean relationship: - Construct a right triangle where ( PA ) and ( PB ) are the legs and ( PC ) is the altitude from ( P ) to the tangent point on the circle. Thus, the tangent ( PT ) (where ( T ) is the point of tangency) has the length: [ PT = sqrt{PA cdot PB} ] Hence the tangent line can be drawn from ( P ) by constructing a right triangle with this relationship. Second Approach: 1. **Identify the given points and circle**: Let ( P ) be the given point external to the circle. 2. **Drawing secant and chords**: - Draw any line from point ( P ) that intersects the circle at two points, say ( A ) and ( B ). 3. **Find the midpoint of chord**: - Let ( M ) be the midpoint of chord ( AB ). 4. **Relationship with Thales' circle**: - The Thales' theorem states that if ( C ) is the midpoint of ( AB ), then ( M ) lies on a circle (Thales' circle) such that ( PM ) is perpendicular to ( AB ). 5. **Construct the Thales' circle**: - Draw the Thales' circle which has diameter ( AB ) and passes through ( M ). This is constructed because perpendicular from midpoint to a chord in a circle bisects the circle. 6. **Locate the center of Thales' circle**: - The center of this Thales’ circle is the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ). Draw the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) and find the intersection point with ( PM ). This will give the center of Thales' circle. 7. **Draw tangents**: - Using the Thales' circle, which intersects the main circle at ( T ) and constructs perpendiculars, you can locate the points of tangency, drawing the tangents from ( P ) to ( T ). Since constructing the Thales circle and locating tangents relies on perpendicularity and the properties of circles, it avoids using the circle’s center directly.

Let M be the midpoint of CE and N be the midpoint of AB: - M on CE - N on AB 2. K represents the midpoint of AC. Step 3: Volumes and Areas Calculation 1. To find the perpendicular distance, notice that S_{triangle OLC} finds the area of the triangle OLC: - OL = sqrt{5} (Distance calculated between midpoint points aligned with the right trapezoid grid) - D's distance to OLC is 4. 2.

For example, ( 11, 111, 1111, ldots ). 2. **Divisibility by 2 and 5:** - Numbers of this form end in '1', making them odd. Hence, they are not divisible by 2. - Numbers of this form do not end in '0' or '5'. Hence, they are not divisible by 5. Therefore, prime numbers 2 and 5 cannot be divisors of these numbers. 3. **General Prime ( p ):** Let ( p ) be a prime number different from 2 and 5. Consider the sequence of numbers: [ 1, 11, 111, ldots, 111 ldots 1 ] with the last number in the sequence represented by ( p+1 ) ones. 4. **Dirichlet's Principle (Pigeonhole Principle):** By Dirichlet's principle, among ( p+1 ) numbers, there exist at least two numbers that, when divided by ( p ), produce the same remainder. Let these numbers be represented by: - ( 111 ldots 1 ) with ( k ) ones, - ( 111 ldots 1 ) with ( k + l ) ones, where ( k, l ) are natural numbers. 5. **Difference of Numbers:** Consider the difference between these two numbers: [ 111 ldots 1 (k + l text{ ones}) - 111 ldots 1 (k text{ ones}) = 111 ldots 1000 ldots 0 ] The resulting number consists of ( l ) ones followed by ( k ) zeros. 6. **Divisibility by ( p ):** The number formed by ( l ) ones followed by ( k ) zeros, when divided by ( p ), has a remainder of 0. Thus, this number ( 111 ldots 1 (l text{ ones}) ) is divisible by ( p ). 7. **Conclusion:** Because of the above reasoning, any prime number ( p ) different from 2 and 5 can be a divisor of a number of the form ( 111 ldots 1 ).

Show that there exists a rectangle whose vertices are all the same color.","completion":"To prove that there exists a rectangle whose vertices are the same color in a two-colored plane, let's consider the two colors to be red and blue. To simplify our argumentation, we start with a rectangular grid of dimensions ( 7 times 3 ), where every point on the grid is either red or blue. 1. **First Column Analysis**: - Consider the first column of 7 points. Since there are only 2 colors (red and blue), by the pigeonhole principle, at least (lceil frac{7}{2} rceil = 4) points must be of the same color. Without loss of generality, let’s assume these are 4 blue points. 2. **Reduced Grid Consideration**: - Now, reduce the problem to a (4 times 3) grid. This is done by considering only the rows that contain the 4 blue points in the first column. Thus, every row in this smaller grid contains a point that is blue in the first column. 3. **Second Column Analysis**: - We now examine the points in the second column of this (4 times 3) grid. There are 4 points in this column, and again by the pigeonhole principle, at least (lceil frac{4}{2} rceil = 2) points must be the same color. Suppose we find 2 blue points in the second column. - If we find 2 blue points in the second column, we have a rectangle with vertices that share the same color (since the first two columns now form a rectangle with vertices (blue, blue, blue, blue)). 4. **Counter-Case (Second Column Analysis)**: - However, if this is not the case, at least (lceil frac{4}{2} rceil + 1 = 3) points in the second column must be red (since we already assumed that the second column does not have at least 2 blue points). 5. **Third Column Analysis**: - Lastly, we check the third column in the (4 times 3) grid. By the pigeonhole principle, at least (lceil frac{4}{2} rceil = 2) points must be the same color. Suppose these 2 points are also red. - If this is the case, we now consider the configuration formed by the three columns: - The second and third columns have at least 2 points each which share the same color (in this case red). Therefore, we will have a rectangular arrangement among these two columns with all-red vertices. **Conclusion**: - In either of the analyzed cases, we will always find a rectangle whose vertices are all the same color (either all blue or all red). This confirms that within any (7 times 3) grid colored in two colors, there exists a rectangle with all four vertices of the same color. Therefore, we conclude: [boxed{text{It is guaranteed that there exists a rectangle whose vertices are of the same color.}}]"},{"prompt":"Given the following propositions: (①) The function (y=cosleft(frac{2}{3}x+frac{pi}{2}right)) is an odd function; (②) The graph of the function (y=sin(2x+frac{pi}{3})) is symmetric about the point (left(frac{pi}{12},0right)); (③) If (alpha) and (beta) are angles in the first quadrant and (alpha < beta), then (tan alpha < tan beta); (④) (x=frac{pi}{8}) is a line of symmetry for the function (y=sin(2x+frac{5pi}{4})); Among these, the correct propositions are ______ (()Answer with numbers()).","completion":"Solution: (①) The function (y=cosleft(frac{2}{3}x+frac{pi}{2}right)=-sinfrac{2}{3}x) is an odd function, so proposition (①) is correct; (②) When (x=frac{pi}{12}), the function (y=sinleft(2timesfrac{pi}{12}+frac{pi}{3}right)=1), (therefore) the proposition that the graph of the function (y=sin(2x+frac{pi}{3})) is symmetric about the point (left(frac{pi}{12},0right)) is incorrect, so proposition (②) is incorrect; (③) If (alpha) and (beta) are angles in the first quadrant and (alpha < beta), then (tan alpha < tan beta) is incorrect.

Since the height of the prism is given as 2, the diagonal connecting the apexes of the two square bases has length 2.

Therefore, we have the diagonal of the square base and the height of the prism forming a right-angled triangle with the space diagonal (diameter of the sphere) as the hypotenuse.

Then there exists exactly one vertex ( w ), which we call the *center*, in the intersection ( P_x cap P_y cap P_z ), where the paths are taken to contain both vertices and edges. Furthermore, we have ( d_T(x,y) = d_T(x,w) + d_T(w,y) ) and similarly for the other pairs. 3. **Proof of Lemma**: - Consider the intersection of ( P_y cap P_z ). Both ( P_y ) and ( P_z ) are paths starting from ( x ), which is a leaf. At some point, they diverge and do not rejoin since ( T ) is a tree. - If ( w ) is the last vertex the paths share in common, then ( P_y cap P_z ) is a path from ( x ) to ( w ); let it be ( Q_x ). Similarly, define ( Q_y ) and ( Q_z ). - Notice that ( Q_x cap Q_y ), ( Q_y cap Q_z ), and ( Q_z cap Q_x ) are all equal to ( {w} ). - Furthermore, since a path from ( x ) to ( y ) is ( Q_x cup Q_y ) and there is only one such path, ( P_z = Q_x cup Q_y ) and similarly for ( P_y ) and ( P_x ). So, [ P_x cap P_y cap P_z = Q_x cap Q_y cap Q_z = {w}. ] - Finally, from ( P_z = Q_x cup Q_y ), we deduce ( d_T(x,y) = d_T(x,w) + d_T(w,y) ), and similarly for the other pairs. (blacksquare) 4. **Application of Lemma**: Notice that for any leaf ( x ) and non-leaf ( w ), we can find ( y ) and ( z ) such that ( w ) is the center of ( x, y, z ). Since ( w ) is a non-leaf, it has degree at least 3, so deleting it creates at least three connected components. Choose three vertices from different components with one of them being ( x ); this gives us our ( x, y, z ) with ( w ) as the center. 5. **Distance Preservation**: Next, we show that if ( w ) is a non-leaf vertex and the center of ( x, y, z ) in ( S ), and ( W ) is the center of ( f(x), f(y), f(z) ) in ( T ), then ( d_S(x,w) = d_T(f(x),W) ) and similarly for ( y ) and ( z ). - Define ( a = d(y,z) ), ( b = d(z,x) ), and ( c = d(x,y) ). From the lemma, we know there exist positive ( a', b', c' ) with ( a = b' + c' ), ( b = c' + a' ), and ( c = a' + b' ); such a representation is unique. - Let ( a'' = d_T(f(x), W) ), ( b'' = d_T(f(y), W) ), and ( c'' = d_T(f(z), W) ). Since ( W ) is the center of ( f(x), f(y), f(z) ), we have ( b'' + c'' = d_T(f(y),f(z)) = d_S(y,z) = a ). Similarly, ( c'' + a'' = b ) and ( a'' + b'' = c ). Therefore, ( a' = a'' ), ( b' = b'' ), and ( c' = c'' ). Then ( d_S(x,w) = a' = a'' = d_T(f(x), W) ), as desired. 6. **Define the Function ( g )**: - For a leaf ( v in S ), set ( g(v) = f(v) ). - For ( w ) a non-leaf vertex of ( S ), choose ( x, y, z ) with ( w ) as the center. Define ( g(w) ) as the center of ( f(x), f(y), f(z) ). By the previous paragraph, this is well-defined. 7. **Distance Preservation for All Vertices**: All that is left to show is that ( d_S(u,v) = d_T(g(u),g(v)) ) for all ( u, v in S ). - Delete ( u ) from ( S ) and choose two leaves ( x_u, y_u ) that are not in the same component as ( v ) or each other. Likewise, choose ( x_v, y_v ). - Then ( u ) is the center of ( x_u, x_v, y_u ) and ( v ) is the center of ( x_u, x_v, y_v ), with the path from ( x_u ) to ( x_v ) passing through ( u ) and ( v ) in that order. Therefore, [ d_S(x_u,v) - d_S(x_u,u) = d_S(u,v) quad (1). ] - In ( T ), ( g(u) ) is the center of ( g(x_u), g(x_v), g(y_u) ) and ( g(v) ) is the center of ( g(x_u), g(x_v), g(y_v) ), so ( g(u), g(v) ) are still on the path between ( g(x_u) ) and ( g(x_v) ). - Since ( d_T(g(x_u), g(u)) = d_S(x_u,u) < d_S(x_u,v) = d_T(g(x_u), g(v)) ), ( g(u) ) is on the path between ( g(x_u) ) and ( g(v) ). Therefore, [ d_T(g(x_u), g(v)) - d_T(g(x_u), g(u)) = d_T(g(u), g(v)). ] - Combining this with (1) shows ( d_S(u,v) = d_T(g(u), g(v)) ) as desired.

Substituting these identities into the expression: [ frac{2sin alpha cos alpha - cos^2 alpha}{1 + (2cos^2 alpha - 1)} = frac{2sin alpha cos alpha - cos^2 alpha}{2cos^2 alpha} ] This simplifies further to: [ frac{2sin alpha cos alpha}{2cos^2 alpha} - frac{cos^2 alpha}{2cos^2 alpha} = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} - frac{1}{2} ] Recalling that tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} and substituting tan alpha = 2: [ tan alpha - frac{1}{2} = 2 - frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2} ] Thus, for part (II), the value is: [ boxed{frac{3}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let ( a_{0} = 1994 ).

Begin by establishing the given initial value and recurrence relation: [ a_0 = 1994, quad a_{n+1} = frac{a_n^2}{a_n + 1} ] 2. Observe that for any positive integer (n), since (a_0 > 0), we can inductively show that (a_n > 0): [ a_{n+1} = frac{a_n^2}{a_n + 1} > 0 ] Therefore, (a_n > 0) for all (n). 3. Next, consider the difference: [ a_n - a_{n+1} = a_n - frac{a_n^2}{a_n + 1} = frac{a_n(a_n + 1) - a_n^2}{a_n + 1} = frac{a_n}{a_n + 1} > 0 ] This shows that the sequence ( {a_n} ) is strictly decreasing: [ a_0 > a_1 > a_2 > cdots > a_n > cdots ] 4. When ( n ) is a non-negative integer, express (a_n) in terms of a summation involving previous terms: [ a_n = a_0 - n + left(frac{1}{a_0 + 1} + frac{1}{a_1 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{n-1} + 1}right) ] Note that each term (frac{1}{a_k + 1} > 0). 5. If we bound (1 leq n leq frac{1}{2}(a_0 + 2)), analyze this inequality: [ 1 leq n leq frac{1996}{2} = 998 ] Given that (1 leq n leq 998), apply this bound to our problem conditions. 6. To further bound the summation from step 4: [ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{1}{a_k + 1} leq sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{1}{a_{n-1} + 1} = frac{n}{a_{n-1} + 1} leq frac{n}{a_0 - n + 2} ] Since (frac{n}{a_0 - n + 2} < 1), we deduce: [ a_0 - n < a_n < a_0 - n + 1 ] 7. Hence, the greatest integer less than or equal to (a_n) is: [ [a_n] = a_0 - n ] **Conclusion:** When (a_0 = 1994) and (1 leq n leq 998), the integer value (1994 - n) corresponds to the greatest integer less than or equal to (a_n).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 8, 16, and 12 is 48.

Consider the collection ( mathcal{S} ) of pairs ( (X, g) ) where ( X ) is an open set such that ( mathbb{C} setminus A subset X subset mathbb{C} ) and ( g ) is an analytic extension of ( f ) to ( X ) with ( |g(z)| leq M ) for all ( z in X ). 3. **Ordering the collection ( mathcal{S} ):** We order the collection ( mathcal{S} ) by defining ( (X_1, g_1) leq (X_2, g_2) ) if ( X_1 subset X_2 ) and ( g_1(z) = g_2(z) ) for all ( z in X_1 ). 4. **Applying Zorn's Lemma:** If ( {(X_i, g_i)} ) is a chain in ( mathcal{S} ), then ( (cup_{i} X_i, g) ) where ( g(z) = g_i(z) ) if ( z in X_i ), is an upper bound of the chain.

If the person thinks they are reliable, they believe they are sane. Conversely, if they think they are unreliable, they believe they are not sane. 3. **Examining Possible Scenarios:** - **Scenario 1: The interlocutor is a sane human.** - A sane human knows they are sane. - Hence, if asked the question \\"Do you think you are reliable?\\", the response will be \\"yes\\". - **Scenario 2: The interlocutor is an insane human.** - An insane human does not recognize their insanity. - When asked \\"Do you think you are reliable?\\", the answer will typically be \\"no\\". - **Scenario 3: The interlocutor is a sane vampire.** - Suppose we assume a sane vampire behaves the same way as a sane human in terms of self-perception. - Therefore, a sane vampire would respond \\"yes\\" when asked if they think they are reliable. - **Scenario 4: The interlocutor is an insane vampire.** - An insane vampire does not recognize their insanity. - Hence, they would respond \\"no\\" to the question about reliability. 4. **Conclusion Based on Responses:** Based on the analysis of the scenarios: - If the answer received is \\"yes,\\" it indicates that the interlocutor is sane, but it does not differentiate between a human and a vampire. - If the answer received is \\"no,\\" it indicates that the interlocutor is insane, and again, it does not differentiate between a human and a vampire. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"do you think you are reliable?\\" allows us to establish the mental state of the interlocutor (whether they are sane or insane) but does not help in determining if the interlocutor is a human or a vampire.

Hence, one corner of the rectangle, denoted as ( P ), lies in the first quadrant with coordinates ( left( frac{a}{2}, frac{b}{2} right) ). 3. **Relationship of the Corner Coordinates**: - Given that the area of the rectangle is ( T ) (a constant), we can express this as: [ a cdot b = T ] The coordinates of ( P ) are derived by halving ( a ) and ( b ). Therefore, the coordinates ( left( frac{a}{2}, frac{b}{2} right) ) must satisfy: [ left( frac{a}{2} right) cdot left( frac{b}{2} right) = frac{T}{4} ] 4. **Identifying the Hyperbolic Path**: - Thus, the point ( P ) lies on the hyperbola defined by: [ xy = frac{T}{4} ] This reveals that one branch of the hyperbola represents all points ( P ) corresponding to one corner of rectangles centered at ( O ). 5. **Symmetry and Opposing Corners**: - The opposing corner to ( P ) will reflect across the origin, lying on the other branch of the same hyperbola. 6. **Considering Remaining Corners**: - The other two corners of the rectangle will similarly lie on coordinates whose product is the negative equivalent of ( frac{T}{4} ): [ xy = -frac{T}{4} ] - This corresponds to a second hyperbola. 7. **Enclosing the Region**: - Consequently, the located points ( P ) and symmetric counterparts fall within the branches of the hyperbolas ( xy = frac{T}{4} ) and ( xy = -frac{T}{4} ), extending infinitely. 8. **Conclusion**: - Since any point ( S ) in the region can be considered part of a rectangle's perimeter (with area ( T )), the rectangles with sides producing these points collectively blacken the paper along the regions defined by these hyperbolas. Hence, the shaded region is the entire set of points encompassed by the combined regions of the hyperbolas: [ xy = frac{T}{4} text{ and } xy = -frac{T}{4} ] **Conclusion**: Thus, the paper will be blackened along the regions of the two hyperbolas: [ boxed{xy = frac{T}{4} text{ and } xy = -frac{T}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the side lengths of an acuteangled triangle are 1, 3, and a, what is the range of values for a?

The total amount spent on each type can be represented as the product of the number of backpacks purchased and the unit price for each type.

That is, [ |CM|^2 = |CA| cdot |CB|. ] 3. **Defining the Circle for Center Locus**: Point (M) lies on a circle centered at (C) with radius (sqrt{|CA| cdot |CB|}). Therefore, the centers of the spheres must lie in the circular region centered at (C) with radius (|CM|). 4. **Cylinder and Plane Intersection**: To include all points where the centers of such spheres can exist, note that each center must also lay on the plane that is passing through the midpoint of the segment (AB) and is perpendicular to (AB). Let this plane be (P). 5. **Formulating the Geometric Shape**: Considering the two requirements: - The center (O) of the sphere must be at a distance (|CM|) from point (C), forming a cylindrical surface around line (AB). - The center (O) must also lie on plane (P) perpendicular to (AB). The intersection of this cylinder with the plane (P) forms an ellipse. **Conclusion**: Thus, the geometric locus of the centers of the spheres that pass through points (A) and (B) and touch the given plane is the line of intersection of the cylindrical surface with the perpendicular plane, which is an ellipse.

Claim 2: Consider the homothety (mathcal{H}_1) with center at (D) which sends (omega_1) to (gamma_1), and homothety (mathcal{H}_2) with center at (C) which sends (omega_2) to (gamma_2). (mathcal{H}_1) and (mathcal{H}_2) have the same ratio. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_28_c21e1fe3d80c53dc08c8g-18.jpg?height=902&width=897&top_left_y=177&top_left_x=268) **Proof:** Let (J_1, J_2) be the centers of (gamma_1, gamma_2), and let (gamma_1, gamma_2) touch (odot(ABCD)) at (T_1, T_2) respectively. We know that (J_1) lies on the bisector of (angle ADB), and (J_2) lies on the bisector of (angle ACB). Thus, lines (D-I_1-J_1) and (C-I_2-J_1) intersect at (Q), the midpoint of an arc (AB) of (odot(ABCD)) which doesn’t contain (C) and (D). We also know that (Q) is the center of (odot(AI_1I_2B)). It's a well-known property of the mixtilinear incircle that (T_1I_1) passes through (P), the midpoint of arc (AB) of (odot(ABCD)) which contains (C) and (D). The same holds for (T_2I_2). Let (O) be the center of (odot(ABCD)). We know that (O, J_1, T_1) are collinear, and that (O) is the midpoint of (PQ). Let the line passing through (J_1) parallel to (PT_1) intersect (PQ) at (R). Then (T_1J_1RP) is an isosceles trapezoid, hence (T_1J_1 = PR). On the other hand, from (RJ_1 parallel PI_1), we have that: [ frac{I_1J_1}{J_1T_1} = frac{I_1J_1}{PR} = frac{QI_1}{QP}. ] Analogously, we can prove that: [ frac{I_2J_2}{J_2T_2} = frac{QI_2}{QP}. ] Because (QI_1 = QI_2), we can conclude that: [ frac{I_1J_1}{J_1T_1} = frac{I_2J_2}{J_2T_2} = k. ] Let (r_1, r_2, rho_1, rho_2) be radii of circles (omega_1, omega_2, gamma_1, gamma_2) respectively. We know that the ratio of (mathcal{H}_1) is (frac{r_1}{rho_1}), and the ratio of (mathcal{H}_2) is (frac{r_2}{rho_2}). Also, we have: [ DI_1 = frac{r_1}{sinfrac{angle ADB}{2}}, quad DJ_1 = frac{rho_1}{sinfrac{angle ADB}{2}}. ] We know that: [ k = frac{I_1J_1}{J_1T_1} = frac{DJ_1 - DI_1}{rho_1} = frac{frac{rho_1 - r_1}{sin angle ADB}}{rho_1} ] which simplifies to: [ frac{r_1}{rho_1} = 1 - k cdot sin frac{angle ADB}{2}. ] Analogously, we can get: [ frac{r_2}{rho_2} = 1 - k cdot sin frac{angle ACB}{2}. ] Therefore, as (angle ADB = angle ACB), [ frac{r_1}{rho_1} = frac{r_2}{rho_2}. ] Claim 3: (t parallel ell) ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_28_c21e1fe3d80c53dc08c8g-18.jpg?height=709&width=1060&top_left_y=2007&top_left_x=181) **Proof:** Let (ell) touch (omega_1) and (omega_2) at (X_1) and (X_2) respectively. Let (Y_1) and (Y_2) be points on segments (DX_1) and (CX_2) respectively, such that (I_1X_1 parallel J_1Y_1) and (I_2X_2 parallel J_2Y_2). From (frac{DI_1}{DJ_1} = frac{r_1}{rho_1}) and (I_1X_1 parallel J_1Y_1), we have that (J_1Y_1 = rho_1). Therefore, (Y_1) lies on (gamma_1). Analogously, (Y_2) lies on (gamma_2). We know that: [ frac{DX_1}{DY_1} = frac{r_1}{rho_1} = frac{r_2}{rho_2} = frac{DX_2}{DY_2}. ] This means that because (CD parallel X_1Y_1), we have: [ CD parallel X_1X_2 parallel Y_1Y_2. ] Now, from (I_1X_1 parallel J_1Y_1), we have (I_1X_1 perp Y_1Y_2). So, (Y_1Y_2) is tangent to (gamma_1). Analogously, (Y_1Y_2) is tangent to (gamma_2). Therefore, line (Y_1Y_2) coincides with (t). Connection to Main Problem: Now let's conclude why the original problem follows from our main lemma. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_28_c21e1fe3d80c53dc08c8g-19.jpg?height=842&width=1054&top_left_y=550&top_left_x=181) We know that (CE) is tangent to the mixtilinear incircle of the triangle (ADF) and is parallel to (AB). From our main lemma, we can conclude that (CE) has to be tangent to the mixtilinear incircle of the triangle (BDF) as well because there exists a unique tangent line to the mixtilinear incircle of the triangle (ADF) which is parallel to (AB) and closer to (AB) than the center of that circle. Thus, there exists a circle tangent to (BD), (BF), (CE), and (tau).

According to the given information: - 80% are technicians, so there are 80 technicians. - 20% are non-technicians, so there are 20 non-technicians. Now, out of these: - 80% of the technicians are permanent. So, 80% of 80 technicians = 0.80 * 80 = 64 technicians are permanent. - 20% of the non-technicians are permanent. So, 20% of 20 non-technicians = 0.20 * 20 = 4 non-technicians are permanent. Therefore, the total number of permanent employees is 64 (technicians) + 4 (non-technicians) = 68. Since the total number of workers is 100, the number of temporary workers would be the total workers minus the permanent workers: 100 - 68 = 32 temporary workers.

In order for 900x to be a multiple of 1152, the prime factorization of 900x must include the entire prime factorization of 1152. Since the prime factorization of 1152 has five more 2's than the prime factorization of 900, and the same number of 3's, we know that the prime factorization of x must include at least five 2's. So, the smallest possible x is 2^5 = boxed{32}.

If not, there exists a red point ( R ) not on ( (BV) ), forming a non-collinear triangle ( BVR ). 3. **Applying Reasoning**: - Let ( R ) be any red point, which must be aligned with ( B ) and ( V ). - Applying the previous reasoning to the line ( (RV) ), all blue points must lie on the line ( (RV) ). - Similarly, all points not on the line passing through ( B, R, ) and ( V ) must be green. 4. **Constructing a Triangle**: - We can construct a triangle with vertices ( B ) and ( R ), and a point ( G ) which is green and not on ( (BV) ). - This contradicts our hypothesis and shows the existence of a non-collinear triangle with vertices of three different colors. 5. **Orthocenter Method**: - Consider the orthocenter ( H ) of a triangle ( BVR ) where ( B ) is blue, ( V ) is green, and ( R ) is red. - Let ( H_B ), ( H_V ), and ( H_R ) be the feet of the perpendiculars from ( B ), ( V ), and ( R ) respectively. - These lines are concurrent at ( H ). 6. **Color Analysis**: - If ( H_B ) is not blue, then one of the triangles ( B H_B R ) or ( B H_B V ) is a right triangle with vertices of three different colors. - Repeat this for ( H_V ) and ( H_R ). 7. **Final Conclusion**: - In any case, we find a right triangle with vertices of different colors, contradicting the initial assumption. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"While playing a video game Victor lost some lives.

However, since we are looking for P(X geqslant 1), which includes all values greater than 1, this probability is not directly symmetrical to P(-3leqslant X leqslant -1)=0.4. Considering the properties of the normal distribution, the probability of X being in the interval (-infty, -1] is 0.5 because -1 is the mean of the distribution.

Player B's strategy is key to the game. Player B must place his circles in such a way that he can ensure that Player A never achieves the winning condition (i.e., an edge with both ends having the same color). 6. Player B can achieve this by applying the following strategy: **Mirror Placement Strategy** - Each time Player A places a circle on a vertex ( v_i ) of the cube, Player B places a circle of the same color on the vertex ( v_{j} ) which is directly opposite ( v_i ) relative to the cube's center. 7. To elaborate, the cube is symmetrical, and every vertex ( v_i ) has a corresponding opposite vertex ( v_{j} ). By mirrored placement: - When Player A places the red circle on vertex ( v_1 ), Player B places the red circle on vertex ( v_2 ) directly opposite ( v_1 ). - This mirroring continues for all turns taken by both players. 8. Why does this strategy ensure Player B’s win? - Any edge of the cube will connect a vertex and its neighbor. - If Player B places circles on the vertices opposite to Player A's placements, then each vertex's neighbor will always have a circle of a different color placed by Player B. Thus, there will not be any pair of vertices connected by an edge having the same color. 9. By using this mirroring strategy, Player B ensures that every time Player A places a colored circle on one vertex, the direct opposite vertex gets the same color circle from Player B, ensuring that no edge will have endpoints with circles of the same color, thus preventing Player A from winning. # Conclusion: Player B has a winning strategy by always placing the same colored circle on the vertex directly opposite to the one chosen by Player A.

We know the volume (V) is 270 m³, so we can plug in the values we have and solve for h (the width of the pool): 270 m³ = (h/2) * (1 m + 4 m) * 12 m Now, let's solve for h: 270 m³ = (h/2) * 5 m * 12 m 270 m³ = (5h/2) * 12 m 270 m³ = 5h * 6 m 270 m³ = 30h m² Now, divide both sides by 30 to isolate h: h = 270 m³ / 30 m² h = 9 m So, the width of the swimming pool is boxed{9} meters."},{"prompt":"w many triangles are there whose side lengths are all integers, and one side length is 3 (which is not the shortest side)?","completion":"Let's consider the properties of triangle side lengths.

Given that one side length is 3 and it is not the shortest side, we need to find sets of three integers that satisfy these conditions. Let's investigate the cases: 1. When 3 is the longest side, the possible triangles are: - (1, 3, 3): This does not form a triangle because ( 1 + 3 leq 3 ). - (2, 3, 3): This forms an isosceles triangle because ( 2 + 3 > 3 ). - (2, 2, 3): This does not form a triangle because ( 2 + 2 = 3 ). 2.

For any edge, the sum of the numbers at its endpoints must be an integer in the range from the smallest possible sum (which is 1 + 2 = 3) to the largest possible sum (which is 7 + 8 = 15). Therefore, the possible sums are: [ {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}. ] 3. **Count the Sums**: There are 13 possible sums but only 12 edges. So, if all edge sums were different, exactly one of the possible sums would not appear among the edge sums. 4. **Analyze Missing Sum Possibilities**: We can analyze scenarios by assuming that each sum k is the one missing, one after another. Let's examine a few critical scenarios to see if we can arrive at a contradiction: - If k = 3 is missing: The sum 3 can only be formed by the numbers 1+2. - So, vertices 1 and 2 would have to be on distinct vertices. - This restricts the placement of other numbers substantially. - If k = 4 is missing: The sum 4 can be formed by 1+3 or 2+2, but since distinct vertex conditions are there: - Vertices 1 and 3 plus other restrictions apply. - Similarly, if sums 5, 6, or any other permissible sum were missing, similar led to analysis could follow: - 5 = 1+4 or 2+3, - 6 = 1+5 or 2+4, etc., each leading to contradictions in assignment consistent with the assumption that each of these constraints applies sequentially. 5. **Find a General Contradiction**: Given that each distinct sum of distances and placements becomes rapidly constrained, it shows by application of the pigeonhole principle that some sums must indeed be repeated: - All 12 sums distinct would imply perfect distributions of sums but in the constrained vertices form, leads directly to contradiction in attempts. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the assumption that all 12 edges have different sums is false.

To prove that if the sum of the areas of the \\"external\\" curvilinear triangles minus the area of the \\"internal\\" curvilinear triangle results in twice the area of triangle ( Delta ABC ). 1. **Denote areas:** Let ( x, y, z ), and ( u ) represent the areas of the curvilinear triangles. Here, ( u ) refers to the area of the \\"internal\\" curvilinear triangle. Let ( a, b, c, d, e, ) and ( f ) denote the areas of the circular segments cut off by the sides of the triangle ( ABC ). Let ( p, q, ) and ( r ) be the areas of the parts of triangle ( ABC ) that lie outside the internal curvilinear triangle. 2. **Set up area relationships (using notation from the given figure 3.15):** [ x + (a+b) = u + p + q + (c+f), ] [ y + (c+d) = u + q + r + (e+b), ] [ z + (e+f) = u + r + p + (a+d). ] 3. **Sum these equations:** Add the three equations to get: [ (x + a + b) + (y + c + d) + (z + e + f) = (u + p + q + c + f) + (u + q + r + e + b) + (u + r + p + a + d). ] 4. **Simplify the summed equation:** [ x + y + z + (a+b+c+d+e+f) = 3u + 2(p+q+r) + (a+b+c+d+e+f). ] Notice that ( a+b+c+d+e+f ) appears on both sides and cancels out: [ x + y + z = 3u + 2(p + q + r). ] 5. **Utilize area properties:** The sum of the areas of ( p, q, ) and ( r ) is exactly the area of ( Delta ABC ) because ( p, q, ) and ( r ) are the regions in ( Delta ABC ) outside the internal curvilinear triangle. 6. **Conclude by organizing the equation:** [ x + y + z = 2(text{Area of} , Delta ABC) + u. ] Since the goal is to determine twice the area of triangle ( Delta ABC ) from the sum of the external curvilinear triangles minus the internal curvilinear triangle: [ (x + y + z) - u = 2(text{Area of} , Delta ABC). ] **Conclusion:** Therefore, twice the area of ( Delta ABC ) is derived as follows: [ boxed{2(text{Area of} , Delta ABC)}. ]"},{"prompt":"Given an arithmetic sequence ({a_{n}}) with a common difference of 2 and all terms being integers, if the sum of all its terms is 2016, how many such sequences exist?","completion":"1.

Now draw another 40° angle on the opposite side of line (BC) using the same technique, producing another line (CD). By summing the angles, we notice that: [ angle ABC = 40^circ + 40^circ = 80^circ ] b) Constructing a (160^circ) angle: To construct a (160^circ) angle, first, we recognize it is the supplementary angle to a 20° angle (since (160^circ = 180^circ - 20^circ)): 1.

To do this (step-by-step bisecting): 1. Place the vertex of the set-square on the point of line (AB). 2. Using a compass, place the point on (B) and draw an arc that intersects both sides (say at points (P) and (Q)). 3. With the compass at (P) and keeping the same arc length, draw another arc within the interior of (angle ABC). 4. Similarly, using the compass at (Q) with the same arc length, draw an arc intersecting the first interior arc. 5. Label the intersection point of these two arcs as (R).

The measure of this arc is equal to the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc: [ overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5 A_6 A_7} = 360^circ - overarc{A_1 A_2} ] where overarc{A_2} = 180^circ as the center is within the heptagon, making the intercepted arcs summing up to 360^circ. 4. **Summing the angles:** By using the inscribed angle theorem and accounting for all such intercepted arcs for angle A_1, angle A_3, and angle A_5, the total intercepted subsequent arcs can aforementioned as follows: [ angle A_1 + angle A_3 + angle A_5 = frac{1}{2} left( (360^circ - overarc{A_7 A_1 A_2}) + (360^circ - overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4}) + (360^circ - overarc{A_4 A_5 A_6}) right) ] 5. **Evaluating the sums:** Simplify the summation inside the parenthesis: [ (360^circ - overarc{A_7 A_1 A_2}) + (360^circ - overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4}) + (360^circ - overarc{A_4 A_5 A_6}) = 1080^circ - (overarc{A_7 A_1 A_2} + overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4} + overarc{A_4 A_5 A_6}) ] Since combining any three internal arcs covered less than four meshes, thus we assert: [ overarc{A_7 A_1 A_2} + overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4} + overarc{A_4 A_5 A_6} geq 360^circ ] 6. **Final calculation:** Having such arcs converging all vertices resolving each arc itself lesser than 360^circ: [ angle A_1 + angle A_3 + angle A_5 < frac{1}{2} (1080^circ - 360^circ) ] [ = frac{1}{2} times 720^circ = 360^circ + 90^circ = 450^circ ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{angle A_1 + angle A_3 + angle A_5 < 450^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a function f(x), if there exists x_0 in its domain such that f(x_0) = f(x_0) holds, then x_0 is called a local symmetry point of the function f(x).

From the given statements and the geometric setup, we use: [ OP^2 = AP^2 + AO^2 - 2AO cdot AP cos angle OAP ] In a triangle, using properties of the circumcircle, we have: [ OP = 2R cos B cos C ] because P lies directly above BC from A, hence vertical opposite angle properties apply. 4. **Standardizing both OP^2 and CP^2:** Using properties of right-angled triangles and orthogonality: [ OP^2 = 4R^2 left( frac{1}{4} - sin B cos B sin C cos C right) ] By symmetry, considering C projections, CP aligns with: [ CP^2 = 4R^2 sin^2 A ] 5. **Combining results:** To prove OP^2 - CP^2 > 0, we evaluate: [ OP^2 - CP^2 = 4R^2 left( frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{2} sin^2 A + frac{1}{2} sin A cdot sin (C - B) right) ] 6. **Inequality proof:** Given angle BCA geq angle ABC + 30^{circ} implies sin (C - B) geq 1/2 (as sin (C - B) positive and acute within a triangle constraint), to finally conclude: [ therefore OP^2 - CP^2 > 0 ] implying OP > CP.

If Nathaniel goes first, determine the probability that he ends up winning.","completion":"To solve this problem, first note that the rolling of a fair six-sided die creates different states based on the sum modulo 7. We denote by x_k the probability that the current player, say Player A, will eventually win when the tally at the beginning of his turn is k pmod{7}. Since the dice has 6 sides, there are 6 possibilities for each roll. 1. **Formulation of the Win Probability:** When it's Player A's turn and the tally is k pmod{7}: - Player A wins immediately if k equiv 0 pmod{7}, since any multiple of 7 means Player A wins. - If k notequiv 0 pmod{7}, then the tally changes to (k, k+1, k+2, k+3, k+4, k+5, k+6 pmod{7}). The win condition for Player A now converts into a probability calculation: - Player A has a frac{1}{6} chance to roll each of the die's faces. 2. **Constructing the Equation:** The new tally states after Player A's roll can range from ( k+1 ) to ( k+6 ) modulo 7.
