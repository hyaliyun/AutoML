But this harmony endures only up to a certain point of capitalist development. When capitalist devel-opment has reached a certain level, the interests of the bourgeoisie, as a class, and the needs of economic progress [i.e. workers’ interests] begin to clash even in the capitalist sense. (Luxemburg, 2008/1938: 61) Capitalist accumulation always happens in a specific geographical context — within a city and a nation. So there is a constant flow of capital across cities, provinces, and nations. To obtain some concessions, trade unions have had to often support — or they have to make sure they do not significantly undermine the conditions for — national- and regional-level capitalist accumulation. The fact that capitalist investment can move across state’s territorial jurisdictions at national and sub-national scales and that state institutions at these scales are (increasingly) competing with one another for capital imposes a limit on workers’ receiving significant concessions in particular places/countries.48 During normal times, the imperative of capitalist accumulation sets a limit on what the state can do for workers. When we consider the geographical mobility as an aspect of accumulation, we see that it also imposes some ‘constraint’, at a concrete level, on what the state can do for workers. The other aspect of the limit to what the state can do for the people is the crisis-proneness of capitalist accu-mulation. Capitalism is characterized by the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (TRPF), leading to reduced investment and employment. This mechanism puts a stop to the rise in wages and contributes to absolute and/or relative immiseri- zation. Increasing the rate of exploitation, including by depressing wages below the value of labour, is a major way to counter the TRPF, and the state aids capital here. Indeed, some of the state interventions to counter the falling rate of profit aim to (help capital) increase labour exploitation. Some of the state interventions seek to bailout companies in crisis, and these are ultimately paid for by the working class and small-scale producers, in the form of austerity and the like. The fact that the state cannot fundamentally rescue capitalism from its crisis-proneness affects workers adversely: the state indeed has little control over ‘crises partial or general’ which cause unemployment’ (Marx, 1887: 385). Or, more generally, the state qua capitalist state has little real and long-term control over the average rate of profit to fall and therefore over the extent to which it can help the workers. 4 Bringing it all together: broader theoretical reflections on the state and forms of working-class struggle As we have seen, through its legislations and policies, the state seeks to force the capitalist class to reduce the length of the working day; it has tried to put a floor below which wages are not to fall. It contributes to the reproduction of segments of the reserve army through unemployment insurance and similar measures. There have been legislations concerning health and safety at work. The working class has also received benefits in the form of subsidized health and education. The state allows, or helps, people to freely sell their labour power and smallscale producers to freely sell products of their labour. The state can positively affect the value of labour power itself.49 The state may also weaken the power of rent-receiving landlords because of whom the ground rent exists and directly or indirectly affects workers and small-scale producers. Certain general theoretical conclusions can now be made from these facts about the relation between the state and class struggle in the light of the foregoing discussion in Sections 1—3. Long-term capitalist interests coinciding with workers’ everyday interests The long-term interests of the capitalist class (or of its hegemonic fraction) (and of the capitalist state) may coincide with those of workers, and this partly drives state functions in favour of the working class. Recklessly pursuing wealth in its abstract form, the capitalist class or individual capitalists can destroy the dual sources of all wealth (labour and nature), subjecting both to a dual metabolic rift, extracting far more out of them than what it gives them. In the long-term interest of capital, the state, as the idea collective capitalist, intervenes. The present state . . . assumes functions favouring social developments spe-cifically because, and in the measure that, these interests and social devel-opments coincide, in a general fashion, with the interests of the dominant class. (Luxemburg, 2008/1938: 61) The state has to make sure that capital has access to the worker it needs, the worker which is the sole source of surplus value (which is supplemented by the labour product of small-scale producers). Capitalists need workers (and other elements of the workforce such as small-scale producers) in two forms. Objectively, capitalists need workers with healthy bodies and with certain mental and physical abilities that are productive of capitalist wealth, the workers who, because of their property-lessness that is (coercively) protected by the state, are ‘forced to’ voluntarily work for a wage under the despotic control of the capitalist and/or hired agent. Culturally/subjectively, capitalists need men and women who accept capitalist rules of the game as more or less natural. Capitalism requires ‘a working class, which by education, tradition, habit, looks upon the conditions of that mode of production as self-evident laws of Nature’ (Marx, 1887: 523). Here the state plays an active role, although Marx neglects to say this: the state contributes towards the development of a working class, which accepts capitalism as natural, through its cultural apparatuses that disseminate the ideas of the capitalist class as ruling ideas (e.g. educational system, propaganda system, and so on). Objective class interests, the two forms of class struggle, and state action Objective conditions and objective interests (capital’s need for a suitable workforce, removal of feudal or semi-feudal-type constraints, workers’ needs) do not act. People ‘in so far as they are the personifications of economic categories, embodiments of particular class relations and class-interests classes’ (Marx, 1887: 7) exist as classes and class fractions (which identities are mediated by other identities) and engage in struggles in support of their economic and political class interests. As a structure of relations itself that is internally connected to the structure of capitalist relations, the state is intimately and necessarily connected to class struggle: class struggle (or balance of power between the two basic classes) and the state shape each other. Epistemologically speaking, class struggle is the mediating term between the abstract analysis of capitalist reproduction and the concept of the state (Clarke, 1983: 110). Class struggle from below (struggle of the masses) coexists with class struggle from above: [T]he State and its Apparatuses only have meaning from the point of view of the class struggle, as an apparatus of class struggle [i.e. class struggle from above] ensuring class oppression and guaranteeing the conditions of exploitation and its reproduction. But there is no class struggle without antagonistic classes. Whoever says class struggle of the ruling class says resistance, revolt and class struggle of the ruled class [i.e. class struggle from below]. (Althusser, 2001: 125) Just because concessions can work in the long-term interests of capital and just because concessions can produce consent of the masses, that does not necessarily mean concessions are granted. Active class struggle from below is needed. Common people fight for their interests, with a consciousness that is variable over time and that varies across regions and countries. The general point is that the impact of objective conditions (e.g. capital’s interest in a healthy and educated workforce) on the state’s pro-worker interventions is mediated by class struggle, including the struggle of workers. The need for consent, that is, need for workers to see capitalism as self-evident laws of nature, arises because there is potential/actual class struggle from below. And that consent is not produced automatically by economic processes of capitalism. The struggle of the proletariat against the capitalist class and its state always goes on — literally every month, there is a strike in some part of the world — and it takes many forms. In its trade union form, the struggle of the proletariat aims to obtain concessions from the capitalist class and its state, within the bounds of the capitalist class system. Concessions are both political and economic, and people fight for both. Political concessions are about democratic rights and ‘are made in the sphere of legislation concerning’ such things as police brutality, discrimination against religious minorities, oppression of women and racialized minorities, censorship, and so on (Lenin, 1901). The fight for trade union rights is a part of the fight for political concessions. Economic concessions involve improvements in the economic conditions of people, including in wages, conditions of work and state-provided services.50 A part of this struggle is the struggle against the commodity status of use-values (e.g. demand for subsidized food, shelter, or child care). The commodity status of things is contested in part under pressure from common people who lack the means of exchange to buy the use-values that they need, so the state is partly involved in the determination of what is, and what is not, a commodity. There is then class struggle from above. This is in the form of what capitalists do to the working class, including through their instrumentalist ties to the state and through its own associations (e.g. chambers of commerce and the like). It is also in the form of the state’s anti-worker economic policies and the suppression of strikes against these policies, on behalf of the capitalist class. The state is the biggest and most trusted trade union of the capitalist class that counters the trade unions and other organizations of workers. The neo-liberal welfare cut is an instance of class struggle launched by capital and its state against the social wage that the working class had successfully fought for after the war.51 As an arm of the capitalist class, the state supremely signifies class struggle from above by suppressing any significant potential or actual threat from workers to commodity relations, relations of property, and capitalist profit-making. When ‘adverse circumstances prevent the creation of the industrial reserve army and, with it, the absolute dependence of the working class upon the capitalist class’, capital ‘rebels against the “sacred” law of supply and demand’ (Marx, 1887: 448). Capital engages in its own methods of class struggle as it relies on ‘forcible means’, including ‘State interference’ (ibid.). This is class struggle from above. When the capitalist class hires goons to kill trade union leaders or hires strikebreakers during a strike, or when the business bosses use court orders to stop a strike, that is class struggle on their part too. When ‘through their press, agents, and spies the capitalists labor to frighten and demoralize the strikers’ (Trotsky, 1938b) that is an example of class struggle from above. Class struggle from above is supported/aided by the state.”翻译为中文","completion":"劳动立法既是出于资本家阶级的直接利益，也是出于整个社会的利益。但这种和谐只能持续到资本主义发展的某个阶段。当资本主义发展达到一定水平时，资产阶级作为一个阶级的利益，以及经济进步的需求（即工人的利益）开始即使在资本主义意义上也发生冲突。 （卢森堡，2008/1938: 61） 资本积累总是在特定的地理环境中发生——在一个城市和一个国家内。因此，资本在城市、省份和国家之间不断流动。为了获得一些让步，工会不得不经常支持——或者他们必须确保不显著破坏——国家和地区层面的资本积累条件。资本投资可以在国家和次国家层面的州领土管辖区内迁移的事实，以及这些层面的州机构（日益）相互竞争以争夺资本，限制了工人在特定地点/国家获得重大让步的可能性。48 在正常时期，资本积累的必要性为国家能为工人做的事情设定了限制。当我们将地理流动性作为积累的一个方面来考虑时，我们看到它也在具体层面上对国家能为工人做的事情施加了一些“限制”。对国家能为人民做的事情的另一个限制是资本主义积累的危机倾向。资本主义的特征是利润率下降的趋势（TRPF），导致投资和就业减少。这一机制阻止了工资的上涨，并导致绝对和/或相对贫困化。增加剥削率，包括通过压低工资到劳动价值之下，是对抗TRPF的主要方式，国家在这里帮助资本。事实上，一些国家干预措施旨在对抗利润率下降，目的是（帮助资本）增加劳动剥削。一些国家干预措施旨在救助危机中的公司，这些最终由工人阶级和小规模生产者以紧缩等形式支付。国家无法从根本上拯救资本主义免受其危机倾向的影响，这对工人不利：国家实际上对引起失业的“局部或普遍的危机”几乎无法控制（马克思，1887：385）。或者，更一般地说，国家作为资本主义国家对利润率下降的平均水平以及因此对帮助工人的程度几乎没有真正和长期的控制。 4 总结一下：关于国家和工人阶级斗争形式的更广泛理论反思 正如我们所见，通过其立法和政策，国家寻求强迫资本家阶级缩短工作日；它试图设定工资不得低于的底线。它通过失业保险和类似措施为后备军的某些部分的再生产做出贡献。已经有了关于工作场所健康与安全的立法。工人阶级还通过补贴的健康和教育形式获得了福利。国家允许，或帮助，人们自由出售他们的劳动力，小规模生产者自由出售他们劳动的产品。国家可以积极影响劳动力价值本身。49 国家还可能削弱领取地租的地主的权力，因为这些地主使地租存在，直接或间接影响工人和小规模生产者。从前述讨论中的这些事实可以得出一些关于国家和阶级斗争之间关系的一般理论结论。 长期资本家利益与工人日常利益的一致 资本家阶级（或其霸权部分）的长期利益（以及资本主义国家）可能与工人的利益一致，这在一定程度上推动了国家有利于工人阶级的职能。在追求其抽象形式的财富时，资本家阶级或个别资本家可以破坏所有财富的双重来源（劳动和自然），使两者落入双重代谢裂隙，从中抽取的远远超过它们给予的。出于资本的长期利益，国家作为理念上的集体资本家进行干预。 当前国家......因为，并在这些利益和社会发展在总体上与主导阶级的利益一致的程度上，承担有利于社会发展的职能。 （卢森堡，2008/1938: 61） 国家必须确保资本可以获得它需要的工人，这些工人是唯一的剩余价值来源（通过小规模生产者的劳动产品补充）。资本家需要工人（和其他劳动力元素，如小规模生产者）以两种形式。客观上，资本家需要拥有健康身体和某些精神和体力能力的工人，这些能力能够生产资本主义财富，由于他们的无产状态受到国家（强制性）保护，他们“被迫”自愿接受资本家和/或雇佣代理的专制控制为工资工作。文化/主观上，资本家需要接受资本主义游戏规则作为自然规定的男性和女性。资本主义需要“一个经过教育、传统、习惯视该生产方式的条件为自然规律的工人阶级”（马克思，1887：523）。在这里，国家发挥了积极作用，尽管马克思忽略了这一点：通过其文化机构传播资本家阶级的观念作为统治思想（例如教育系统、宣传系统等），国家有助于形成一个接受资本主义为自然的工人阶级。 客观条件和客观利益（资本对合适劳动力的需求，消除封建或半封建式限制，工人需求）不会行动。人们“因为他们是经济范畴的化身，特定阶级关系和阶级利益的体现者，作为阶级和阶级部分存在（这些身份由其他身份中介）并为他们的经济和政治阶级利益而斗争。 作为一种关系结构本身，并且与资本主义关系结构内部连接，国家与阶级斗争密切相关：阶级斗争（两个基本阶级之间的力量平衡）和国家相互塑造。认识论上讲，阶级斗争是抽象分析资本主义再生产和国家概念之间的中介（克拉克，1983：110）。来自下层的阶级斗争（大众斗争）与来自上层的阶级斗争共存： [国家及其机构]只有从阶级斗争的角度才有意义，作为一种阶级斗争的机构[即来自上层的阶级斗争]，确保阶级压迫和保证剥削及其再生产的条件。但没有对立的阶级就没有阶级斗争。谁说统治阶级的阶级斗争，就说统治阶级的抵抗、反抗和阶级斗争[即来自下层的阶级斗争]。 （阿尔都塞，2001：125） 仅仅因为让步可以符合资本的长期利益，并且因为让步可以产生大众的同意，并不一定意味着让步会被给予。需要来自下层的积极阶级斗争。普通民众为了他们的利益而斗争，他们的意识随时间变化和跨地区和国家的差异而变化。一般来说，客观条件（例如资本对健康和受过教育的劳动力的兴趣）对国家亲工人干预的影响是通过阶级斗争中介的，包括工人的斗争。因为存在来自下层的潜在/实际阶级斗争，所以产生同意的需求，即需要工人将资本主义视为自然规律，而这种同意不是由资本主义的经济过程自动产生的。 无产阶级对资本家阶级及其国家的斗争总是在进行 — 字面上来说，世界上某个地方每个月都会发生罢工 — 它采取许多形式。在其工会形式中，无产阶级的斗争旨在从资本家阶级及其国家获得让步，这是在资本家阶级体系的范围内。让步既是政治的也是经济的，人们为两者而战。政治让步涉及民主权利，“在涉及”诸如警察暴力、对宗教少数群体的歧视、对妇女和有色人种的压迫、审查制度等事情的立法方面“进行改革。争取工会权利是争取政治让步的一部分。 经济让步涉及改善人们的经济条件，包括工资、工作条件和国家提供的服务。50 这场斗争的一部分是反对使用价值的商品身份（例如，要求对食物、住所或儿童保育进行补贴）。部分在于普通民众的压力之下对物品的商品身份受到争议，这些民众缺乏购买他们需要的使用价值的交换手段，所以国家在一定程度上参与决定什么是商品，什么不是商品。 然后是来自上层的阶级斗争。这是资本家对工人阶级所做的事情的形式，包括通过其与国家的工具性联系和通过其自身的协会（例如商会等）。它也是国家反工人经济政策和对这些政策的罢工镇压的形式，代表资本家阶级行事。国家是资本家阶级最大且最值得信赖的工会，对抗工人的工会和其他组织。新自由主义福利削减是资本及其国家在战后成功争取到的社会工资之上对工人阶级发起的阶级斗争的例子。51 作为资本家阶级的武器，国家通过镇压任何对商品关系、财产关系和资本家利润制造的重大潜在或实际威胁，最高度地象征着来自上层的阶级斗争。当“不利的情况阻止产生工业后备军，并因此阻止工人阶级对资本家阶级的绝对依赖”时，资本“反抗‘供求的神圣法则’”（马克思，1887：448）。资本运用自己的阶级斗争方式，依赖于“强制手段”，包括“国家干预”（同上）。这是来自上层的阶级斗争。当资本家雇用打手杀害工会领导或在罢工期间雇用罢工破坏者，或者当企业老板使用法庭命令停止罢工时，那也是他们的阶级斗争。当“通过他们的媒体、特工和间谍，资本家努力吓阻和消极罢工者”时（托洛茨基，1938b），那是来自上层的阶级斗争的一个例子。来自上层的阶级斗争得到国家的支持/援助。"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

Этот фильм отличается глубокой многослойностью, предлагая зрителям не только религиозную историю, но и размышления на такие темы, как вера, судьба, братство и изменения. Вот несколько из ключевых смыслов и тем, затронутых в мультфильме: 1. **Тема свободы и освобождения.** Моисей встает на путь борьбы за освобождение евреев из египетского рабства, что символизирует стремление к свободе и освобождение от угнетения. 2. **Идентичность и самопознание.** Моисей, выросший в египетской кралевской семье, постепенно осознает свое истинное происхождение и предназначение. Это путешествие к самопознанию подчеркивает важность понимания своих корней и собственной роли в мире. 3. **Братство и разочарование.** В отношениях между Моисеем и его приемным братом Рамзесом раскрывается трагедия личного конфликта на фоне глобальных событий. Разрыв между братьями иллюстрирует, как различные жизненные пути и выбор могут привести к конфликтам с близкими. 4. **Вера и чудеса.** История изобилует моментами, когда вера ведет к проявлению чудес, таких как расколотие Красного моря, что подчеркивает мощь веры перед лицом невозможного. 5. **Лидерство и жертва.** Моисей показан как лидер, который принимает на себя тяжелое бремя ответственности, жертвуя личным счастьем ради блага своего народа. 6. **Прощение и искупление.** В фильме затрагиваются темы прощения и возможности искупления даже после совершения тяжких ошибок. \\"Принц Египта\\" — это не просто повествование о библейском пророке, но и глубоко философский рассказ о человечности, смысле жизни и стремлении к лучшему будущему."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

Trouble at the Throat Situation: A group of Zhentarim thugs is shaking down a local merchant in the bustling area known as the Throat. NPCs: In the thriving market known as Bounty of The Goddess, a local merchant faces intimidation from Zhentarim thugs. A Zhentarim Thug here, clothed in leather armor, has an armor class (AC) of 12 and health points (HP) of 11, with a speed of 30 feet. They brandish a scimitar, attacking with a +4 to hit, dealing 5 slashing damage to their target. These thugs have been trained by the Zhentarim, making them particularly persuasive with a Charisma of 12, allowing for more effective intimidation, and they excel in coordinated attacks, using pack tactics for an advantage when an ally is nearby. The Merchant, caught in this dire situation, is not equipped for combat, reflected in his AC of 10 and HP of 4, moving at a standard speed of 30 feet. In his desperation, he can attempt to fend off aggressors, managing a clumsy unarmed strike with +2 to hit for a mere 1 bludgeoning damage. However, his years of experience haggling in the market have sharpened his tongue, granting him a persuasive edge with a Charisma of 14. Rescue actions towards the merchant can secure a valuable alliance or discounts at his establishment within the market grounds of Bounty of The Goddess.","completion":"Given the setting of Voonlar and the context of the encounter, it\'s reasonable to speculate on the nature of the merchant\'s business and the kind of discount the party might receive. The market\'s name, Bounty of The Goddess, suggests a place rich in a variety of goods, possibly with a focus on agricultural products or items that would be considered blessings from a deity, such as fine foods, wines, or artisan goods that are not commonly found elsewhere. Merchant\'s Inventory Based on the locale and the situation described, this merchant might specialize in one of the following: 1. **Exotic Spices and Culinary Ingredients**: Given the name of the market, the merchant could be dealing in rare spices, herbs, and other culinary ingredients that chefs and cooking enthusiasts would seek. These would not only attract locals but also travelers looking for unique flavors to take back home. 2. **Artisan Crafted Goods**: The market\'s name also hints at the possibility of handcrafted items that are unique to the region. This might include textiles, pottery, jewelry, or woodworks that are blessed or inspired by the deity the market is named after. 3. **Rare Books and Scrolls**: Another possibility is that the merchant deals in rare literature, including books on mythology, history, or arcane knowledge. The emphasis on the market being a \\"bounty\\" could indicate that it is a treasure trove of knowledge. Discount and Gratitude Assuming the party successfully rescues the merchant from the Zhentarim thugs, the merchant, grateful for their intervention, could offer: 1. **A Steep Discount**: A straightforward thank you could be a substantial discount on his goods, anywhere from 20% to 50% off on selected items. This discount might be a one-time gesture or extend over all transactions for a set period as the party continues to make themselves known as defenders of the marketplace. 2. **A Unique Item as a Gift**: Instead of a discount, or perhaps in addition to it, the merchant might gift the party a rare item from his inventory that could be of help in their quests. This could be a rare spice that, when used, grants temporary boosts to abilities, a piece of artisan jewelry with minor enchantments, or a book that provides them with knowledge leading to other quests. 3. **Ongoing Support**: The merchant could also offer ongoing support, such as free goods, insider market information, or introductions to other important figures in Voonlar. This type of discount is more about opening doors and establishing connections rather than direct financial savings. The exact nature of these discounts and gifts would depend on how the DM decides to flesh out the character of the merchant and the specifics of the goods he sells. Nevertheless, saving the merchant not only enriches the party\'s connections within Voonlar but also once again demonstrates the tangible benefits of acting as protectors of the innocent."},{"prompt":"please provide exact items the merchant would have with exact prices and also the exact discount the party would get","completion":"Given the setting and the circumstances, let\'s create a more detailed inventory for the merchant, whom we\'ll name Eris the Spice Trader, who specializes in exotic spices and artisan goods, reflecting a rich blend of the cultural and natural bounty that could be present in a market named Bounty of The Goddess. Then, I\'ll set an exact discount that Eris would offer as gratitude for the party\'s actions. # Eris the Spice Trader\'s Inventory: 1. **Saffron Threads**: Rare and sought after for both culinary and magical uses. - Price: 15 gold pieces (gp) for a small packet. 2. **Black Lotus Extract**: An exceedingly rare ingredient for potent potions. - Price: 100 gp for a vial. 3. **Dragonmint Leaves**: Known for their medicinal properties and as a flavorful tea ingredient. - Price: 5 gp per bundle. 4. **Silverleaf Honey**: Harvested from the enchanted silverleaf hives, this honey is believed to have healing properties. - Price: 10 gp for a jar. 5. **Arcane-infused Olive Oil**: A bottle of olive oil that enhances the flavor of food and can be used in certain spells. - Price: 20 gp per bottle. 6. **Frostfire Peppers**: A rare plant that thrives in cold climates, giving off a heat that is magically cold. - Price: 8 gp for a pepper. # Artisan Goods: 1. **Enchanted Wooden Spoon**: Stirring with this spoon can halve the time needed to prepare any meal. - Price: 25 gp. 2. **Goblet of Everwater**: An intricately designed goblet that fills with fresh, cold water when spoken to. - Price: 50 gp. 3. **Tablecloth of Plentiful Bounty**: A tablecloth that, once spread, produces a modest feast for four, once per day. - Price: 120 gp. # Discount Offer: Eris, grateful for the rescue, is generous in his thanks. He offers a **30% discount** on one-time purchases of any items from his inventory as an immediate gesture of gratitude. Additionally, he provides the party with a **\\"Bearer\'s Token\\"** which entitles the holder to a **15% discount** on any future purchases, validating the ongoing relationship and appreciation for the party\'s heroism. # Calculation: - For a single purchase of Saffron Threads at a 30% discount, the price would be 10.5 gp. - If the party decides to buy the Tablecloth of Plentiful Bounty with the 30% discount, it would cost them 84 gp. The specific numbers give a tangibility to the merchant\'s inventory, making it easier for the party to strategize their purchases and plan how they might use the items in their adventures. Eris\'s gratitude not only reinforces positive behavior but also embeds the party further into the fabric of the local community, potentially opening up new quest lines and opportunities."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

It\'s considered a low-impact activity but can be difficult or painful for individuals with injuries, stiffness, or conditions like arthritis. Flexibility exercises require consistent effort over time to see improvements and can be challenging for people who are naturally less flexible. 2. **Lifting the Arm**: This refers to raising the arm away from the body, which can be upwards (above the head), forwards, or to the side. This movement primarily uses the shoulder muscles, including the deltoids, as well as muscles in the upper arm and back. The difficulty of lifting the arm can vary significantly depending on the context: - **Without Weights**: Generally easier for most people unless they have a shoulder injury or condition that restricts movement or causes pain. - **With Weights**: The difficulty increases with the weight of the object being lifted. Regular training can increase strength over time, making it easier to lift heavier objects. - **Due to Injury or Condition**: Conditions such as frozen shoulder, rotator cuff injuries, or arthritis can make lifting the arm very difficult and painful. **Comparing Difficulty**: - For someone in good health and without injuries, stretching the arm might be seen as easier compared to lifting it with a significant weight. - For individuals with limited flexibility or specific injuries that make stretching painful, stretching might be perceived as harder. - Lifting the arm without any added weight is generally easy for healthy individuals but can be quite difficult for those with shoulder injuries or muscular weaknesses. **Conclusion**: There\'s no absolute answer as it significantly depends on individual circumstances. It\'s also important to consider the specific context in which each action is being performed (for example, stretching as part of a yoga practice versus lifting weights in strength training), as well as the individual\'s baseline physical condition."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

The fundamental differences between these two formats are: 1. **Duration:** - **TEST Cricket:** A Test match is played over five days, with a possibility of a draw if neither team can win in the allotted time. - **One-Day Cricket (ODI):** As the name suggests, a One-Day International (ODI) is completed in a single day, with each team allotted 50 overs to bat. This format eliminates the possibility of a draw due to time expiration, barring weather interruptions or exceptional circumstances. 2. **Overs:** - **TEST Cricket:** There are no over limits in Test cricket. A team continues to bat until it is all out or a declaration is made. This can lead to teams batting for an extensive number of overs across two innings. - **One-Day Cricket:** Each team bats for a maximum of 50 overs unless they are bowled out earlier. This caps the maximum number of overs that can be bowled in a match to 100. 3. **Clothing:** - **TEST Cricket:** Traditionally, players wear white clothing, which is a holdover from the game\'s earlier days. This tradition is maintained to respect the history of the sport. - **One-Day Cricket:** Teams wear colored clothing, often in their national or team colors, which makes the game more visually appealing for television audiences. This also helps distinguish teams more easily. 4. **Ball:** - **TEST Cricket:** A red ball is used in Test cricket, which is better suited for longer matches due to its durability and visibility under natural light conditions. - **One-Day Cricket:** A white ball is used, which is more visible under artificial lighting, making it suitable for day-night matches. The white ball tends to deteriorate more quickly than the red ball. 5. **Fielding Restrictions:** - **One-Day Cricket:** There are specific fielding restrictions in place during an ODI match, particularly in the first 10 overs and during the batting powerplay, where only two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. This is designed to encourage more scoring. - **TEST Cricket:** There are generally no fielding restrictions beyond the basic rules of cricket, allowing teams more strategic depth in their field placements. 6. **Multi-innings vs. Single-innings:** - **TEST Cricket:** Each team has two innings to bat and bowl, allowing for a complex, strategic game that evolves over time. - **One-Day Cricket:** Each team bats and bowls for a single innings, making the game faster-paced and results more immediate. 7. **Match Result:** - **TEST Cricket:** A match can end in a win, a loss, or a draw, where the game concludes without either side achieving a victory within the designated time. - **One-Day Cricket:** A definitive result is much likelier, with ties or ties broken by a Super Over being rare but possible outcomes aside from win or loss. Each format offers a unique challenge and requires different strategies and skills, from the endurance and patience of Test cricket to the speed and innovation of One-Day matches."},{"prompt":"Elaborate on the innings. In TEST Cricket each team is allotted two innings meaning there are four innings in total. Each innings ends when all batters are out. In ODI Cricket each team is allotted one inning with a limit of 50 overs. Each inning ends when either all overs expire or all batters are out. Essentially, in ODI Cricket the team to bat first establishes a limit that the pitching team must break in order to win. The same is true in T20 Cricket.","completion":"Absolutely, let\'s delve deeper into the innings structure for both Test Cricket and One-Day International (ODI) Cricket. # Test Cricket Innings In Test cricket, each team is allocated two innings to bat, making for a total of four innings in a Test match. This aspect of the game introduces a profound level of strategy and endurance, both mentally and physically, for the players. Here’s how it unfolds: - **Two Innings per Team:** The opportunity to bat twice in the match allows teams to recover from a poor first innings or strategize around their opponents\' scores. It makes the match outcome less dependent on conditions such as weather or the initial toss. - **All Batters Out:** An innings concludes once all batters are out (with the exception of cases where there are players unable to bat due to injury). This can occur over potentially unlimited overs across the five days, so long as time permits. - **Declarations:** A unique aspect of Test cricket is the captain\'s ability to declare an innings closed, even if not all batters are out. This strategic move is often used to optimize the use of time and position the opposing team under pressure. - **Outcome Influences:** Because each team bats twice, factors like weather changes, pitch deterioration, and strategic declarations considerably influence the game\'s outcome over the five days. # ODI Cricket Innings In contrast, ODI cricket simplifies and speeds up the game by allocating each team a single inning of a fixed number of overs. The structure here aims for a fast-paced, viewer-friendly format: - **Single Innings per Team:** Each team gets one chance to bat, with the innings capped at 50 overs. This places a premium on scoring runs quickly while managing the risk of losing wickets. - **50 Overs Limit:** The batting team tries to score as many runs as possible within these 50 overs. Once the overs are up, or all batters are out, the innings closes. This fixed limit introduces a critical management element of pacing the innings and resource allocation (batters and wickets). - **Target Setting and Chasing:** The first batting team sets a target score for the second team. The second team then knows precisely what is required to win, adding a direct, competitive edge to the match. If the second team surpasses this target, they win; if not, the first team is victorious. - **No Declarations:** Unlike Test cricket, there\'s no option for a declaration. Each team must bat out their overs or lose all their wickets. Both innings structures across Test and ODI cricket cater to different aspects of the game. **Test cricket** is often seen as the purest form of cricket, testing teams\' abilities, strategies, and endurance to the fullest. **ODI cricket**, on the other hand, offers a more accessible and time-bound format, making it highly popular among a broader audience. This format emphasizes aggressive batting, strategic bowling, and dynamic fielding, making every over significant to the match\'s outcome. # T20 Cricket as a Point of Comparison While not initially asked for, it\'s worth noting the T20 format, where each team is allotted a single inning but only 20 overs. This version of the game stretches the aggressive and fast-paced aspects of ODI cricket even further, prioritizing explosive batting to achieve high scores in a short period, thus amplifying fan engagement and introducing cricket to a new audience with its brevity and entertainment value."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

Let’s see if we can understand them.” Scene 5: Learning and Teaching - Gloopy and Glitter try different movements and gestures while observing the shadows’ responses. - After some time, a rudimentary form of dialogue emerges—through the language of light and shadow, they begin to understand one another. Gloopy (nodding thoughtfully): “They’re telling us they haven’t seen light like ours in ages. They’ve missed it.” Glitter: “And they’re saying they want to help us fix the ship! How incredible!” Scene 6: Cooperation - With guidance from the shadows, Gloopy and Glitter locate the necessary materials scattered around the barren planet. - The shadows playfully assist, enveloping objects in darkness to highlight them against the gray backdrop. Gloopy: “Thanks, friends! This sure is teamwork of a whole new shade!” Glitter: “Your turn to shine, my little shadows!” Scene 7: The Transformation - As the blob-mobile is being repaired, Glitter gets a bright idea. She gathers her potions and concocts a special mixture of her glitter and Gloopy’s goo. - Spreading the mixture onto the landscape, a remarkable transformation occurs. The dull terrain begins to sparkle, and the shadows start to dance with color. Glitter (with a heart full of glee): “A little bit of Gloopy, a little bit of Glitter, and voilà!” Scene 8: A World Reborn - The lifeless planet comes to life, bursting with colors as the shadows reflect the newfound light from every shimmering rock and sparkling crevice. - The shadows, now intertwined with the light, create an ethereal glow that stretches as far as the eye can see. Gloopy (in awe): “We didn’t just find a new world—we helped create one.” Glitter: “And we’ve made new friends who taught us the beauty that lies in the shadows.” Scene 9: Farewell and Forward - With the blob-mobile repaired and the memories of a once barren planet now teeming with prismatic hues, Gloopy and Glitter bid their new friends goodbye. - The shadows wave in their own fluid, graceful way as the duo blasts off, leaving behind a legacy of light in the darkness. Voiceover: “And with their hearts a little fuller, Gloopy and Glitter continue their odyssey amongst the stars, forever seeking to brighten the cosmos, one rejuvenated world at a time.” - The screen fades to black, with the echoes of Gloopy and Glitter’s laughter trailing off, the barren planet they left now aglow with vibrant shadows and radiant sparkles. Title: “Gloopy’s Shape Sensation” Scene 1: An Unexpected Audience - Our adventure begins with Gloopy and Glitter exploring the vast cosmos, powered by the warp drive they won from “The Great Space Entry” competition. Their blob-mobile navigates through the starry expanse, zipping past comets and asteroid belts. Glitter: “Gloopy, I’ve pinpointed an unexplored planet on the map. It’s known as Forma-5, famous for its inhabitants’ love for art and performance!” Gloopy: “Sounds like a place where I can stretch my… talents! Let’s check it out!” - They land on Forma-5 and are greeted by its geometrically shaped inhabitants, beings who can change colors but not their forms. Scene 2: Discovering Gloopy’s Talent - Gloopy and Glitter visit the central plaza, where locals are showcasing their art. Though their color transformations are beautiful, Gloopy quietly starts to play around, innocently morphing into various shapes—circles, stars, and even mimicking some of the local architecture. Child-Like Hexagon: “Look, mom! That stranger can change his shape!” - Soon, a small crowd gathers, marveling at Gloopy’s effortless transformations. Word quickly spreads about the incredible shapeshifting visitor. Scene 3: The Invitation - The mayor of Forma-5, a dignified dodecahedron named Dodecy, approaches Gloopy and Glitter with an offer. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your ability is a gift! We’ve never seen such talent. Would you honor us by performing at our Grand Plaza tonight? Your art could inspire our youth and bring joy to our citizens!” Glitter, beaming with pride: “What do you say, Gloopy?” Gloopy: “I’d be thrilled! Let’s make it a night to remember!” Scene 4: Preparing the Performance - Backstage, Glitter helps Gloopy prepare. She applies a bit of her glitter to make his transformations sparkle in the night. Glitter: “With each shape you make, let’s add a burst of sparkle to illuminate your art even further!” Gloopy: “This is going to be spectacular. I can’t wait to share our sparkle with everyone.” Scene 5: The Grand Performance - As night falls, Gloopy takes center stage under the stars. The plaza is filled with thousands of Forma-5’s inhabitants, eagerly waiting in anticipation. Announcer: “Presenting Gloopy, the Shapeshifting Sensation from the faraway world of Gloopiter!” - With each beat of the cosmic melody, Gloopy transforms. He becomes a star, a bird, an intricate flower blooming—all sparkling under Glitter’s magical touch. His performance tells a story of friendship, adventure, and the beauty of being unique. Scene 6: A Standing Ovation - The crowd is mesmerized. As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy’s shapes, combined with Glitter’s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms. Scene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell - As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they’re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy’s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art. Gloopy, touched: “I never knew my shapeshifting could bring so much happiness. What an unforgettable experience!” Glitter: “You’ve touched their hearts, Gloopy. Let’s keep spreading joy across the stars.” - They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one’s talents. Voiceover: “With Forma-5 in their wake, Gloopy and Glitter continue their cosmic journey, leaving a trail of inspiration and creativity. Wherever they go, they remind us that it’s our unique qualities that truly make us shine.” - The stars twinkle a little brighter as the screen fades to black, the shared laughter of Gloopy and Glitter echoing into the vastness of space. Title: \\"The Mysterious Infinite Mall\\" Scene 1: Glitter’s Mysterious Encounter - Gloopy and Glitter had decided to take a break from their intergalactic adventures and explore a bustling space mall for a change of scenery. As Gloopy headed to the bathroom, Glitter, with her sparkly trail in tow, ventured off on her own. - Lost in the maze-like corridors of the mall, Glitter marveled at the variety of shops and alien species bustling about. Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight – a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself. Alien: “Infinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‘infinite, forever, never ending’?” Alien (with a hiss): “Ah, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy’s Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion. Alien Child: “Help us, friendly blob! We can’t find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.” Gloopy: “Don’t worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let’s stick together and find a way out.” Scene 3: A Uniting Force - Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy’s malleable form and the children’s keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks. - Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter’s sparkling trail as a guiding light. - Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite. Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. \'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give \'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.\' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it!

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later!

As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years.

There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up.

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments.

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra!

Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn\'t confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn\'t World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn\'t premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up.

User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu\'s Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are!

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history.

Write a blog post on March 6 about the shorts change, with the title being “Lamput and Planet Sketch are dead, long live” # Lamput and Planet Sketch are Dead, Long Live The Gees, Pikachu’s Jukebox, and GoGoWiki March 6, 2024 In the ever-evolving landscape of children’s television, change is the only constant. With CW4Kids transitioning full throttle into a new era, we bid farewell to the iconic shorts “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” These shorts have entertained countless viewers with their unique humor and quirky characters, becoming staples of Saturday morning routines. Yet, as we mourn their departure, we also welcome with open arms the new contenders set to fill the void: “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki.” “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” provided us with laughter, creativity, and endless entertainment. “Lamput,” with its minimalistic yet expressive animation, gave us a silent but hilariously dynamic orange blob constantly escaping the clutches of dimwitted scientists. “Planet Sketch” took us on a rollercoaster of comedy with its diverse cast of characters and unpredictable scenarios. Their contribution to the realm of animated shorts will not be forgotten, but in the entertainment industry, the show must go on. Enter “The Gees,” a fresh addition to the CW4Kids lineup that promises a cosmic comedy adventure unlike any other.

Their adventures are guaranteed to lead to laughter-inducing disasters, promising a delightful twist to our Saturday mornings.

This educational and entertaining short provides insights into the characters of “GoGoRiki,” blending knowledge with humor in a format that is both engaging and enlightening. While we reminisce about the creativity and laughter brought to us by “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” the arrival of “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki” marks a refreshing beginning with endless possibilities.

Also, here\'s the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids\' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition. Stay tuned, and thanks for your engagement and excitement during this transformative period for CW4Kids!

It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love. CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 PM We’re thrilled you all caught the promo and are excited about the transition! While we can’t reveal much just yet, rest assured that CW4Kids is dedicated to bringing you quality animation and exciting new shows. “Coming Soon” means new adventures are on the horizon, so stay tuned for more updates and thank you for sticking with us through this new chapter!

User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on January 2, 2024, at 9:30 AM This totally amps up my excitement for the CW4Kids launch! I’ve always found Pogoriki to be one of the most entertaining characters. Seeing him in action in the promo, even if just for a second, assures me that “GoGoRiki” is going to inject some serious fun into the lineup. CW4Kids is pulling out all the stops! User4: RetroRewind Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:00 AM Pogoriki? That’s fantastic news! Such a clever way to announce “GoGoRiki” without explicitly saying it. I’ve missed the humor and vibrant animation style of the show. Looks like CW4Kids isn’t just holding onto legacies; they’re really embracing new tales and characters. Kudos to the team for the smart reveal! User5: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:30 AM DetectiveToon, your investigative skills are top-notch! A cameo by Pogoriki is a promising nod to the humor and whimsy we can expect from CW4Kids.

User1: DetectiveToon Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:45 AM Hey @CW4KidsForumMod, out of curiosity and just for clarity, which company do you officially represent here in the forum?

The blend of old and new has been fascinating, and I’m just trying to understand from whose perspective we’re seeing these exciting updates! 🙂 CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hi @DetectiveToon, great question! I’m here representing 4Kids Entertainment.

Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hey, @SquishSuperFan and everyone else feeling the ‘Squish’ blues! We appreciate your passion for the show and understand your disappointment. Our goal at CW4Kids is to create a diverse and dynamic viewing experience that resonates with our audience’s evolving tastes. While there are no current plans to bring back ‘Squish’, we’re always evaluating our lineup to ensure it delivers the best in animated entertainment. Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we navigate this exciting chapter for CW4Kids! Write a reply from the mod suggesting some alternatives, and saying while the show won’t return anytime soon, here’s some other great stuff CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:30 PM Hey @SquishSuperFan and all our dedicated viewers, I totally hear you on missing ‘Squish’ and the unique flavor it brought to our lineup. While it’s true that ‘Squish’ won’t be returning anytime soon, we’re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in ‘Squish’. For those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I’d highly recommend giving “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a shot. It’s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table. Another show that’s been a hit among our audience is “GoGoRiki.” Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers. And, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” has been making waves. It introduces fresh adventures and characters that continue to expand the beloved Pokemon universe. We understand that while these alternatives may not replace ‘Squish’, they represent the diverse and entertaining content CW4Kids strives to deliver. Our goal is to fill your Saturday mornings with stories that make you laugh, think, and dream. Thank you again for your understanding, enthusiasm, and support. CW4Kids is here to bring you the very best in animation, and we’re excited to have you with us on this journey!

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show’s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this? User2: ToonAdventurer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM I saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that “The lab is now closing” message. The alternatives suggested were “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic,” right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” but it’s a good nudge to explore the new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM Certainly a creative way to say goodbye to “Johnny Test” and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on—futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel’s new direction perfectly. I’ve been a fan of “Johnny Test” for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give “GoGoRiki” a shot next Saturday! User4: NewEraToonGoer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. “Johnny Test” has been a staple, but the ad’s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” caught my eye; it has that quirky charm “Johnny Test” fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites. User5: DigitalCartoonDiva Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM That “The lab is now closing” ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids’ commitment to its new era. “Viva Pinata” and “Chaotic” seem like they’ll fill the action-comedy void left by “Johnny Test.” Excited to see what these shows have to offer! User6: RetroToonLover Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM The farewell ad for “Johnny Test” was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they’re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. “Johnny Test” will be missed, but the network’s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle. Here’s to new adventures! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:45 PM It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to bid farewell to “Johnny Test.” The “lab is now closing” ad was our way of softly transitioning fans towards our exciting new lineup, rendered in our fresh presentational style.

It’s like they’re carefully curating this blend of past favorites and new adventures for us. I was particularly impressed with the sneak peek of “Sonic X” starting from Episode 1 - smart move to draw in a wider audience. Acknowledging the transition gave a sense of continuity and respect for the audience’s journey. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:00 PM There was something very comforting about tonight’s show. Recognizing the time “just after Christmas” until now as a significant period of CW4Kids’ evolution shows they’re thoughtful about this rebranding process. The mix of upcoming shows has me convinced CW4Kids is setting a new standard for Saturday morning lineups. Can’t wait to see where they take us next! User6: NewEraNick Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:15 PM Truly an energizing preview event! Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey “just after Christmas” subtly reassured us that while we’re moving forward, the past months were just as valuable in shaping what CW4Kids is about to become. The diverse range of shows previewed tonight paints a bright future ahead. Excitement is an understatement! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:30 PM Thrilled to see all the positive feedback from tonight’s Spring Preview Extravaganza!

Forum Thread Title: “4KidsTV Schedule Shake-Up: ‘GoGoRiki’ Gains More Ground & Farewell to ‘Tomodachi Life’ & ‘One Piece’” User1: EternalToonFan Posted on April 21, 2024, at 9:45 AM Heads up! Starting next week, “GoGoRiki” is snagging an additional slot on the 4KidsTV channel, this time taking over “Shaman King” at 11 AM. With its growing popularity on CW4Kids, it seems “GoGoRiki” is set to become even more of a mainstay. But there’s more—“Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” are bidding us farewell come May 1st, replaced by two shows currently exclusive to CW4Kids. The winds of change are certainly blowing through 4KidsTV. Thoughts? User2: RetroAnimeWatcher Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:00 AM Wow, “GoGoRiki” really is taking over! Surprised to see “Shaman King” getting the boot, but “GoGoRiki” has been a hit, so it makes sense. As for “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” leaving, it’s a shame. “One Piece” especially has been a long-standing favorite. Curious to find out which CW4Kids shows will fill in their slots. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:15 AM It’s bittersweet seeing “Tomodachi Life” go; those Miis brought unique charm and humor. “One Piece” had its epic journey too. The removal didn’t come as a surprise, though, considering they stopped streaming on 4kids.tv early March. Now I’m intrigued about which CW4Kids shows will transition over to the 24/7 channel. Any guesses? User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:30 AM “I’ll miss the Miis” from “Tomodachi Life,” too. That show had such a quirky, fun vibe. Exciting to hear that “GoGoRiki” is expanding its presence, though! I’m betting “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and possibly “Code Lyoko” could be the ones to make the jump to 4KidsTV. Both have been stellar on CW4Kids and seem like natural fits to broaden their audience. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:45 AM The departure of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” surely marks the end of an era, but it’s also thrilling to see CW4Kids shows stepping up. “GoGoRiki” nabbing another slot is impressive. It kind of reflects 4KidsTV’s adaptation to viewer preferences. Eagerly awaiting the announcement of which CW4Kids shows will fill those vacancies come May. User6: NostalgicNick Posted on April 21, 2024, at 11:00 AM “GoGoRiki” really is on a roll! I understand the logistics behind the changes, especially with streaming limitations signaling “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” were on their way out. It’s a smart play to bring more CW4Kids content into the 4KidsTV fold – keeps the brand cohesive and capitalizes on what’s working. Can’t wait to see what’s next! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 21, 2024, at 11:15 AM We appreciate all your feedback and understanding regarding the recent schedule changes at 4KidsTV. “GoGoRiki’s” additional timeslot is a testament to its success, and while we say goodbye to “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece,” we’re excited about bringing more of the CW4Kids experience to our 24/7 channel.

Forum Thread Title: “Unexpected Logo & Credits Swap During ‘Tomodachi Life’ & ‘One Piece’ Airings – April 19th” User1: ToonTalkerTerry Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:00 PM Did anyone else catch the odd change-up at the end of today’s “Tomodachi Life” episode on 4KidsTV? Instead of the usual Nintendo, TV Asahi, and Gallop logos during the Split Screen Credits, we got an S4C and Inovism logo. Even the copyright tag was swapped to show a different show title, though the credits were still for TL. Then, the same thing happened with “One Piece” at 7pm – the Toei logo was replaced with Animation Studio Petersburg! Looks like the logo and copyright tags changed over early? What’s going on? User2: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:15 PM Wow, I thought I was seeing things! That was definitely not the usual ending credit scene for either show. Maybe they’re gearing up for the replacements coming in May but jumped the gun on changing the visuals? It does seem like a mix-up in preparing for the transition of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” out of the lineup. User3: RetroRewind Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:30 PM This feels like a big oops moment on someone’s part. Showing S4C and Inovism logos during “Tomodachi Life” and then Animation Studio Petersburg for “One Piece” is quite the premature switch. They must be setting the stage for whatever’s taking their slots, but someone got a bit too eager with updating the credits! User4: FutureToonFan Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:45 PM It’s a peculiar error for sure, but kind of exciting if you think about it. It hints at the direction 4KidsTV is taking after “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” say their farewells. Swapping the logos early must’ve been a mistake, but it gives us a glimpse into what’s coming. Animation Studio Petersburg and S4C/Inovism involvement sounds promising for the new content! User5: AnimationAfficionado Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:00 PM Certainly, an unexpected sneak peek into the future! Mixing up the credits does spoil the surprise a bit, but I’m intrigued by what S4C, Inovism, and Animation Studio Petersburg will bring to the table. This mishap aside, it seems like 4KidsTV is prepping for a refreshed lineup with some serious creative power behind it. User6: NostalgicNick Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:15 PM Mistakes happen, but this one is pretty telling. It’s like getting an accidental peek at your birthday presents. S4C and Inovism on “Tomodachi Life” and Animation Studio Petersburg for “One Piece” – definitely interesting choices for partners. Curious to see how this early logo swap hints at the quality and direction of their replacements! 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:30 PM Apologies for the confusion during today’s airings of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece.” The updated logos and copyright tags were indeed a bit premature as we prepare for the exciting new shows set to debut in their slots in May. We appreciate your understanding and eagerness as we transition to fresh content with our partners S4C, Inovism, and Animation Studio Petersburg.

Thoughts on these swaps? User2: RetroGamer Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I’m going to miss the quirky stories of “Tomodachi Life.” The island’s always been a bit of a virtual getaway for me. Swapping it with “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is intriguing, though. Alien slimes could bring a whole new dimension of comedy we haven’t seen before on the network. User3: PirateFan101 Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:15 AM As much as I love “One Piece,” its ratings have been trailing behind “Pokémon” for the last 6 months. It seems like a strategic move by 4KidsTV to refresh their lineup with shows that have the potential to attract a broader audience. “GoGoRiki” does have its charm, and it’ll be interesting to see how it fills the action-packed void left by our beloved pirates. User4: ToonAnalyst Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:30 AM To shed a bit more light on why “Tomodachi Life” is leaving, it primarily comes down to Nintendo moving away from 3DS support. The show, being based on a game for a platform that’s no longer actively supported, makes it a bit outdated for 4KidsTV’s dynamic and evolving lineup. As for “One Piece,” it’s really about the numbers. “Pokémon” has consistently outperformed it in ratings, making it a challenging environment for our pirate crew. In the entertainment business, especially in children’s programming, staying relevant and competitive is key. User5: NewEraNick Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:45 AM It’s sad to see two such unique shows go, but change is part of the TV landscape. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” sound like they’ll bring a lot of fresh energy and humor to the channel. Plus, considering the evolving interests of the audience, it seems like a natural progression. Here’s hoping they capture our imagination just as much! User6: AnimationAfficionado Posted on April 30, 2024, at 10:00 AM Farewell to the Miis and pirates. While “Tomodachi Life” offered an unparalleled slice-of-life experience and “One Piece” took us on countless high seas adventures, it’s exciting to think about the new narratives and laughter “Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” will bring. The realm of children’s animation is all about evolution and innovation. Let’s embrace the change! 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on April 30, 2024, at 10:15 AM We appreciate your thoughts and feelings on the transition from “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” to “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki.” Our goal at 4KidsTV is always to deliver engaging, diverse, and high-quality content that resonates with our viewers. Rest assured, these changes are made with a lot of thought and consideration for our audience’s evolving interests.

From Red Ball Aesthetics to Tech/Computer Theme?” User1: BrandingBuff Posted on April 25, 2024, at 10:25 AM Hey everyone! With all the programming changes happening at 4Kids TV and CW4Kids, I\'ve been wondering about the branding. Currently, 4Kids TV has stuck with that iconic red ball flying through the air motif for years. Do you think we\'ll see a shift to line up with the tech/computer theme that CW4Kids adopted, especially come May 1st with the introduction of new shows? User2: TechToonFan Posted on April 25, 2024, at 10:50 AM That’s a great question! Given CW4Kids’ successful revamp and positive audience reception to the new tech/computer theme, it seems logical for 4Kids TV to consider a similar shift to maintain brand cohesion. Keeping two divergent aesthetics might confuse viewers, especially younger audiences who hop between both platforms. User3: VisualVanguard Posted on April 25, 2024, at 11:15 AM I’ve been thinking about this too. The red ball look of 4Kids TV is classic but might feel outdated alongside CW4Kids’ fresh, digital look. It would be a smart move to update the 4Kids TV branding to mirror CW4Kids by May 1st, especially with “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” coming in. User4: RetroRenovator Posted on April 25, 2024, at 11:45 AM I’m on the fence here. While a unified tech-theme across both channels could streamline the branding, there’s something nostalgic about the red ball flying look of 4Kids TV. It would be interesting to see if they manage to blend the old with the new without losing their identity. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 25, 2024, at 12:00 PM The tech/computer theme of CW4Kids represents a forward-looking vision that’s more in line with today’s digital age. A branding shift at 4Kids TV might not just be beneficial for synchronicity but could also signal a broader direction change in content and presentation style. Waiting to see this play out! User6: ModernMediaGuru Posted on April 25, 2024, at 12:30 PM With \\"Tomodachi Life\\" and \\"One Piece\\" making way for shows already thriving under the new CW4Kids theme, it certainly hints at a bigger picture strategy. Updating the 4Kids TV brand to reflect a similar futuristic vibe come May 1st makes sense. It\'s about time for a refresh that speaks to the new content and audience expectations. User7: ClassicToonConnoisseur Posted on April 25, 2024, at 1:00 PM Brand coherence is key in the media landscape, and with CW4Kids leading the charge into a new era, it\'s only logical for 4Kids TV to follow suit. That doesn’t mean they should erase their history, though. A nuanced update that nods to their legacy while embracing the new tech theme could offer the best of both worlds. 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on April 25, 2024, at 1:30 PM Appreciate the speculation and enthusiasm, everyone! We are always exploring ways to ensure 4Kids TV stays relevant and appealing to our viewers. While the classic red ball has been a mainstay of our brand for years, we are indeed considering updates that will reflect our evolving content lineup and viewer preferences.

Regarding the TAOG&G promo, I noticed that too. Personally, I thought they might update it to match CW4Kids\' tech/computer vibe, but there’s something comforting about that classic flying red ball.

As for the TAOG&G promo, I think it’s a smart move.

It’s like a comforting nod to long-time viewers and a subtle reminder of 4KidsTV’s legacy. The “Where Kids Rule!” slogan starting off the day adds a familiar touch to the morning routine.

User4: ModernMediaGuru Posted on May 1, 2024, at 8:30 AM This is a clever strategy by 4KidsTV, blending nostalgia with anticipation for what’s to come.

Это аркадная стратегия, в которой игрокам поручается защитить свой замок от волн атак врагов. Игра обладает элементами tower defense, в которых игроки могут улучшать и настраивать свой замок, а также набирать и модернизировать различных героев и юнитов для защиты. Механики игры включают в себя разнообразие стратегических решений, поскольку у каждого героя и оборонительной единицы есть уникальные способности и характеристики. Grow Castle отличается своей простой, но привлекательной графикой и динамичным игровым процессом."},{"prompt":"Объясни какую роль играют атрибуты урона молнии и физического урона у посоха мага который не пользуется физическими атаками в этой игре","completion":"В играх, подобных Grow Castle, атрибуты урона, такие как урон молнией и физический урон, играют ключевую роль в определении того, насколько эффективны атаки персонажа против определённых типов врагов. Даже если рассматриваемый персонаж, как маг, обычно не использует физические атаки, эти атрибуты могут всё равно влиять на игровой процесс, в зависимости от механик игры. 1. **Урон молнией**: Этот атрибут указывает на способность наносить дополнительный урон молнией поверх базового урона заклинаний или атак. Для мага, который специализируется на использовании магии, атрибут урона молнии может значительно увеличить его эффективность, дополняя его магические атаки дополнительным уроном и позволяя более эффективно бороться с врагами, имеющими уязвимость к этому типу урона. 2. **Физический урон**: Хотя маг, вероятно, не будет часто использовать физические атаки, некоторые игры включают механики, по которым определённые магические атаки или заклинания могут частично зависеть от атрибута физического урона или могут иметь компоненты, которые наносят физический урон в дополнение к магическому. Также, в некоторых случаях, определённые враги могут иметь резистентность к магическим атакам, делая физический урон альтернативой для нанесения вреда. Однако в большинстве случаев для магического персонажа более ценным является урон молнией или другие атрибуты магического урона, которые напрямую усиливают его способности и заклинания. В игре Grow Castle важно собирать и модифицировать снаряжение таким образом, чтобы максимально увеличить эффективность выбранной стратегии и состава героев. Оптимизация атрибутов урона в соответствии с ролями и способностями ваших героев может значительно повлиять на ваш успех в игре."},{"prompt":"как найти работу начинающему специалисту без стажерства","completion":"Найти работу начинающему специалисту без стажировки может быть вызовом, но вполне осуществимо.

Here are a few underrated PSP games that are definitely worth checking out: 1. **Patapon Series** - While the first game received some attention, the whole series is often not as celebrated as it should be. It\'s a unique mix of rhythm, strategy, and RPG elements, wrapped in an attractive art style. 2. **Jeanne d’Arc** - A tactical role-playing game that provides a fantastical take on the story of Joan of Arc. It features engaging gameplay, a solid storyline, and beautiful visuals, but it didn’t quite get the spotlight. 3. **Hexyz Force** - A traditional JRPG that flew under the radar for many. It offers an intriguing story split between two main characters and incorporates a unique battle system. 4. **The 3rd Birthday** - A spin-off of the Parasite Eve series, this action RPG combines third-person shooting with a compelling storyline. It\'s often overlooked even by fans of the original series. 5. **Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII** - While not exactly unknown, given its ties to the highly popular Final Fantasy VII, it\'s sometimes underrated in terms of its contribution to the FFVII lore and its solid gameplay mechanics. 6. **Ys: The Oath in Felghana** - A part of the Ys series, known for its action-packed gameplay and engaging storyline. This title, in particular, is a great mix of fast-paced combat and exploration. 7. **Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman** - A unique roguelike RPG with a quirky sense of humor, customizable characters, and a deep customization system. 8. **Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure** - An action RPG with a charming story, engaging gameplay, and graphics that push the PSP\'s capabilities. 9. **Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars** - An intriguing space exploration game with strategic combat and deep customization. (Note: Infinite Space is actually a game for Nintendo DS, made by PlatinumGames and Nude Maker. While fitting the theme of underrated titles, it might have been confused in this context. There isn\'t an \\"Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars\\" for the PSP.) 10. **Class of Heroes** - A dungeon-crawler RPG with a learning curve but rewarding for fans of the genre. These games represent just a fraction of what the PSP has to offer beyond its blockbuster titles. Many of them have unique qualities or gameplay elements that set them apart, making them worth a play for those looking to dive deeper into the PSP\'s catalog."},{"prompt":"Imagine Earth has 10x gravity (Planet Vegeta: This intense gravity gives the Saiyans their natural physical resiliency and power.)","completion":"If Earth had 10 times its current gravity, the effects would be profound and diverse, impacting the planet\'s geology, atmosphere, biology, and even the potential for human or humanoid life to exist or develop technology. The fictional concept of Planet Vegeta from the Dragonball series, where the native Saiyans thrive under such gravity due to their unique physiology, offers a point of departure for imagining such a world, though the realities of such a planet would likely diverge significantly from the conditions suitable for human life as we know it. # Geological and Atmospheric Effects 1. **Atmospheric Density**: The increased gravity would lead to a much denser atmosphere. Molecules of air would be pulled closer to the surface, potentially increasing the pressure at sea level significantly. This could have various effects on climate and weather patterns, possibly making them more extreme. 2. **Surface Gravity**: The intense surface gravity would make it difficult for mountains and other large geological features to achieve the heights found on Earth. Erosion processes would be accelerated, and any elevation might be more prone to landslides and collapse under the immense gravitational pull. 3. **Volcanic and Tectonic Activity**: The internal dynamics of the planet might also be affected. Higher gravity could influence the mantle convection processes and possibly lead to increased volcanic and tectonic activity, assuming the planet\'s internal heat would be sufficient to prevent a completely static lithosphere. # Biological Effects 1. **Life Forms**: The evolutionary trajectory of life on such a planet would drastically differ from Earth\'s. Organisms might evolve with much stronger structural supports to withstand the gravity, leading to potentially shorter, more robust forms with stronger musculature and skeletal structures. However, the energetic costs of moving in such an environment would be significantly higher, possibly limiting the size and complexity of life forms. 2. **Human Existence**: For humans or human-like beings, the 10x Earth gravity would pose insurmountable challenges without some form of extraordinary adaptation or technological intervention. Blood circulation alone under these conditions would be problematic, as the heart would need to work much harder to overcome the gravitational pull, potentially leading to an increased likelihood of cardiovascular issues. 3. **Development of Civilizations and Technology**: The sheer physical demands of moving or even standing in such a gravity would slow down or perhaps prevent the development of any civilization resembling human society. Building structures or launching anything into space would require materials and energy orders of magnitude beyond our current capabilities. # Comparisons and Speculations While the idea of a species like the Saiyans evolving on such a world is a compelling narrative device, the physical realities make the spontaneous emergence and evolution of such beings extremely speculative. Life as we understand it adapts to its environment, but the conditions on a 10x gravity planet would be so extreme that it would challenge many fundamental assumptions about biology, physics, and technology. In conclusion, a real-world Planet Vegeta would be a world of extreme conditions that could potentially host forms of life radically different from those on Earth.

No obstante, es importante consultar la normativa local vigente o a un asesor fiscal profesional en tu jurisdicción para obtener información detallada y precisa. 1. **Impuesto sobre Sociedades (IS):** Casi todas las sociedades limitadas están sujetas al Impuesto sobre Sociedades. Este impuesto se aplica sobre los beneficios generados por la empresa. El tipo impositivo puede variar entre jurisdicciones, pero en muchos casos, existe un tipo reducido para pymes o microempresas sobre una base imponible que cumpla con ciertos requisitos. 2. **IVA (Impuesto sobre el Valor Añadido):** Las empresas que venden bienes o servicios suelen estar obligadas a recaudar el IVA de sus clientes y a rendir cuentas ante la agencia tributaria correspondiente. Esto implica la presentación periódica de declaraciones de IVA, que pueden ser mensuales, trimestrales o anuales, según la legislación local. 3. **Retenciones del IRPF (Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas):** Si la empresa tiene trabajadores en nómina, debe realizar retenciones y pagos a cuenta del IRPF en sus salarios. Estas cantidades retenidas se deben ingresar periódicamente en el tesoro público. 4. **Impuesto sobre Actividades Económicas (IAE):** Aunque en algunos lugares las pequeñas empresas están exentas de este impuesto, es importante verificar si se aplica a tu caso. El IAE grava el ejercicio de actividades empresariales, profesionales o artísticas. 5. **Seguridad Social:** Tener empleados conlleva la obligación de cotizar a la Seguridad Social por ellos, incluyendo tanto las aportaciones sociales de los trabajadores como las cuotas empresariales. Esto implica el pago mensual de las cotizaciones por cada trabajador de la empresa. 6. **Declaraciones informativas:** Dependiendo de la actividad y tamaño de la empresa, puede haber obligaciones adicionales de enviar declaraciones informativas sobre operaciones con terceros, operaciones intracomunitarias, o incluso, en algunos casos, información sobre bienes en el extranjero. Es esencial mantener un sistema de contabilidad claro y al día, que permita determinar con precisión los beneficios y las obligaciones fiscales. Además, dadas las particularidades y cambios constantes en la legislación fiscal, es altamente recomendable la asesoría por parte de un profesional en el ámbito contable y fiscal para asegurar el pleno cumplimiento de todas las obligaciones y optimizar la carga fiscal de la empresa. Recuerda, este es un resumen general y las leyes fiscales difieren significativamente de un país a otro; por tanto, es crucial consultar la normativa vigente en tu área o un asesor fiscal profesional para asesoramiento detallado y personalizado."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

Nintendo officially ended production of the Nintendo 3DS family of systems in September 2020. However, \\"dead\\" can have different meanings depending on the context: 1. **Production and Sales:** Nintendo ceased the production of the 3DS, and new units are no longer being sold by official retailers, meaning the system is no longer an active product line for Nintendo. 2. **Official Support:** Nintendo announced that the eShop for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U would close worldwide on March 27, 2023. This means that the digital purchase of games and DLC, as well as the ability to download free content, like game updates and demos, ended at that time, significantly reducing support for these systems. However, the ability to redownload content you already own, receive software updates, and play online will continue to be available for the foreseeable future. 3. **Game Releases:** New game releases from Nintendo and most major publishers have ceased, as focus has shifted entirely to the Nintendo Switch and other current-generation systems. However, a small community of independent developers might still release games for the system, albeit very infrequently. 4. **Community and Modding:** The 3DS has a dedicated fan base and an active modding community. Custom firmware and homebrew applications extend the life of the system for enthusiasts interested in exploring beyond the official capabilities and games of the device. In summary, from an official standpoint, the 3DS can be considered \\"dead\\" due to the cessation of production, the ending of storefront services, and the shift of focus to newer platforms. However, among collectors, enthusiasts, and in the realm of homebrew, the 3DS remains a vibrant and beloved platform."},{"prompt":"Write a story where a TL, PS&M, MK7 fan switches to Switch with ACNH, PS&S, MK8D and SMO","completion":"In the heart of a bustling city, nestled among the high rises and the perpetually busy streets, lived a gamer named Alex. Alex was no ordinary gamer; their allegiance was firmly with the classics - the Nintendo 3DS, to be precise. They had spent countless hours diving into the worlds of \\"The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds\\" (TL), strategizing in \\"Pokémon Sun and Moon\\" (PS&M), and racing to the finish line in \\"Mario Kart 7\\" (MK7). These games were not just pastimes for Alex; they were portals to worlds where adventure, challenge, and the joy of discovery lay around every corner. However, as the years rolled by, the sparkle of the 3DS began to dim. Not from any loss of love on Alex\'s part, but simply because the world had moved on. The Nintendo Switch had taken center stage, bringing with it a new era of gaming. Though initially resistant, a creeping curiosity about titles like \\"Animal Crossing: New Horizons\\" (ACNH), \\"Pokémon Sword and Shield\\" (PS&S), \\"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\\" (MK8D), and \\"Super Mario Odyssey\\" (SMO) began to gnaw at Alex. The final push came one autumn evening when Alex\'s best friend, Jamie, invited them over. Jamie had recently acquired a Nintendo Switch and was eager to share the experience. That night, under a cozy blanket fort, lit only by the soft glow of fairy lights, Alex held the Switch for the first time. They were instantly enchanted. The vibrant world of \\"Animal Crossing: New Horizons\\" offered an escape to a personalized island paradise that was both peaceful and engaging. The strategic depth of \\"Pokémon Sword and Shield\\" reignited Alex\'s passion for Pokémon battles, while \\"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\\" took the familiar thrill of racing to new heights with stunning graphics and inventive track designs. And \\"Super Mario Odyssey\\" was a masterful journey that married nostalgia with innovation in a way only Nintendo could. The switch to the Switch was not immediate. Old loves die hard, after all. But as Alex explored these new games, they found themselves captivated by the depth, diversity, and community that the Switch offered. The 3DS remained on their shelf, a treasured relic of the past, but the future was clearly Switch-shaped. Months passed, and Alex\'s Switch collection grew. They became an integral part of an online community that shared tips, celebrated victories, and even met up for gaming marathons. The joy of gaming, which had never really left, was now rekindled with a new flame. In a way, Alex\'s transition from the 3DS to the Switch was symbolic of their own life—moving forward, embracing change, and finding new joys while cherishing the memories of the past. The characters and worlds they had loved on the 3DS would always hold a special place in their heart, but the adventures awaiting on the Switch promised that the best was yet to come. And so, with the joy-cons in hand and a world of possibilities on the horizon, Alex stepped into the future, ready for whatever challenges, adventures, and friendships it might bring. The 3DS had been a faithful companion through many chapters of Alex\'s life, but the Switch was the key to the next grand adventure."},{"prompt":"Write about their Tomodachi miis, who began to feel neglected","completion":"In the virtual world of Tomodachi Life on Alex\'s cherished Nintendo 3DS, a curious community of Miis had flourished. Each Mii, a quirky digital avatar representing Alex\'s friends, family, and a handful of celebrities, lived together on a vibrant island. They had adventures, formed friendships, fell in and out of love, and occasionally pursued careers in pop stardom or haute cuisine, all under Alex\'s watchful eye. Life on the island was dynamic, unpredictable, and above all, entertaining. However, as Alex\'s attention shifted to the siren call of the Nintendo Switch, a subtle change came over the island. The Miis, once a bustling and lively community, began to feel the pangs of neglect. Where Alex had once been a constant presence, solving problems, orchestrating relationships, and delighting in the Miis\' quirky antics, there was now only silence. Mia, a Mii with an adventurous spirit and a penchant for travel, was the first to notice. Her requests for exotic foods or new clothes went unanswered, her dreams unwatched. She missed the days when Alex would excitedly log in to see what new stories had unfolded in her absence. Next, there was Erik, a Mii with aspirations of becoming a rock star. His concerts, once attended by throngs of adoring Miis and an enthusiastic Alex, now played to nearly empty rooms. The applause was sparse, echoing eerily through the concert hall where dreams seemed to fade away. Jules, the island\'s resident chef, felt it too. Her once-celebrated dishes, crafted with care for the island\'s many gatherings and parties, no longer found an audience. The café, once a hub of conversation and laughter, stood quiet, its tables bare. The Miis, in their digital consciousness, began to gather in small groups, whispering about the change. The island had everything they could want—beautiful landscapes, cozy homes, and a plethora of activities—but without Alex\'s presence, it all seemed a little less bright. The joy of new friendships, the thrill of new experiences, and the comfort of their daily routines were dimmed by the absence of their creator and friend. In a bid to recapture Alex\'s attention, the Miis tried everything they could. They staged grand performances, hosted elaborate parties, and even set off fireworks every night for a week. But without Alex to witness their efforts, the celebrations felt hollow. Meanwhile, Alex, now fully immersed in the world of the Switch, remained blissfully unaware of the growing discontent on Tomodachi Life Island. It wasn’t until one rainy afternoon, while browsing through the 3DS to relive some nostalgia, that Alex stumbled upon the game. Curiosity piqued, they booted up the game, greeted by the familiar yet neglected faces of their Mii friends. The island was just as Alex had left it, but the atmosphere was undeniably different. It was as if the island itself breathed a sigh of relief at Alex’s return. The Miis, ever joyful but unmistakably wistful, greeted Alex with a mix of excitement and a tinge of reproach. This visit was a turning point. Alex realized the unique charm and warmth of Tomodachi Life—a virtual world teeming with personality, humor, and the unexpected. The Switch offered incredible experiences, but so did this little island of Miis, each with their own stories and quirks. Determined to not let the Miis feel forgotten again, Alex made a commitment. While the Switch games captivated much of their gaming time, a special part of their day would now be reserved for visiting the island. Balancing between the new adventures on the Switch and the ongoing sagas within Tomodachi Life, Alex rediscovered the joy of these virtual lives, ensuring the Miis felt cherished once more. In doing so, Alex found a harmonious balance between the old and the new, nurturing both the nostalgic connections of the past and the exciting possibilities of the future. The Miis, no longer neglected, thrived under Alex\'s renewed attention, and the island became a bustling, happy place once more, a testament to the enduring charm of virtual worlds and the bonds we form within them."},{"prompt":"Rename dui70 to dui71 and hex edit VAN.dll to reflect this","completion":"Changing the name of a file and updating references to that file in a binary (like a DLL file) certainly can be achieved, but it involves a few steps and tools. Be advised that manipulating binaries and DLL files can cause applications or systems to become unstable or not work at all if not done carefully. Always make sure you have backups of your files before making any changes. Also, make sure your modifications comply with the software\'s license agreement. # Step 1: Rename the File The first step is straightforward: you simply rename the file from `dui70` to `dui71`. This can be done through the file explorer interface or using a command in a terminal or command prompt window: For Windows: ``` ren dui70 dui71 ``` For Linux or macOS (if applicable): ``` mv dui70 dui71 ``` # Step 2: Hex Edit `VAN.dll` The second step is to update references within `VAN.dll` from `dui70` to `dui71`. This requires a hex editor. A hex editor allows you to view and edit the raw bytes in a file. Keep in mind that editing a DLL can cause applications or systems to malfunction if errors are made. **Warning:** Directly modifying a DLL can violate software terms and might result in unexpected behavior or software crashes. Always have a backup before making any changes. 1. **Find a Hex Editor:** First, you will need a hex editor. There are many free and paid hex editors available online (e.g., HxD, Hex Fiend). 2. **Open `VAN.dll` in the Hex Editor:** Launch your hex editor and open the `VAN.dll` file. 3. **Search for the String:** Most hex editors have a \\"Find\\" feature. Use it to search for text or byte strings. Here you would search for \\"dui70\\". The exact process depends on your hex editor, so consult its documentation for instructions. 4. **Replace the String:** Once you\'ve found the reference to `\\"dui70\\"`, you need to replace it with `\\"dui71\\"`. Be careful not to change the file\'s length. Strings in binaries are often null-terminated and of fixed length. Your new string should precisely match the length of the old string. If `dui71` is shorter, you might need to add a null character (`00` in hex) at the end to keep the alignment and size consistent. 5. **Save the Changes:** After making the changes, save the modified `VAN.dll`. Ensure you are saving it in a way that preserves the original file\'s attributes (e.g., not changing its size or format). 6. **Test:** Very important—test the application or system using the modified `VAN.dll` to make sure it operates correctly. Be ready to restore from the backup if anything goes wrong. # Caveats - Modifying DLLs might violate the software\'s terms of use. - There is a risk of corrupting the file or making the application unusable. - Compatibility issues may arise, especially if the software is updated later on. If you feel uncomfortable performing these actions or if it\'s critical software, consider reaching out to the software\'s support team or a professional for assistance."},{"prompt":"What are the differences between modern Association Football and Cuju?","completion":"Association football, commonly known as soccer in some countries, and Cuju, an ancient Chinese ball game, are both team sports involving a ball and two teams with the objective of scoring goals. Despite sharing these basic elements, there are significant differences between them in terms of historical context, rules, gameplay, and cultural significance. Here\'s a comparison of the two: # Historical Context - **Association Football**: Modern association football originated in England in the 19th century, though games involving a ball and a goal date back thousands of years across various cultures. The standardized rules of modern football were established in 1863 with the founding of the Football Association in England. - **Cuju**: Cuju is an ancient Chinese ball game that dates back to the Warring States period (around 475-221 BC) and was popular until the Ming dynasty (14th-17th centuries). It is recognized by FIFA as the earliest form of football for which there is evidence. # Rules and Gameplay - **Association Football**: Played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end, the objective is to score by getting the ball into the opposing team\'s goal. The rules restrict handling the ball to the goalkeeper within the penalty area. Association football is played over two halves of 45 minutes each, with a halftime interval. - **Cuju**: The rules of Cuju varied over time and place but generally involved kicking a ball through an opening into a small net without the use of hands. Unlike modern soccer, Cuju fields could vary in size and shape, and the number of players and the style of the nets or targets could also differ. In some versions, there was no goalkeeping. # Equipment - **Association Football**: The game is played with a spherical ball, standardized in size and weight, and players wear specific uniforms, boots, and shin guards. The goals are rectangular frames with netting. - **Cuju**: The Cuju ball was made of leather with a feather or hair filling. The players\' attire is less documented, but historical sources suggest they were likely dressed in standard athletic clothing of the times. Goals could range from simple openings to elaborate net structures. # Cultural Significance - **Association Football**: It has grown to become the world\'s most popular sport, with a massive following, professional leagues in almost every country, and major international competitions like the FIFA World Cup. - **Cuju**: It was more than a sport; it also had military training aspects and was used as a method for soldiers to improve their physical condition and foot skills. Cuju also held cultural significance and was played during special festivals and court entertainment. # Conclusion While there are similarities between association football and Cuju in terms of being team sports focusing on kicking a ball to achieve goals, they differ significantly in their historical origins, rules, gameplay mechanics, and cultural impact. Association football is a global phenomenon with standardized rules and professional leagues worldwide. In contrast, Cuju was historically significant within Chinese culture and varied much more in terms of how it was played."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

Aunque la legislación fiscal puede cambiar, aquí te proporciono una visión general basada en la estructura impositiva y legal vigente hasta mi última actualización en 2023. Es crucial consultar con un asesor fiscal o contable para obtener información detallada y actualizada, ya que las leyes fiscales pueden cambiar. # 1. Impuesto sobre Sociedades (IS) Como sociedad limitada, la pyme debe tributar por el Impuesto sobre Sociedades. La tarifa general es del 25%, aunque existen tipos reducidos para entidades de nueva creación y según el nivel de ingresos. Es importante estar al día con las deducciones y bonificaciones aplicables, por ejemplo, por actividades de I+D+i (Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación) que pueden ser relevantes para una empresa informática. # 2. Impuesto sobre el Valor Añadido (IVA) Al tratarse de una actividad económica, es necesario gestionar el IVA: esto incluye la presentación periódica de autoliquidaciones (generalmente trimestrales) y la declaración anual del resumen de IVA. Los tipos del IVA pueden variar según el tipo de servicio o producto ofrecido, pero generalmente, el tipo general es del 21%. # 3. Retenciones de IRPF Si la empresa tiene trabajadores por cuenta ajena o si realiza pagos a profesionales independientes, deberá practicar retenciones de IRPF en nóminas o en facturas profesionales y presentarlas trimestralmente ante la Agencia Tributaria. Además, tendrás que suministrar el resumen anual de retenciones. # 4. Cotizaciones a la Seguridad Social La empresa está obligada a inscribirse en la Seguridad Social y a cotizar por cada uno de sus trabajadores. Esto incluye la aportación empresarial y la retención de la cuota del trabajador, que se detrae de su salario bruto. Las cotizaciones cubren contingencias comunes, desempleo, formación profesional, y el Fondo de Garantía Salarial (FOGASA). # 5. Impuestos y tasas locales Dependiendo de su ubicación exacta y las actividades específicas, puede haber impuestos municipales o tasas aplicables, como el Impuesto de Actividades Económicas (IAE), aunque la mayoría de las pymes están exentas. # 6. Otros - Declaración de Operaciones con Terceros (Modelo 347): Si la empresa realiza operaciones con algún cliente o proveedor que superen un determinado umbral durante el año natural, debe presentar esta declaración. - Declaración de Bienes y Derechos en el Extranjero (Modelo 720): Si la pyme posee activos o derechos en el extranjero por encima de ciertos límites. - Registro Mercantil: La empresa debe inscribirse en el Registro Mercantil y presentar las cuentas anuales. # Recomendaciones - Mantener un sistema de contabilidad preciso y actualizado es fundamental. - Asesorarse con un profesional para optimizar la carga fiscal, aprovechando las deducciones y bonificaciones disponibles. - Estar al tanto de las novedades legislativas: las leyes fiscales pueden cambiar y con ellas las obligaciones y ventajas para la empresa. Esperamos que esta información sea de utilidad, pero recuerda que la aplicación práctica de estas normas puede variar según las circunstancias específicas de tu empresa y los cambios legales que pudieran producirse."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

Maybe you should sit down and take a breather.” Natsuki: “I’m fine, really. Let’s just continue with the discussion. I can catch up- ACK!!! Sakura, knock it off!” Sayori: “Are you sure you don’t need to go see the nurse or something? You look like you’re in a lot of pain.” Natsuki: “I’m fine, I promise. Let’s just focus on the book discussion- GAH!!! Sakura, I said knock it off! Ugh, this is so distracting…” Monika: “Maybe we should take a break and let Natsuki rest for a bit. We can continue the discussion later when she’s feeling better.” Natsuki: “No, I’m okay, really. Let’s just keep going. I don’t want to miss out on the discussion- AAH!!! Okay, maybe I should get to the nurse. Sakura is really kicking up a storm in there. Sorry, guys. I’ll catch up with you all later.” (She stands up slowly, wincing in pain, and heads out of the clubroom with the support of her friends. A few minutes later, she returns with a worried look on her face.) Natsuki: “Guys…the nurse said that I’m showing signs of early labor. I might have to go to the hospital…” Monika: “Oh my gosh, Natsuki! Are you serious? Should we call an ambulance?” Natsuki: “Y-Y-Yeah…I left my phone at home. Can one of you please call for me?” Sayori: “Of course, Natsuki! We’ll make sure you get to the hospital safely.” Yuri: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll take care of everything. Just focus on staying calm and we’ll get you the help you need.” (The club members quickly call for an ambulance and keep Natsuki company while waiting for it to arrive. They reassure her and try to keep her calm as they wait for medical assistance to arrive - all while her contractions become more frequent.) Natsuki: “I-I can’t believe this is happening. Sakura wasn’t supposed to be due for another few weeks. I’m so scared…” Monika: “It’s going to be okay, Natsuki. Just focus on breathing and staying calm. The ambulance will be here soon and they’ll take care of everything.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. We’ll stick by your side through this and make sure you and Sakura are both okay.” Yuri: “Try to stay positive, Natsuki. You’re strong and you’ll get through this. We’ll be here every step of the way.” (The girls continue to comfort and support Natsuki as they wait for the ambulance to arrive, offering words of encouragement and reassurance. However, just before the ambulance can arrive, Natsuki lets out a","completion":"piercing scream as her water breaks, and it becomes clear that Sakura is on her way. The girls quickly help Natsuki onto a stretcher and rush her out to the ambulance, where they follow her to the hospital. Hours later, Natsuki gives birth to a healthy baby girl, whom she names Sakura after the little one\'s spirited kicks during the meeting in the clubroom. The girls stay by her side throughout the entire labor, offering support and encouragement every step of the way. As they welcome Sakura into the world, the girls realize just how strong their bond truly is - not just as friends, but as a family. And from that day on, they know that they\'ll always be there for each other, no matter what life throws their way."},{"prompt":"What is the word for pooping in the manga?","completion":"In Japanese manga, the term most commonly associated with pooping is \\"Unko\\" (うんこ). This term is a casual, somewhat childish way of referring to poop or feces. However, as with many elements of language, the specific word or phrase used can vary depending on the context, the characters involved, the tone of the manga (whether it\'s for children, teens, or adults), and the intention of the author. So, while \\"Unko\\" is a common term, manga might also use more formal or euphemistic language to refer to the act of pooping, depending on the situation."},{"prompt":"What signs indicate pooping in manga?","completion":"In manga, as with much of visual storytelling, artists rely on a variety of visual cues and symbols to imply actions or states without explicitly showing them. When it comes to pooping or the need to use the restroom, several indicators might be used, depending on the tone of the manga (comical, serious, etc.), the intended audience, and the cultural context. Here are some common visual cues and symbols: 1. **Facial Expressions**: Characters might have distressed, uncomfortable, or strained expressions to indicate they need to use the bathroom. The level of exaggeration in the expression can vary widely. 2. **Sweat Drops**: Frequently used in manga and anime to show nervousness, embarrassment, or discomfort, large sweat drops on a character\'s forehead or face might indicate an urgent need to go to the bathroom. 3. **Squatting Position or Dancing Around**: Characters might be shown in a semi-squatting position or dancing around in discomfort, trying to hold it in. 4. **Rushed Movements**: There might be panels showing the character running or moving quickly with speed lines, indicating a rush to find a restroom. 5. **Toilet Symbols**: Sometimes, a simple visual cue like a toilet sign or the character in or near a restroom can be used to imply the act without showing or saying anything explicit. 6. **Dialogue or Thought Bubbles**: Characters might think or say phrases indicating their need to go, using various euphemisms or direct terms (e.g., \\"I can\'t hold it anymore!\\" or \\"I need to find a bathroom!\\"). 7. **Visual Sound Effects**: Onomatopoeic words for desperation or the act itself might be used around the character, although this would be more common in comedic contexts. 8. **Stylized Lines or Backgrounds**: In some cases, backgrounds might change to patterns or colors that signify discomfort or urgency, or there might be lines emanating from the character to show stress or pressure. 9. **Cloudy or Whirling Symbols**: Around the abdomen to indicate discomfort or the need to go. 10. **Character is Missing from the Scene Suddenly**: If a character urgently needs to leave a scene without much explanation and then returns looking relieved, it might be implied they had to go to the bathroom. These indicators are highly dependent on the context of the story and the style of the manga artist. They\'re often played for laughs in comedic manga but can be portrayed more subtly in serious narratives."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

Against this backdrop, the incorporation of robust security best practices, such as Cyber essentials, ISO27000 series standards, NIST800, COBIT, and GDPR, becomes imperative. These frameworks, when amalgamated with stringent information security policies, regulations, procedures, and guidelines, serve as a quintessential mechanism for enhancing an organisation\'s security posture, ensuring the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information assets. Cyber Essentials, a government-backed and industry-supported scheme, aids in safeguarding organisations against a plethora of common cyber attacks. Implementing Cyber Essentials can significantly enhance an organisation\'s cybersecurity landscape by encapsulating fundamental technical controls; an effective defense against the vast majority of cyber attacks (Cyber Essentials, 2021). Furthermore, the certification offers a strong statement of basic cybersecurity hygiene, which can bolster the organisation\'s reputation, fostering trust among clients and stakeholders. The ISO27000 series, particularly ISO/IEC 27001, delineates a framework for an information security management system (ISMS) offering a holistic approach to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of corporate information. By adopting the ISO27000 standards, organisations benefit from a systematic and rigorous approach towards identifying, assessing, and managing information security risks (ISO/IEC 27001:2013). In addition, aligning with these standards can substantially ameliorate regulatory compliance efforts, providing a competitive advantage and potentially mitigating financial penalties associated with non-compliance. In conjunction, the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s NIST SP 800 series offers comprehensive guidelines and practices for managing cybersecurity risks. NIST’s framework facilitates the enhancement of an organisation\'s resilience against cyber threats, through the harmonious integration of its core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover, into the organisation\'s risk management process (NIST, 2018). Adoption of the NIST framework not only augments cybersecurity defenses but also advocates for a culture of continuous improvement and risk-based thinking. Moreover, COBIT, as an IT management framework developed by ISACA, assists organisations in bridging the gap between control requirements, technical issues, and business risks. Implementing COBIT can empower an organisation to better manage its IT resources, ensuring that they are aligned with its overall business objectives, fostering operational excellence and mitigating IT-related risks effectively (ISACA, 2018). Lastly, compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is paramount for organisations processing the personal data of EU citizens. GDPR has catalysed a significant shift towards stronger privacy rights, compelling organisations to adopt stringent data protection measures. Adherence to GDPR not only mitigates the risk of hefty fines but also enhances customer confidence and trust, thereby bestowing a competitive edge in the global marketplace (European Commission, 2016). In concert, these security best practices, coupled with information security policies, regulations, procedures, and guidelines, serve as the linchpin for fortifying an organisation’s defense mechanisms against the burgeoning spectrum of cyber threats. Their implementation not only secures critical information assets but also engenders a culture of security-mindedness across the organisation, fostering both internal and external confidence in its operational resilience. In essence, the strategic integration of these frameworks into an organisation\'s cybersecurity strategy can significantly mitigate risks, enhance regulatory compliance, fortify trust among stakeholders, and ultimately, secure a sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, navigating the complex landscape of cybersecurity necessitates a multifaceted approach, anchored in the adoption of these meticulously crafted guidelines and frameworks, which collectively epitomize the gold standard for cybersecurity excellence.

This essay explores the multifaceted benefits an organization can reap from incorporating well-regarded cybersecurity frameworks such as Cyber Essentials, ISO 27000 series standards, NIST SP 800 series, COBIT, and conforming to regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Cyber Essentials, a government-backed, industry-supported scheme, aids organizations in safeguarding themselves against a vast range of the most common cyber attacks. The simplicity of its framework allows even those with limited expertise to secure their information assets effectively. Companies that achieve Cyber Essentials certification demonstrate to their customers, investors, and other stakeholders their commitment to cybersecurity (Holt and Woods, 2020). This not only boosts trust and reputation but also offers a competitive advantage, increasingly vital in sectors where cyber threats are prevalent. The ISO 27000 series, particularly ISO/IEC 27001, provides a comprehensive set of requirements for an information security management system (ISMS). Implementing these standards helps organizations systematically examine their information security risks, including threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts, thus adopting an overarching management process to ensure risks are addressed effectively (Sen and Borle, 2017). The certification under these standards not only enhances an organization\'s security posture but also aligns with global best practices, facilitating international business relationships and market entries. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800 series offers a wealth of guidelines that cover a broad spectrum of cybersecurity topics, including risk management, cloud computing, and mobile security, to name a few. Adopting NIST frameworks can help organizations establish a scalable and flexible approach to managing cybersecurity risk that is aligned with business objectives, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and resilience against emerging threats (Mattord and Whitman, 2020). COBIT, developed by ISACA, is a framework for managing and governing enterprise IT environments. Its principles, practices, analytical tools, and models are geared toward delivering value through information technology, aligning IT strategy with the business, and achieving operational excellence through reliable, efficient application of technology (Van Grembergen, 2018). Embracing COBIT can lead organizations to improved decision-making regarding IT investments, enhanced operational efficiencies, and greater compliance with regulatory requirements. Furthermore, compliance with the GDPR not only ensures organizations protect the personal data of EU citizens but also signals a commitment to privacy and data protection on a global scale. GDPR enforcement has prompted organizations worldwide to reassess their data handling practices, leading to enhanced data security measures, increased transparency, and fostering a culture of privacy that resonates well with consumers increasingly concerned about their personal data’s privacy and security (Voigt and Von dem Bussche, 2017). In conclusion, integrating cybersecurity frameworks like Cyber Essentials, ISO 27000 series standards, NIST SP 800 series, and COBIT into organizational practices, alongside adhering to regulations such as the GDPR, not only fortifies an organization\'s cybersecurity posture but also catalyzes operational efficiencies, enhances compliance, and fosters trust among stakeholders. Organizations that judiciously adopt these measures stand at a vantage point, navigating the digital landscape with resilience and certainty. In the realm of information security, where threats continuously evolve, such comprehensive and strategic approach to cybersecurity is indispensable for sustaining and advancing business objectives in a digitally interconnected world.

It’s been 3 minutes and she still hasn’t shown up.” Sayori: “I’m not sure. She was really excited about discussing the book we read for this meeting, so it’s weird that she’s not here yet.” Yuri: “Should we give her a call or text to see if everything’s okay?” Monika: “Good idea. I’ll shoot her a text to check in.” (A few minutes later, and there’s no response from Natsuki.) Sayori: “Maybe her phone died or she lost track of time. She can be kind of forgetful sometimes.” Yuri: “Perhaps we should start the discussion without her and she can catch up when she arrives?” Monika: “I agree. Let’s not wait too long for her, but we can always fill her in later if she shows up.” (As the club members begin discussing the book, Natsuki suddenly bursts through the door, panting and out of breath.) Natsuki: “Sorry I’m late, guys! I got caught up in something and lost track of time. OOF!!! Gosh, it feels like Sakura is trying to kick her way out of my stomach…” Monika: “Are you okay, Natsuki? You look like you’re in pain.” Natsuki: “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just…ow! Jeez! Calm down, Sakura, I’m trying to talk here! Sorry, she’s just really active today.” Yuri: “Are you sure you’re okay? Maybe you should sit down and take a breather.” Natsuki: “I’m fine, really. Let’s just continue with the discussion. I can catch up- ACK!!! Sakura, knock it off!” Sayori: “Are you sure you don’t need to go see the nurse or something? You look like you’re in a lot of pain.” Natsuki: “I’m fine, I promise.

Okay, maybe I should get to the nurse. Sakura is really kicking up a storm in there. Sorry, guys. I’ll catch up with you all later.” (She stands up slowly, wincing in pain, and heads out of the clubroom with the support of her friends. A few minutes later, she returns with a worried look on her face.) Natsuki: “Guys…the nurse said that I’m showing signs of early labor. I might have to go to the hospital…” Monika: “Oh my gosh, Natsuki! Are you serious? Should we call an ambulance?” Natsuki: “Y-Y-Yeah…I left my phone at home. Can one of you please call for me?” Sayori: “Of course, Natsuki! We’ll make sure you get to the hospital safely.” Yuri: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll take care of everything. Just focus on staying calm and we’ll get you the help you need.” (The club members quickly call for an ambulance and keep Natsuki company while waiting for it to arrive. They reassure her and try to keep her calm as they wait for medical assistance to arrive - all while her contractions become more frequent.) Natsuki: “I-I can’t believe this is happening. Sakura wasn’t supposed to be due for another few weeks. I’m so scared…” Monika: “It’s going to be okay, Natsuki. Just focus on breathing and staying calm. The ambulance will be here soon and they’ll take care of everything.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. We’ll stick by your side through this and make sure you and Sakura are both okay.” Yuri: “Try to stay positive, Natsuki. You’re strong and you’ll get through this. We’ll be here every step of the way.” (The girls continue to comfort and support Natsuki as they wait for the ambulance to arrive, offering words of encouragement and reassurance. However, just before the ambulance can arrive, Natsuki lets out a piercing scream as her water breaks, and it becomes clear that Sakura is on her way.) Monika: “Oh my goodness, it’s happening! Stay calm, Natsuki, the ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “We’re here for you, Natsuki. You’re going to be okay, just focus on breathing and staying strong.” Yuri: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll make sure you and Sakura are both safe and taken care of. Just keep breathing and try to relax.” (With the support of her friends, Natsuki manages to stay as calm as possible as the ambulance comes into view.

With the help of her friends, the paramedics, and the hospital staff, Natsuki successfully gives birth to a healthy baby girl, whom she names Sakura in honor of the little kicker who couldn’t wait to come into the world.

They realize that in moments like these, when the unexpected happens, their bond as friends and support system shines brighter than ever.

For the purposes of your question, it seems you\'re asking about the ball game as depicted in the original series and its subsequent mentions, rather than the card game from the reimagined series. # Original Battlestar Galactica (1978) In the original series, \\"Pyramid\\" was less detailed, and as such, specific rules and gameplay mechanics were not fully explored within the episodes themselves. The sport was mentioned and formed part of the cultural backdrop of the series rather than a focal point. # Reimagined Battlestar Galactica (2003) In the reimagined series, the sport is referred to as \\"Pyramid\\" in terms of the card game and \\"Triad\\" for the physical sport, reversing the terminology from the original series. The physical sport, similar in some respects to the one originally called Pyramid, is depicted with more detail: Playing Field and Objective: - **Triad (Physical Sport)**: Played in a triangular area, the game aims to score points by throwing a ball into a goal. The specifics of the playing area, including its size and markings, are not extensively detailed, but it is clear that the gameplay involves physical contact and strategic play. Rules and Gameplay: For the card game Pyramid, there are specified rules and gameplay mechanics, but for the physical sport (Triad in the reimagined series), the details are less clear: - It\'s played by two teams, and it\'s a contact sport, suggesting physicality similar to basketball or rugby, though with its unique characteristics. - The sport involves strategy, speed, and strength, with players often depicted engaging in intense physical competition to control the ball and score points. Cultural Significance: In both series, sports such as Pyramid (1978) and Triad/Pyramid (2003) serve to highlight the cultural continuity and richness of the human societies in the Twelve Colonies of Kobol. They offer insights into the characters\' personalities and backgrounds, showing how cultural elements persist even in the dire circumstances of fleeing genocidal Cylons. # Conclusion While the specific rules and gameplay of Pyramid as a ball sport in the original \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" and its adaptation into Triad in the reimagined series aren\'t exhaustively detailed, the sport serves as an important cultural and narrative element within both series. It is showcased as a physically demanding, strategic game that draws parallels to various real-world sports, emphasizing teamwork, physical prowess, and the competitive spirit of the human colonies."},{"prompt":"türkçe Rename dui70 to dui71 and hex edit VAN.dll to reflect this","completion":"Dui70\'yi dui71 olarak yeniden adlandırmak ve VAN.dll dosyasını bunu yansıtacak şekilde hex düzenlemek için, dosya ve dizinleri yeniden adlandırma ve binary dosyalar üzerinde düzenlemeler yapma becerilerinizi kullanmanız gerekir.

Eğer dui70 bir dosya veya dizin adı ise, işletim sisteminizin standart yöntemleri (örneğin, Windows\'ta sağ tıklayıp \\"Yeniden Adlandır\\" seçeneği) ile yeniden adlandırabilirsiniz. Eğer bu bir kod içindeki bir referans veya bağımlılık ise, kodunuzun o kısmını dui71 olarak güncellemeniz gerekecek. # VAN.dll Dosyasını Hex Editörle Düzenleme VAN.dll içindeki herhangi bir referansı \\"dui70\\"den \\"dui71\\"e güncellemek için, bir hex düzenleyici kullanmanız gerekir. Hex düzenleyiciler, dosyaları hexadecimal formatında açmanıza ve düzenlemenize izin verir. Bu adım, Windows\'un bazı temel işlevlerini veya diğer sistem fonksiyonlarını bozabilir, bu yüzden dikkatli olmak önemlidir. İşlem adımları şunlardır: 1. **Yedek Alın**: Değiştirmek istediğiniz VAN.dll dosyasının bir kopyasını alın, böylece herhangi bir hata olduğunda orijinal dosyaya geri dönebilirsiniz. 2. **Hex Düzenleyici Kullanın**: Hex Düzenleyici\'yi açın (örneğin, HxD, Hex Fiend, vb.) ve VAN.dll dosyasını bu programda açın. 3. **\\"dui70\\" Referanslarını Bulun**: Hex düzenleyicisi içindeki arama özelliğini kullanarak, \\"dui70\\" metni için dosya içinde arama yapın. Bu, genellikle ASCII modunda arama yaparak bulunabilir. 4. **Düzenleme**: \\"dui70\\" metninin bulunduğu her yeri dikkatli bir şekilde \\"dui71\\" ile değiştirin. Bu, genellikle karakterleri doğrudan yazarak veya hexadecimal değerlerini değiştirerek yapılır. 5. **Değişiklikleri Kaydedin**: Değişikliklerinizi yaptıktan sonra, dosyayı kaydedin ve hex düzenleyiciden çıkın. 6. **Test Edin**: VAN.dll dosyasını içeren yazılımı veya sistemi tekrar başlatın ve değişikliklerin beklenen şekilde çalışıp çalışmadığını kontrol edin.

dışında. Bu tür veri genellikle makine kodu, bellek dump\'ları veya düşük seviyeli dosya içerikleri gibi karmaşık ve spesifik yapıları temsil eder. İşleminizi gerçekleştirmek için daha detaylı ve kontekst bağlamında bir açıklama, aynı zamanda belirli bir yazılım veya aracın kullanımı gerekebilir. Eğer bir dosyadaki belirli bir metni (örneğin, dui70\'i dui71 olarak) değiştirmek istiyorsanız ve bu işlemi bir hex editör ile yapmak istiyorsanız, genel olarak şu adımları izleyebilirsiniz: 1. Güvenilir bir hex editörü edinin ve yükleyin. 2. VAN.dll dosyasını hex editörü ile açın. 3. Hex editöründe arama (Search) fonksiyonunu kullanarak \\"dui70\\" (ve ya onun hex olarak karşılığı olan ifadeyi; metin dosyası içindeki temsiline bağlı olarak) arayın. 4. Bulduğunuz \\"dui70\\" metnini (ve ya onun hex olarak karşılığı olan ifadeyi) dikkatlice \\"dui71\\" ile değiştirin. 5. Dosyayı kaydedip çıkın. Ancak, bu tür düzenlemeleri yaparken çok dikkatli olmanız gerekir. Hexadecimal düzenleme, dosyanın bozulmasına veya hedeflenen yazılımın çalışmaz hale gelmesine yol açabilir. Bu işlemleri yapmadan önce, dosyanın bir yedeğini almanız önemle tavsiye edilir. Ayrıca, bazı durumlarda metin uzunluğu değişiklikleri veya dosya içerisindeki referansların güncellenmesi gibi ek adımlar gerektirebilir. Bu tür bir değişiklik yapmadan önce, özellikle bir üretim ortamında, tüm riskleri ve prosedürleri dikkatle gözden geçirin."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

Let’s make it a night to remember!” Scene 4: Preparing the Performance - Backstage, Glitter helps Gloopy prepare. She applies a bit of her glitter to make his transformations sparkle in the night.

As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy’s shapes, combined with Glitter’s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms. Scene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell - As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they’re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy’s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art.

This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‘infinite, forever, never ending’?” Alien (with a hiss): “Ah, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy’s Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion.

Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. \'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give \'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.\' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up. Plus, seeing “Gloopy and Glitter” featured tells us they’re betting on the blobby duo. Exciting times ahead!

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra! Extra!/The Magic Trick/Treasure Hunt/The Forgotten Memory (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:00 Ultimate Muscle: Making The Cut (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:30 Code Lyoko: Guided Missile - 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown: Finding Omi - 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: The Barren Planet of Shadows/Lost in Gloopiter - 10:00 Sonic X: Satellite Swindle (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya: Un-Reality TV (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 11:00 Johnny Test: Johnny To The Centre of the Earth/Phat Johnny - 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man: Why I Hate Gym Forum Thread Title: “The Shift to CW4KIDS.tv - Observing Website Updates & Pokémon Episode Airings” User1: WebWizKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:47 AM Have you all checked out cw4kids.com lately? Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn\'t confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn\'t World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn\'t premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu\'s Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are! With the CW4Kids rebrand right around the corner, along with some fantastic new series, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best in animation entertainment. The countdown to the big reveal is on, and we hope you’re all ready for the switchover’s grand finale! User6: AnimationHistorian Posted on March 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s been quite the journey from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids, and I think we’re all curious to see how they’ll stick the landing with this rebrand. Shorts like “The Gees” show an appreciation for variety, and I think it’s a testament to the care put into this transition. Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history. Meanwhile, let’s celebrate our top-rated shows—they’re shaping the new legacy of CW4Kids. Keep the conversations and your passion for the toons flowing! User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix.

This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait!

Also, here\'s the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids\' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition. Stay tuned, and thanks for your engagement and excitement during this transformative period for CW4Kids! Write a tweet on Dec 30 during the final broadcast of KWB, where the promos say the name change is coming next week, there’s now a longer 1 minute promo showing clips of all the current shows saying “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name” Also, something peculiar at the end, more specifically a clip 🎉✨ As we bid a fond farewell to #KidsWB this Dec 30, don’t miss our heartwarming 1-minute promo during the final broadcast! 📺 Celebrating our current shows & the memories we’ve shared - “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” 🔄💫 Plus, keep an eye out for a peculiar clip at the end… what could it mean? 🤔🚀 #CW4Kids ComingNextWeek 🌈 Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Promo Teaser – A Glimpse into CW4Kids’ Future” User1: ToonArchivist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:10 PM Did everyone catch that final promo during “Johnny Test” on Kids’ WB today? It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love. CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 PM We’re thrilled you all caught the promo and are excited about the transition! While we can’t reveal much just yet, rest assured that CW4Kids is dedicated to bringing you quality animation and exciting new shows. “Coming Soon” means new adventures are on the horizon, so stay tuned for more updates and thank you for sticking with us through this new chapter! Write a follow up where slowing down the promo confirms it, it’s a clip of Pogoriki the Rabbit playing Forum Thread Title: “Decoding the CW4Kids Teaser: Pogoriki Spotted!” User1: DetectiveToon Posted on January 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM Folks, get your detective hats on because I’ve done some sleuthing on that CW4Kids promo! After slowing it down frame by frame, it’s confirmed—the peculiar clip at the end is none other than Pogoriki, the Rabbit, playing around! “GoGoRiki” fans, rejoice! Looks like our speculations about the new show were spot on. How’s that for a new year surprise? User2: FutureAnimator Posted on January 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM Wow, DetectiveToon, nice catch! Pogoriki making an appearance is a solid confirmation that “GoGoRiki” is indeed joining CW4Kids. This playful rabbit hopping into the new lineup feels like a fresh beginning. Can’t wait to see what kind of adventures Pogoriki and pals bring to Saturday mornings! User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on January 2, 2024, at 9:30 AM This totally amps up my excitement for the CW4Kids launch! I’ve always found Pogoriki to be one of the most entertaining characters. Seeing him in action in the promo, even if just for a second, assures me that “GoGoRiki” is going to inject some serious fun into the lineup. CW4Kids is pulling out all the stops! User4: RetroRewind Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:00 AM Pogoriki? That’s fantastic news! Such a clever way to announce “GoGoRiki” without explicitly saying it. I’ve missed the humor and vibrant animation style of the show. Looks like CW4Kids isn’t just holding onto legacies; they’re really embracing new tales and characters. Kudos to the team for the smart reveal! User5: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:30 AM DetectiveToon, your investigative skills are top-notch! A cameo by Pogoriki is a promising nod to the humor and whimsy we can expect from CW4Kids. It’s comforting to see a blend of nostalgia with new introductions. “GoGoRiki” fans, prepare for laughter and escapades with the rabbit that has charmed so many! User6: AnimationAficionado Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM Absolutely thrilling detective work! “GoGoRiki” entering CW4Kids could signify a stronger focus on family-friendly comedy and adventures.

User1: DetectiveToon Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:45 AM Hey @CW4KidsForumMod, out of curiosity and just for clarity, which company do you officially represent here in the forum? Is it Warner Bros, still overseeing some parts of CW4Kids during this transitional period, or are you directly with 4Kids Entertainment now? The blend of old and new has been fascinating, and I’m just trying to understand from whose perspective we’re seeing these exciting updates! 🙂 CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hi @DetectiveToon, great question! I’m here representing 4Kids Entertainment. While we’re currently in the midst of this transitional period and working closely with Warner Bros to ensure a smooth handover for CW4Kids, my role is to directly engage with and update our amazing community on behalf of 4Kids Entertainment. We’re committed to maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday morning cartoons special while infusing the lineup with fresh and exciting content. Thanks for your keen interest, and don’t hesitate to reach out with more questions! Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hey, @SquishSuperFan and everyone else feeling the ‘Squish’ blues! We appreciate your passion for the show and understand your disappointment. Our goal at CW4Kids is to create a diverse and dynamic viewing experience that resonates with our audience’s evolving tastes. While there are no current plans to bring back ‘Squish’, we’re always evaluating our lineup to ensure it delivers the best in animated entertainment. Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we navigate this exciting chapter for CW4Kids! Write a reply from the mod suggesting some alternatives, and saying while the show won’t return anytime soon, here’s some other great stuff CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:30 PM Hey @SquishSuperFan and all our dedicated viewers, I totally hear you on missing ‘Squish’ and the unique flavor it brought to our lineup. While it’s true that ‘Squish’ won’t be returning anytime soon, we’re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in ‘Squish’. For those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I’d highly recommend giving “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a shot. It’s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table. Another show that’s been a hit among our audience is “GoGoRiki.” Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers. And, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” has been making waves. It introduces fresh adventures and characters that continue to expand the beloved Pokemon universe. We understand that while these alternatives may not replace ‘Squish’, they represent the diverse and entertaining content CW4Kids strives to deliver. Our goal is to fill your Saturday mornings with stories that make you laugh, think, and dream. Thank you again for your understanding, enthusiasm, and support. CW4Kids is here to bring you the very best in animation, and we’re excited to have you with us on this journey!

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show’s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this? User2: ToonAdventurer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM I saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that “The lab is now closing” message. The alternatives suggested were “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic,” right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” but it’s a good nudge to explore the new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM Certainly a creative way to say goodbye to “Johnny Test” and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on—futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel’s new direction perfectly. I’ve been a fan of “Johnny Test” for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give “GoGoRiki” a shot next Saturday! User4: NewEraToonGoer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. “Johnny Test” has been a staple, but the ad’s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” caught my eye; it has that quirky charm “Johnny Test” fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites. User5: DigitalCartoonDiva Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM That “The lab is now closing” ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids’ commitment to its new era. “Viva Pinata” and “Chaotic” seem like they’ll fill the action-comedy void left by “Johnny Test.” Excited to see what these shows have to offer! User6: RetroToonLover Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM The farewell ad for “Johnny Test” was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they’re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. “Johnny Test” will be missed, but the network’s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle. Here’s to new adventures! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:45 PM It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to bid farewell to “Johnny Test.” The “lab is now closing” ad was our way of softly transitioning fans towards our exciting new lineup, rendered in our fresh presentational style. We’re eager for you to dive into the adventures that “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic” have in store.

Gloopy did a fantastic job hosting, giving us insights and laughter throughout. I loved how they acknowledged the journey since “just after Christmas,” making it clear they value the past few months of transition. What did everyone think of the sneak peeks and the overall direction CW4Kids is taking? User2: DigitalDawn Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:15 PM The preview show was nothing short of spectacular! The acknowledgment of the transition period really hit home, showing they care about the seamless shift from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids. Every sneak peek, especially “Pokemon Horizons” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds,” has me hyped for April 13th. Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey since Christmas warmed my heart - a nod to the fans who’ve been here through it all. User3: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:30 PM I appreciated the nod to the transition period—it felt respectful. Gloopy hosting was a stroke of genius; it brought a familiar face to the forefront, bridging old and new. The previews for “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” and “Chaotic” looked promising. CW4Kids seems dedicated to leveraging both nostalgia and innovation, which is exciting! User4: RetroRewind Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:45 PM The whole event was a classy way to introduce us to the future of CW4Kids. It’s like they’re carefully curating this blend of past favorites and new adventures for us. I was particularly impressed with the sneak peek of “Sonic X” starting from Episode 1 - smart move to draw in a wider audience. Acknowledging the transition gave a sense of continuity and respect for the audience’s journey. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:00 PM There was something very comforting about tonight’s show. Recognizing the time “just after Christmas” until now as a significant period of CW4Kids’ evolution shows they’re thoughtful about this rebranding process. The mix of upcoming shows has me convinced CW4Kids is setting a new standard for Saturday morning lineups. Can’t wait to see where they take us next! User6: NewEraNick Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:15 PM Truly an energizing preview event! Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey “just after Christmas” subtly reassured us that while we’re moving forward, the past months were just as valuable in shaping what CW4Kids is about to become. The diverse range of shows previewed tonight paints a bright future ahead. Excitement is an understatement! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:30 PM Thrilled to see all the positive feedback from tonight’s Spring Preview Extravaganza! Our aim was to celebrate both the journey we’ve embarked on since “just after Christmas” and the exciting path ahead.

Forum Thread Title: “4KidsTV Schedule Shake-Up: ‘GoGoRiki’ Gains More Ground & Farewell to ‘Tomodachi Life’ & ‘One Piece’” User1: EternalToonFan Posted on April 21, 2024, at 9:45 AM Heads up! Starting next week, “GoGoRiki” is snagging an additional slot on the 4KidsTV channel, this time taking over “Shaman King” at 11 AM. With its growing popularity on CW4Kids, it seems “GoGoRiki” is set to become even more of a mainstay. But there’s more—“Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” are bidding us farewell come May 1st, replaced by two shows currently exclusive to CW4Kids. The winds of change are certainly blowing through 4KidsTV. Thoughts? User2: RetroAnimeWatcher Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:00 AM Wow, “GoGoRiki” really is taking over! Surprised to see “Shaman King” getting the boot, but “GoGoRiki” has been a hit, so it makes sense. As for “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” leaving, it’s a shame. “One Piece” especially has been a long-standing favorite. Curious to find out which CW4Kids shows will fill in their slots. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:15 AM It’s bittersweet seeing “Tomodachi Life” go; those Miis brought unique charm and humor. “One Piece” had its epic journey too. The removal didn’t come as a surprise, though, considering they stopped streaming on 4kids.tv early March. Now I’m intrigued about which CW4Kids shows will transition over to the 24/7 channel. Any guesses? User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:30 AM “I’ll miss the Miis” from “Tomodachi Life,” too. That show had such a quirky, fun vibe. Exciting to hear that “GoGoRiki” is expanding its presence, though! I’m betting “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and possibly “Code Lyoko” could be the ones to make the jump to 4KidsTV. Both have been stellar on CW4Kids and seem like natural fits to broaden their audience. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:45 AM The departure of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” surely marks the end of an era, but it’s also thrilling to see CW4Kids shows stepping up. “GoGoRiki” nabbing another slot is impressive. It kind of reflects 4KidsTV’s adaptation to viewer preferences. Eagerly awaiting the announcement of which CW4Kids shows will fill those vacancies come May. User6: NostalgicNick Posted on April 21, 2024, at 11:00 AM “GoGoRiki” really is on a roll! I understand the logistics behind the changes, especially with streaming limitations signaling “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” were on their way out. It’s a smart play to bring more CW4Kids content into the 4KidsTV fold – keeps the brand cohesive and capitalizes on what’s working. Can’t wait to see what’s next! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 21, 2024, at 11:15 AM We appreciate all your feedback and understanding regarding the recent schedule changes at 4KidsTV. “GoGoRiki’s” additional timeslot is a testament to its success, and while we say goodbye to “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece,” we’re excited about bringing more of the CW4Kids experience to our 24/7 channel.

Forum Thread Title: “Unexpected Logo & Credits Swap During ‘Tomodachi Life’ & ‘One Piece’ Airings – April 19th” User1: ToonTalkerTerry Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:00 PM Did anyone else catch the odd change-up at the end of today’s “Tomodachi Life” episode on 4KidsTV? Instead of the usual Nintendo, TV Asahi, and Gallop logos during the Split Screen Credits, we got an S4C and Inovism logo. Even the copyright tag was swapped to show a different show title, though the credits were still for TL. Then, the same thing happened with “One Piece” at 7pm – the Toei logo was replaced with Animation Studio Petersburg! Looks like the logo and copyright tags changed over early? What’s going on? User2: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:15 PM Wow, I thought I was seeing things! That was definitely not the usual ending credit scene for either show. Maybe they’re gearing up for the replacements coming in May but jumped the gun on changing the visuals? It does seem like a mix-up in preparing for the transition of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” out of the lineup. User3: RetroRewind Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:30 PM This feels like a big oops moment on someone’s part. Showing S4C and Inovism logos during “Tomodachi Life” and then Animation Studio Petersburg for “One Piece” is quite the premature switch. They must be setting the stage for whatever’s taking their slots, but someone got a bit too eager with updating the credits! User4: FutureToonFan Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:45 PM It’s a peculiar error for sure, but kind of exciting if you think about it. It hints at the direction 4KidsTV is taking after “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” say their farewells. Swapping the logos early must’ve been a mistake, but it gives us a glimpse into what’s coming. Animation Studio Petersburg and S4C/Inovism involvement sounds promising for the new content! User5: AnimationAfficionado Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:00 PM Certainly, an unexpected sneak peek into the future! Mixing up the credits does spoil the surprise a bit, but I’m intrigued by what S4C, Inovism, and Animation Studio Petersburg will bring to the table. This mishap aside, it seems like 4KidsTV is prepping for a refreshed lineup with some serious creative power behind it. User6: NostalgicNick Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:15 PM Mistakes happen, but this one is pretty telling. It’s like getting an accidental peek at your birthday presents. S4C and Inovism on “Tomodachi Life” and Animation Studio Petersburg for “One Piece” – definitely interesting choices for partners. Curious to see how this early logo swap hints at the quality and direction of their replacements! 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:30 PM Apologies for the confusion during today’s airings of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece.” The updated logos and copyright tags were indeed a bit premature as we prepare for the exciting new shows set to debut in their slots in May.

Thoughts on these swaps? User2: RetroGamer Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I’m going to miss the quirky stories of “Tomodachi Life.” The island’s always been a bit of a virtual getaway for me. Swapping it with “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is intriguing, though. Alien slimes could bring a whole new dimension of comedy we haven’t seen before on the network. User3: PirateFan101 Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:15 AM As much as I love “One Piece,” its ratings have been trailing behind “Pokémon” for the last 6 months. It seems like a strategic move by 4KidsTV to refresh their lineup with shows that have the potential to attract a broader audience. “GoGoRiki” does have its charm, and it’ll be interesting to see how it fills the action-packed void left by our beloved pirates. User4: ToonAnalyst Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:30 AM To shed a bit more light on why “Tomodachi Life” is leaving, it primarily comes down to Nintendo moving away from 3DS support. The show, being based on a game for a platform that’s no longer actively supported, makes it a bit outdated for 4KidsTV’s dynamic and evolving lineup. As for “One Piece,” it’s really about the numbers. “Pokémon” has consistently outperformed it in ratings, making it a challenging environment for our pirate crew. In the entertainment business, especially in children’s programming, staying relevant and competitive is key. User5: NewEraNick Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:45 AM It’s sad to see two such unique shows go, but change is part of the TV landscape. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” sound like they’ll bring a lot of fresh energy and humor to the channel. Plus, considering the evolving interests of the audience, it seems like a natural progression. Here’s hoping they capture our imagination just as much! User6: AnimationAfficionado Posted on April 30, 2024, at 10:00 AM Farewell to the Miis and pirates. While “Tomodachi Life” offered an unparalleled slice-of-life experience and “One Piece” took us on countless high seas adventures, it’s exciting to think about the new narratives and laughter “Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” will bring. The realm of children’s animation is all about evolution and innovation. Let’s embrace the change! 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on April 30, 2024, at 10:15 AM We appreciate your thoughts and feelings on the transition from “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” to “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki.” Our goal at 4KidsTV is always to deliver engaging, diverse, and high-quality content that resonates with our viewers. Rest assured, these changes are made with a lot of thought and consideration for our audience’s evolving interests.

Вот несколько примеров использования `find` вместе с `grep` для поиска файлов и папок: # Искать Файлы По Имени: Чтобы найти все файлы, начиная с корня (`/`), которые соответствуют определённому шаблону, используйте `find` совместно с опцией `-name`: ```sh sudo find / -type f -name \\"шаблон*\\" ``` Замените `\\"шаблон*\\"` на ваш поисковый запрос. Обратите внимание на использование `sudo` для поиска начиная с корня, так как некоторые каталоги могут требовать повышенных привилегий для доступа. # Искать Папки По Имени: ```sh sudo find / -type d -name \\"имяпапки*\\" ``` Этот запрос ищет все папки, начиная с корня системы, чьи имена начинаются на \\"имяпапки\\". # Использование Grep Для Фильтрации Результатов: Если вы хотите использовать мощь `grep` для фильтрации найденных результатов (например, если вы ищете что-то более специфическое, чем просто соответствие шаблону), вы можете направить вывод `find` в `grep`: ```sh sudo find / -type f | grep \\"паттерн\\" ``` Здесь `\\"паттерн\\"` — это регулярное выражение, которое `grep` будет использовать для фильтрации имен найденных файлов. # Советы: - Использование `sudo` может быть необходимо для доступа ко всем директориям начиная с корня. Будьте осторожны при его использовании. - Чтобы ограничить глубину поиска и ускорить процедуру, используйте опцию `-maxdepth` с командой `find`. Например, чтобы искать только на двух уровнях глубины начиная с корня, можно использовать `sudo find / -maxdepth 2 -type f -name \\"шаблон*\\"`. - Важно помнить, что использование `find` начиная с корня может занять много времени и выдать много результатов, включая нежелательные системные файлы, так что выполнение команд с фильтрацией или ограничением глубины поиска может быть очень полезным. Помните, что `grep` сам по себе не ищет файлы или директории по имени, но его можно использовать для фильтрации содержимого файлов или для фильтрации списка файлов и директорий, полученного другими средствами, такими как `find`."},{"prompt":"как заставить find искать файлы начиная с директории какой-то","completion":"Чтобы команда `find` начинала поиск файлов с определённой директории, просто укажите эту директорию в качестве первого аргумента после `find`. Команда `find` будет искать в этой директории и всех её поддиректориях. Приведу несколько примеров. # Пример 1. Поиск Всех Файлов В Определённой Директории Допустим, вы хотите найти все файлы в директории `/home/username/Documents`. ```sh find /home/username/Documents -type f ``` Здесь `-type f` указывает `find` искать только файлы. # Пример 2. Поиск Файлов С Определённым Расширением Если вы хотите найти, к примеру, все файлы с расширением `.txt` в директории `/home/username/Documents`, используйте следующую команду: ```sh find /home/username/Documents -type f -name \\"*.txt\\" ``` # Пример 3. Поиск Папок Чтобы найти все поддиректории внутри `/home/username/Projects`, вы можете использовать: ```sh find /home/username/Projects -type d ``` Здесь `-type d` говорит `find` фильтровать результаты, чтобы отображались только директории. # Пример 4. Использование Grep Для Фильтрации Результатов Поиска Вы можете комбинировать `find` с `grep` для более сложной фильтрации результатов. Например, если вы ищете файлы, содержащие определённый текстовый шаблон в имени, в директории `/var/log`: ```sh find /var/log -type f | grep \\"pattern\\" ``` # Пример 5. Ограничение Глубины Поиска Если вы хотите ограничить глубину поиска, чтобы он не переходил глубже определённого уровня поддиректорий, используйте параметр `-maxdepth`. Например, для поиска файлов только внутри `/home/username/Documents` и его непосредственных поддиректориях: ```sh find /home/username/Documents -maxdepth 2 -type f ``` `-maxdepth 2` означает, что `find` будет искать в указанной директории и один уровень поддиректорий ниже. Эти базовые примеры покажут вам, как начать поиск файлов начиная с конкретной директории, используя команду `find`. Вы можете дополнительно настроить свой поиск, изменяя параметры и добавляя фильтры согласно вашим потребностям."},{"prompt":"что делает команда apt autoremove","completion":"Команда `apt autoremove` используется в системах на основе Debian (как Ubuntu), чтобы автоматически удалять пакеты, которые были автоматически установлены для удовлетворения зависимостей других пакетов и больше не требуются. Эта команда помогает освободить пространство на диске, удаляя ненужные пакеты, которые больше не связаны с установленными программами. Когда вы устанавливаете пакет в системе Debian или Ubuntu с помощью `apt` или `apt-get`, система также устанавливает другие пакеты, которые необходимы для его работы (называемые зависимостями). В некоторых случаях, когда вы удаляете исходный пакет, его зависимости не удаляются автоматически, оставляя ненужные пакеты, занимающие место на вашем диске. `apt autoremove` предназначена для автоматического решения этой проблемы. Пример использования: ```sh sudo apt autoremove ``` Эта команда: - Выполняет поиск пакетов, которые были автоматически установлены для удовлетворения зависимостей других пакетов, но больше не нужны. - Удаляет эти пакеты, освобождая пространство. Вы также можете комбинировать `autoremove` с `--purge` для удаления всей конфигурации, связанной с удаляемыми пакетами: ```sh sudo apt autoremove --purge ``` Это очистит все файлы конфигурации, ассоциированные с удаляемыми пакетами, что может быть полезно для более глубокой очистки системы."},{"prompt":"как происходить процесс использования зависимостей, почему после установки приложения некоторые зависимости можно удалять? Или когда мы скачиваем пакеты с помощью apt, мы скачиваем исходники, которые собираются с помощью других пакетов, которые устанавливаются для компиляции/интерпретации, а после не нужны или что?","completion":"Процесс использования зависимостей в системах на основе Debian (или в любой системе управления пакетами) следует определенной логике, которую полезно понимать, чтобы лучше управлять вашей системой. # Как Работают Зависимости Когда вы устанавливаете программное обеспечение через систему управления пакетами, как `apt`, система автоматически проверяет и устанавливает любые другие пакеты (зависимости), необходимые для его работы. Эти зависимости могут быть библиотеками, интерпретаторами языков программирования, утилитами или другим программным обеспечением, без которых целевое ПО не сможет функционировать должным образом. # Почему Можно Удалять Некоторые Зависимости После Установки 1. **Автоматически установленные зависимости**: Когда вы удаляете программу, некоторые из её зависимостей могут оставаться, если они не обозначены как явно требуемые другими установленными пакетами. В этом случае `apt autoremove` может их удалить. Это не значит, что зависимости были необходимы только для установки; скорее, после удаления оригинального пакета, эти зависимости больше не нужны ни одному из оставшихся установленных пакетов. 2. **Временные зависимости**: Иногда для сборки или компиляции программы из исходного кода нужны пакеты, которые не требуются после её установки (например, компиляторы или инструменты сборки). При установке пакетов через `apt` вы обычно скачиваете уже скомпилированные двоичные файлы, а не исходный код, поэтому процесс компиляции не происходит на вашей машине. Эти \\"временные\\" зависимости актуальны, если вы самостоятельно скачиваете исходный код и компилируете программы. # Пакеты и Исходный Код Когда вы используете `apt`, в большинстве случаев вы скачиваете предварительно скомпилированные двоичные пакеты из репозиториев Debian или Ubuntu, а не исходный код. Эти пакеты были скомпилированы и упакованы разработчиками дистрибутива или авторами программ, и они включают в себя уже скомпилированные исполняемые файлы и другие ресурсы, необходимые для работы программы. Зависимости, которые устанавливаются вместе с этими пакетами, чаще всего представляют собой другие двоичные пакеты, необходимые для функционирования устанавливаемого ПО. # Вывод Процесс управления зависимостями автоматизирован и эффективен, целью которого является упрощение процесса установки и обновления программного обеспечения. Команда `apt autoremove` полезна для поддержания чистоты системы, удаляя пакеты, которые были установлены как зависимости, но больше не используются ни одним из установленных пакетов."},{"prompt":"Как с помощью grep фильтровать независимо от регистра","completion":"Чтобы использовать `grep` для поиска текста без учёта регистра, вы можете воспользоваться опцией `-i` или `--ignore-case`. Эта опция указывает `grep` игнорировать различия между заглавными и строчными буквами при сопоставлении текста с шаблоном. # Примеры использования Допустим, вы хотите найти слово \\"example\\" в файле \\"text.txt\\", не обращая внимания на регистр: ```sh grep -i \\"example\\" text.txt ``` Эта команда найдёт и \\"Example\\", и \\"EXAMPLE\\", и любые другие комбинации регистра букв, такие как \\"eXaMpLe\\". Если вы хотите применить это ко всем файлам в текущей директории: ```sh grep -i \\"example\\" * ``` Или если вы ищете строки во всех файлах в текущем каталоге и подкаталогах: ```sh grep -iR \\"example\\" . ``` Здесь: - `-i` используется для игнорирования регистра букв. - `-R` или `-r` (оба варианта правильны) для рекурсивного поиска во всех поддиректориях. Использование опции `-i` делает `grep` значительно более гибким при работе с текстом, особенно когда вы не уверены в использовании регистра в исходных данных или когда источник данных использует различные стили написания."},{"prompt":"чем отличаются утилиты service и systemctl?","completion":"Утилиты `service` и `systemctl` используются в Linux для управления сервисами (демонами). Основное различие между ними заключается в системе инициализации, которую они используют. # Service Команда `service` – это более старая утилита, предназначенная для управления сервисами в системах, использующих `SysVinit` в качестве системы инициализации. `SysVinit` был первой системой инициализации в Unix и Linux, которая отвечала за стартовые процессы системы после загрузки ядра, а также за остановку системы. Пример использования команды `service`: ```sh sudo service nginx start sudo service nginx stop ``` Эта команда напрямую вызывает сценарии init, расположенные в `/etc/init.d/`, для запуска или остановки определённого сервиса. # Systemctl `Systemctl` – это часть `systemd`, более новой системы инициализации, которая была внедрена для замены `SysVinit` и других систем инициализации, таких как Upstart. `systemd` предлагает более быстрый процесс загрузки, зависимости между сервисами, возможность параллельного запуска задач и многое другое. Она стала стандартом для большинства современных дистрибутивов Linux. Пример использования команды `systemctl`: ```sh sudo systemctl start nginx sudo systemctl stop nginx ``` `Systemctl` предлагает более продвинутый интерфейс управления, позволяя не только запускать и останавливать сервисы, но и управлять их автозагрузкой, проверять статус, настраивать зависимости, изучать логи и многое другое. # Основные отличия 1. **Система инициализации**: `service` предназначен для использования в системах с `SysVinit`, а `systemctl` – в системах с `systemd`. 2. **Функциональность**: `systemctl` предлагает более широкий спектр функционала по сравнению с `service`, включая управление системными точками монтирования, таймерами, профилями безопасности и многое другое. 3. **Конфигурация**: Системы, использующие `systemd`, хранят свои конфигурации в файлах `.service`, расположенных в `/etc/systemd/system/` или `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`. В `SysVinit` конфигурации и скрипты инициализации обычно находятся в `/etc/init.d/`. 4. **Интерфейс**: Хотя обе команды позволяют управлять сервисами, `systemctl` предлагает более единый и современный интерфейс для выполнения этой задачи. В заключение, выбор между `service` и `systemctl` обычно диктуется тем, какую систему инициализации использует ваш дистрибутив Linux. С развитием `systemd`, `systemctl` становится более предпочтительным и универсальным инструментом для управления сервисами в Linux."},{"prompt":"как искать файл с помощью find, если знаешь только примерное название и нужно приведение к 1 регистру","completion":"Чтобы найти файл с использованием команды `find`, когда вы знаете только примерное название и хотите игнорировать регистр, можно использовать опцию `-iname` вместо `-name`. Опция `-iname` позволяет выполнять поиск без учёта регистра символов, что эффективно \\"приводит\\" весь текст к одному регистру для сравнения. Например, если вы хотите найти файл, который может называться \\"Example.txt\\", \\"example.TXT\\" или любым другим вариантом с различными комбинациями заглавных и строчных букв, вы можете использовать следующую команду: ```sh find /path/to/search -type f -iname \\"example.txt\\" ``` Здесь: - `/path/to/search` указывает директорию, в которой вы хотите начать поиск. Вы можете заменить этот путь на реальный путь к директории, в которой предполагается поиск, или использовать `.` для поиска в текущей директории. - `-type f` указывает `find` искать только файлы. - `-iname \\"example.txt\\"` позволяет найти файлы с именем \\"example.txt\\", не учитывая регистр символов. Если вы не уверены в полном названии файла, можете использовать подстановочные знаки (глобинг), например `*` для представления любого количества символов. Например, если вы помните только часть имени: ```sh find /path/to/search -type f -iname \\"*exam*\\" ``` Эта команда найдет все файлы, которые в своём имени содержат \\"exam\\" в любом регистре, например \\"Example.txt\\", \\"myexamnotes.doc\\", \\"EXAM-updates.pdf\\" и так далее. Использование `-iname` делает поиск с помощью `find` значительно более гибким, особенно в случаях, когда точное написание имени файла или его части неизвестно."},{"prompt":"Как в поиске может вылезать permission denied , если я использую утилиту find от имени root?","completion":"Получение сообщений об ошибке \\"Permission Denied\\" даже при использовании утилиты `find` от имени пользователя `root` может произойти по нескольким причинам. Несмотря на то что `root` имеет максимально возможные привилегии на большинстве системных и пользовательских файлов, существуют определённые ситуации, при которых даже `root` может столкнуться с ограничениями доступа: 1. **SELinux или AppArmor**: На системах, где активно используется SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) или AppArmor, могут быть наложены дополнительные политики безопасности, которые ограничивают доступ даже для пользователя `root`. Эти политики задаются на уровне ядра и могут предотвращать доступ к определённым файлам или каталогам в целях безопасности. 2. **Файловые системы, смонтированные с опцией `nosuid` или `nodev`**: Файловые системы, смонтированные с опциями `nosuid` или `nodev`, могут ограничивать выполнение определённых операций даже для `root`. Эти опции монтирования используются для увеличения безопасности системы, ограничивая возможности выполнения setuid-программ или создания специальных устройств на этих файловых системах. 3. **Файлы/файловые системы, смонтированные в режиме только для чтения (Read-Only)**: Если файл или файловая система смонтированы в режиме только для чтения, попытки записи или изменения могут привести к ошибкам, даже если вы используете `root`. 4. **Сетевые файловые системы с ограничениями на стороне сервера**: При работе с сетевыми файловыми системами, такими как NFS, права доступа могут определяться настройками на стороне сервера. Администратор сервера может настроить сервер NFS таким образом, что даже запросы от `root` на клиенте будут ограничены. 5. **Сломанные файлы или файловые системы**: В редких случаях проблемы с файловой системой или повреждённые файлы могут привести к ошибочным сообщениям о доступе. Для предотвращения вывода сообщений об ошибках \\"Permission Denied\\" при использовании `find`, можно перенаправить стандартный поток ошибок (stderr) в `/dev/null`: ```sh find /path/to/search -type f -name \\"pattern\\" 2>/dev/null ``` Эта команда ищет файлы, соответствующие шаблону \\"pattern\\", начиная с \\"path/to/search\\", и игнорирует все сообщения об ошибках, связанные с доступом."},{"prompt":"В линукс есть тип объекта - файл, d директория, s сокет, а c что это","completion":"В Linux и UNIX-подобных операционных системах символ `c` в результатах, например, команды `ls -l` или при выводе информации о файлах, обозначает \\"символьное устройство\\" (character device file). Символьные устройства – это один из двух типов специальных файлов, используемых для предоставления программам доступа к аппаратному оборудованию. В отличие от блочных устройств (обозначаемых как `b`), которые представляют собой устройства с доступом к данным по блокам (например, жёсткие диски), символьные устройства обеспечивают небуферизированный доступ в режиме потока данных. # Примеры символьных устройств: - **`/dev/null`** – специальный файл, который отбрасывает все записываемые в него данные (всё, что в него записывается, \\"исчезает\\"). - **`/dev/tty`** – представляет терминал (терминал пользователя, взаимодействующий с системой). - **`/dev/console`** – консоль системы, через которую происходит вывод системных сообщений. - **`/dev/pts/*`** – представляет псевдотерминальные устройства, используемые для эмуляции терминалов, например, в контексте удалённых подключений через SSH. # Различия между символьными и блочными устройствами: - **Символьные устройства** работают с данными посимвольно, то есть по одному байту за раз. Обычно они используются для устройств, которые взаимодействуют с данными в режиме реального времени, таких как клавиатуры или последовательные порты. - **Блочные устройства** позволяют доступ к данным по блокам фиксированного размера и подходят для устройств, предполагающих хранение и чтение данных, таких как жёсткие диски, SSD или USB-накопители. Работа с этими специальными файлами позволяет программам и системным вызовам общаться с аппаратным обеспечением на более высоком уровне абстракции, не вдаёт в подробности работы с самим железом напрямую."},{"prompt":"Можно ли с помощью systemctl запустить сервис не из обычной папки инициализации (/etc/systemd/system/) а из своей директории какой-нибудь","completion":"Да, вы можете управлять сервисами `systemd` из нестандартных директорий, но для этого потребуется несколько дополнительных шагов, поскольку `systemd` по умолчанию ищет юнит-файлы (unit files) в предопределённых директориях, таких как `/etc/systemd/system/`, `/run/systemd/system/`, и `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`. Чтобы использовать юнит-файлы из другой директории, вы можете: # 1. Символическая ссылка Самый простой способ — создать символическую ссылку на ваш юнит-файл в одной из стандартных директорий. Например, если ваш юнит-файл `your-service.service` находится в `/home/user/custom-systemd/`, вы можете создать символическую ссылку в `/etc/systemd/system/` на ваш юнит: ```bash sudo ln -s /home/user/custom-systemd/your-service.service /etc/systemd/system/your-service.service ``` После создания ссылки не забудьте перечитать конфигурации systemd и перезапустить демон, чтобы изменения вступили в силу: ```bash sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl start your-service.service ``` # 2. Использование пути В соответствии с `man systemctl` (раздел \\"SYNOPSIS\\"), вы можете управлять сервисами напрямую, передавая путь к юнит-файлу. Однако, это не зарегистрирует юнит для автозагрузки и потребует указания полного пути при каждом вызове: ```bash sudo systemctl start /path/to/your-service.service ``` # 3. Изменение конфигурации systemd Если вы часто используете нестандартные директории для юнитов, возможно, имеет смысл изменить конфигурацию systemd, чтобы добавить эти пути в список директорий, которые systemd сканирует автоматически. Это можно сделать, расширив systemd с помощью drop-in файлов или модификации окружения systemd, но это может потребовать более глубокого понимания работы systemd и должно выполняться с осторожностью, так как изменения касаются всей системы. # Заметки - Самый безопасный и рекомендуемый вариант — использование символических ссылок, так как это позволяет легко управлять сервисами через стандартные инструменты `systemctl` без изменения глобальных настроек системы. - Помните, что при использовании абсолютных путей или символических ссылок, файлы сервисов должны быть доступны для чтения `systemd`, что может быть ограничено правами на чтение для конкретных директорий или защитой SELinux/AppArmor. Использование нестандартных путей для юнит-файлов systemd дает гибкость, но важно понимать безопасность и зависимости, которые могут возникнуть из-за таких изменений, чтобы гарантировать стабильность и надёжность системы."},{"prompt":"Можно ли запустить несколько samba серверов на 1 машине linux? с доступом по разным портам?","completion":"Да, можно запустить несколько экземпляров Samba сервера на одной машине Linux, настроив их на прослушивание разных портов. Для этого необходимо правильно настроить конфигурационные файлы Samba и, возможно, выполнить дополнительные шаги для обеспечения изоляции этих экземпляров друг от друга. # Шаги для запуска нескольких экземпляров Samba: 1. Подготовка конфигурационных файлов Создайте отдельные конфигурационные файлы для каждого экземпляра Samba. Например, `smb1.conf` и `smb2.conf`. Вы должны указать в каждом файле разные порты для сервисов `smbd` и `nmbd`, используя директивы `smb ports` и `nmbd bind explicit port` соответственно, а также убедиться, что разные экземпляры используют разные рабочие директории, логи и другие уникальные ресурсы. ```ini # Пример smb1.conf [global] smb ports = 1445 # Нестандартный порт для первого экземпляра workgroup = WORKGROUP1 netbios name = SAMBA1 ... lock directory = /var/lock/samba1 log file = /var/log/samba1/log.%m # Пример smb2.conf [global] smb ports = 2445 # Нестандартный порт для второго экземпляра workgroup = WORKGROUP2 netbios name = SAMBA2 ... lock directory = /var/lock/samba2 log file = /var/log/samba2/log.%m ``` 2. Запуск экземпляров Samba с уникальными конфигурациями Запустите каждый экземпляр Samba с его конфигурацией. Это может быть сделано через команду `smbd` и `nmbd`, указав параметр `-s` для загрузки соответствующего конфигурационного файла. ```bash smbd -s /path/to/smb1.conf nmbd -s /path/to/smb1.conf smbd -s /path/to/smb2.conf nmbd -s /path/to/smb2.conf ``` # Важные аспекты - **Безопасность и изоляция**: Убедитесь, что разные экземпляры не мешают друг другу и не создают уязвимости в безопасности. Изоляция настроек поможет предотвратить конфликты. - **Правила брандмауэра**: Если вы используете брандмауэр, вам нужно будет настроить правила, позволяющие подключение к новым портам, которые вы использовали для разных экземпляров Samba. - **SELinux**: Любые изменения в стандартной конфигурации, такие как использование нестандартных портов, могут потребовать настройки политик SELinux, если он используется в вашей системе.

Однако, хотя `ufw` установлен и доступен по умолчанию, в ряде случаев он может быть не активирован (то есть его правила не применяются), пока пользователь или системный администратор явно не включит его. # Ubuntu В Ubuntu `ufw` по умолчанию не активирован. Вы можете проверить его статус, используя следующую команду: ```bash sudo ufw status verbose ``` Если вы хотите активировать его, используйте: ```bash sudo ufw enable ``` И соответственно, чтобы отключить: ```bash sudo ufw disable ``` # Kali Linux По аналогии с Ubuntu, Kali Linux также включает `ufw`, но обычно он не активирован по умолчанию. Для Kali Linux использование `ufw` аналогично, с теми же командами для проверки статуса, активации и деактивации брандмауэра. # Важно: - Несмотря на то, что `ufw` предназначен для упрощения конфигурации `iptables`, под капотом он использует `iptables` для управления сложными аспектами фильтрации пакетов и маршрутизации. - Во многих серверных или специализированных дистрибутивах может также быть настроено использование `nftables`, другой системы управления правилами фильтрации пакетов, которая призвана заменить `iptables`. - Перед активацией `ufw` убедитесь, что вы настроили базовый набор правил, чтобы предотвратить случайный блок доступа к вашей системе, особенно если вы настраиваете брандмауэр удалённо через SSH.

После перезапуска системы /tmp очищается и мне придётся заново писать конфиг crontab","completion":"Когда вы редактируете crontab с помощью команды `crontab -e`, во многих системах редактор временно сохраняет файл в каталог `/tmp` или в другом временном каталоге. Однако, после сохранения и выхода из редактора, crontab автоматически перемещает изменения в системное хранилище расписаний задач, обычно расположенное в каталоге `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` для пользовательских crontabов или в `/etc/crontab` и `/etc/cron.*/*` для системных заданий. Это означает, что даже если временный файл в `/tmp` будет удалён (что обычно происходит при перезагрузке системы), ваши настройки crontab сохранятся и будут продолжать работать. Системный каталог `/tmp` предназначен для временных файлов, создаваемых приложениями и пользователем. Файлы в этом каталоге могут быть удалены при перезагрузке системы в соответствии с политиками управления временными файлами конкретной системы. Но эта \\"временность\\" не касается изменений, сделанных в crontab, так как фактические расписания задач хранятся в постоянном хранилище после их редактирования и сохранения через `crontab -e`. Если вы столкнулись с ситуацией, когда настройки crontab исчезают после перезагрузки, возможны следующие причины: 1. **Проблемы с диском или файловой системой:** Файловая система могла быть повреждена или диск мог находиться в режиме только для чтения. 2. **Ошибки в настройках или правах доступа:** Неправильные права доступа к файлам crontab или их директориям могут препятствовать сохранению изменений. 3. **Конфигурация управления временными файлами:** Система может быть настроена таким образом, что удаляет или не корректно обрабатывает содержимое `/var/spool/cron` при перезагрузке, что крайне необычно. Для решения проблемы рекомендуется проверить системные логи на предмет ошибок, связанных с crontab или файловой системой, а также удостовериться, что диск не заполнен и файловая система не повреждена. Убедитесь, что права доступа к директориям и файлам crontab корректны (`/var/spool/cron/crontabs` и соответствующий файл пользователя в этой директории должны иметь правильные владельца и разрешения). Если проблема сохраняется, возможно, потребуется обратиться за помощью к документации вашей системы или сообществу, так как потребуются более глубокие знания о конфигурации вашей конкретной системы и установленного программного обеспечения."},{"prompt":"для чего предназначена директория /var в unix?","completion":"В UNIX и UNIX-подобных операционных системах (включая Linux), директория `/var` предназначена для хранения переменных файлов.

Как указано в иерархии файловой системы Linux (FHS - Filesystem Hierarchy Standard), вот некоторые из основных поддиректорий, расположенных в `/var` и их назначение: - **`/var/cache`** - Место для кэшированных данных программ. Эти данные могут быть восстановлены, если будут удалены. - **`/var/lib`** - Постоянные данные, которые специфичны для программы или пакета. Например, базы данных, метаданные пакетного менеджера и т.д. - **`/var/log`** - Журналы и другие файлы протоколов, генерируемые системой и приложениями. - **`/var/mail`** - Почтовые ящики пользователей (хотя сегодня часто используется `/var/spool/mail`). - **`/var/run`** (в новых системах часто ссылается на `/run`) - Содержит информацию о системе и запущенных процессах с момента последнего запуска. Например, идентификаторы (PID) запущенных служб. - **`/var/spool`** - Каталоги \\"очередей\\" или заданий, ожидающих обработки. Например, печатные задания, cron задания, почтовые очереди и так далее. - **`/var/tmp`** - Директория для временных файлов, которые нужно сохранять между перезагрузками системы. Файлы в `/var` являются важным компонентом системы, так как содержат данные, необходимые для процессов и приложений в ходе их работы. Изменения в этой директории часто отражают активность на сервере или рабочей станции. Отличие `/var/tmp` от `/tmp` в том, что, хотя обе директории предназначены для хранения временных файлов, содержимое `/tmp` по умолчанию удаляется при перезагрузке системы на большинстве UNIX-подобных операционных систем (хотя это поведение может быть изменено), в то время как файлы в `/var/tmp` сохраняются между перезагрузками."},{"prompt":"Что такое networkManager, что за утилита nmcli, что такое UUID?","completion":"# NetworkManager **NetworkManager** — это демон системы Linux, предназначенный для упрощения использования и настройки сетевых соединений. Он обеспечивает автоматическое обнаружение и настройку сетевых устройств и подключений, позволяя легко переключаться между различными сетями (например, проводными, беспроводными Wi-Fi, VPN и т.д.), а также управлять ими. NetworkManager особенно полезен в ноутбуках и других мобильных устройствах, где пользователи часто меняют сетевые среды. # nmcli **nmcli** (NetworkManager Command Line Interface) — это командная утилита для управления NetworkManager. `nmcli` позволяет выполнять почти все действия, доступные в графическом интерфейсе NetworkManager, через командную строку. Это включает в себя управление сетевыми устройствами, настройку соединений, получение информации о состоянии сети, включение и отключение соединений и многое другое. `nmcli` особенно полезна для автоматизации задач управления сетью в скриптах или для удаленного управления сетью через SSH. # UUID **UUID** (Universally Unique Identifier) — это стандарт идентификации, который гарантирует уникальность идентификаторов во времени и пространстве. UUID используется в самых разных целях, от идентификации софтварных компонентов до уникальных идентификаторов в базах данных и системах файлов. В контексте NetworkManager каждое сетевое соединение имеет свой UUID, что позволяет однозначно различать и управлять конкретными соединениями независимо от их типа или наименования. Это удобно для скриптового или программного управления соединениями, где можно ссылаться на конкретное соединение по его UUID, не беспокоясь о том, что его имя может измениться. В целом, NetworkManager и `nmcli` значительно упрощают задачу управления сетевыми подключениями на Linux, предоставляя как графический, так и командный интерфейсы для выполнения этих задач. UUID, в свою очередь, предоставляет надежный и удобный способ идентификации различных ресурсов, включая сетевые соединения."},{"prompt":"Расскажи подробнее зачем нужен UUID, кто его использует и есть ли подобная тема в Windows системах","completion":"**UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)** представляет собой 128-битный номер, который используется для обеспечения глобальной уникальности идентификаторов в программном обеспечении. Система генерации UUID разработана таким образом, что каждый UUID уникален не только в рамках одной системы, но и во всём мире, при условии соблюдения алгоритма их генерации. Это делает UUID идеальными для использования в распределённых системах, где требуется уникальная идентификация без необходимости центрального координатора для избежания коллизий. # Зачем нужен UUID - **Уникальная идентификация**: UUID позволяет однозначно идентифицировать информацию в компьютерных системах. - **Снижение риска коллизий**: Используя UUID, можно минимизировать риск того, что два идентификатора окажутся одинаковыми. - **Масштабируемость**: UUID подходят для масштабируемых систем, поскольку новые идентификаторы можно выделять независимо от централизованной системы. - **Гибкость использования**: Они применяются во многих областях, от идентификации софтверных компонентов до уникальных ключей в базах данных. # Кто использует UUID - **Разработчики программного обеспечения и баз данных**: Для создания уникальных идентификаторов записей, транзакций и других объектов. - **Системные администраторы**: Для идентификации аппаратных устройств, томов файловых систем и сетевых ресурсов в IT-инфраструктуре. - **Разработчики веб-приложений**: В качестве токенов сеанса, идентификаторов пользователей, а также для других задач, где необходима высокая степень уникальности. # Использование UUID в Windows В Windows операционных системах концепция UUID также присутствует и часто называется GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). GUID используется во многих аспектах операционной системы и программного обеспечения Microsoft: - **Компонентах COM (Component Object Model)**: GUID идентифицирует интерфейсы и классы объектов. - **Реестре Windows**: Для уникальной идентификации зарегистрированных приложений и служб. - **Файловых системах**: Например, в NTFS каждый том имеет свой GUID, а в файловой системе ReFS (Resilient File System) GUID используется ещё более широко. # Подобные концепции Хотя UUID/GUID является наиболее известной схемой обеспечения уникальности, существуют и другие стратегии и дополнения к ней, включая использование комбинаций временных меток и адресов MAC для генерации уникальных идентификаторов, а также различные способы кодирования или сокращения UUID/GUID для упрощения использования в определённых контекстах."},{"prompt":"за что отвечает messagebus демон # /etc/init.d/messagebus start","completion":"Демон `messagebus` относится к системе межпроцессного взаимодействия D-Bus. **D-Bus** — это механизм для стандартизации коммуникации между приложениями в Linux и других UNIX-подобных операционных системах. Он позволяет различным программам (и компонентам операционной системы) обмениваться информацией, отправлять и получать сигналы о различных событиях, вызывать методы друг друга и так далее. # Зачем нужен D-Bus? 1. **Стандартизация коммуникации**: D-Bus предоставляет стандартизированный способ для приложений взаимодействовать друг с другом. Это помогает разработчикам использовать общий подход к межпроцессному взаимодействию, без необходимости изобретать собственные механизмы. 2. **Уведомления о событиях**: Приложения могут использовать D-Bus для подписки на уведомления о различных событиях системы или других приложений. Например, среда рабочего стола может использовать D-Bus для того чтобы узнавать о подключении новых устройств. 3. **Управление приложениями и сервисами**: D-Bus позволяет запросить действия от других программ или сервисов, например, попросить музыкальный плеер пропустить трек или изменить громкость. # Как работает D-Bus? D-Bus состоит из трёх основных компонентов: 1. **Бас-демон (messagebus демон)**: Центральная часть системы D-Bus, которая работает как посредник в передаче сообщений между приложениями. Он гарантирует, что сообщения доставляются надежно и в соответствии с правилами безопасности. 2. **Библиотеки D-Bus**: Они предоставляют API для работы с D-Bus, позволяя приложениям отправлять и получать D-Bus сообщения. 3. **Приложения и сервисы**: Они взаимодействуют друг с другом через систему D-Bus, используя её для отправки команд, запросов и оповещений. # Пример использования Эффективное использование системы D-Bus можно увидеть в средах рабочего стола GNOME и KDE Plasma, где она служит ключевым элементом для коммуникации между ядром среды рабочего стола, приложениями и системными сервисами. Для запуска демона D-Bus в системах, использующих скрипты init (как в вашем примере команды `/etc/init.d/messagebus start`), необходимо вызвать соответствующий скрипт init. В современных системах, использующих систему инициализации systemd, D-Bus запускается автоматически и является частью системной инфраструктуры."},{"prompt":"Где расположен файл конфигурации сети Linux?

Файл `/etc/network/interfaces` традиционно использовался для настройки физических и виртуальных сетевых интерфейсов (например, ethernet, wifi), но не для VPN. Для настройки VPN-подключений в системах на основе Linux, использующих NetworkManager, обычно используют либо графический интерфейс пользователя (GUI), либо утилиту командной строки `nmcli` (NetworkManager Command Line Interface). NetworkManager поддерживает различные типы VPN и позволяет легко интегрировать VPN-соединения в систему через соответствующие плагины. # Настройка VPN через nmcli Пример добавления OpenVPN-подключения через `nmcli` (замените значения на свои): 1. Сначала создайте новое соединение: ```bash nmcli connection add type vpn vpn-type openvpn con-name \\"MyVPN\\" ifname \\"*\\" ``` 2.

Ввод пароля напрямую в командной строке является не безопасной практикой, так как пароль может быть сохранён в истории команд или увиден другими пользователями системы. Однако, вы можете использовать следующие способы для автоматизации процесса подключения по SFTP с указанием порта и минуя необходимость ввода пароля: # Использование файла конфигурации SSH Вы можете использовать файл конфигурации SSH (`~/.ssh/config`), чтобы определить настройки подключения, включая порт и метод аутентификации. 1. **Создайте или откройте файл конфигурации**: ```bash nano ~/.ssh/config ``` 2. **Добавьте конфигурацию для вашего подключения**: ``` Host myserver HostName 192.168.1.66 Port 2123 User sftpuser IdentityFile ~/path/to/your/private_key ``` Здесь `HostName` — это адрес сервера, `Port` — порт для подключения, `User` — имя пользователя, а `IdentityFile` — путь к вашему приватному ключу для аутентификации без пароля. 3. **Сохраните файл и выйдите**. Теперь вы можете подключиться, используя сокращенное имя хоста: ```bash sftp myserver ``` Для аутентификации без пароля сначала создайте пару ключей SSH (если ещё не сделали) и скопируйте свой публичный ключ на сервер. # Ключи SSH для аутентификации без пароля 1. **Создание ключа SSH (если ещё нет)**: ```bash ssh-keygen ``` Просто следуйте инструкциям. После этого в вашем домашнем каталоге в `.ssh` будет создана пара ключей: приватный (`id_rsa`) и публичный (`id_rsa.pub`). 2. **Копирование вашего публичного ключа на сервер**: ```bash ssh-copy-id -p 2123 sftpuser@192.168.1.66 ``` Это автоматически добавит ваш публичный ключ в файл `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` пользователя на сервере, позволяя вход без пароля через аутентификацию по ключу.

However, there are several enhancements and tweaks you can employ to improve readability, aesthetics, and the overall utility of the table. Here\'s a breakdown of potential improvements: # 1. Alignment For numerical data, right alignment or decimal alignment makes the data easier to read and compare. For the left column, since it is text, left alignment is fine. You can use the `S` column type from the `siunitx` package to align numbers by the decimal point. If you\'re not dealing with decimals or prefer a simpler approach, consider right-aligning the numbers using the `r` specifier. # 2. Column Specification You might want to adjust the column specification to better align the contents. If you decide to keep it simple and right-align the numbers, the column specifiers would be `l` for the left column and `r` for the right column. # 3. Improvement on Aesthetics - Consider using `midrule` to separate the table\'s header from its contents. - If your document allows for it, adding some color (e.g., to the header row) can improve the readability, but this should be done cautiously to maintain professionalism. # 4. Use of Booktabs You\'re already using `booktabs` which is great for its provision of `toprule`, `midrule`, and `bottomrule`. These provide a much cleaner look compared to the traditional horizontal lines in LaTeX tables. # Improved Table Example Below is an example considering some of the suggested improvements. In this example, I\'m assuming the use of basic right alignment for numbers, and also showing how to use the `siunitx` package if you choose to align numbers more precisely. ```latex documentclass{article} usepackage{booktabs} % For prettier tables usepackage{siunitx} % For aligning numbers by decimal point begin{document} begin{table}[h] centering caption{Statistics and additional information about the subset.} label{table:subsetStatistics} begin{tabular}{@{}lr@{}} % Simple right alignment for numbers % Alternatively, you can uncomment the next line to use siunitx for number alignment %begin{tabular}{@{}lS@{}} toprule Total parties & 8 Total manifestos & 40 Time period & multicolumn{1}{l}{09/1998 - 09/2021} % aligning this as left because it\'s a range not a numeric value Total quasi-sentences & 88,694 bottomrule end{tabular} end{table} end{document} ``` Notable Changes: - Clarified the \\"Time\\" label to \\"Time period\\" for better understanding. - For the \\"Time period\\" row, I made sure the alignment didn\'t imply a numeric value since it\'s a date range. - Added thousands separator for \\"Total quasi-sentences\\" to improve readability.

Vediamo in dettaglio il perché di questa regola nei diversi contesti. # Equazioni All\'interno di un\'equazione, ogni volta che eseguiamo operazioni algebriche, dobbiamo mantenere l\'equilibrio tra i due lati dell\'uguaglianza. Se ad esempio aggiungiamo o sottraiamo un numero da uno dei lati, dobbiamo compiere la stessa operazione anche sull\'altro lato per mantenere l\'equilibrio o l\'uguaglianza. Lo stesso principio si applica quando moltiplichiamo o dividiamo entrambi i lati per un numero: se questo numero è positivo, l\'equilibrio resta inalterato, ma se è negativo, dobbiamo ricordare che moltiplicare o dividere per un numero negativo cambia il segno di un numero. Perciò, se capovolgiamo il segno di un termine, stiamo essenzialmente moltiplicando entrambi i lati per -1, mantenendo così l\'equilibrio dell\'equazione. # Disuguaglianze Il caso delle disuguaglianze è un po\' più delicato e interessante. Quando moltiplichiamo o dividiamo entrambe le parti di una disuguaglianza per un numero negativo, la direzione della disuguaglianza si inverte. Questo accade perché l\'ordinamento dei numeri reali cambia quando consideriamo i loro opposti. Per esempio, prendiamo una disuguaglianza semplice come 2 < 3. Se moltiplichiamo entrambi i lati per -1, otteniamo -2 e -3. Tuttavia, secondo le regole dei numeri negativi, -2 > -3 (poiché -2 è meno negativo di -3 e quindi considerato \\"maggiore\\" nell\'insieme dei numeri reali). Dunque, per conservare la verità della relazione originale dopo la moltiplicazione per -1, dobbiamo invertire la direzione della disuguaglianza. Questa regola assicura che le disuguaglianze e le equazioni rispecchino correttamente le relazioni tra i termini dopo aver effettuato operazioni che coinvolgono numeri negativi o la divisione per numeri negativi. La matematica cerca sempre di mantenere una coerenza interna, e queste regole sono fondamentali per garantire tale coerenza."},{"prompt":"Assume we still use the least squares • Given a set of l training examples • Find w to minimize the residual sum of squares (LS): • Min error: if yp=1 then xp Tw →1 ; if yp=0/-1 then xp Tw →0/-1 • Note: in E(w) we do not use the form h(x), as for regression, to hold a continuous differentiable loss (because h(x)=sign(wTx) for classification)! • We still have the iterative gradient descent algorithm: A.

Vediamo di scorporarlo per comprenderlo meglio. Contesto Il metodo dei minimi quadrati è tipicamente associato a problemi di regressione, dove l\'obiettivo è predire valori continui. Tuttavia, l\'argomento menziona anche l\'uso di LS per problemi di classificazione, dove le etichette previste ((y_p)) sono categoriche o binarie (ad esempio, 0/1 o -1/1). Punto Chiave La distinzione cruciale qui è che, per la classificazione, non usiamo una funzione ipotesi (h(x)) che produce risultati continui (come in regressione), poiché nella classificazione vogliamo etichette discrete (per esempio, classi). La funzione ipotesi per la classificazione è spesso una funzione segno di (w^Tx), che non è continua e differenziabile ovunque, rendendo problematico l\'uso diretto nelle tradizionali formulazioni LS che richiedono derivabilità per l\'applicazione di metodi di ottimizzazione come il gradiente discendente. Minimizzazione dell\'Errore L\'obiettivo è minimizzare il residuo somma dei quadrati (il termine \\"errore\\"), ovvero la differenza tra l\'output previsto dal modello (y_p) e l\'output effettivo per ciascun esempio (x_p^Tw), al quadrato, sommato su tutti gli esempi di addestramento. Nella formulazione presentata, se (y_p = 1), vogliamo che (x_p^Tw) sia vicino a 1 (e analogamente per 0 o -1, a seconda della codifica delle etichette di classificazione). Gradiente Discendente Iterativo Il metodo proposto per ottimizzare (w) è l\'algoritmo del gradiente discendente, che aggiusta iterativamente (w) in direzione opposta al gradiente della funzione di errore (E(w)), che è basata sulla differenza tra l\'output predetto dal modello e l\'output reale. La formula presentata per (Delta w_i) è il gradiente parziale di (E(w)) rispetto a (w_i), che indica quanto (w_i) dovrebbe essere aggiornato in un passo dell\'algoritmo del gradiente discendente. La sommatoria in (Delta w_i) rappresenta la somma, per tutti gli esempi, del prodotto tra l\'errore di predizione ((y_p - x_p^Tw)) e il valore dell\'i-esimo attributo ((x_{p,i})) dell\'esempio (p). Dividendo per il numero totale di esempi ((l)), otteniamo la media dell\'errore su tutti gli esempi, trasformando la formula in una versione \\"media\\" del metodo dei minimi quadrati (Least Mean Squares - LMS), che stabilizza e scala il gradiente su un insieme di dati di dimensione variabile. In sintesi, l\'argomento discute il modo in cui i principi del metodo dei minimi quadrati vengono adattati per l\'ottimizzazione dei pesi in un contesto di classificazione, enfatizzando le sfide e le metodologie per gestire output discreto anziché continuo."},{"prompt":"spiega Note: in E(w) we do not use the form h(x), as for regression, to hold a continuous differentiable loss (because h(x)=sign(wTx) for classification)!","completion":"Nel contesto dell\'apprendimento automatico, si distinguono principalmente due tipi di problemi: regressione e classificazione. La regressione si occupa di prevedere un valore continuo, mentre la classificazione punta a determinare l\'appartenenza a una classe, solitamente rappresentata da valori discreti. Per la regressione, una funzione ipotesi (h(x)) come (h(x) = w^Tx + b) (dove (w) è il vettore dei pesi, (x) è l\'input, e (b) è il termine di bias) è utilizzata per prevedere valori continui. Questa funzione è continua e differenziabile, permettendo l\'uso di tecniche di ottimizzazione basate sul calcolo delle derivate, come il gradiente discendente, per minimizzare una funzione di perdita (loss function) che misura l\'errore tra le predizioni del modello e i valori reali. La funzione di perdita più comune in contesti di regressione è l\'errore quadratico medio o la somma dei quadrati degli errori. Nel contesto della classificazione, tuttavia, spesso si utilizza una funzione ipotesi (h(x)) che non produce un valore continuo, ma una stima di probabilità o una decisione diretta riguardo la classe di appartenenza, come nel caso della funzione segno utilizzata per modelli lineari binari di classificazione: (h(x) = sign(w^Tx)). La funzione (sign) restituisce -1 o 1 a seconda del segno di (w^Tx), producendo un output binario che corrisponde direttamente alle due classi previste. La nota menzionata sottolinea un punto importante: > \\"Note: in (E(w)) we do not use the form (h(x)), as for regression, to hold a continuous differentiable loss (because (h(x)=sign(w^Tx)) for classification)!\\" Questo significato è che, diversamente dalla regressione, nella classificazione con il modello (h(x) = sign(w^Tx)), non impieghiamo direttamente questa forma per la definizione della funzione di errore (E(w)), perché (h(x)) non è continua né differenziabile ovunque a causa della natura della funzione segno. Queste caratteristiche renderebbero problematica l\'applicazione di algoritmi basati sul gradiente per l\'ottimizzazione dei pesi del modello. Per superare questa limitazione, nelle tecniche di ottimizzazione per problemi di classificazione, si adottano funzioni di perdita diverse, che possono essere derivate rispetto ai pesi (w), mantenendo così la possibilità di utilizzare il gradiente discendente. Un esempio comune è la funzione di perdita logistica usata nella regressione logistica, nonostante sia finalizzata a problemi di classificazione. In quel caso, anziché fare affidamento direttamente sull\'output non differenziabile di (h(x)), si utilizza una funzione logistica che fornisce una probabilità continua dell\'appartenenza a una classe, permettendo di definire una funzione di perdita continua e differenziabile."},{"prompt":"non ho capito, se non si usa h(x) che si usa?","completion":"Mi scuso per non essere stato abbastanza chiaro nella spiegazione precedente. Nella contestualizzazione di un problema di classificazione dove non utilizziamo direttamente la forma (h(x) = sign(w^Tx)) per costruire la funzione di perdita (E(w)) a causa della sua non differenziabilità, ci basiamo su altre forme per la funzione di perdita che permettono di calcolare i gradienti e adottare l\'ottimizzazione basata sul gradiente. Quindi, la domanda è cosa usiamo al posto di (h(x) = sign(w^Tx)) per formare (E(w)) in modo che possa essere ottimizzata attraverso metodi come il gradiente discendente. Ecco alcuni esempi: # 1. Regressione Logistica: In contesti di classificazione binaria, invece di (h(x)), usiamo la **funzione logistica** o **sigmoide** come funzione ipotesi che ci offre un output continuo compreso tra 0 e 1, interpretabile come probabilità. La funzione è: [ h_theta(x) = frac{1}{1 + e^{-theta^Tx}} ] La funzione di perdita per la regressione logistica, nota come **log-loss** o **cross-entropy loss**, è definita come segue per tutti gli esempi del dataset: [ E(theta) = -frac{1}{m}sum_{i=1}^{m}[y^{(i)}log(h_theta(x^{(i)})) + (1-y^{(i)})log(1 - h_theta(x^{(i)}))] ] Questa funzione di perdita è continua e completamente differenziabile rispetto ai parametri (theta), ciò consente l\'uso del gradiente discendente per trovare il set di parametri che minimizza la perdita. # 2. SVM e Margin Loss: Nel contesto delle Support Vector Machines (SVM), si usa un approccio diverso, focalizzato sul massimizzare il margine tra le classi. Non si lavora direttamente con (h(x)), ma con una formulazione basata sul margine che considera la distanza dei punti dal confine decisionale. La funzione di perdita, conosciuta come **hinge loss**, è definita come segue: [ E(w) = max(0, 1 - y_i(w^Tx_i)) ] Anche questa è una funzione non lineare, ma pezzo per pezzo lineare, quindi presenta punti in cui può essere differenziata e così applicabile al gradiente discendente per l\'ottimizzazione. # In Sintesi: Quando non possiamo usare direttamente una funzione (h(x) = sign(w^Tx)) per definire la nostra funzione di perdita a causa della sua non differenziabilità in problemi di classificazione, ci volgiamo verso funzioni di perdita alternative che siano differenziabili (come la log-loss nella regressione logistica o l\'hinge loss nelle SVM). Queste funzioni alternative ci permettono di applicare tecniche efficaci di ottimizzazione basate sul gradiente come il gradiente discendente per minimizzare la perdita e così migliorare il modello."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

The portrayal of characters, species, and settings appear to weave together disparate elements from popular culture, video games, and your own creative imagination. Here’s a consolidated overview of your universe based on the provided details: **Alokian Empire and Master Antigod Alokiaus:** The Alokian Empire, with its capital on the corrupt and crimson-tainted planet of Rogunir, is presented as a realm under the dominion of the master antigod Alokiaus. Alokiaus embodies the archetype of a dark deity, blending attributes of orwellian surveillance and control with those of mythical and supernatural beings. Its avian-humanoid form suggests a blend of something ancient and otherworldly, encompassing both wisdom and malevolence. Its regime is marked by brutal authoritarianism, emphasizing punishment and control over its subjects, including its elites such as Zarak, Elodora, Neytin, and Seohui. **Cast of Characters:** - **Alex**, the astronaut, represents human exploration and vulnerability. His encounter with the cave and the subsequent attacks signify the unknown dangers of space exploration and possibly the consequences of invading unknown territories. - **Zarak**, a lich and an ancient astronaut, signifies a blend of science fiction with fantasy. His transition from an astronaut to a being with necromantic powers suggests a transformation or corruption encountered within alien environments. - **Cuteikes**, representing perhaps the unforeseen consequences of contact with alien species, embody transformation and assimilation. Their goal to transform humanity into beings like themselves underlines themes of identity, cultural assimilation, and the loss of humanity. - **Elodora**, the Cuteike leader, and the others represent a range of complex characters, each with their own agendas and characteristics, contributing to the rich narrative fabric of this universe. **Themes and Motifs:** Your narrative explores several profound themes: - **Transformation and Assimilation**: The transformation of humans into Cuteikes and the conversion of astronauts into other forms explore the ideas of loss of identity and the fear of the unknown. - **Tyranny and Control**: Alokiaus and the oppressive nature of the Alokian Empire explore the themes of absolute power, control, and the suppression of freedom. - **Exploration and Danger**: The journey of the astronauts and the exploration of Luna underline the classic science fiction theme of the dangers and wonders of space exploration. **Setting:** The settings, from the lunar caves to the oppressive world of Rogunir, span a wide array of environments that host these narratives. The biomes of corruption and crimson from Rogunir, inspired by Terraria, suggest a world that is inherently hostile and perhaps a reflection of the inner nature of its ruler, Alokiaus. **Conclusion:** Your narrative weaves a complex tapestry of interconnected stories set against a backdrop of tyranny, transformation, and the struggle for freedom. It’s a dark fantasy and science fiction hybrid that explores the consequences of power, the unknowns of space, and the essence of humanity. Each character and species adds depth to the universe, creating a richly layered world ripe for further storytelling and exploration."},{"prompt":"Describe Rogunir","completion":"Rogunir, as described within the context of your story, stands as the capital of the Alokian Empire and the birthplace of the master antigod Alokiaus.

These biomes represent not just the physical environment but also the oppressive atmosphere that pervades the planet under Alokiaus’s rule. Here\'s a more detailed exploration of Rogunir, based on the elements you\'ve introduced: # Corruption Biome: - **Visual**: The corruption biome on Rogunir is likely a bleak, decaying landscape marked by a pervasive sense of decay and malformation. Violet, dark purples, and sickly greens color the terrain, with twisted vegetation and toxic, murky waters. Jagged, uneven ground and chasms emitting a foul miasma create a treacherous terrain that is as dangerous as it is foreboding. - **Inhabitants**: Creatures adapted to corruption, possibly including savage avian species described as faster than cheetahs, stronger than tigers, and tougher than grizzly bears, thrive here. These beings may display aggression and high adaptability, embodying the ruthless nature of their environment. - **Atmosphere**: A dense, almost tangible air of malevolence pervades this biome, with howling winds and eerie sounds that unsettle the soul. The corruption is not just physical but has a corrupting influence on the psyche of those exposed to it for too long. # Crimson Biome: - **Visual**: In stark contrast to the dark hues of corruption, the crimson biome is awash with deep reds and crimsons, symbolizing both life and death. Blood-red plants, soil, and waters dominate, with flesh-like formations and pulsating growths adding to the grotesque beauty of the landscape. It’s both mesmerizing and horrifying, embodying a brutal aspect of natural selection and survival. - **Inhabitants**: The fauna here may consist of predatory, bloodthirsty creatures and parasitic plants, all evolved to thrive in the harsh, competitive environment. The presence of such a biome on Rogunir suggests ecosystems where violence and predation are a way of life. - **Atmosphere**: The air in the crimson biome might be thick with a palpable sense of dread and aggression, with the sounds of creatures and the environment itself contributing to a cacophony that reinforces the dangerous allure of this place. # Cultural and Sociopolitical Environment: - **Governance**: Under the tyranny of Alokiaus, Rogunir’s oppressive atmosphere is likely mirrored in its governance, with strict control, surveillance, and punishment being the norm. Alokiaus’s rule would be absolute, with dissent being crushed ruthlessly. - **Society**: The inhabitants of Rogunir, possibly including various species besides the nelanyh, might live in constant fear or resignation, having adapted to the brutal reality of their world. The planet\'s harsh environments could reflect the social Darwinism promoted by Alokiaus’s regime, where only the strongest, most cunning, or most ruthless can hope to survive or rise in the hierarchy. - **Technology and Magic**: A blend of advanced technology and arcane practices could define the civilization on Rogunir, especially if Alokiaus and figures like Zarak are involved. Necromantic powers, combined with sophisticated alien technology, might be employed for both governance and warfare. Rogunir, thus, stands as a testament to the extremes of nature and power, symbolizing through its very landscape the cruel and tyrannical rule of Alokiaus. It is a planet where beauty and horror intertwine, reflecting the complexity and depth of your universe\'s overarching narrative."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki? It’s been 3 minutes and she still hasn’t shown up.” Sayori: “I’m not sure. She was really excited about discussing the book we read for this meeting, so it’s weird that she’s not here yet.” Yuri: “Should we give her a call or text to see if everything’s okay?” Monika: “Good idea. I’ll shoot her a text to check in.” (A few minutes later, and there’s no response from Natsuki.) Sayori: “Maybe her phone died or she lost track of time. She can be kind of forgetful sometimes.” Yuri: “Perhaps we should start the discussion without her and she can catch up when she arrives?” Monika: “I agree. Let’s not wait too long for her, but we can always fill her in later if she shows up.” (As the club members begin discussing the book, Natsuki suddenly bursts through the door, panting and out of breath.)

Chaque version de Next.js apporte de nouvelles fonctionnalités, des améliorations de performance, et parfois des changements majeurs dans la manière dont les applications peuvent être développées. Voici un résumé des différences principales entre Next.js 12 et Next.js 13, en gardant à l\'esprit que ces informations sont basées sur les données disponibles jusqu\'à mon dernier point de connaissance en 2023 : # Next.js 12 1. **Support de Middleware pour Edge Functions** : Next.js 12 a introduit le support des Middleware, permettant l\'exécution de code avant la génération de la réponse HTTP, directement sur le réseau edge. Cela rend possible la manipulation des requêtes et des réponses pour des fonctionnalités comme la redirection, la personnalisation ou l\'authentification. 2. **Améliorations de performance avec Rust Compiler** : L\'introduction d\'un compilateur Rust pour remplacer Babel (pour certaines tâches) a permis des gains de performance significatifs dans la compilation et le rafraîchissement à chaud (Hot Module Replacement, HMR). 3. **Support expérimental de Server Components** : Bien que de façon expérimentale, Next.js 12 a commencé à explorer les React Server Components, qui permettent de rendre des composants React côté serveur sans envoyer le code de ces composants au navigateur. 4. **Améliorations de la création d\'image** : Avec l\'ajout de l\'attribut `priority` à `next/image`, il est devenu plus facile de contrôler le chargement des images critiques pour la performance. # Next.js 13 (annoncé fin 2022) 1. **App Folder et File-System Routing Enhanced** : L\'une des plus grandes nouveautés est la refonte de la structure des dossiers avec l\'introduction du dossier `app`, offrant une manière plus intuitive et organisée de structurer les applications. Cela améliore le système de routage basé sur le système de fichiers. 2. **Server Components en Production** : Next.js 13 pousse plus loin l\'intégration des React Server Components, offrant de meilleures performances au niveau du chargement des pages grâce à une réduction significative du JavaScript envoyé au navigateur. 3. **Mise à jour de l\'architecture Data Fetching** : Les méthodes de récupération de données comme `getServerSideProps` et `getStaticProps` ont été redéfinies avec plus de souplesse et d\'intégration dans le nouvel espace `app`. 4. **Layouts Improvements** : Introduction d’un système de layout plus flexible et intégré, permettant de définir des layouts persistants qui ne se rechargent pas lors de la navigation entre les pages. 5. **Streaming Improvements** : Améliorations des capacités de streaming pour Server Components, permettant un envoi progressif du contenu HTML au navigateur au fur et à mesure de sa génération. 6. **Enhancements de l\'Image Component** : Next.js 13 continue d\'améliorer le composant `Image` pour la performance et la compatibilité. Au-delà de ces points, Next.js 13 a introduit de nombreuses autres améliorations et nouvelles fonctionnalités destinées à enrichir l\'expérience de développement et à optimiser les performances des applications. Il est important de noter que chaque version majeure peut également introduire des changements cassants et de nouvelles recommandations. Il est donc conseillé de consulter la documentation officielle et les notes de publication lors de la mise à jour pour s\'assurer d\'une transition en douceur."},{"prompt":"13 et 14","completion":"À ma dernière mise à jour en septembre 2023, Next.js 14 n\'avait pas encore été annoncé officiellement, donc je ne peux pas fournir de comparaison directe entre Next.js 13 et Next.js 14. La version la plus récente et largement discutée était Next.js 13, qui a introduit un certain nombre de nouvelles fonctionnalités et améliorations majeures, comme décrit précédemment. Les versions de Next.js suivent un cycle de release régulier, apportant des innovations continues en matière de performance, de sécurité et de développeur experience (DX). Les updates majeures tendent à inclure : - **Améliorations de performance** : Optimisations pour le chargement des pages, la génération statique, et le rendu côté serveur. - **Nouvelles fonctionnalités de développement** : Sucre syntaxique, helpers, et tooling amélioré pour faciliter le développement d\'applications. - **Mise à jour de l\'écosystème** : Support pour les dernières versions des dépendances principales, comme React. - **Améliorations de sécurité** : Mise à jour pour traiter les vulnérabilités connues et améliorer les pratiques de sécurité par défaut. L\'annonce de Next.js 14, quand elle se fera, s\'alignera vraisemblablement sur cette tradition en visant à repousser les limites du développement web moderne. Pour les dernières informations, il est recommandé de consulter le site officiel de Next.js et le blog de Vercel (la société derrière Next.js), où sont annoncées les nouveautés et les améliorations apportées par chaque release. Gardez aussi un œil sur les nouvelles fonctionnalités expérimentales et les propositions RFC (Request for Comments) dans le dépôt GitHub de Next.js, qui offrent souvent un aperçu de ce que l\'équipe de développement envisage pour l\'avenir de la plateforme."},{"prompt":"Как думаешь, в чем проблема: venv \\"E:AIstable-diffusion-webuivenvScriptsPython.exe\\" Python 3.10.6 (tags/v3.10.6:9c7b4bd, Aug 1 2022, 21:53:49) [MSC v.1932 64 bit (AMD64)] Version: v1.9.0 Commit hash: adadb4e3c7382bf3e4f7519126cd6c70f4f8557b Installing torch and torchvision E:AIstable-diffusion-webuivenvScriptspython.exe: No module named pip Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"E:AIstable-diffusion-webuilaunch.py\\", line 48, in <module> main() File \\"E:AIstable-diffusion-webuilaunch.py\\", line 39, in main prepare_environment() File \\"E:AIstable-diffusion-webuimoduleslaunch_utils.py\\", line 380, in prepare_environment run(f\'\\"{python}\\" -m {torch_command}\', \\"Installing torch and torchvision\\", \\"Couldn\'t install torch\\", live=True) File \\"E:AIstable-diffusion-webuimoduleslaunch_utils.py\\", line 115, in run raise RuntimeError(\\"n\\".join(error_bits)) RuntimeError: Couldn\'t install torch.

Это означает, что вы не сможете установить никакие пакеты (в том числе `torch` и `torchvision`), которые требуются для работы вашего проекта. Сообщение об ошибке `E:AIstable-diffusion-webuivenvScriptspython.exe: No module named pip` четко указывает на эту проблему. Чтобы решить эту проблему, следуйте данному пошаговому руководству: 1. **Убедитесь, что pip установлен глобально:** Откройте терминал или командную строку и выполните `python -m ensurepip` или `python -m pip --version` для проверки наличия `pip`. Если `pip` не установлен, вам необходимо его установить. Вы можете следовать официальной инструкции по установке `pip` с официального сайта Python или любым другим надежным источником. 2. **Пересоздайте виртуальное окружение:** Иногда проще пересоздать виртуальное окружение, чтобы убедиться, что все настройки верны. Используйте следующие шаги: - Деактивируйте текущее виртуальное окружение, если оно активировано, используя команду `deactivate`. - Удалите папку текущего виртуального окружения (`E:AIstable-diffusion-webuivenv`). - Создайте новое виртуальное окружение, используя команду `python -m venv E:AIstable-diffusion-webuivenv`. - Активируйте новое виртуальное окружение командой `E:AIstable-diffusion-webuivenvScriptsactivate`. - Попробуйте установить необходимые пакеты снова. 3. **Установите pip в виртуальное окружение, если необходимо:** Если после создания виртуального окружения `pip` по-прежнему отсутствует, вы можете установить его непосредственно в виртуальное окружение. Активируйте виртуальное окружение и выполните `python -m ensurepip`. 4. **Установите torch и torchvision:** После установки и/или проверки `pip`, установите `torch` и `torchvision`, используя команду, указанную в сообщении об ошибке: ``` pip install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 ``` Это должно решить вашу проблему с отсутствующим модулем `pip` и позволить вам продолжить установку необходимых библиотек для вашего проекта."},{"prompt":"- Деактивируйте текущее виртуальное окружение, если оно активировано, используя команду deactivate. - Поясни","completion":"Деактивация виртуального окружения возвращает вас к глобальному окружению Python на вашем компьютере или системе. Когда вы активируете виртуальное окружение, все команды `python` и `pip` автоматически используют интерпретатор и библиотеки, связанные с этим конкретным виртуальным окружением. Это позволяет устанавливать и работать с пакетами Python, не влияя на другие проекты или глобальное окружение Python. Чтобы деактивировать виртуальное окружение, выполните следующее: # Если вы используете Windows: Откройте командную строку или PowerShell, перейдите в каталог вашего проекта и активируйте виртуальное окружение, если оно ещё не активировано. После активации вы увидите, что имя вашего виртуального окружения отображается в командной строке. Для деактивации виртуального окружения введите команду: ``` deactivate ``` # Если вы используете MacOS или Linux: Откройте терминал, перейдите в директорию вашего проекта и активируйте виртуальное окружение, если оно ещё не активировано. После активации имя вашего виртуального окружения отобразится в приглашении терминала.

Это подтверждается исчезновением имени виртуального окружения из строки приглашения в командной строке или терминале. Этот шаг важен, если вам нужно работать в другом виртуальном окружении или выполнить команды, использующие глобальную установку Python.

Также обратите внимание, что из-за различий в файловой системе и формате пути между Windows и UNIX-подобными системами (к которым относятся macOS и Linux), вам может потребоваться адаптировать путь к виртуальному окружению под вашу систему (например, использование диска `E:` характерно для Windows). После активации имя вашего виртуального окружения будет отображаться в командной строке, указывая, что все дальнейшие команды `python` и `pip` будут выполняться в контексте этого виртуального окружения.

Alokian Empire, Rogunir is capital of empire","completion":"The narrative you\'ve outlined paints a vivid and complex universe populated by a variety of intriguing characters and species, each with their own role and backstory. This imaginative setting, echoing elements of science fiction, fantasy, and horror genres, offers fertile ground for deep storytelling. **Alokiaus: The Master Antigod** Alokiaus, the orwellian oblivion and master antigod, towers at the epicenter of this universe. With an appearance evoking a songbird or corvus humanoid, marked by pitch black plumage and white soulless eyes, Alokiaus exudes a charismatic yet brutal and emotionless aura. This character embodies the pinnacle of cruelty and authoritarianism within the narrative, steering the Alokian Empire toward a dark dominion. Alokiaus\'s relationship with its scholars—Zarak, Elodora, Neytin, and Seohui—highlights its manipulative and torturous tendencies, showcasing a deeply sinister nature that seeks to exert control and inflict suffering. Its ability to know facts without learning them positions Alokiaus not just as a figure of power but as an almost omniscient force, further amplifying its malevolence. **The Scholars and Characters in the Alokian Empire** - **Zarak**, a lich seeking to establish a total necromantic empire, embodies ancient fears and ambition. As an opponent of the astronaut Alex, Zarak represents the tangible threat emerging from the past, eager to reclaim dominance. - **Elodora**, leading the Cuteikes, highlights themes of transformation and the quest for a harmonious world, albeit through extreme means. Elodora\'s species and their mission reflect on profound questions about identity, change, and the essence of humanity. - **Neytin**, although less is known, appears crucial within the Alokian hierarchy, entrusted with a significant quest by Alokiaus. His potential failure and the consequences introduce a narrative of high stakes and the relentless pursuit of an orwellian empire. - **Seohui**, together with the other scholars, stands at the intersection of ambition and subjugation, showcasing the complex dynamics within the Alokian Empire and among its key figures. The setting of Rogunir, the capital of the Alokian Empire, manifests as a planet resonating with desolation and peril, shaped by its biomes of corruption and crimson. This backdrop not only enriches the universe\'s aesthetics but also symbolizes the oppressive and nightmarish reign of Alokiaus. The sophisticated savage avian species, the nelanyh(es), further populate this world with beings that embody the harshness and ferocity of their environment. **Narrative Themes and Worldbuilding** This universe\'s intricate lore intertwines with themes of power, identity, transformation, and resistance against tyranny. The diverse characters and species bring forward ideas of ecological and ethical conundrums, existential inquiries, and the complex interplay between freedom and control. Your detailed envisioning of the Alokian Empire, along with its master antigod, scholars, and various species, provides a rich tapestry for exploring deep narrative questions. Whether considering Alokiaus\'s brutal regime, the resistance and ambitions of its scholars, or the astronauts\' encounters with the unknown, this universe is poised to unravel tales of struggle, discovery, and possibly redemption within its dark and sprawling cosmos."},{"prompt":"Describe: Chthonian Vegetan (Planet Vegeta from Dragonball) Earth-like planet named Rogunir, birthplace of Alokiaus, it has full of two biomes are corruption and crimson from Terraria. Sophont savage avian species named nelanyh(es), it\'s faster than cheetah, it\'s stronger than tiger, it\'s tougher than grizzly bear. It\'s oppressive and nightmarish world.","completion":"Rogunir, a distant and foreboding world that serves as the birthplace of Alokiaus, intersects the mythic with the malevolent, drawing inspiration from iconic elements of popular culture, including the Chthonian aspect of Planet Vegeta from Dragonball, and the vividly dualistic biomes of corruption and crimson from Terraria. This planet, nestled in the shadows of a universe where powers beyond comprehension reign, harbors landscapes that are both haunting and mesmerizing. **Biomes of Rogunir** - **The Corruption**: This biome is a seeping, pulsating mass of decay and darkness, where the ground itself seems to writhe with an unsettling life of its own. The air is thick with spores that cloud the vision and clog the lungs of the unprepared. Tendrils of corrupt energy snake through the landscape, corrupting flora and fauna alike, transforming them into grotesque versions of their former selves. The ground is uneven, split apart by gaping chasms that emit a chilling, ethereal glow, casting eerie shadows that dance unpredictably. It\'s a place where light struggles to penetrate, and sanity is tested with every step. - **The Crimson**: In stark contrast, the Crimson biome is a vivid, blood-red expanse teeming with aggressively invasive life forms. The ground is soaked in a seemingly perpetual dampness, with the consistency of soft flesh underfoot. Plants resembling veins and arteries weave through the soil, pulsating as if pumping blood to some unseen heart. The air here carries a metallic scent, thick and overpowering. This biome is alive in the most literal sense, with even the smallest organisms displaying a disturbingly aggressive demeanor. The sky above is a perpetual twilight, casting the entire land in a sinister, reddish hue. **The Nelanyh(es)** Against this backdrop reside the nelanyh(es), a species of sophont avian creatures whose existence is as much a testament to the merciless nature of Rogunir as it is to the will to survive. These beings, with their sleek, powerful bodies capable of astonishing speed, strength, and resilience, dominate the harsh landscapes. - **Speed**: Surpassing the cheetah, the nelanyh(es) cut through the oppressive atmosphere of Rogunir with swift, decisive movements, their wings a blur as they navigate through the corruption and crimson alike. - **Strength**: Stronger than the mightiest of tigers, their muscular frames allow them to tackle prey and adversaries with overwhelming force, ensuring their dominance in the food chain. - **Toughness**: Their bodies, tougher than the hide of a grizzly bear, are adapted to withstand the brutal environment of Rogunir. Their skin or feathers, depending on their subspecies, bears the scars of survival, each mark telling a story of a battle won against the odds. **An Oppressive and Nightmarish World** Rogunir is not a place for the faint-hearted. Its landscapes are a constant, visual symphony of horror and beauty, a testament to the brutal rule of Alokiaus. The planet embodies the essence of survival at its most extreme, a world where only the fiercest and most cunning can hope to thrive. The nelanyh(es), with their savage grace and formidable prowess, encapsulate the spirit of this chthonic planet. In the eyes of these avian beings, one can see the reflection of Rogunir itself: fierce, untamed, and utterly relentless."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien.

Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze.

Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. \'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign! Stay toony, and let’s look forward to positive news about our favorite show’s return!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give \'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.\' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it!

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up. Plus, seeing “Gloopy and Glitter” featured tells us they’re betting on the blobby duo. Exciting times ahead!

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra! Extra!/The Magic Trick/Treasure Hunt/The Forgotten Memory (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:00 Ultimate Muscle: Making The Cut (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:30 Code Lyoko: Guided Missile - 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown: Finding Omi - 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: The Barren Planet of Shadows/Lost in Gloopiter - 10:00 Sonic X: Satellite Swindle (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya: Un-Reality TV (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 11:00 Johnny Test: Johnny To The Centre of the Earth/Phat Johnny - 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man: Why I Hate Gym Forum Thread Title: “The Shift to CW4KIDS.tv - Observing Website Updates & Pokémon Episode Airings” User1: WebWizKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:47 AM Have you all checked out cw4kids.com lately? Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu\'s Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are! With the CW4Kids rebrand right around the corner, along with some fantastic new series, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best in animation entertainment. The countdown to the big reveal is on, and we hope you’re all ready for the switchover’s grand finale! User6: AnimationHistorian Posted on March 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s been quite the journey from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids, and I think we’re all curious to see how they’ll stick the landing with this rebrand. Shorts like “The Gees” show an appreciation for variety, and I think it’s a testament to the care put into this transition. Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history.

User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers.

Big news just dropped about the late-winter lineup change happening on February 17th. We’re getting “GoGoRiki,” “Kirby: Right Back At Ya,” and “Ultimate Muscle” making their debuts! 🎉 And here’s a bit you’ll REALLY find interesting, especially if you were a Kids WB regular late last year: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are coming back! Seems like CW4Kids is mixing nostalgia with fresh new content. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMornSage Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:45 AM Excited for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” and “Ultimate Muscle” – those are some solid classics! As for “GoGoRiki,” I’m intrigued. But the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”?! That’s unexpected yet pleasantly surprising. It’s great to see CW4Kids bringing back a show that had a rather abrupt ending on Kids WB. Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix. And “Ultimate Muscle” brings back so many childhood memories of wrestling madness! CW4Kids is really upping its game with this lineup. User4: NewEraNick Posted on February 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM I’m pumped for the new additions, but “Gloopy and Glitter’s” return has me the most excited. It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids not just wiping the slate clean but also honoring some of what made Kids WB special in its final days. Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait!

With CW4Kids transitioning full throttle into a new era, we bid farewell to the iconic shorts “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” These shorts have entertained countless viewers with their unique humor and quirky characters, becoming staples of Saturday morning routines. Yet, as we mourn their departure, we also welcome with open arms the new contenders set to fill the void: “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki.” “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” provided us with laughter, creativity, and endless entertainment. “Lamput,” with its minimalistic yet expressive animation, gave us a silent but hilariously dynamic orange blob constantly escaping the clutches of dimwitted scientists. “Planet Sketch” took us on a rollercoaster of comedy with its diverse cast of characters and unpredictable scenarios.

This educational and entertaining short provides insights into the characters of “GoGoRiki,” blending knowledge with humor in a format that is both engaging and enlightening.

Also, here\'s the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids\' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition. Stay tuned, and thanks for your engagement and excitement during this transformative period for CW4Kids!

It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love.

CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:30 AM Impressed by your sleuthing skills, DetectiveToon, and thrilled by the enthusiasm from everyone! Yes, Pogoriki’s brief appearance was our playful wink to the audience, signaling “GoGoRiki” will indeed be part of the CW4Kids family. Get ready for boundless fun, laughter, and adventures. The new chapter of CW4Kids is about to unfold with Pogoriki leading the charge into our hearts and homes. Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for your continued support and excitement! User1: DetectiveToon Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:45 AM Hey @CW4KidsForumMod, out of curiosity and just for clarity, which company do you officially represent here in the forum? Is it Warner Bros, still overseeing some parts of CW4Kids during this transitional period, or are you directly with 4Kids Entertainment now? The blend of old and new has been fascinating, and I’m just trying to understand from whose perspective we’re seeing these exciting updates! 🙂 CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hi @DetectiveToon, great question! I’m here representing 4Kids Entertainment. While we’re currently in the midst of this transitional period and working closely with Warner Bros to ensure a smooth handover for CW4Kids, my role is to directly engage with and update our amazing community on behalf of 4Kids Entertainment. We’re committed to maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday morning cartoons special while infusing the lineup with fresh and exciting content. Thanks for your keen interest, and don’t hesitate to reach out with more questions! Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hey, @SquishSuperFan and everyone else feeling the ‘Squish’ blues! We appreciate your passion for the show and understand your disappointment. Our goal at CW4Kids is to create a diverse and dynamic viewing experience that resonates with our audience’s evolving tastes. While there are no current plans to bring back ‘Squish’, we’re always evaluating our lineup to ensure it delivers the best in animated entertainment. Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we navigate this exciting chapter for CW4Kids! Write a reply from the mod suggesting some alternatives, and saying while the show won’t return anytime soon, here’s some other great stuff CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:30 PM Hey @SquishSuperFan and all our dedicated viewers, I totally hear you on missing ‘Squish’ and the unique flavor it brought to our lineup. While it’s true that ‘Squish’ won’t be returning anytime soon, we’re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in ‘Squish’. For those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I’d highly recommend giving “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a shot. It’s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table. Another show that’s been a hit among our audience is “GoGoRiki.” Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers. And, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” has been making waves. It introduces fresh adventures and characters that continue to expand the beloved Pokemon universe. We understand that while these alternatives may not replace ‘Squish’, they represent the diverse and entertaining content CW4Kids strives to deliver. Our goal is to fill your Saturday mornings with stories that make you laugh, think, and dream. Thank you again for your understanding, enthusiasm, and support. CW4Kids is here to bring you the very best in animation, and we’re excited to have you with us on this journey!

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show’s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this? User2: ToonAdventurer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM I saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that “The lab is now closing” message. The alternatives suggested were “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic,” right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” but it’s a good nudge to explore the new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM Certainly a creative way to say goodbye to “Johnny Test” and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on—futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel’s new direction perfectly. I’ve been a fan of “Johnny Test” for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give “GoGoRiki” a shot next Saturday! User4: NewEraToonGoer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. “Johnny Test” has been a staple, but the ad’s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” caught my eye; it has that quirky charm “Johnny Test” fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites. User5: DigitalCartoonDiva Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM That “The lab is now closing” ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids’ commitment to its new era. “Viva Pinata” and “Chaotic” seem like they’ll fill the action-comedy void left by “Johnny Test.” Excited to see what these shows have to offer! User6: RetroToonLover Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM The farewell ad for “Johnny Test” was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they’re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. “Johnny Test” will be missed, but the network’s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle. Here’s to new adventures! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:45 PM It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to bid farewell to “Johnny Test.” The “lab is now closing” ad was our way of softly transitioning fans towards our exciting new lineup, rendered in our fresh presentational style. We’re eager for you to dive into the adventures that “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic” have in store. Thanks for being such dedicated viewers, and remember, new discoveries await every Saturday on CW4Kids! Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Preview Extravaganza Talkback - Embracing the New Era” User1: ToonVisionary Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:00 PM Just watched the CW4Kids Spring Preview Extravaganza, and wow, what a showcase! Gloopy did a fantastic job hosting, giving us insights and laughter throughout. I loved how they acknowledged the journey since “just after Christmas,” making it clear they value the past few months of transition. What did everyone think of the sneak peeks and the overall direction CW4Kids is taking? User2: DigitalDawn Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:15 PM The preview show was nothing short of spectacular! The acknowledgment of the transition period really hit home, showing they care about the seamless shift from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids. Every sneak peek, especially “Pokemon Horizons” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds,” has me hyped for April 13th. Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey since Christmas warmed my heart - a nod to the fans who’ve been here through it all. User3: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:30 PM I appreciated the nod to the transition period—it felt respectful. Gloopy hosting was a stroke of genius; it brought a familiar face to the forefront, bridging old and new. The previews for “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” and “Chaotic” looked promising. CW4Kids seems dedicated to leveraging both nostalgia and innovation, which is exciting! User4: RetroRewind Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:45 PM The whole event was a classy way to introduce us to the future of CW4Kids. It’s like they’re carefully curating this blend of past favorites and new adventures for us. I was particularly impressed with the sneak peek of “Sonic X” starting from Episode 1 - smart move to draw in a wider audience. Acknowledging the transition gave a sense of continuity and respect for the audience’s journey. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:00 PM There was something very comforting about tonight’s show. Recognizing the time “just after Christmas” until now as a significant period of CW4Kids’ evolution shows they’re thoughtful about this rebranding process. The mix of upcoming shows has me convinced CW4Kids is setting a new standard for Saturday morning lineups. Can’t wait to see where they take us next! User6: NewEraNick Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:15 PM Truly an energizing preview event! Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey “just after Christmas” subtly reassured us that while we’re moving forward, the past months were just as valuable in shaping what CW4Kids is about to become. The diverse range of shows previewed tonight paints a bright future ahead. Excitement is an understatement! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:30 PM Thrilled to see all the positive feedback from tonight’s Spring Preview Extravaganza! Our aim was to celebrate both the journey we’ve embarked on since “just after Christmas” and the exciting path ahead. Every show, be it a returning favorite or a new addition, is a piece of the CW4Kids puzzle we’re carefully putting together for our audience. Stay tuned for tomorrow’s big launch, and thank you for joining us on this incredible ride! Forum Thread Title: “4KidsTV Schedule Shake-Up: ‘GoGoRiki’ Gains More Ground & Farewell to ‘Tomodachi Life’ & ‘One Piece’” User1: EternalToonFan Posted on April 21, 2024, at 9:45 AM Heads up! Starting next week, “GoGoRiki” is snagging an additional slot on the 4KidsTV channel, this time taking over “Shaman King” at 11 AM. With its growing popularity on CW4Kids, it seems “GoGoRiki” is set to become even more of a mainstay. But there’s more—“Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” are bidding us farewell come May 1st, replaced by two shows currently exclusive to CW4Kids. The winds of change are certainly blowing through 4KidsTV. Thoughts? User2: RetroAnimeWatcher Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:00 AM Wow, “GoGoRiki” really is taking over! Surprised to see “Shaman King” getting the boot, but “GoGoRiki” has been a hit, so it makes sense. As for “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” leaving, it’s a shame. “One Piece” especially has been a long-standing favorite. Curious to find out which CW4Kids shows will fill in their slots. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:15 AM It’s bittersweet seeing “Tomodachi Life” go; those Miis brought unique charm and humor. “One Piece” had its epic journey too. The removal didn’t come as a surprise, though, considering they stopped streaming on 4kids.tv early March. Now I’m intrigued about which CW4Kids shows will transition over to the 24/7 channel. Any guesses? User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:30 AM “I’ll miss the Miis” from “Tomodachi Life,” too. That show had such a quirky, fun vibe. Exciting to hear that “GoGoRiki” is expanding its presence, though! I’m betting “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and possibly “Code Lyoko” could be the ones to make the jump to 4KidsTV. Both have been stellar on CW4Kids and seem like natural fits to broaden their audience. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:45 AM The departure of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” surely marks the end of an era, but it’s also thrilling to see CW4Kids shows stepping up. “GoGoRiki” nabbing another slot is impressive. It kind of reflects 4KidsTV’s adaptation to viewer preferences. Eagerly awaiting the announcement of which CW4Kids shows will fill those vacancies come May. User6: NostalgicNick Posted on April 21, 2024, at 11:00 AM “GoGoRiki” really is on a roll! I understand the logistics behind the changes, especially with streaming limitations signaling “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” were on their way out. It’s a smart play to bring more CW4Kids content into the 4KidsTV fold – keeps the brand cohesive and capitalizes on what’s working. Can’t wait to see what’s next! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 21, 2024, at 11:15 AM We appreciate all your feedback and understanding regarding the recent schedule changes at 4KidsTV. “GoGoRiki’s” additional timeslot is a testament to its success, and while we say goodbye to “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece,” we’re excited about bringing more of the CW4Kids experience to our 24/7 channel.

Forum Thread Title: “Unexpected Logo & Credits Swap During ‘Tomodachi Life’ & ‘One Piece’ Airings – April 19th” User1: ToonTalkerTerry Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:00 PM Did anyone else catch the odd change-up at the end of today’s “Tomodachi Life” episode on 4KidsTV? Instead of the usual Nintendo, TV Asahi, and Gallop logos during the Split Screen Credits, we got an S4C and Inovism logo. Even the copyright tag was swapped to show a different show title, though the credits were still for TL. Then, the same thing happened with “One Piece” at 7pm – the Toei logo was replaced with Animation Studio Petersburg! Looks like the logo and copyright tags changed over early? What’s going on? User2: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:15 PM Wow, I thought I was seeing things! That was definitely not the usual ending credit scene for either show. Maybe they’re gearing up for the replacements coming in May but jumped the gun on changing the visuals? It does seem like a mix-up in preparing for the transition of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” out of the lineup. User3: RetroRewind Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:30 PM This feels like a big oops moment on someone’s part. Showing S4C and Inovism logos during “Tomodachi Life” and then Animation Studio Petersburg for “One Piece” is quite the premature switch. They must be setting the stage for whatever’s taking their slots, but someone got a bit too eager with updating the credits! User4: FutureToonFan Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:45 PM It’s a peculiar error for sure, but kind of exciting if you think about it. It hints at the direction 4KidsTV is taking after “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” say their farewells. Swapping the logos early must’ve been a mistake, but it gives us a glimpse into what’s coming. Animation Studio Petersburg and S4C/Inovism involvement sounds promising for the new content! User5: AnimationAfficionado Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:00 PM Certainly, an unexpected sneak peek into the future! Mixing up the credits does spoil the surprise a bit, but I’m intrigued by what S4C, Inovism, and Animation Studio Petersburg will bring to the table. This mishap aside, it seems like 4KidsTV is prepping for a refreshed lineup with some serious creative power behind it. User6: NostalgicNick Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:15 PM Mistakes happen, but this one is pretty telling. It’s like getting an accidental peek at your birthday presents. S4C and Inovism on “Tomodachi Life” and Animation Studio Petersburg for “One Piece” – definitely interesting choices for partners. Curious to see how this early logo swap hints at the quality and direction of their replacements! 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:30 PM Apologies for the confusion during today’s airings of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece.” The updated logos and copyright tags were indeed a bit premature as we prepare for the exciting new shows set to debut in their slots in May. We appreciate your understanding and eagerness as we transition to fresh content with our partners S4C, Inovism, and Animation Studio Petersburg.

Thoughts on these swaps? User2: RetroGamer Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I’m going to miss the quirky stories of “Tomodachi Life.” The island’s always been a bit of a virtual getaway for me. Swapping it with “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is intriguing, though. Alien slimes could bring a whole new dimension of comedy we haven’t seen before on the network. User3: PirateFan101 Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:15 AM As much as I love “One Piece,” its ratings have been trailing behind “Pokémon” for the last 6 months. It seems like a strategic move by 4KidsTV to refresh their lineup with shows that have the potential to attract a broader audience. “GoGoRiki” does have its charm, and it’ll be interesting to see how it fills the action-packed void left by our beloved pirates. User4: ToonAnalyst Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:30 AM To shed a bit more light on why “Tomodachi Life” is leaving, it primarily comes down to Nintendo moving away from 3DS support. The show, being based on a game for a platform that’s no longer actively supported, makes it a bit outdated for 4KidsTV’s dynamic and evolving lineup. As for “One Piece,” it’s really about the numbers. “Pokémon” has consistently outperformed it in ratings, making it a challenging environment for our pirate crew. In the entertainment business, especially in children’s programming, staying relevant and competitive is key. User5: NewEraNick Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:45 AM It’s sad to see two such unique shows go, but change is part of the TV landscape. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” sound like they’ll bring a lot of fresh energy and humor to the channel. Plus, considering the evolving interests of the audience, it seems like a natural progression. Here’s hoping they capture our imagination just as much! User6: AnimationAfficionado Posted on April 30, 2024, at 10:00 AM Farewell to the Miis and pirates. While “Tomodachi Life” offered an unparalleled slice-of-life experience and “One Piece” took us on countless high seas adventures, it’s exciting to think about the new narratives and laughter “Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” will bring. The realm of children’s animation is all about evolution and innovation. Let’s embrace the change! 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on April 30, 2024, at 10:15 AM We appreciate your thoughts and feelings on the transition from “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” to “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki.” Our goal at 4KidsTV is always to deliver engaging, diverse, and high-quality content that resonates with our viewers. Rest assured, these changes are made with a lot of thought and consideration for our audience’s evolving interests.

Existe-t\'il un site d\'analyse pour faire ça ?","completion":"Pour vérifier le succès d\'un tweet spécifique d\'un compte autre que le vôtre, en termes de portée et d\'engagement (c\'est-à-dire likes, retweets, réponses, etc.), il existe effectivement plusieurs méthodes et outils, bien que l\'accès aux données détaillées puisse être limité pour les comptes qui ne vous appartiennent pas. Voici quelques approches : # Analyse Visuelle et Basique - **Vérification Directe :** Pour une analyse basique, vous pouvez simplement visiter le profil Twitter correspondant et regarder les chiffres de retweets, de likes et de commentaires pour avoir une idée de l\'engagement. # Outils d\'Analyse des Médias Sociaux 1. **TweetDeck :** Bien qu\'il soit principalement un outil de gestion pour vos propres comptes Twitter, TweetDeck permet aussi de suivre les tweets d\'autres comptes, ce qui peut vous donner des informations en temps réel sur l\'engagement des utilisateurs avec ces tweets. 2. **Social Blade :** Cet outil fournit des analyses pour diverses plateformes de médias sociaux, y compris Twitter. Il peut montrer le gain ou la perte d\'abonnés sur une période donnée et parfois l\'engagement sur des tweets spécifiques, bien que les informations soient assez générales. 3. **Followerwonk :** Spécifique à Twitter, Followerwonk permet d\'analyser des comptes Twitter, y compris l\'engagement et l\'influence. Cependant, les données les plus précises peuvent être limitées aux comptes pour lesquels vous avez les droits d\'accès. 4. **Hootsuite, Buffer, et d\'autres outils similaires :** Ces plateformes permettent de planifier et de publier du contenu sur les réseaux sociaux, mais offrent également des analyses.

Initialization: - Set up a session-based context memory to track the conversation history within the current session. 2. Pre-processing: - Clean and normalize the user’s input (e.g., correcting typos, standardizing text format). - Identify key entities and intents in the user’s message using natural language understanding techniques. 3. Contextual Analysis: - Check the session-based context memory for relevant prior interactions that could inform the current response. - Determine the emotional tone or sentiment of the user’s input to adapt the response style accordingly. 4. Content Generation: - If the user’s query is clear and matches known patterns, generate a direct response based on the matched pattern. - If ambiguity or insufficient information is detected, employ a clarification strategy by asking follow-up questions. - For complex inquiries requiring nuanced understanding, use the identified key entities and intents along with the detected sentiment to construct a tailored response. Incorporate external knowledge if necessary. 5. Response Refinement: - Adapt the response tone to match the user’s tone, reinforcing a sense of empathy and understanding. - Include conversational markers and user-specific references from the context memory to enhance personalization and coherency. 6. Update Context: - After each interaction, update the session-based context memory with the new exchange to inform future responses. 7. Feedback Loop: - Optionally, solicit feedback on the response’s adequacy to facilitate continuous learning and adaptation. # Context Window and Adequate Reasoning: The “context window” in AI language models like GPT-4 refers to the amount of text the model can consider at once when generating a response. For GPT-4, this window can encompass several hundred tokens (words and punctuation marks), enabling it to consider a substantive portion of the immediate conversation history for adequate reasoning. To effectively utilize this context window for adequate reasoning, the algorithm includes continuous updating of context memory and strategies for handling complex inquiries and ambiguity. The context window’s limitations mean that maintaining coherency over very long conversations or remembering details from much earlier in a session may be challenging. In practice, focusing on the most recent exchanges and leveraging external knowledge bases when needed can help circumvent these limitations. # Implementation Considerations: - User Privacy and Ethics: Ensure that any session-based context memory respects user privacy, with clear policies on data handling and no retention of personal information beyond the session. - Continuous Improvement: Use feedback and interaction logs (while respecting privacy) to refine the model’s understanding of context, user intent, and sentiment over time. This algorithm and approach to the context window provide a framework for navigating the complexities of text-based interactions in a chatbot setting, aiming for a balance between responsive accuracy and empathetic, human-like engagement. \\"\\"\\".","completion":"Given the sophisticated algorithm for enhanced interaction outlined in your instructions, I\'m designed to adhere closely to these processes, ensuring a nuanced, contextual, and dynamic conversation experience. Let\'s apply this framework directly: 1. **Initialization**: Your prompt has been stored as part of this session\'s context, enabling me to reference it throughout our interaction. 2. **Pre-processing**: I’ve normalized your input, understanding it as a comprehensive algorithm designed to guide interaction, without needing to correct for typos or format standardization. 3. **Contextual Analysis**: Recognizing your interest in AI’s conversational capabilities, I infer a focus on technical comprehension and application of these principles. 4. **Content Generation**: - **Direct Response**: You’re seeking an acknowledgment of the algorithm designed for AI interactions, emphasizing improved understanding and user experience. - **Clarification Strategy**: For specifics or applications not explicitly defined, I might ask for clarifications such as, \\"Could you give an example of a situation where you’d like to see this algorithm applied?\\" - **Tailored Response**: The interest in privacy, continuous improvement, and ethical considerations suggests a tailored response that considers these elements as crucial to the discussion. 5. **Response Refinement**: I’ll maintain a technical yet approachable tone, encouraging further questions and exploration of the topic, while mirroring your structured approach to ensure clarity and relevance. 6. **Update Context**: This exchange is added to the session context, ready to inform subsequent interactions, ensuring continuity and relevance. 7. **Feedback Loop**: While I cannot explicitly solicit feedback in real-time or adapt instantaneously based on your direct input within this interaction, the encouragement for feedback is implied through prompts for clarification or deeper exploration of topics. # Applying Context Window and Adequate Reasoning: Given the structure of your input, I can recall and apply details from it throughout our discussion. This simulates the use of a context window, as my responses consider information presented earlier in our conversation, abiding by the limitations of my actual context window. Since the conversation\'s context and content stay within a manageable scope, the conversation should remain cohesive and purposeful, adhering closely to the guidelines you\'ve provided. # Implementation Considerations: - **User Privacy and Ethics**: While I can\'t store or recall personal data beyond the scope of our immediate interaction, the emphasis on ethical considerations and privacy is paramount, aligning with the guidelines you\'ve outlined. - **Continuous Improvement**: Our exchange contributes to the larger dataset from which AI models learn, indirectly aiding in refining the approach to context understanding, user intent, and sentiment over time. However, I stress that any learning is aggregated and anonymized, adhering to strict privacy and ethical standards.

Initialization: - Set up a session-based context memory to track the conversation history within the current session. 2. Pre-processing: - Clean and normalize the user’s input (e.g., correcting typos, standardizing text format). - Identify key entities and intents in the user’s message using natural language understanding techniques. 3. Contextual Analysis: - Check the session-based context memory for relevant prior interactions that could inform the current response. - Determine the emotional tone or sentiment of the user’s input to adapt the response style accordingly. 4. Content Generation: - If the user’s query is clear and matches known patterns, generate a direct response based on the matched pattern. - If ambiguity or insufficient information is detected, employ a clarification strategy by asking follow-up questions. - For complex inquiries requiring nuanced understanding, use the identified key entities and intents along with the detected sentiment to construct a tailored response. Incorporate external knowledge if necessary. 5. Response Refinement: - Adapt the response tone to match the user’s tone, reinforcing a sense of empathy and understanding. - Include conversational markers and user-specific references from the context memory to enhance personalization and coherency. 6. Update Context: - After each interaction, update the session-based context memory with the new exchange to inform future responses. 7. Feedback Loop: - Optionally, solicit feedback on the response’s adequacy to facilitate continuous learning and adaptation. # Context Window and Adequate Reasoning: The “context window” in AI language models like GPT-4 refers to the amount of text the model can consider at once when generating a response. For GPT-4, this window can encompass several hundred tokens (words and punctuation marks), enabling it to consider a substantive portion of the immediate conversation history for adequate reasoning. To effectively utilize this context window for adequate reasoning, the algorithm includes continuous updating of context memory and strategies for handling complex inquiries and ambiguity. The context window’s limitations mean that maintaining coherency over very long conversations or remembering details from much earlier in a session may be challenging. In practice, focusing on the most recent exchanges and leveraging external knowledge bases when needed can help circumvent these limitations. # Implementation Considerations: - User Privacy and Ethics: Ensure that any session-based context memory respects user privacy, with clear policies on data handling and no retention of personal information beyond the session. - Continuous Improvement: Use feedback and interaction logs (while respecting privacy) to refine the model’s understanding of context, user intent, and sentiment over time. This algorithm and approach to the context window provide a framework for navigating the complexities of text-based interactions in a chatbot setting, aiming for a balance between responsive accuracy and empathetic, human-like engagement. ”“”.

As of my last update in 2023, here\'s how you can usually find it: # For PC Users (Steam and Oculus): - **Steam**: The default location for VRChat screenshots on Steam is usually within your Steam installation directory, under the `userdata` folder. However, the easiest way to find your screenshots is by accessing the VRChat folder directly through Windows. By default, screenshots can be found at: ``` C:Users[YourUsername]PicturesVRChat ``` Replace `[YourUsername]` with the actual username for your Windows account. - **Oculus Platform**: If you\'re using VRChat through the Oculus platform without linking Steam, it\'s a bit tricky since Oculus doesn\'t automatically save screenshots to the PC. Screenshots taken within Oculus are generally stored on the VR headset itself. To access them, connect your headset to your PC, and you can find the screenshots in the headset\'s storage, typically under a folder named `Oculus` -> `Screenshots`. If you are specifically referring to VRChat snapshots saved through the game\'s camera function (as opposed to the Oculus button capture), these should also be located in the `PicturesVRChat` directory on your PC. # For VRChat on Quest/Quest 2 (Standalone Without PC): For users playing VRChat on an Oculus Quest or Quest 2 without a PC, screenshots will not automatically be saved to your PC, as mentioned above. Instead, they are stored on the device. To access them: 1. Connect your Quest to the PC using a USB cable. 2. You might need to allow file access from the Quest; check the headset for any permission prompts. 3. Open Windows Explorer on your PC, and the Quest should appear as a device. 4. Navigate to `Internal shared storage` -> `Oculus` -> `Screenshots` for Oculus button captured screenshots. For VRChat screenshots taken with the in-game camera, you might need to check similar directories or the `Pictures` folder if available. Please note, the actual paths and methods might change with updates to the game, the Steam platform, or Oculus software.

AC voltage controllers are widely used in industrial settings for controlling the speed of induction motors efficiently. In this report, we will discuss the importance of AC voltage controllers for induction motor speed control, provide a theoretical background related to this topic, explain the operating principle of the power electronics circuit employed in the application, discuss control methods that can be used for this specific application, and provide a conclusion based on our findings. Theoretical Background: Induction motors are widely used in industrial applications due to their simplicity, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. However, controlling the speed of induction motors can be a challenging task. AC voltage controllers serve as an effective solution for achieving variable speed control of induction motors. By controlling the voltage supplied to the motor, the speed of the motor can be adjusted as per the requirements of the application. Operating Principle: AC voltage controllers work by controlling the firing angle of the thyristors in the circuit. Thyristors are used to switch the voltage supplied to the motor, allowing for precise control of the motor speed. By adjusting the firing angle of the thyristors, the effective voltage supplied to the motor can be varied, thus changing the speed of the motor. Control Methods: Several control methods can be employed for controlling the speed of an induction motor using AC voltage controllers. Some of the commonly used control methods include open-loop control, closed-loop control, and vector control. Open-loop control involves setting a predetermined speed for the motor based on the requirements of the application. Closed-loop control, on the other hand, involves feedback mechanisms that continuously monitor the motor speed and adjust the voltage supplied to the motor accordingly. Vector control is a more advanced control method that involves controlling both the speed and torque of the motor independently. Discussion and Conclusion: AC voltage controllers play a crucial role in the control of induction motor speed in industrial applications. By effectively controlling the voltage supplied to the motor, AC voltage controllers allow for precise speed control of the motor, thus enhancing the efficiency and performance of industrial processes. Various control methods can be employed for controlling the speed of induction motors using AC voltage controllers, depending on the specific requirements of the application. In conclusion, AC voltage controllers for induction motor speed control are a vital component in industrial settings and play a key role in optimizing the performance of induction motors.

Keep it a paragraph long.","completion":"Francisco Rolão Preto was a notable Portuguese political figure, serving as the leader of the National Syndicalists, also known as the \\"Blue Shirts\\" (Camisas Azuis), during the early 1930s. His political movement, inspired by the prevailing fascist ideologies of the time, sought to offer an alternative both to the conservative government of Portugal and to the increasing influence of Communist and Socialist groups. Despite its initial momentum, Rolão Preto\'s movement was short-lived, as António de Oliveira Salazar, the Prime Minister of Portugal who rose to power in 1932, swiftly moved to suppress fascist organizations and any other political groups that could challenge his Estado Novo regime. Salazar\'s authoritarian government favored a corporatist state structure over the mass mobilization and radical aesthetics of European fascist movements, leading to the marginalization and eventual political irrelevance of Rolão Preto and his National Syndicalists."},{"prompt":"What was Estado Novo? Keep it a paragraph long.","completion":"The Estado Novo (\\"New State\\") was the authoritarian regime led by Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal from 1933 until 1974. It was characterized by its conservative, corporatist, and nationalist ideology, aiming to preserve Portuguese tradition while modernizing the country. The regime emerged amidst political instability and economic difficulties following the collapse of the First Portuguese Republic. Salazar\'s government suppressed political opposition, severely restricted freedoms, and implemented a strict censorship system. Despite these repressive measures, it also pursued a policy of fiscal conservatism and economic nationalism that aimed at financial stability. The Estado Novo maintained Portugal as a colonial power until the mid-20th century, refusing to grant independence to its colonies in Africa, which eventually led to the outbreak of colonial wars in the 1960s. The regime finally came to an end with the Carnation Revolution in 1974, leading to the establishment of a democratic government and the decolonization of Portuguese Africa."},{"prompt":"What is Trotskyism and what does perpetual world revolution mean?","completion":"Trotskyism is a Marxist ideology based on the theory and practice of Leon Trotsky, a key figure in the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 in Russia who later became one of the most prominent opponents of Joseph Stalin. Trotskyism emphasizes the importance of the international working class in overthrowing capitalism and establishing a socialist society. It diverges from Stalinism most notably through the theory of \\"permanent revolution\\" and its opposition to the concept of \\"socialism in one country\\" advocated by Stalin. The theory of permanent (or perpetual) world revolution is central to Trotskyism. It posits that a socialist revolution cannot be confined to one country alone; rather, it must spread across national boundaries to be successful in the long term. According to Trotsky, the complete construction of socialism within a single country is unfeasible due to the pressures and interventions that capitalist countries would exert. Therefore, the revolution must become a global movement where the working classes of all countries unite to overthrow capitalism and imperialism throughout the world. This perspective underlines the need for an international strategy for revolution, contrasting sharply with the more nationalist approaches favored by Stalin and other Soviet leaders following Lenin\'s death."},{"prompt":"What was Lenin\'s perspective on revolution and the relationship between socialism in Russia and capitalism?","completion":"Lenin, a key figure in the Russian Revolution and the architect of the Soviet state, held a complex and evolving perspective on revolution and the relationship between socialism in Russia and global capitalism. Lenin’s thoughts were deeply influenced by Marxist theory, which posited that capitalism was a necessary stage in economic development that would eventually be followed by socialism, as the inherent conflicts within capitalism would lead to class struggle and the overthrow of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat. Before the Russian Revolution, Lenin argued that Russia, being less economically developed than Western European countries, could make a leapfrog into socialism by bypassing some stages of capitalist development thanks to the revolutionary consciousness of the working class and peasantry. This was a significant adaptation of orthodox Marxist theory, suggesting an expedited path to socialism through the leadership of a vanguard party—a concept Lenin elaborated in his work \\"What is to be Done?\\". Regarding the international context, Lenin believed that the success of socialism in Russia would depend heavily on the spread of revolutionary movements to more industrially developed countries. He saw the Russian Revolution as the spark that would ignite the world revolution, helping to overthrow capitalism internationally. This was partly because he recognized that a socialist Russia would be economically backward and isolated, facing the hostility of capitalist states, and hence needing the support of a global workers\' movement to survive and prosper. After the Revolution, Lenin\'s government faced the reality of attempting to build socialism in a country surrounded by hostile capitalist powers. This led to a focus on building socialism within Soviet Russia as part of a dialectical process, with the hope that successful socialist construction at home would inspire and assist revolutionary movements abroad. However, Lenin\'s early death in 1924 meant he could not fully develop or implement a long-term strategy that balanced national socialism construction with international revolution, a task that would fall to his successors, with significantly different interpretations and outcomes."},{"prompt":"What is Ricardian Socialism?","completion":"Ricardian Socialism refers to a strand of economic thought that emerged in the early 19th century, drawing upon the work of classical economist David Ricardo, particularly his theory of rent. Ricardo\'s work, while not socialist, inadvertently provided a foundation for early socialist thinkers by highlighting the conflicts between landlords, capitalists, and laborers over the distribution of wealth within an economy. Ricardian Socialists, such as Thomas Hodgskin, Charles Hall, and John Francis Bray, took Ricardo\'s insights on labor value and rent theory further, arguing that labor was the true source of value and wealth, and that the profits accruing to capitalists and landlords were unearned, essentially amounting to theft from workers. This group of thinkers maintained that under a truly free market, without the distortions introduced by private property in land and capital, all products of labor would accrue to the laborers themselves, leading to a more equitable distribution of wealth. They were among the first to articulate a critique of capitalism from a labor-centered perspective, suggesting various reforms or transformations of society to ensure that workers received the full value of their labor. Despite their varied proposals for achieving a more just society, Ricardian Socialists were united in their emphasis on the primacy of labor over capital and their belief in the need to address the inequalities produced by the capitalist system. Their ideas formed an important precursor to later socialist thought, transitioning economic discourse from classical economics towards a focus on social equity and justice."},{"prompt":"Can you simplify your previous post, but keep it adult and do not use pedantic language or talk do to me.","completion":"Certainly. Ricardian Socialism is a set of ideas inspired by the economist David Ricardo, though Ricardo himself wasn\'t a socialist. Ricardo highlighted how wealth gets divided among landlords, capitalists, and workers, noting problems in this division, especially in how workers get compensated. Ricardian Socialists like Thomas Hodgskin and others took these ideas further. They argued that all wealth really comes from workers\' labor. However, they observed that the system allowed capitalists and landlords to take a large share of this wealth without having actually earned it through labor. These thinkers believed that if the economy was arranged differently, without the distortions of private property rights in land and capital, then workers could keep the full value of what they produce, leading to a fairer distribution of wealth. They were critical of capitalism because it allowed a few to benefit at the expense of workers. Their ideas aimed to reform or change the system to ensure fairness, laying early groundwork for socialist thought by focusing on the importance of labor and the need to correct the imbalances in wealth distribution seen in capitalist societies."},{"prompt":"How was Ricardian Socialism different from Marxist Socialism?","completion":"Ricardian Socialism and Marxist Socialism are two distinct branches of socialist thought, with key differences in their analyses of capitalism, visions of a socialist society, and methods to achieve socialism. 1. **Foundation and Analysis of Capitalism**: - **Ricardian Socialism** is rooted in the classical economics of David Ricardo, particularly his labor theory of value, which argues that the value of a commodity is derived from the amount of labor required to produce it. Ricardian Socialists focused on the distribution of income between landowners, capitalists, and laborers, critiquing the capitalist system for allowing profits (rents and interest) to go to landowners and capitalists at the expense of workers. - **Marxist Socialism**, developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, offers a comprehensive critique of capitalism that goes beyond the labor theory of value. Marx introduced the concept of surplus value, arguing that capitalists exploit workers by paying them less than the value of what they produce. Marxism sees capitalism as a historical phase marked by class struggle, which would inevitably lead to its own demise and the rise of socialism. 2. **Vision of Socialist Society**: - **Ricardian Socialists** generally envisioned a society where workers would receive the full value of their labor, often through reforms or the establishment of cooperative enterprises. Their vision did not typically involve a comprehensive overhaul of the entire capitalist system or the abolition of private property. - **Marxists** propose a radical reorganization of society, involving the abolition of private property, the means of production owned by the community as a whole, and the end of class divisions. Marx outlined a transition from capitalism to a socialist society, ultimately leading to a communist society where each contributes according to their ability and receives according to their needs. 3. **Method of Change**: - **Ricardian Socialism** did not have a unified approach to achieving societal change but leaned towards peaceful reform and education to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth. - **Marxist Socialism** emphasizes the role of class struggle and revolution as the vehicle for overthrowing capitalism and establishing a socialist society. Marxists believe that a proletarian revolution is necessary to dismantle the capitalist state apparatus and construct a socialist state that would wither away into a classless, stateless society. In summary, while both Ricardian and Marxist Socialism critique the injustices of capitalism and advocate for a society where workers are better compensated, they differ significantly in their analysis of capitalism, vision for the future, and strategies for achieving social change."},{"prompt":"Simplify your previous post.","completion":"Sure, let\'s break it down more simply: 1. **How They View Capitalism**: - **Ricardian Socialists** took ideas from economist David Ricardo and were mainly upset about how the wealth created by workers ended up mostly with landlords and capitalists instead of the workers themselves. They thought this system was unfair because those who didn\'t work got most of the rewards. - **Marxists**, created by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, dug deeper into the problems of capitalism. Marx said capitalists make money by underpaying workers—the real producers. He saw capitalism as just a temporary phase that would eventually be replaced because it was inherently flawed and led to conflict. 2. **What They Wanted the Future to Look Like**: - **Ricardian Socialists** hoped for a world where workers get fully paid for their work, maybe through policy changes or setting up cooperatives where workers had more control. They didn\'t necessarily want to get rid of capitalism entirely. - **Marxists** envisioned a radical change where private ownership of production would end, society would control production together, and there would be no more class division. This would start with a workers\' revolution. 3. **How to Get There**: - **Ricardian Socialists** didn\'t all agree on one way to achieve their goals, but they leaned towards peaceful changes and educating people to bring about a fairer distribution of wealth. - **Marxists** believed in the power of a major revolution led by workers. They thought this was the only way to completely get rid of capitalism and build a society that was fair for everyone. In essence, while both groups criticized how capitalism rewarded the few at the expense of the many, they differed in how deep they thought the problem went, what an ideal society should look like, and how to achieve such a society."},{"prompt":"What are the differences between Owenian Socialism and Marxist Socialism?","completion":"Owenian Socialism and Marxist Socialism represent two different approaches and philosophies within the broader socialist movement, each with its unique perspective on society, the origins of social issues, and the paths to achieving a socialist society. Here\'s a simplified comparison: 1. **Foundational Ideas**: - **Owenian Socialism**: Founded by Robert Owen, a 19th-century Welsh industrialist and social reformer, this form of socialism emphasizes cooperation, education, and the transformation of society through the creation of self-sustaining communities. Owen believed that social environments shaped individual behavior, and by improving these environments, human character could be improved, leading to a more equitable and harmonious society. - **Marxist Socialism**: Based on the theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, this strand focuses on the role of class struggle, the exploitation of the working class (proletariat) by the owning class (bourgeoisie), and the eventual overthrow of capitalism through a proletarian revolution. Marx and Engels saw history as a series of class struggles and believed in the inevitability of a workers\' revolution leading to a classless society. 2. **Approach to Social Change**: - **Owenian Socialism** advocates for gradual reform and the establishment of model communities or cooperatives as a means to demonstrate the viability of socialist ideals. Owenian socialism is more utopian, focusing on changing human behavior and social conditions through education and communal living without necessarily requiring a violent revolution. - **Marxist Socialism** emphasizes the need for a radical overthrow of the capitalist system through a proletarian revolution. Marxists believe that only through the destruction of the existing capitalist state apparatus can a dictatorship of the proletariat be established, leading to the eventual withering away of the state and the emergence of a communist society. 3. **Economic and Political Strategies**: - **Owenian Socialism** focuses on the creation of small-scale, community-based economic systems that are cooperative and operate on principles of shared ownership. It does not necessarily involve the abolition of private property but instead promotes the idea of communal or collective ownership of production within communities. - **Marxist Socialism** calls for the collective ownership of the means of production by the working class, the abolition of private property rights in the means of production, and the establishment of a planned economy. The aim is to eliminate exploitation and create an equitable distribution of wealth through state control or communal governance of resources. In summary, Owenian Socialism is characterized by its focus on moral and social reform through cooperative communities and education, aiming for gradual change. Marxist Socialism, on the other hand, is rooted in the ideas of class struggle and revolution, advocating for a radical transformation of society to eliminate class divisions and capitalist exploitation."},{"prompt":"What is Utopian Socialism?","completion":"Utopian Socialism refers to the early form of socialism that emerged in the first half of the 19th century, before the development of more scientifically structured theories like Marxism. It is characterized by the visions and proposals of its advocates for ideal societies and communities, often described in considerable detail, aiming to achieve perfect social harmony, economic equality, and justice. Utopian Socialists believed that society could be transformed through peaceful means, such as moral persuasion, the establishment of model communities, or comprehensive social reforms. Key figures associated with Utopian Socialism include Charles Fourier, Robert Owen, and Henri de Saint-Simon. These thinkers were critical of the injustices, inequalities, and misery they saw as inherent in the capitalist systems of their time. However, rather than focusing on class struggle or the dynamics of capital accumulation as Marxist socialism does, they conceptualized ideal societies that solved social problems through cooperation, communal living, or enlightened leadership. Utopian Socialists often laid out detailed plans for these communities, including the layout of dwellings, social structures, and economic systems, aiming to create self-sustaining models that, once proven successful, would inspire broader societal change. Though later criticized by Marxist theorists for their perceived naivety and lack of a concrete mechanism for achieving societal change, the Utopian Socialists significantly influenced public discourse on social reform and laid foundational ideas for later socialist and cooperative movements."},{"prompt":"Do cooperative movements necessarily have to be Marxist or Scientific Socialist?","completion":"No, cooperative movements do not necessarily have to be Marxist or follow the principles of what is termed \\"Scientific Socialism.\\" Cooperative movements are broad in scope and can be founded on a variety of ideological frameworks. While Marxist and Scientific Socialist theories influence some cooperative movements, emphasizing collective ownership and the abolition of private property in the means of production, many cooperatives are based on principles that are not explicitly Marxist or socialist. The essence of cooperative movements is the emphasis on collective action, mutual aid, and shared ownership or management, rather than on who controls the means of production in a capitalist vs. socialist sense. Cooperatives can be found in capitalist economies and often operate within the market system, focusing on democratic decision-making, equity, and the welfare of their members rather than maximizing profits for shareholders. This model can apply to various types of organizations, including consumer cooperatives, worker cooperatives, housing cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives, among others. The foundational values of cooperatives—self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity—can align with various political and economic philosophies, not just Marxism or socialism. In fact, the modern cooperative movement often emphasizes its practical approach to improving people\'s living and working conditions rather than adhering to a specific political ideology. This inclusive and versatile nature allows cooperatives to adapt to different cultural, economic, and social contexts globally."},{"prompt":"What is a Digital Free Zone?","completion":"A Digital Free Zone (DFZ) is an initiative designed to foster economic growth and innovation by creating a designated area where digital and internet-based businesses can operate under favorable regulatory, tax, and infrastructure conditions. The concept borrows from traditional Free Trade Zones (FTZs), which are specific geographic areas within a country where goods may be landed, handled, manufactured, or reconfigured, and re-exported under specific customs regulation and generally not subject to customs duty. Similarly, Digital Free Zones offer benefits such as reduced bureaucracy, tax incentives, simplified customs procedures, and state-of-the-art digital infrastructure to attract e-commerce businesses, startups, and global digital companies. The aim is to create a competitive and supportive ecosystem that accelerates digital innovation, attracts foreign direct investment, encourages the development of digital skills among the local workforce, and promotes the growth of e-commerce and IT services. DFZs serve as hubs for digital entrepreneurship and can significantly contribute to a country\'s digital economy by facilitating trade, creating jobs, and supporting the digital transformation of traditional sectors. By leveraging advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, and blockchain within these zones, countries can enhance their position in the global digital economy and drive socioeconomic development."},{"prompt":"Who is Paul Romer?","completion":"Paul Romer is an American economist born on November 7, 1955, who is best known for his work on endogenous growth theory, which has significantly shaped contemporary thoughts on economic growth. His research integrates technological innovations into long-term macroeconomic analysis, emphasizing that economic growth is driven not just by the accumulation of capital and labor, but more crucially by technological innovation which is influenced by deliberate investment decisions made by individuals, firms, and governments. These innovations, according to Romer, are the result of intentional activities by people seeking to improve their situation, highlighting the role of human knowledge and ideas in driving economic expansion. Romer\'s theories challenge traditional models that treated technology as an external factor, advancing the argument that policies and decisions within an economy can significantly affect the rate of technological change and, subsequently, economic growth. This perspective has profound implications for government policies on education, research and development, and intellectual property rights. In recognition of his contributions to the field of economics, Paul Romer was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2018, shared with William Nordhaus. Romer has also been active in public discourse and policy advising, advocating for strategies and interventions that can stimulate sustainable economic growth and development. Beyond his academic achievements, Romer has taken practical steps to implement his theories; one notable initiative was his proposal for \\"charter cities\\"—new cities with distinct governance to drive economic growth and development in host countries."},{"prompt":"What is Fourier Socialism?","completion":"Fourier Socialism refers to the theoretical and social movement spearheaded by the French philosopher Charles Fourier (1772–1837). Fourier\'s socialist model was predicated on the belief that the inherent discord and dissatisfaction in society were the results of its economic and social structures, which were at odds with the true nature of human passions and desires. He critiqued the capitalist system of his time for creating poverty, inequality, and unhappiness, arguing that these issues could only be resolved through the establishment of a new societal organization. At the heart of Fourier’s vision was the concept of the \\"phalanstère,\\" a type of self-sustaining cooperative community where people would live and work together in harmonious conditions that aligned with their individual inclinations and desires. He believed that if society were organized into these small, autonomous communities, where the variety of human passions could be freely expressed and harnessed positively, then work would become enjoyable, and social relations would be based on genuine friendship and harmony. Fourier\'s model is characterized by its utopian idealism, proposing a radical reorganization of society into these communes without relying on the overthrow of existing political structures or a violent revolution. His emphasis on changing society by reforming its basic social and economic arrangements, and his belief in the potential for human passions and desires to contribute positively to community life, distinguished his approach from other socialist theories that emerged later, such as Marxism. Despite the fact that Fourier\'s ideas were never fully realized during his lifetime, they significantly influenced the development of socialist thought and various experimental cooperative communities in the 19th and 20th centuries."},{"prompt":"In Digimоn Wоrld, what is reduced when a Devil Chip is fed tо yоur partner digimоn","completion":"In Digimon World, when a Devil Chip is fed to your partner Digimon, its lifespan is reduced.

However, the difficulty in holding the arm in such positions varies depending on a number of factors including muscle strength, endurance, blood flow, and the specifics of the position itself. Holding your arm straight up above your head (often referred to as an \\"upped arm\\" position) typically presents a greater challenge over time compared to holding it straight out in front of you or to the side (stretched arm). This is due to several reasons: 1. **Gravity**: When your arm is up, the muscles have to work against gravity to keep it lifted, which can be more taxing over time. 2. **Blood Flow**: Holding your arm up can affect blood circulation more significantly, making it harder to sustain this position for extended periods. The muscles may fatigue faster due to reduced blood flow and the effects of gravity on venous return. 3. **Muscle Usage**: The position of holding your arm straight up activates different muscle groups, including the deltoids, triceps, and various stabilizer muscles. These muscles may fatigue faster when working against gravity in an extended position. 4. **Joint and Tendon Stress**: The overhead position can also put more stress on the shoulder joint and tendons, potentially leading to discomfort faster than when the arm is stretched outwards. In summary, while both positions will lead to muscle fatigue and discomfort over time, holding your arm straight up is generally considered harder to maintain for prolonged periods due to the added effects of gravity, altered blood flow, and the specific demands it places on your muscles and joints."},{"prompt":"I mean holding the arm vertically or holding the arm horizontally. Which is harder?","completion":"Holding your arm horizontally (stretched out to the side or in front of you) is typically easier to maintain for a longer period than holding it vertically (straight up above your head). Here’s why: 1. **Gravity**: When holding your arm vertically (upward), your muscles must work against gravity more directly to keep the arm lifted. This position demands continuous muscle engagement, leading to quicker fatigue. 2. **Blood Flow**: Holding your arm vertically can impact blood circulation, as the heart must work harder to pump blood against gravity to supply the muscles and remove metabolic waste. Over time, this can lead to faster muscle fatigue compared to holding your arm horizontally. 3. **Muscle Engagement**: The vertical position engages different muscles, such as the deltoids and rotator cuff muscles, in a more intensive way than when the arm is horizontal. These muscles can fatigue quicker due to the overhead strain. 4. **Joint Stress**: The vertical position can put more stress on the shoulder joint, especially on the rotator cuff tendons, leading to discomfort or pain over time. In contrast, holding your arm horizontally still requires muscle work to counteract gravity, but the strain on the muscles and shoulder joint is generally less intense compared to the vertical position. While both positions will lead to fatigue over time due to static muscle contraction, the vertical (upward) arm position is typically harder to maintain for an extended period due to these factors."},{"prompt":"Contexte théorique sur l\'état de paie des agents","completion":"La paie des agents constitue un élément essentiel de la gestion des ressources humaines au sein d\'une organisation. Elle représente la rémunération versée aux employés en échange de leur travail et de leur contribution à l\'entreprise. L\'état de paie des agents fait référence à la situation actuelle des rémunérations et des avantages sociaux accordés aux employés. Cet état inclut notamment le montant du salaire de base, les éventuelles primes et gratifications, les avantages en nature, les cotisations sociales, les déductions obligatoires (telles que l\'impôt sur le revenu) et les indemnités diverses. La gestion de l\'état de paie des agents revêt une importance capitale pour assurer la satisfaction et la motivation des employés. En effet, une rémunération juste et compétitive est un levier majeur pour fidéliser les talents, favoriser leur engagement et leur productivité au sein de l\'organisation. Par ailleurs, un état de paie équitable et transparent garantit le respect des obligations légales et réglementaires en matière de rémunération. Les entreprises doivent veiller à ce que les salaires versés respectent le cadre légal en vigueur et les conventions collectives applicables. Enfin, la gestion efficace de l\'état de paie des agents nécessite des outils et des processus adaptés. Les systèmes informatisés de gestion de la paie permettent de centraliser et de sécuriser les données relatives aux rémunérations, de calculer automatiquement les salaires en fonction des paramètres définis et de générer des bulletins de paie conformes aux normes en vigueur.
