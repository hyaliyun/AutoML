We utilize this step to further our calculations. - Notice that triangles ( CDE ) and ( DCF ) are isosceles at ( D ) since ( angle DCE = angle DEC = alpha ) by alternate interior angles. 6. **Similarity and Isosceles Nature**: - Triangles ( EDA ) and ( DCF ) are similar due to the equal angles ( ADE ) and ( FCD ). Thus they share proportional sides and angles. - Since ( AD = FC ) and ( DF = CD ), triangle ( CDF ) is isosceles at ( F ). 7. **Isosceles Triangle Angles**: - We find ( angle CDF = 2alpha ). - Since we know ( angle CFD = beta ), hence the interior angles of triangle at ( D ) give ( angle BDF = 180^circ - beta = 4alpha ). 8. **Equation**: - We form the following equation: [ 180^circ = angle ADE = angle EDB = angle BDF = angle FDC = (2 + 1 + 4 + 2)alpha = 9alpha ] - Solving it, [ 9alpha = 180^circ implies alpha = 20^circ ] - Consequently, [ beta = 180^circ - 4alpha = 180^circ - 4 times 20^circ = 180^circ - 80^circ = 100^circ ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{100^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"A certain store sells a batch of branded shirts, with an average daily sale of 20 pieces, making a profit of 40 yuan per piece.

The first chef earns 20% more than the first dishwasher. The first dishwasher earns 6 per hour. 20% of 6 is (20/100) * 6 = 1.20. So, the first chef earns 6 + 1.20 = 7.20 per hour. 2. The second chef earns 25% more than the second dishwasher. The second dishwasher earns 7 per hour. 25% of 7 is (25/100) * 7 = 1.75. So, the second chef earns 7 + 1.75 = 8.75 per hour. 3. The third chef earns 30% more than the third dishwasher. The third dishwasher earns 8 per hour. 30% of 8 is (30/100) * 8 = 2.40. So, the third chef earns 8 + 2.40 = 10.40 per hour. Now, let's add up the hourly wages of all three chefs: 7.20 (first chef) + 8.75 (second chef) + 10.40 (third chef) = 26.35. The manager earns 12.50 per hour. To find out how much less the chefs collectively earn per hour compared to the manager, we subtract the total hourly wage of the chefs from the manager's hourly wage: 12.50 (manager's wage) - 26.35 (chefs' total wage) = -13.85.

Explain.","completion":"# Problem: Why is the practice of joint purchases popular in many countries despite the described risks? Several factors can explain the profitability of such purchases: 1. **Cost Savings via Wholesale Prices**: Joint purchases allow significant savings on goods since they are effectively carried out at wholesale prices. The associated overhead costs related to the delivery of goods to the buyer and payment for the services of the organizers of this purchase are negligible because they are distributed among all group members. Let's break down the details of this point: - When consumers buy collectively, they can order in bulk quantities, which typically reduces the price per unit. - For example, if an item costs 10 individually, buying in bulk might reduce the price to 7 each due to the wholesale rate. - Additionally, delivery and handling fees, which might be substantial for a single buyer, get split among all participants. If the total delivery cost is 100 and there are 50 participants, the cost per participant is only 2, making it much more economical. 2. **Enhanced Quality Assessment**: A large group of consumers jointly sharing information about products they have previously purchased enables them to more accurately assess the quality of the product than each buyer individually. This allows them to choose the best options and, if necessary, exchange goods with each other. Detailed evaluation here includes: - Through collective experience sharing, participants can gain insights into the reliability and quality of products directly from other users. - This reduces the risk of purchasing low-quality goods as participants can make informed decisions. - If an issue arises with a product, exchanging within the community becomes an option, thereby mitigating the risk of individual loss. 3. **Trust and Community Dynamics**: Typically, within such communities, people are more willing to share objective information about products, organizers, and suppliers. Thus, even if there are costs associated with the described risks in joint purchases, buyers are willing to pay for purchases from those whose reputation is higher, and whose reputation can attest to the quality of the goods being purchased. Specifically: - There is a sense of trust within the community which encourages honest feedback. - Reputation plays a critical role; members rely on others with a proven track record. - Organizers with good reviews and reliable history become go-to entities, ensuring the quality and reliability of transactions. # Conclusion: Given the collective insights and cost benefits, as well as the distribution of risk among many participants, the practice of joint purchases remains attractive despite the potential risks involved. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"What is the degree measure of the supplement of the complement of a 35degree angle?","completion":"1.

Through market analysis, it is determined that a fixed cost of 300 million yuan needs to be invested throughout the year. An additional cost of y (in thousand yuan) is required for producing x (hundreds of vehicles), and y is defined as follows: [y=left{begin{array}{l}{10{x}^{2}+100x,0<x<40}{501x+frac{10000}{x}4500,xgeq 40}end{array}right.] According to market research, each vehicle is priced at 50,000 yuan, and all vehicles produced within the year can be sold. 1.

The total cost includes the fixed cost of 300 million yuan (or 3000 thousand yuan) and the additional cost (y), so the total cost is (y + 3000 = 10x^2 + 100x + 3000).

From k_{AD} + k_{BD} = 0, we have: frac{k(x_1 - 1)}{x_1 - x_0} + frac{k(x_2 - 1)}{x_2 - x_0} = 0 Simplifying, we obtain: x_0 = frac{2x_1x_2 - (x_1 + x_2)}{x_1 + x_2 - 2} Substituting the values of x_1 + x_2 and x_1x_2, we get: x_0 = frac{frac{4k^2 - 4}{2k^2 + 1} - frac{4k^2}{2k^2 + 1}}{frac{4k^2}{2k^2 + 1} - 2} = 2 Thus, there exists a point D(2, 0) such that the sum of the distances from point O to lines DA and DB is constant.

We can map each number ( 2^a 3^b ) to a point ((a, b)) in a (6 times 6) grid (since (a, b) can each be any integer from 0 to 5). 2. **Characterize the Property of the Subsets ( S )**: The problem states that for any subset ( S ) of ( T ), if a number ( n in S ), then all positive integer divisors of ( n ) must also be in ( S ). Using the grid mapping, this means if ((a, b) in S), then all points ((a', b') ) where (0 leq a' leq a) and (0 leq b' leq b) must also be in ( S ). 3. **Subset Correspondence to Grid Points**: As such, we are looking for subsets ( S ) where the set ( S ) contains all points below and to the left of any included point in the grid. 4. **Defining ( S_x )**: For each column ( x ), define ( S_x ) to be the maximum value of ( y ) such that ((x, y) in S ), or (-1) if no such ( y ) exists.

First, we normalize the angle to a value within 0^{circ} to 360^{circ} since any angle greater than 360^{circ} or less than 0^{circ} can be represented within this range by adding or subtracting multiples of 360^{circ}. This process is based on the fact that a full rotation around a circle is 360^{circ}. 2. We express 2023^{circ} as a sum of a multiple of 360^{circ} and a remainder angle that falls within 0^{circ} to 360^{circ}. This is done as follows: [2023^{circ} = 360^{circ} times 5 + 223^{circ}] This indicates that 2023^{circ} is equivalent to an angle of 223^{circ} after completing five full rotations. 3. Next, we determine the quadrant in which an angle of 223^{circ} lies. The quadrants are defined by the following angle ranges: - First Quadrant: 0^{circ} to 90^{circ} - Second Quadrant: 90^{circ} to 180^{circ} - Third Quadrant: 180^{circ} to 270^{circ} - Fourth Quadrant: 270^{circ} to 360^{circ} 4. Given that 223^{circ} falls between 180^{circ} and 270^{circ}, we can determine that the angle lies in the third quadrant. Therefore, the angle 2023^{circ} lies in the third quadrant.

Through reasoning, it can be derived that a_{n+1}=n(a_{n}+a_{n1}).

If we place letter a in the 2nd mailbox, we have the following misplacement options for the remaining letters: badc, dabc, cadb. Each of these represents a scenario where no letter is placed in its correct mailbox. This gives us 3 ways when a is in the 2nd mailbox. Similarly, placing a in the 3rd or 4th mailbox also results in 3 misplacement ways each. Therefore, the total number of misplacements when there are 4 letters is: [a_{4} = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9] Hence, option A is correct, and we have a_{4} = 9. **Option B: {a_{n+1}-left(n+1right)a_{n}} is a geometric sequence** Given the recurrence relation a_{n+1}=n(a_{n}+a_{n-1}), we can manipulate it to find the difference between consecutive terms: begin{align*} a_{n+1}-left(n+1right)a_{n} &= n(a_{n}+a_{n-1}) - left(n+1right)a_{n} &= -a_{n} + na_{n-1} &= -(a_{n}-na_{n-1}) end{align*} This shows that the difference between consecutive terms is not constant, thus disproving the statement that {a_{n+1}-left(n+1right)a_{n}} forms a geometric sequence. Therefore, option B is incorrect. **Option C: frac{{a}_{n}}{n!}=frac{(-1)^{2}}{2!}+frac{(-1)^{3}}{3!}+cdots +frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}** We know that a_{3}-3a_{2}=-1 and a_{n}-na_{n-1}=left(-1right)^{n-2}. Therefore, we can express the difference between the fraction of consecutive terms as: begin{align*} frac{{a}_{n}}{n!}-frac{{a}_{n-1}}{(n-1)!} &= frac{(-1)^{n-2}}{n!} &= frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!} end{align*} Summing these differences from n=2 to n gives us: [frac{{a}_{n}}{n!} = frac{1}{2!} + frac{(-1)^{3}}{3!} + cdots + frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}] Thus, option C is correct. **Option D: The probability that all letters are misplaced is greater than frac{1}{e}** The probability of misplacing all letters is frac{{a}_{n}}{n!}. Using the Taylor series for e^{-1}, we find that: [e^{-1} = 1 - 1 + frac{1}{2!} - frac{1}{3!} + cdots] Subtracting frac{{a}_{n}}{n!} from frac{1}{e} gives us alternating terms starting from frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}.

Therefore, the probability of this person successfully obtaining a driver's license can be obtained by multiplying the probabilities of passing each subject: P(text{obtaining license}) = P(text{subject 1}) times P(text{subject 2}) times P(text{subject 3}) = 0.9 times 0.7 times 0.6 = 0.378 So, the probability of getting the license is boxed{0.378}. 2.

The respective probabilities are as follows: - P(xi = 1) = P(text{failing subject 1}) = 0.1 - P(xi = 2) = P(text{passing subject 1}) times P(text{failing subject 2}) = 0.9 times 0.3 = 0.27 - P(xi = 3) = P(text{passing subject 1}) times P(text{passing subject 2}) times (P(text{failing subject 3}) + P(text{passing subject 3})) = 0.9 times 0.7 = 0.63 Note that for xi = 3, we don't need to further multiply by the probability of subject 3 because whether they fail or pass, they would have taken 3 exams by then. Now, we calculate the expected value E(xi): E(xi) = 1 times P(xi = 1) + 2 times P(xi = 2) + 3 times P(xi = 3) E(xi) = 1 times 0.1 + 2 times 0.27 + 3 times 0.63 E(xi) = 0.1 + 0.54 + 1.89 E(xi) = 2.53 Therefore, the expected number of exams taken by this person is boxed{2.53}."},{"prompt":"For each positive integer p, let b(p) denote the unique positive integer k such that |ksqrt{p}|<frac{1}{2}.

To solve the problem, we first need to establish the points of intersection of the diagonals within a convex pentagon. These points become the vertices of another convex pentagon. 2. Recall that in any convex pentagon, the sum of its interior angles is given by: [ 180(n-2) = 180(5-2) = 540^circ ] where ( n = 5 ) is the number of sides of the pentagon. 3.

Given that ( triangle DEF sim triangle ABC ). 2. **Using Complex Numbers**: Consider the complex plane and denote the vertices of the triangle ( ABC ) as complex numbers ( A, B, ) and ( C ). Let ( P ) be the origin in the complex plane. We can then express ( D, E, ) and ( F ) in terms of ( A, B, ) and ( C ) and some real numbers ( alpha, beta, gamma ) such that: [ alpha A + beta B + gamma C = 0 ] with the condition: [ alpha + beta + gamma = 1. ] 3. **Calculations for ( D, E, F )**: Since ( D ) is the intersection of ( AP ) and ( BC ), similarly for ( E ) and ( F ), we can find their expressions in terms of ( alpha, beta, gamma ): [ D = -frac{alpha}{1 - alpha} B + frac{alpha}{1 - alpha} C ] [ E = -frac{beta}{1 - beta} C + frac{beta}{1 - beta} A ] [ F = -frac{gamma}{1 - gamma} A + frac{gamma}{1 - gamma} B ] 4. **Using Similarity Condition**: Utilizing the given similarity ( triangle DEF sim triangle ABC ), we have the ratio condition: [ frac{D - E}{A - B} = frac{E - F}{B - C} ] This can be written and simplified as: [ frac{gamma BC}{1 - gamma} + frac{beta AB}{1 - beta} + frac{alpha CA}{1 - alpha} - frac{alpha AB}{1 - alpha} - frac{beta BC}{1 - beta} - frac{gamma CA}{1 - gamma} = 0. ] 5. **Further Simplification**: Collecting terms and simplifying: [ (gamma^2 - beta^2) B(C - A) + (alpha^2 - gamma^2) A(C - B) = 0. ] 6. **Evaluating Specific Conditions on ( alpha, beta, gamma )**: Assuming ( gamma^2 neq beta^2 ), and isolating ( B(C - A) ) and ( A(C - B) ): [ frac{B(C - A)}{A(C - B)} in mathbb{R}. ] Thus, we find that ( P ) must lie on the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ), which contradicts ( P ) being inside ( triangle ABC ).

That is, there exist positive integers ( a, b, c ) such that ( a prec b prec c ), and either ( 2b = a + c ) or ( a nprec c ). Among such number triples, choose ( a, b, c ) where ( c ) is the smallest possible. Write the numbers as ( a = 2^k a_1 ), ( b = 2^l b_1 ), ( c = 2^m c_1 ) where ( k, l, m ) are non-negative and ( a_1, b_1, c_1 ) are odd integers. Since ( a prec b prec c ), we know ( k leq l leq m ). Case 1: ( k < m ) - Clearly, ( a prec c ). - Notice ( 2^{k+1} ) divides ( 2b = 2^{l+1} b_1 ), but does not divide ( a + c = 2^k a_1 + 2^m c_1 = 2^k (a_1 + 2^{m-k} c_1) ). - Since ( a_1 + 2^{m-k} c_1 ) is odd, ( 2b neq a + c ), contradicting our assumption about ( a, b, c ). Case 2: ( k = l = m ) - Then, ( frac{a_1 + 1}{2} prec frac{b_1 + 1}{2} prec frac{c_1 + 1}{2} ). - If ( c neq 1 ), then ( frac{c_1 + 1}{2} < c ), and by minimality of ( c ), ( frac{a_1 + 1}{2} prec frac{c_1 + 1}{2} ). - Thus ( a prec c ). Furthermore, since ( 2 cdot frac{b_1 + 1}{2} neq frac{a_1 + 1}{2} + frac{c_1 + 1}{2} ), it implies ( 2b neq a + c ), a contradiction. Now, if ( c = c_1 = 1 ), then ( b prec 1 ). Let ( d ) be the smallest positive integer such that ( d prec 1 ). - Clearly, ( d ) is greater than 1 and must be odd. However, ( frac{d + 1}{2} prec frac{1 + 1}{2} = 1 ) contradicts the minimality of ( d ) since ( frac{d + 1}{2} < d ). In both cases, we've reached contradictions, establishing that the relation ( prec ) satisfies all requirements of the problem.

Given that the height submerged in mercury is (frac{(k-1)h}{k}), we need to find the volume of the submerged part. 2. **Volume of the Submerged Part:** Since the submerged height is a fraction of the total height, the radius of the submerged part will also be a proportion: [ r_{text{sub}} = r times frac{k-1}{k} ] The submerged volume (V_{text{sub}}) is then: [ V_{text{sub}} = frac{1}{3} pi r_{text{sub}}^2 left(frac{(k-1)h}{k}right) ] [ V_{text{sub}} = frac{1}{3} pi left(r times frac{k-1}{k}right)^2 left(frac{(k-1)h}{k}right) ] [ V_{text{sub}} = frac{1}{3} pi r^2 left(frac{(k-1)^2}{k^2}right) left(frac{(k-1)h}{k}right) ] [ V_{text{sub}} = frac{1}{3} pi r^2 left(frac{(k-1)^3}{k^3}right) h ] 3. **Applying Archimedes' Principle:** According to Archimedes' principle, the weight of the cone equals the buoyant force, which equals the weight of the displaced mercury: [ rho V g = rho_m V_{text{sub}} g ] [ rho left(frac{1}{3} pi r^2 h right) g = rho_m left(frac{1}{3} pi r^2 left(frac{(k-1)^3}{k^3} h right) right) g ] Simplifying, we get: [ rho = rho_m left(frac{(k-1)^3}{k^3}right) ] 4. **Conclusion:** The density (rho) of the material of the cone is: [ rho = rho_m left(frac{(k-1)^3}{k^3}right) ] This gives us the required density of the cone material in terms of the density of mercury: [ boxed{rho = rho_m left(frac{(k-1)^3}{k^3}right)} ]"},{"prompt":"United Telephone charges a base rate of 9.00 for service, plus an additional charge of 0.25 per minute.

First, complete the square for x and y: x^2 - 2mx can be written as (x - m)^2 - m^2, and since there is no y term, we leave y^2 as it is. Considering that the constant term on the right should be r^2 = 2^2 = 4, we can determine m from the equation -m^2 - 3 = 4. Now, solve for m: -m^2 - 3 = 4 implies -m^2 = 7 implies m^2 = -7 text{ (which is not possible since m^2 is non-negative)} Here we encounter an issue: the value of m^2 must always be non-negative, but our calculation says m^2 must be negative in order to make the left side equal to 4.

For every 5 times 5 sub-square, at least one corner must remain white. 2. For every 5 times 5 sub-square, at least two corners must remain white. There are 16 non-overlapping 5 times 5 sub-squares within the 8 times 8 grid. 3. **乙's Move Strategy**: - 乙 targets crucial squares to maintain at least one or two corners of each 5 times 5 sub-square white. - Let 甲 paint two adjacent squares black anywhere on the grid. If one of these is a corner of a 5 times 5 sub-square, 乙 can repaint it white immediately. Part (b): 甲's Winning Strategy 1. **Blocking 乙's Winning Condition**: - 甲 can force 乙 to fail the winning condition by methodically painting black such that it forces violation of the conditions defined for 乙. 2. **Strategic Painting**: - There are normally 32 crucial corners in the 16 5 times 5 sub-squares (since each sub-square has 4 corners, but some corners are shared by adjacent sub-squares). 3. **Maximum Moves From 甲**: - If 甲 carefully paints two squares each turn, 甲 can disrupt these crucial corners without giving 乙 the possibility of recovery: - For the first 32 moves, 甲 paints squares in such a way that it targets the crucial corners of sub-squares. - If 甲 can execute their strategy correctly, it can ensure less than 32 white squares remain after乙's move is nullified by countering the critical white square repeatedly. 4. **Proving 甲's advantage**: - If we analyze the white and black distribution strategy: - If 32 white squares remain and none can be adjacent, 甲 can force re-painting to ensure required conditions are not met across multiple 5 times 5 sub-squares. - By methodically ensuring that 5 times 5 areas contain necessary black corners, 甲 eventually ensures some 5 times 5 areas do not satisfy conditions for both at least one or two white corners being mandatory. 5. **Conclusion**: - The structured approach highlights that 甲 can actually prevent 乙 from guaranteeing the winning condition by tactically distributing black in 5 times 5 sub-square setups, avoiding adjacent corners remaining white in enough sub-squares. # Conclusion: In conclusion, both 甲 and 乙 have strategies that can be used to reach their respective winning conditions.

Thus, for 6 boxes: [ 7^6 ] 3. **Calculate the number of ways where exactly one box goes to the 8th floor:** First, we choose 1 box out of 6 to place on the 8th floor. The number of ways to choose 1 box from 6 is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{6}{1} = 6 ] After placing one box on the 8th floor, we need to distribute the remaining 5 boxes among the remaining 7 floors. Each remaining box has 7 options, so the total number of ways becomes: [ 7^5 ] Therefore, the total number of ways where exactly one box is on the 8th floor is: [ 6 times 7^5 ] 4. **Sum the unsuitable configurations:** Since the number of ways where no boxes or exactly one box go to the 8th floor are considered together, we sum up these two possibilities: [ 7^6 + 6 times 7^5 ] 5. **Subtract to find the number of favorable ways:** We subtract the unsuitable configurations from the total configurations to find the number of ways where at least two boxes go to the 8th floor: [ 8^6 - (7^6 + 6 times 7^5) ] Simplifying the expression within parentheses: [ 7^6 + 6 times 7^5 = 7^6 + 6 times 7^5 = 7^5(7 + 6) = 13 times 7^5 ] Thus, the number of ways where at least two boxes go to the 8th floor is: [ 8^6 - 13 times 7^5 ] # Conclusion: The total number of ways to distribute the boxes is (8^6).

This method increases the size until it remains within the limits of the triangle's sides. 3. **Key angles and geometric properties:** - A regular dodecagon has an interior angle of ( 150^circ ) and an exterior angle of ( 360^circ / 12 = 30^circ ). - Consider the directions of the sides of the dodecagon starting at a vertex ( D ) on side ( AB ). - Moving counterclockwise, we need to determine the directions relative to ( AB ) (which aligns with a baseline). 4. **Central Symmetric Argument:** - The dodecagon must have a symmetric configuration centered at the center ( O ) of the equilateral triangle. - If we rotate and enlarge the dodecagon such that its vertices optimally touch each side, we achieve maximal dimension. 5. **Calculating side length of dodecagon:** - The largest inscribed circle within an equilateral triangle of side length ( 20 , text{cm} ) has a radius equal to the triangle's height divided by ( sqrt{3} ).

After each pick, the remaining sum of the even indices decreases, but it remains larger than or equal to the remaining sum of the odd indices. - If ( S_1 leq S_2 ), the first player picks from the odd indices. Similarly, the remaining sum of the odd indices decreases, but it remains larger than or equal to the remaining sum of the even indices. 5. **Conclusion:** - By following this strategy, the first player ensures that their total sum will be at least as large as the second player's total sum, guaranteeing a win or at least a tie.

This is a combinatorial problem where we need to find the number of solutions to the equation: [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 9 ] where (x_i geq 0) for all (i). The number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation is given by the formula for combinations with repetition: [ binom{n+k-1}{k-1} ] where (n = 9) (number of balls) and (k = 6) (number of spaces).

Consequently, segment O P is constant in length: [ OP = BC = AB ] - Since P is always a third of the way along from C to D, it means that P must move while maintaining its distance O. - Thus, P moves on a sphere centered at O with radius AB. 5. **Analyzing Special Cases:** - If R is a point on the sphere that is not on line AB, the line through R parallel to AB will have points that form a rhombus with A B. - Points C and D on this line can be positioned such that C D is parallel to A B and satisfies the condition of being divided into thirds by P. - If R lies directly on line AB, R cannot contribute to it being a genuine rhombus; hence, these points are excluded. 6. **Conclusion:** - The locus of the point P is the surface of a sphere centered at O with radius equal to AB, excluding the two points where this sphere intersects with the line AB.

Find these numbers. б) Prove that there do not exist 11 prime numbers less than 20000 that form an arithmetic progression.","completion":"Part (a): 1. Since all prime numbers (except 2) are odd, the common difference ( d ) in an arithmetic progression of prime numbers must be even. Hence, ( d ) can be written as ( d = 2k ) for some integer ( k ). 2. Suppose the common difference ( d ) is not divisible by 3. In that case, the three members of the arithmetic progression ( a_1, a_1 + d, a_1 + 2d ) would all give different remainders when divided by 3 (since the difference between any two of them is not divisible by 3). Thus, at least one of these numbers would be divisible by 3. However, if a number is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, it cannot be a prime number, meaning that all three of these terms cannot be prime numbers simultaneously. - This implies ( d ) must be divisible by 3. 3. Similarly, using the same reasoning for the divisibility by 5, 7, and generally for any other prime number as a divisor, if ( d ) is not divisible by these primes, then the sequence would include terms that are divisible by these primes. This would preclude them being prime numbers if they are greater than the respective prime itself. - Thus, ( d ) must be a multiple of the product of the smallest primes up to a certain limit. Combining the necessary conditions: [ d text{ must be a multiple of } 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 210 ] Therefore, let ( d = 210k ) for some integer ( k ). 4. According to the problem, we need to find 10 prime numbers in arithmetic progression less than 3000.

This can be done as follows: [ n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = n(n-1)(n+1) ] This factorization shows that n^3 - n is the product of three consecutive integers, (n-1), n, and (n+1). Next, we observe a key property of any set of three consecutive integers: among them, at least one is divisible by 2 and at least one is divisible by 3. This is because in any sequence of three consecutive numbers, there will always be one even number (divisible by 2) and, since three consecutive numbers cover all possible remainders when divided by 3 (namely, 0, 1, and 2), one of them must be divisible by 3. Given this, we can conclude that the product of any three consecutive integers, and thus n^3 - n, is always divisible by 2 times 3 = 6. This means that 6 always divides into n^3 - n for all composite integers n. To confirm that 6 is the largest integer that always divides n^3 - n for all composite n, we can examine specific cases. For n = 6, we have: [ n^3 - n = 6^3 - 6 = 216 - 6 = 210 = 6 cdot 5 cdot 7 ] And for n = 33, we find: [ n^3 - n = 33^3 - 33 = 32 cdot 33 cdot 34 = 6 cdot 32 cdot 11 cdot 17 ] In both cases, and indeed for all composite n, the greatest common divisor of the factors of n^3 - n (excluding n itself when n is not a factor of 6) is 6.

Let (ABCD) be the convex quadrilateral, and let (A_1, B_1, C_1,) and (D_1) be the midpoints of the sides (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA) respectively. 2. By connecting these midpoints, we form the quadrilateral (A_1B_1C_1D_1), which is a parallelogram. This is due to the property that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a quadrilateral is parallel to the third side and half its length. 3. The areas of quadrilaterals can be discussed in terms of their diagonals. Specifically, for the parallelogram (A_1B_1C_1D_1), it is known that: [ text{Area}(A_1B_1C_1D_1) = frac{1}{2} text{Area}(ABCD) ] This comes from the fact that the area of a parallelogram formed by connecting the midpoints of a quadrilateral is half the area of the original quadrilateral. This follows from Varignon's theorem. 4. Given that the area of (ABCD) is equal to the product of its two midlines, i.e., (M_1 = A_1C_1) and (M_2 = B_1D_1): [ text{Area}(ABCD) = M_1 cdot M_2 ] 5.

Since f, g, F, G are polynomials with integer coefficients, varphi and psi will also be polynomials with integer coefficients. Step 3: Finding a trivial solution A simple pair that satisfies the equation is (f=1, g=0): [ 1^2 - (x^4 - 2x) cdot 0^2 = 1 implies 1 = 1 ] To generate new solutions from (f, g) = (1, 0) using the above formulas with (F, G) = (1, 0) will only produce the same solution.

Then: [ f^2 = (x^4 - 2x) (c + dx)^2 + 1 ] Expanding this: [ f^2 = (x^4 - 2x)(c^2 + 2cdx + d^2x^2) + 1 = x^4 c^2 + 2cdx^5 + d^2x^6 - 2cx^2 - 4cdx^3 - 2d^2x^4 + 1 ] Therefore, f(x) can be deduced to match the degree of the polynomial and coefficients: [ f = dx^3 pm c x pm 1 ] Next, we find specific dx^3 pm 1 since other coefficients must remain consistent: Step 5: Analyzing terms and coefficients consistency For d neq 0 and checking the exact terms, let f = x^3 - 1 and g = x: [ f^2 = (x^3 - 1)^2 = x^6 - 2x^3 + 1 ] [ (x^4 - 2x) g^2 = (x^4 - 2x) cdot x^2 = x^6 - 2x^3 ] This yields the same degree and coefficients match: [ f^2 - (x^4 - 2x) g^2 = (x^6 - 2x^3 + 1) - (x^6 - 2x^3) = 1 ] Step 6: Generating further solutions By using pairs (f_n, g_n) recursively with (f_{n+1}, g_{n+1}) defined by: [ begin{aligned} f_{n+1} &= f f_n + (x^4 - 2x) g g_n g_{n+1} &= f g_n + g f_n end{aligned} ] We ensure each new pair keeps integer coefficients.

Consider: [ fleft( (2k)^2 + (k-5)^2 right) = f^2(k+3) + f^2(2k-4) ] Given that ( k+3, 2k-4, k-5 ) are all smaller than ( 2k ), we use the induction hypothesis: [ f^2(2k) = f^2(k+3) + f^2(2k-4) - f^2(k-5) ] Simplifying: [ (2k)^2 = (k+3)^2 + (2k-4)^2 - (k-5)^2 ] - **Case 2: ( n ) is odd:** Let ( n = 2k+1 ): [ fleft( (2k+1)^2 + (k-2)^2 right) = f^2(k+2) + f^2(2k-1) ] Similarly using the induction hypothesis: [ (2k+1)^2 = (k+2)^2 + (2k-1)^2 - (k-2)^2 ] In both cases, using the hypothesis, we affirm ( f(n) = n ) for these values. Thus, by mathematical induction, [ f(n) = n quad forall quad n geq 0. ] This completes the proof that ( f(n) = n ) is the only non-negative integer-valued function that satisfies all given conditions. # Conclusion: (boxed{f(n) = n})"},{"prompt":"a trapezoid ABCD with a base AD , point L is the orthogonal projection of C on AB , and K is the point on BC such that AK is perpendicular to AD .

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 45 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 45 × 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 45000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 12.5 Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge.

The number of ways to arrange 5 items in 4 positions is calculated as P(5,4) = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 = 120. However, since among these 5 items, there are 4 commercial advertisements and 1 public service advertisement, and the public service advertisement can be any one of the 5 items, we need to divide the total number by the number of ways to arrange the 4 commercial advertisements among themselves, which is P(4,4) = 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24. Therefore, the total number of different broadcasting methods is frac{120}{24} = 5.

Given (|PF_1| - |PF_2| = a), we have (|PF_1| = frac{3}{2}a) and (|PF_2| = frac{1}{2}a). Now (|PF_1| = sqrt{(2+c)^2 + 2}) and (|PF_2| = sqrt{(2-c)^2 + 2}). As (|PF_1| = 3|PF_2|), we have [sqrt{(2+c)^2 + 2} = 3sqrt{(2-c)^2 + 2}]. Squaring both sides and simplifying, we obtain (c^2 - 5c + 6 = 0). Since (c < a < 3), we get (c = 2). Substituting the value of c into (|PF_1| = frac{3}{2}a), we find that (3sqrt{2} = frac{3}{2}a), which implies (a = 2 sqrt{2}). From the relationship (b^2 = a^2 - c^2), we find that (b^2 = 4). Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse is [boxed{frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1}]. (2) It is known that line l does not pass through the origin. Suppose A has coordinates ((x_1, y_1)) and B has coordinates ((x_2, y_2)). i. When line l is perpendicular to the x-axis, its equation is (x = m) (where (m neq 0) and (-2sqrt{2} < m < 2sqrt{2})). We find (y_1 = sqrt{4 - frac{m^2}{2}}) and (y_2 = -sqrt{4 - frac{m^2}{2}}). Since vec{OA} perp vec{OB}, (x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0). This reduces to (m^2 - (4 - frac{m^2}{2}) = 0), which further simplifies to (m = pm frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}). Hence, the equation of line l is (x = pm frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}), and the distance (d) from the origin O to line l is [boxed{d = frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}}]. ii. When the line AB has a slope, let its equation be (y = kx + n). Combining this with the ellipse equation and eliminating y, we get [(1+2k^2)x^2 + 4knx + 2n^2 - 8 = 0]. The sum and product of the roots (x_1) and (x_2) are (x_1 + x_2 = -frac{4kn}{1+2k^2}) and (x_1x_2 = frac{2n^2 - 8}{1+2k^2}). Thus, (y_1y_2 = (kx_1 + n)(kx_2 + n) = k^2x_1x_2 + kn(x_1 + x_2) + n^2 = frac{n^2 - 8k^2}{1+2k^2}). Since vec{OA} perp vec{OB}, (x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0), so (frac{2n^2 - 8}{1+2k^2} + frac{n^2 - 8k^2}{1+2k^2} = 0). Simplifying: (3n^2 = 8k^2 + 8). The distance (d) from origin O to line l is (d = frac{|n|}{sqrt{1+k^2}}). Squaring, we get (d^2 = frac{n^2}{1+k^2} = frac{3n^2}{3(1+k^2)}). Substituting the squared-term into this equation, we find (d^2 = frac{8k^2 + 8}{3(1+k^2)} = frac{8}{3}).

This divides the triangle ( ABC ) into two right triangles ( AHC ) and ( BHC ). 5. **Case Analysis:** - If there are points in both triangles ( AHC ) and ( BHC ), we can use the inductive hypothesis on each triangle separately. - Let ( t ) be the number of points in ( AHC ) and ( k+1-t ) be the number of points in ( BHC ). - By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a sequence of points ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_t ) in ( AHC ) such that: [ sum_{i=1}^{t-1} (P_i P_{i+1})^2 leq AC^2 ] - Similarly, there exists a sequence of points ( P_{t+1}, P_{t+2}, ldots, P_{k+1} ) in ( BHC ) such that: [ sum_{i=t+1}^{k} (P_i P_{i+1})^2 leq BC^2 ] 6. **Combining the Results:** - Consider the sequence ( A, P_1, ldots, P_t, C, P_{t+1}, ldots, P_{k+1}, B ). - The sum of the squares of the segments in this sequence is: [ sum_{i=1}^{t-1} (P_i P_{i+1})^2 + (P_t C)^2 + (C P_{t+1})^2 + sum_{i=t+1}^{k} (P_i P_{i+1})^2 ] - Since ( angle P_t C P_{t+1} ) is non-obtuse, we have: [ (P_t C)^2 + (C P_{t+1})^2 geq (P_t P_{t+1})^2 ] - Therefore: [ sum_{i=1}^{t-1} (P_i P_{i+1})^2 + (P_t P_{t+1})^2 + sum_{i=t+1}^{k} (P_i P_{i+1})^2 leq AC^2 + BC^2 ] - Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ( ABC ) (since ( angle C = 90^circ )): [ AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 ] - Hence: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} (P_i P_{i+1})^2 leq AB^2 ] 7. **Conclusion:** - By induction, the statement is true for any ( n ) points inside the triangle ( ABC ).

Let C_0 be the midpoint of side AB of triangle ABC, and let A_1, B_1 be the feet of the altitudes dropped to sides BC and AC, respectively. 2. Since triangles ABA_1 and ABB_1 are right triangles, their medians A_1C_0 and B_1C_0 are equal to half of the hypotenuse AB. 3. Consequently, if the given points C_0, A_1, and B_1 satisfy C_0A_1 = C_0B_1, then the sought-for set of points GMT is empty. This is also true in the case where C_0 is the midpoint of A_1B_1, since A_1B_1 = AB cos C < AB. 4. If A_1B_1C_0 form an isosceles triangle, then points A and B lie on a circle sigma with center C_0 and radius C_0A_1 = C_0B_1, and are endpoints of the circle's diameter. 5. If ABC is an acute triangle, then its orthocenter H is the intersection of chords AA_1 and BB_1 on this circle (as shown in the figure). Hence, angle A_1HB_1 is equal to half the sum of the arcs A_1B_1 and AB, which means 90^circ + frac{angle A_1C_0B_1}{2}. 6. Therefore, the point H lies on the arc defined by the endpoints A_1 and B_1 on the circle, containing this angle. Similarly, if the triangle ABC is obtuse, then H lies on the complementary arc of this circle. 7. If AB is a leg of a right triangle, its orthocenter coincides with the vertex of the right angle, i.e., one of the points A_1 or B_1, thus it also lies on this circle. 8. From another viewpoint, if we take the point H on our circle, then lines A_1H and B_1H intersect circle sigma at diametrically opposite points. These points must be A and B, and C is the intersection of A B_1 and A A_1; thus, triangle ABC exists for any point H on our circle. 9. Consequently, the sought GMT is the entire circle. Conclusion.

Note that the chessboard is colored in a checkerboard pattern, so each square is either black or white. 2. **Invariant Property:** The difference ( S_b - S_w ) is an invariant under the allowed operations. This is because adding an integer ( k ) to two adjacent squares (one black and one white) will increase both ( S_b ) and ( S_w ) by ( k ), leaving ( S_b - S_w ) unchanged. 3. **Final Condition:** At the end, we want all numbers to be zero.

This operation makes ( a_1 ) equal to zero. 6. **Applying the Algorithm:** Apply the above operations row by row. After processing each row, the last two entries in the row will be equal because ( S_b = S_w ). This ensures that the sum of the numbers in each row can be reduced to zero. 7. **Conclusion:** Since we have shown that the condition ( S_b = S_w ) is both necessary and sufficient for it to be possible to make all numbers zero, we conclude the proof.

The mathematics teacher says: If I insert 3 different digits into the blank spaces, the resulting 3 fourdigit numbers will be divisible by 9, 11, and 6, respectively. What is the sum of the 3 digits that the teacher inserts?","completion":"Given the four-digit number 173_, we need to fill in three digits in the blanks to create three four-digit numbers that are divisible by 9, 11, and 6, respectively. Let's proceed step by step. 1. **Divisibility by 9:** A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Let's denote the three digits to be filled in as a, b, and c. Therefore, we need to fill the blanks in the number as 173a, 173b, and 173c. The original digits sum is: [ 1 + 7 + 3 = 11 ] To make 173a divisible by 9, the sum 1 + 7 + 3 + a must be a multiple of 9: [ 11 + a equiv 0 pmod{9} ] Therefore: [ a equiv (9 - 11) pmod{9} implies a equiv -2 equiv 7 pmod{9} ] So a = 7. 2. **Divisibility by 11:** A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11. The number 173b has the pattern 1 __, 7 __, 3 for the positions. The difference for 173b will be: [ (1 + 3) - (7 + b) = 4 - (7 + b) = -3 - b ] For 173b to be divisible by 11, the difference must be a multiple of 11. Hence, [ -3 - b equiv 0 pmod{11} ] Thus, [ b equiv -3 pmod{11} implies b equiv 8 pmod{11} ] So b = 8. 3. **Divisibility by 6:** A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. - Divisibility by 2: The last digit must be even. Let's fill in the last digit c such that c is even. - Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3. We already have: [ 1 + 7 + 3 = 11 ] We need: [ 11 + c equiv 0 pmod{3} ] The sum 11 + c equiv 2+c pmod{3}. Hence c equiv 1 pmod{3}. Since c also needs to be even, the even numbers satisfying this condition in {0-9} are 4. So c = 4 is both even and 11 + c = 15 which is a multiple of 3. 4. **Sum of the three digits:** Hence, the sum of the three digits we filled in: [ 7 + 8 + 4 = 19 ] Conclusion: [ boxed{19} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the complex numbers z_1=1+7i and z_2=24i, find the value of z_1+z_2 equal to ( ).

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Property of f(x+1)**: Since f(x+1) is an odd function, its graph is symmetric about the origin. This means that for any point (a, b) on the graph of f(x+1), the point (-a, -b) is also on the graph. 2. **Implication for f(x)**: The function f(x) can be obtained by shifting f(x+1) one unit to the right. Therefore, the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0). This is because shifting the graph of an odd function (which is symmetric about the origin) one unit to the right results in symmetry about the point (1,0). 3. **Analysis of g(x)**: The function g(x) is given as g(x)=ln(sqrt{x^2-2x+2}-x+1). To understand its symmetry, we consider a related function h(x)=ln(sqrt{x^2+1}-x), which is defined for all real numbers x. 4. **Symmetry of h(x)**: We find that h(-x) + h(x) = ln(sqrt{x^2+1}+x) + ln(sqrt{x^2+1}-x) = ln1 = 0. This shows that h(x) is an odd function, meaning its graph is symmetric about the origin. 5. **Symmetry of g(x)**: Given that g(x)=h(x-1), we can conclude that the graph of g(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0). This is because shifting the graph of h(x), which is symmetric about the origin, one unit to the right results in symmetry about (1,0). 6. **Intersection Points**: Since both f(x) and g(x) are symmetric about the point (1,0) and they have 5 intersection points, these points must also reflect this symmetry. Therefore, we can deduce that x_{1}+x_{5}=2, x_{2}+x_{4}=2, and the middle point of symmetry, x_{3}, must be 1. 7. **Sum of Abscissas**: Adding up the abscissas of the intersection points, we get sum_{i=1}^5{x_i} = x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}+x_{5} = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.

Let g′(x)=0, i.e., ln x-1=0, solving this gives x=e, when 0 < x < e and xneq 1, g′(x) < 0; when x > e, g′(x) > 0, therefore the intervals of decrease for the function g(x) are (0,1), (1,e), and the interval of increase is (e,+infty).

At these points, the derivative of ( y ) must be zero: [ y' = (sin x + a - b x)' = cos x - b = 0 implies cos x = b ] which corresponds to the second equation ( cos x = b ) in the given system. 8. **Solution to the system**: Therefore, at least one of these points ( x_1 ) or ( x_2 ) satisfies both the original system of equations: [ left{begin{array}{l} sin x + a = b x cos x = b end{array}right. ] Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the given system has at least one solution.

This ensures that ( p ) is sufficiently large to satisfy the conditions of the problem. 2. **Select an Odd Integer ( m ):** Choose ( m ) to be an odd positive integer such that ( frac{p}{2} > m > frac{p}{3} ). Such an ( m ) exists because ( p > 12 ). 3. **Define ( n ) and ( k ):** Set ( n = p ) and ( k = 4m - p ). This choice of ( k ) ensures that ( k ) is positive and satisfies the conditions needed for the proof. 4. **Analyze ( L(n,k) ):** Let ( A = text{lcm}(p+1, p+2, ldots, p+k-1) ). Since ( m < frac{p}{2} ), we have ( p + k - 1 < 2p ).

This ensures that in the ( k-1 ) numbers ( p+1, p+2, ldots, p+k-1 ), there is at least one multiple of 4 and one multiple of ( m ). 6. **Multiple of 4 and ( m ):** Since ( 4m ) divides ( A ) (because ( m ) is odd and there is at least one multiple of 4 in the range), we have ( L(n+1,k) = text{lcm}(A, 4m) = A ). 7. **Compare ( L(n,k) ) and ( L(n+1,k) ):** Therefore, ( L(n,k) = pL(n+1,k) ).

Find all possible values of number of divisors of 2p^2+2p+1 .","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of divisors of (2p^2 + 2p + 1) given that (frac{28^p - 1}{2p^2 + 2p + 1}) is an integer for a prime number (p). 1. **Identify the divisors of (2p^2 + 2p + 1):** Let (q) be a prime divisor of (2p^2 + 2p + 1). Since (q) divides (2p^2 + 2p + 1), it must also divide (28^p - 1). This is because (frac{28^p - 1}{2p^2 + 2p + 1}) is an integer. 2. **Properties of (q):** Since (q) divides (28^p - 1), by Fermat's Little Theorem, we have: [ 28^{q-1} equiv 1 pmod{q} ] This implies that the order of 28 modulo (q), denoted as (text{ord}_q(28)), must divide both (q-1) and (p). Therefore, (text{ord}_q(28)) can be either 1 or (p). 3. **Order of 28 modulo (q):** - If (text{ord}_q(28) = 1), then (28 equiv 1 pmod{q}), which implies (q) divides (27). The prime divisors of 27 are 3. However, if (q = 3), then (2p^2 + 2p + 1 equiv 0 pmod{3}), which is not possible for any prime (p). Hence, (text{ord}_q(28) neq 1). - Therefore, (text{ord}_q(28) = p), and (p) must divide (q-1). This implies (q geq p + 1). 4. **Bounding the number of prime divisors:** Suppose (2p^2 + 2p + 1) has more than 3 distinct prime divisors. Let (q_1, q_2, ldots, q_k) be the distinct prime divisors. Then: [ 2p^2 + 2p + 1 geq (p+1)^3 ] However, this inequality does not hold for any prime (p), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, (2p^2 + 2p + 1) can have at most 3 distinct prime divisors. 5. **Possible cases for the number of divisors:** - If (2p^2 + 2p + 1 = q), where (q) is a prime, then the number of divisors is 2. - If (2p^2 + 2p + 1 = q^2), where (q) is a prime, then: [ 2p^2 + 2p + 1 = (pk + 1)^2 = p^2k^2 + 2pk + 1 ] This simplifies to: [ 2p + 2 = pk^2 + 2k ] Solving for (k), we find that (k = 1) leads to a contradiction. Hence, this case is not possible. - If (2p^2 + 2p + 1 = qr), where (q) and (r) are distinct primes, then: [ 2p^2 + 2p + 1 = (pk + 1)(pm + 1) = p^2mk + p(m + k) + 1 ] This simplifies to: [ 2p + 2 = pmk + m + k ] Since (m) and (k) are distinct, this also leads to a contradiction.

Note the following key point: - Adding 7 repeatedly to a number ( x ) allows for generating larger numbers that share the same remainder when divided by 7. This enables generating all numbers of the form ( x + 7k ) for any integer ( k ) and any starting number ( x ) modulo 7. 4. **Generating Remainders**: To generate all four-digit numbers, it's sufficient to ensure we can generate numbers with any remainder ( r ) modulo 7 (( r in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} )). Here are the steps for generating each remainder: - **From ( 1 )**: - ( 3 cdot 1 + 4 = 7 ) (remainder 0 modulo 7) - ( 2 cdot 7 - 2 = 12 ) (remainder 5 modulo 7) - ( 3 cdot 7 + 4 = 25 ) (remainder 4 modulo 7) - ( 2 cdot 25 - 2 = 48 ) (remainder 6 modulo 7) - ( 3 cdot 25 + 4 = 79 ) (remainder 2 modulo 7) - ( 3 cdot 79 + 4 = 241 ) (remainder 3 modulo 7) - By adding 7 to 241, we can generate numbers of the form ( 241 + 7k ) (sharing remainder 3 which can be changed through the operation ( 2x - 2 ) or ( 3x + 4 )). 5. **Verification**: From the operations, we started with 1 and managed to generate numbers with remainders 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 modulo 7 through a series of defined operations.

Prove that for all integers ngeq 3 there exists a face of the polyhedra with a number of sides not divisible by n .","completion":"To prove that for all integers ( n geq 3 ), there exists a face of the polyhedron with a number of sides not divisible by ( n ), we will proceed as follows: 1. **Assumption and Simplification**: Assume that all faces of the polyhedron are triangular. This assumption simplifies the problem because if we can prove the statement for triangular faces, we can extend the argument to more complex faces by triangulating them. 2. **Orientation of Edges**: Consider orienting the edges of the polyhedron such that all triangles, except possibly one, are oriented either clockwise or counterclockwise. This means that for each triangle, we assign a direction to each edge and ensure that the sum of the directions around the triangle is zero. Specifically, if we traverse an edge in the direction of its orientation, we assign it a ( +1 ), and if we traverse it against its orientation, we assign it a ( -1 ). 3. **Contradiction Argument**: If we can orient all but one triangle, the last triangle must also be oriented because the sum of the cycles of the other triangles is zero. This implies that the last triangle must also have a sum of zero, which is a contradiction if we assume that one triangle cannot be oriented. 4. **Deletion of the Common Edge**: Consider the polyhedron obtained by deleting the common edge of the two vertices with an odd number of edges. This results in a polyhedron where all vertices have an even number of edges. Such a polyhedron can be colored in a chessboard style (i.e., two-colorable), where each face can be oriented consistently. 5. **Chessboard Coloring and Orientation**: Color the polyhedron in a chessboard style, where each black face is oriented clockwise and each white face is oriented counterclockwise. When we reintroduce the \\"bad\\" edge (the edge between the two vertices with an odd number of edges), we can orient it arbitrarily. This results in exactly one triangle not being oriented, which is a contradiction. 6. **Triangulation of Faces**: For a convex polygon with ( 3k ) vertices, it is possible to triangulate it such that each vertex lies on an even number of edges in the triangulation. This ensures that the argument holds for more complex faces by breaking them down into triangles. By following these steps, we have shown that there must exist a face of the polyhedron with a number of sides not divisible by ( n ).

First, consider the equation for sin x: [ sin x = frac{e^{i x} - e^{-i x}}{2 i} ] Now, Kolya Vasina's attempt to show that sin x = 0 is as follows: [ sin x = frac{e^{(2 pi i) frac{x}{2 pi}} - e^{(-2 pi i) frac{x}{2 pi}}}{2 i} = frac{1 - 1}{2 i} = 0 ] Here, Vasina substituted e^{i x} and e^{-i x} with e^{(2 pi i) frac{x}{2 pi}} and e^{(-2 pi i) frac{x}{2 pi}}, respectively, assuming that x can be expressed as x = 2 pi k for some integer k. The key assumption here is: [ e^{i x} = e^{i (2 pi k)} = 1 ] The error comes from the assumption that e^{i x} = e^{i (2 pi k)} Rightarrow e^{i x} = 1 for all x. This is only true for integer multiples of 2pi. However, e^{i x} is a periodic function with period 2pi, which means e^{i x} = e^{i (x + 2pi k)} for any integer k. Similarly, for cos x, the equation provided is: [ cos x = frac{e^{i x} + e^{-i x}}{2} ] And Vasina's attempt to show that cos x = 1 is as follows: [ cos x = frac{e^{(2 pi i) frac{x}{2 pi}} + e^{(-2 pi i) frac{x}{2 pi}}}{2} = frac{1 + 1}{2} = 1 ] Here too, the assumption is that: [ e^{i x} = e^{i (2 pi k)} = 1 quad text{and} quad e^{-i x} = e^{-i (2 pi k)} = 1 ] This is again incorrect as mentioned before. The critical error lies in misunderstanding the nature of the Euler's formula e^{i x} and incorrectly substituting e^{i (2 pi frac{x}{2 pi})} = 1 for all x. Expressing 2pi as 2pi (frac{x}{2pi}) only works for x = 2pi k for integer k. In general, because the complex exponential function has an infinite number of values due to the periodic property of the trigonometric functions involved (which is related to the fact that the logarithm function ln z is multi-valued when applied to complex numbers), the proof provided is invalid. Hence, the results sin x = 0 and cos x = 1 are incorrect for all x. To summarize, the mistake stems from: 1. Misunderstanding the periodic properties of the exponential function involving complex numbers. 2. Incorrect substitution of e^{i x} and e^{-i x} with their periodic equivalents without consideration of correct values. Conclusion: The error in the given equalities is in the assumption that the value of e^{i x} and e^{-i x} when expressed as e^{i (2 pi frac{x}{2 pi})} are unique and equal to 1, which ignores the multi-valued nature of the function involving complex exponents. boxed{text{The error is due to the incorrect assumption that the result of raising 1 to the power of frac{x}{2pi} is uniquely defined.

Notice that the width (w) of the initial carpet, minus the cut portion, should be taken into account: [ 12 - 1 = 11 , text{m} quad text{and} quad 9 - 8 = 1 , text{m} ] So we have dimensions around the \\"step\\" of the configuration: [ 11 times 9 quad text{and when considering the cut} quad 11 times 1 quad text{reconfigured to fill the dimensions properly}. ] The sections are thus pieced back together to form our desired dimensions of a (10 times 10) square using the step-function approach where the steps are 2, text{m} in width each (as described in the statement). 6. **Verification**: To verify: [ text{Area of new square} = 10 times 10 = 100 , text{m}^2 ] which matches our remaining carpet area.

For this to occur, all eight dice must show an odd number (1, 3, 5). The probability of rolling an odd number on one die is frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}. The probability that all eight dice show odd numbers is: [ left(frac{1}{2}right)^8 = frac{1}{256}. ] **Step 2:** Calculate the probability that the product is divisible by 2 exactly once or twice but not by 4.

In the right-angled triangle triangle APQ, 4r^2 = AP^2 + PQ^2 where r is the radius of the smaller circle. 2. Next, consider the point Q. Note that PQ can be written as PQ = PC - QC = PC - BP by the addition and subtraction of the length segment QC. 3. Therefore, substituting back, we get: 4r^2 = PA^2 + (PC - BP)^2 4. Expanding the square term, 4r^2 = PA^2 + PC^2 - 2PC cdot BP + BP^2 5. Rearranging the terms: PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 = 4r^2 + 2PB cdot PC 6. Since 4r^2 is constant and PB cdot PC (power of point P with respect to the larger circle) is also a constant value, it follows that the sum PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 remains constant. 7. Now, considering the triangle sides and applying the Pythagorean theorem: - In triangle APC: AC^2 = PA^2 + PC^2 - In triangle APB: AB^2 = PA^2 + PB^2 - For BC: BC^2 = (BP + PC)^2 = BP^2 + PC^2 + 2PB cdot PC 8. Summing these, we have: AB^2 + BC^2 + CA^2 = 2(PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PB cdot PC) Since PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PB cdot PC is constant, we conclude that the expression above is also constant. Hence, the sum of the squares of the sides of triangle ABC formed by the chords remains constant. Conclusion: boxed{PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 = text{constant}} 1.

Define the problem:** We are given an 8 times 8 chessboard. We need to investigate if a king can visit each square exactly once, such that all moves, except the first, are into squares adjacent to an even number of squares already visited. **2. Establish the adjacency relationship:** On a chessboard, two squares are adjacent if they share a common edge or a common corner. We formalize this relationship as follows: - Each square has up to 8 adjacent squares. **3. Set up the definition of the set ( S ):** Let ( S ) be the set of all (non-ordered) pairs of adjacent squares. An element of this set ( S ) is called \\"treated\\" if the king has visited both squares of the pair. **4. Analyze the treated pairs:** - After the king's first move, there is exactly 1 treated pair. - With each move following the first, the number of treated pairs changes. The new square the king moves into creates new treated pairs by visiting new adjacent squares. **5. Parity analysis of treated pairs:** - Since each square is adjacent to 8 squares and moving into a new square adds new treated pairs, the number of new treated pairs created by each move is always an even number because each move affects multiple adjacent pairs. Thus, after each move beyond the first, the number of treated pairs remains odd. **6. Calculation of total pairs:** Next, let's calculate the total number of pairs in ( S ). - Each square is involved in several pairs of adjacency. - The symmetry of the board means the total count should be sufficiently symmetrical. **7. Bijection argument:** To determine the evenness of the number of elements in ( S ), consider rotation by 180 degrees around the center of the chessboard. This induces a bijection on ( S ). This bijection leaves two pairs fixed: the pairs of squares sharing only a common corner at the middle of the board. The board symmetry under this rotation ensures there are an even count of such pairs overall, as fixed points in a bijective mapping ensure even parity. **Conclusion:** Combining points 5 and 7: - The number of treated pairs ( S ) will always turn out odd when counting steps. - We established via parity that the total number of adjacent pairs ultimately is always even over this particular board geometry and constraints. Since for every possible permutation or sequence we cannot pair an odd sequence with an even board adjacency count, we conclude: [ boxed{text{No, it is not possible.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let the vertices of a square tablecloth be denoted by A, B, C, D, and the corresponding hanging triangular pieces be denoted as triangle_{A}, triangle_{B}, triangle_{C}, triangle_{D}.

We have thus shown mathematically that such a reordering will lead to the balance shifting to the opposite side.

According to the information given, two-thirds of the officers on duty that night were female.

To find the total number of female officers (F), we can set up the following equation: 24% of F = 140 0.24 * F = 140 Now, we can solve for F: F = 140 / 0.24 F = 583.333...

By inscribing alternate lengths, angle ABC = angle CDE = angle EFG = angle GHA. Let P be the intersection of overline{AD} and overline{EH}. Triangles ABP and EHP are formed, and considering the cyclic nature and equal arcs between points of similar length sides, these triangles are similar. Let x = AP = PH. Then AD = EH = 2x. By the properties of the circle, we know that angle APH = 120^circ due to the equal subdivision of the circle by the octagon's sides.

Given two integers (a) and (b) such that (a b + 1) divides (a^2 + b^2), we need to prove that (frac{a^2 + b^2}{a b + 1}) is a perfect square. 2. Let (frac{a^2 + b^2}{a b + 1} = k), where (k) is an integer. Then we have: [ a^2 + b^2 = k(ab + 1) ] which simplifies to: [ a^2 - kab + b^2 = k ] 3. This can be viewed as a quadratic equation in (a): [ a^2 - k b a + b^2 = k tag{1} ] 4. For (a) and (b) to be integers, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. This condition must hold given that (a) and (b) are integers. 5. Assume (k) is not a perfect square. We can analyze the characteristic equation: [ t^2 - (ka)t + b^2 = 0 ] The solutions to this equation are given by: [ t = frac{ka pm sqrt{(ka)^2 - 4b^2}}{2} ] 6. Since (a) is an integer, the other root (a') must also be an integer. Thus, from Vieta's formulas: [ a + a' = kb ] [ aa' = b^2 - k ] 7.

Step 1: Understand Supergradients We start by understanding the concept of supergradients. A real number alpha is called a supergradient of f at y in (x, z) if the following inequality holds: f(t) leq f(y) + alpha(t - y) quad text{for every } t in (x, z). Step 2: Equivalent Condition The problem condition is equivalent to stating that frac{f(z) - f(x)}{z - x} is a supergradient of f at frac{x+z}{2} for the interval (x, z) for all x < z. This condition can be verified by manipulation of the given inequality. Step 3: Assume Quadratic Form Assume f(y) = a y^2 + b y + c where a, b, c are constants. Such functions are concave if a leq 0. Verify that the function meets the inequality: 1. **Tangent Line Revisited:** The slope at frac{x+z}{2} of the given quadratic function is: f'(x) = 2ay + b Evaluating at frac{x+z}{2}: f'left(frac{x+z}{2}right) = 2a left(frac{x+z}{2}right) + b = frac{f(z) - f(x)}{z - x}. 2. **Substitute into the Inequality:** Substitute f(y) = ay^2 + by + c into the inequality to check: f(y) - left( frac{z-y}{z-x} f(x) + frac{y-x}{z-x} f(z) right) leq fleft(frac{x+z}{2}right) - frac{f(x) + f(z)}{2}. Step 4: Concavity of f Prove that f is concave: Choose any Delta > max{z - y, y - x}. Since f has a supergradient alpha at y over the interval (y-Delta, y+Delta), this includes x and z. Show: frac{z-y}{z-x} f(x) + frac{y-x}{z-x} f(z) leq frac{z-y}{z-x}(f(y) + alpha(x-y)) + frac{y-x}{z-x}(f(y) + alpha(z-y)) = f(y). Thus, f is concave, and continuity follows because any concave function on mathbb{R} is continuous (referencing the lemma). Step 5: Uniqueness of Supergradients Show that f cannot have more than one supergradient at any point. Suppose the contrary, that f has two different supergradients alpha and alpha' at point y such that alpha < alpha'. Define: g(t) = frac{f(y) - f(y-t)}{t} - frac{f(y+t) - f(y)}{t} Then, g(varepsilon) leq frac{3}{5} g(3varepsilon) text{ for any } varepsilon > 0. This proves g(varepsilon) to 0 text{ as } varepsilon to 0 indicating f must be differentiable at all points and concave. Thus f is quadratic. Step 6: Conclusion Since f is concave and differentiable, it must be quadratic of the form: f(y) = ay^2 + by + c text{ with } a leq 0. Hence, all functions that satisfy the given inequality are: boxed{f(y) = ay^2 + by + c text{ where } a leq 0.}"},{"prompt":"A cricket player has played 10 innings with a certain average of runs.

We will explore the logical steps in detail. 1. **Observation of Sum Total**: - Let's denote the five given positive numbers as ( a, b, c, d, e ). - The sum of all these five numbers together can be written as: [ S = a + b + c + d + e ] - To split these numbers into two groups with equal sums, each group must sum to ( frac{S}{2} ). 2. **Check for an Impossible Condition**: - If one of the groups contains only one number, for instance, ( a ), then ( a ) must also be equal to the sum of the other four numbers: [ a = b + c + d + e ] - However, given that all numbers are positive and distinct, it is impossible for one number to be equal to the sum of all the other four. Therefore, each group must contain at least two numbers. 3. **Consider the Possible Group Sizes**: - We can split 5 numbers into either: - One group with 1 number and the other with 4 numbers - One group with 2 numbers and the other with 3 numbers. 4. **Elimination via Group Size One**: - From the previous argument: having one number equal to the sum of the other four is not possible. Hence, this case is ruled out. 5. **Examine Groups of Two and Three**: - We now consider groups of two and three numbers where sums are equal. - Suppose we have one group with numbers ( (x_1, x_2) ) and the other group with numbers ( (x_3, x_4, x_5) ). For these to have equal sums, they must satisfy: [ x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = frac{S}{2} ] - If there exists another such splitting, it must yield the same two sums because any rearrangement within the groups will involve the same numbers. 6. **Uniqueness Argument**: - If we assume there is another way to split the numbers where the sums of the groups are the same, the way of distribution would inherently be matched to the total sum condition. - Mathematically, if there were multiple ways, their resulting pairs would overlap, leading to contradictions since our initial numbers are distinct and positive. Therefore, by evaluating all logical conditions and constraints, we find that **there must be a unique way** to split the five distinct positive numbers into two groups such that their sums are equal.

I. Proof of ( a + m_a geq b + m_b geq c + m_c ) 1. We start with the well-known geometric relations. For a triangle with sides (a geq b geq c) and corresponding heights (m_a), (m_b), and (m_c), it is given that (m_a leq m_b leq m_c). 2. The area (A) of the triangle can be expressed in two ways: - Using side (a) and height (m_a): [ A = frac{1}{2} a m_a ] - Using side (b) and height (m_b): [ A = frac{1}{2} b m_b ] 3. Equating these two expressions for the area, we get: [ a m_a = b m_b implies m_a = frac{b m_b}{a} ] 4. Consider the inequality (a + m_a geq b + m_b). Substituting (m_a) from above: [ a + frac{b m_b}{a} ] 5. We need to show: [ a + frac{b m_b}{a} geq b + m_b ] 6. Rearranging all terms to one side: [ a + frac{b m_b}{a} - b - m_b geq 0 ] 7. Factoring: [ (a - b) + left( frac{b m_b - a m_b}{a} right) = (a - b) + (a - b) frac{m_b}{a} = (a - b) left( 1 + frac{m_b}{a} right) ] 8. Since (a geq b) and (m_b leq a), the terms ((a - b)) and ((1 + frac{m_b}{a})) are both non-negative. Thus, the entire expression is non-negative. 9. Equality holds if and only if (a = b), because (m_b = a) is not possible in a triangle, as that would imply a right angle at vertex (C) and make (c > a). 10. Therefore, (a + m_a geq b + m_b). 11. Similarly, for the next inequality (b + m_b geq c + m_c): [ b + m_b geq c + m_c ] 12. Use a similar argument replacing (a) with (b) and (b) with (c): [ b + frac{c m_c}{b} geq c + m_c ] 13. This becomes: [ (b - c) + left( frac{c m_c - b m_c}{b} right) = (b - c) + (b - c) frac{m_c}{b} = (b - c) left( 1 + frac{m_c}{b} right) ] 14. Here, (b geq c) and (m_c leq b), so the expression is non-negative, resulting in (b + m_b geq c + m_c). 15. Equality here holds if (b = c) or (b = m_c) (in a right triangle). 16. Thus, we have: [ a + m_a geq b + m_b geq c + m_c ] II. Verification whether (a + m_a^* geq b + m_b^* geq c + m_c^*) 1. First, let's consider a right triangle where ( angle BAC = 90^circ). In such a case, the orthocenter (A) means: [ m_a^* = 0, quad m_b^* = m_b = c, quad m_c^* = b. ] 2. Thus, we get: [ a + 0 = a < b + c = b + m_b^* ] Which indeed does not satisfy (a + m_a^* geq b + m_b^* geq c + m_c^*). 3. For specific configurations, like when angles are (alpha = 135^circ, beta = 30^circ, gamma = 15^circ): - Here side lengths and heights are easier to express. - For instance: [ a = m_a^* = b sqrt{2}, quad c = frac{b(sqrt{3} - 1)}{sqrt{2}}, quad m_b^* = b sqrt{3}, quad m_c^* = frac{b(sqrt{3} + 1)}{sqrt{2}} ] - Check: [ a + m_a^* = 2bsqrt{2} > b sqrt{3} + b quad text{(better demonstrated through calculation)}. ] 4.

Assume there exist 15 subsets of (X), such that every union of any 7 subsets has at least 41 elements, and among these 15 subsets, any three subsets have an empty intersection. Since each element belongs to at most 2 subsets (otherwise, three subsets would intersect), let us assume that each element belongs to exactly 2 subsets (if not, we can add elements and the condition remains valid).

These centers lie in a plane parallel to the base of the cone at a distance r from the base. 3. **Setting up the problem**: Since each sphere is tangent to the side of the cone, if we slice the cone along its height and unroll it, the lateral surface becomes a sector of a circle. The radius of this sector (slant height) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 10 cm and 4 cm.

An irrational number cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, meaning it has an infinite, non-repeating decimal expansion. 2. **No exact integer or fraction squared equals 2:** Since (sqrt{2}) is irrational, there does not exist any integer (a) and integer (b neq 0) such that (left(frac{a}{b}right)^2 = 2). This confirms that (sqrt{2}) is not a rational number, i.e., it cannot be exactly calculated. 3. **Approximation with rational numbers:** Although (sqrt{2}) is irrational, it can be approximated by rational numbers (fractions). For any desired degree of accuracy, we can find a rational number (frac{p}{q}) such that the difference between (left(frac{p}{q}right)^2) and 2 is smaller than any specified small number (epsilon). 4. **Illustrating the approximation:** For example, if we choose (epsilon = 0.001), we can find rational numbers (frac{p}{q}) such that [ left|left(frac{p}{q}right)^2 - 2right| < 0.001 ] Similarly, if (epsilon) is set to a smaller value like (0.000001), we still can find such rational numbers approximating (sqrt{2}) closely enough to satisfy: [ left|left(frac{p}{q}right)^2 - 2right| < 0.000001 ] 5. **Conclusion:** The key point is that while (sqrt{2}) cannot be exactly represented as a fraction or finite decimal (making it impossible to compute it exactly), it can be approximated to any desired degree of precision by appropriate rational numbers.

For A: Capital = Rs. 3500 Time = 12 months Capital-months for A = 3500 * 12 = 42000 For B: Capital = Rs. 10500 Time = 6 months (since B joined after 6 months) Capital-months for B = 10500 * 6 = 63000 Now, we find the ratio of A's capital-months to B's capital-months to determine the profit-sharing ratio. Ratio of A's share to B's share = Capital-months for A : Capital-months for B = 42000 : 63000 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor. In this case, we can divide by 21000. 42000 / 21000 = 2 63000 / 21000 = 3 So, the simplified ratio of A's share to B's share in the profit is boxed{2:3} ."},{"prompt":"A convex polyhedron S has vertices U_1, U_2, ldots, U_m, and 120 edges.

This means: - The graph is connected: There is a path between any two vertices (scientists). - The graph is non-bipartite: It is impossible to partition the vertices into two sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. 2. **Averaging Operation**: Each scientist's opinion on the proposal is updated daily to the integer part of the average of their friends' opinions from the previous day. Denote this operation by ( f ). 3. **Sum of Opinions**: Let ( S(t) ) be the sum of all scientists' opinions on day ( t ). Since each scientist's new opinion is the integer part of the average of their friends' opinions, the sum of opinions ( S(t) ) is non-increasing over time. This is because taking the integer part of an average can only decrease or keep the sum the same. 4. **Convergence to a Fixed Point**: Since the sum of opinions is non-increasing and bounded below by 0, it must eventually stabilize. Let ( S ) be the stabilized sum of opinions. Once the sum stabilizes, the opinions must also stabilize because the sum cannot decrease further. 5. **Uniformity of Opinions**: Suppose the opinions stabilize to a configuration where not all opinions are the same. Consider two scientists ( A ) and ( B ) with different opinions. Since the graph is connected, there is a path between ( A ) and ( B ). Along this path, there must be at least one pair of adjacent scientists with different opinions. 6. **Non-Bipartite Property**: Because the graph is non-bipartite, there exists an odd cycle. In an odd cycle, the averaging process will force the opinions to become uniform over time. This is because the averaging process will eventually equalize the opinions along the cycle due to the repeated averaging. 7. **Conclusion**: Since the graph is connected and non-bipartite, the averaging process will force all scientists' opinions to converge to the same value. This is because any initial differences in opinions will be smoothed out by the repeated averaging process, and the non-bipartite nature ensures that no stable non-uniform configuration can persist.

Suppose ( T = 2pi q ). - Then, [ g(x pm T) = cos(x pm 2pi q) + cos left(frac{p}{q}(x pm 2pi q)right) ] Using the periodic properties of the cosine function, we obtain: [ cos(x pm 2pi q) = cos x quad text{and} quad cos left(frac{p}{q} (x pm 2pi q)right) = cos left(frac{p}{q} x pm 2pi p right) = cos left(frac{p}{q} xright) ] Putting these back into the equation, we get: [ g(x pm T) = cos x + cos left( frac{p}{q} x right) = cos x + cos (ax) = g(x) ] Thus, ( T = 2pi q ) is a period of ( g(x) ). **Step 2: Sequence of rational approximations to (sqrt{2})** - For any real number, there exists a sequence of rational numbers that converges to it.

This means: [ cos(x + T) + cos((x + T)sqrt{2}) = cos x + cos(x sqrt{2}) ] - Using the periodicity of the cosine function: [ cos(x + T) = cos x ] - Therefore, the equation simplifies to finding ( T ) such that: [ cos((x + T)sqrt{2}) = cos(x sqrt{2}) ] This equation must hold for all ( x ). - However, this only happens if: [ (x + T) sqrt{2} = x sqrt{2} + 2pi k quad text{for some integer } k ] which simplifies to: [ Tsqrt{2} = 2pi k ] giving: [ T = frac{2pi k}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}pi k ] For ( k neq 0 ), ( T ) would be a rational multiple of ( pi ). However, since ( sqrt{2} ) is irrational, ( T ) would be an irrational period, contradicting the notion of a periodic function with a rational period. **Conclusion** Thus, the function ( f(x) = cos x + cos(x sqrt{2}) ) is not periodic, as there is no common period for both terms.

We begin with the assumption that the given company cannot be split into two subgroups where one is a 2-unbreakable group and the other is a 1-unbreakable group.

According to the problem, a company is (k)-unbreakable if any partition into (k) groups contains a group where at least one pair of acquaintances exists. 3. In graph theory terminology, (G) is (k)-unbreakable if it requires at least (k) colors in a proper coloring (i.e., a coloring where no two neighboring vertices share the same color). 4. To approach this problem, we use the following lemma: * **Lemma:** If a graph (G) does not contain any odd-length cycles, then (G) is bipartite (i.e., it can be colored with 2 colors). 5. **Proof of Lemma:** * For simplicity, let's prove the lemma for connected graphs (since if a graph is disconnected, we can prove for each connected component and the result holds for the entire graph). * Define the distance between two vertices (X) and (Y) as the shortest path connecting these vertices. * Fix a vertex (A) and color it with color 1. Color all vertices at an odd distance from (A) with color 2, and all vertices at an even distance from (A) with color 1. * Assume towards a contradiction that there exists an edge between vertices of the same color.

Hence, (A, B_1, ldots, B_{2n-1}, C_{2m-2}, ldots, C_0, A) forms an odd cycle, contradicting the assumption that (G) has no odd cycles. Thus, the graph can be 2-colored. (blacksquare) 6. Given the graph (G) is 3-unbreakable and does not contain any complete subgraph of 4 vertices (i.e., there aren’t four persons all mutually acquainted), let's focus on finding the partition mentioned in the problem statement. * Because (G) is 3-unbreakable, it cannot be properly colored with just 2 colors, which means there exists at least one odd cycle in (G). 7. Identify an odd cycle emph{C} of minimal length in (G). Note that any vertex not part of this cycle emph{C} is connected to at most 2 vertices in emph{C}; otherwise, we'd form a smaller odd cycle, contradicting our selection of the minimal cycle. 8. Partition the graph: * Let one group (C) consist of the vertices of the odd cycle emph{C}. * Let the other group (D) consist of all remaining vertices not in emph{C}. 9. Proof of properties of subgroups: * Group (C): By construction, the vertices in (C) cannot be 2-colored properly because (C) is an odd cycle. Thus, (C) is 2-unbreakable. * Group (D): Since emph{D} is formed by vertices not part of the odd cycle, any pair of acquaintances in (D) invalidates that emph{G} was 3-unbreakable without forming 4 mutually acquainted people; hence, group (D) must be 1-unbreakable because it implies they must be fully acquainted, nullifying partitional concerns. # Conclusion: Thus, the given company can indeed be split into two groups where one is a 2-unbreakable group and the other is a 1-unbreakable group.

Therefore, the equation for circle C is: boxed{left(x - frac{6}{5}right)^2 + left(y + frac{2}{5}right)^2 = 2} (2) By the problem description, the area of quadrilateral PABC can be written as: S_{text{quadrilateral} PABC} = S_{triangle PAC} + S_{triangle PBC} Since triangle PAC cong triangle PBC, the area of the quadrilateral PABC equals |PA| cdot |AC| = sqrt{2} |PA|. The minimum area occurs when the tangent line |PA| is the shortest. Since |PA| is the distance from P to the circle C, it can be calculated from the distance squared between P and the center C minus the radius squared of the circle: |PA| = sqrt{|PC|^2 - r^2} = sqrt{|PC|^2 - 2} The minimum value of |PC| is the distance from the center C to the line 3x + 4y + 8 = 0: d = frac{|frac{18}{5} + 8 - frac{8}{5}|}{sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} = 2 Therefore, the minimum length of |PA| is: |PA|_{text{min}} = sqrt{d^2 - 2} = sqrt{4 - 2} = sqrt{2} Hence, the minimum area of quadrilateral PABC is: S = sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{2} = boxed{2} Therefore, the minimum value of the area of quadrilateral PABC is 2."},{"prompt":"f two line segments in a plane figure are parallel and equal, then in its perspective drawing, these two line segments are ( ) A: Parallel and equal B: Parallel but not equal C: Equal but not parallel D: Neither parallel nor equal","completion":"**Answer:** According to the principles of oblique projection, lines parallel to the x-axis retain both their parallelism and length; lines parallel to the y-axis retain their parallelism, but their length becomes half of the original length.

We need to prove that if the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to each vertex equals three times the square of the circumcircle's radius, then the triangle is equilateral. 2. **State Leibniz's Theorem**: According to **Leibniz's Theorem** (Theorem 38), for any triangle with centroid (G) and any point (P), the sum of the squares of the distances from (P) to the vertices of the triangle (A), (B), and (C) is given by: [ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 = 3PG^2 + GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 ] 3. **Apply Leibniz’s Theorem with Point ( P ) at (O)**: In our problem, we select the point (P) to be the center of the circumcircle, (O). Thus: [ OA^2 + OB^2 + OC^2 = 3OG^2 + GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 ] Since (OA = OB = OC = R), the equation simplifies to: [ 3R^2 = 3OG^2 + GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2. ] 4. **Utilize the Given Condition**: According to the given condition, [ GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = 3R^2. ] 5. **Combine the Results**: Substitute (GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2) from the given condition into the equation from the theorem: [ 3R^2 = 3OG^2 + 3R^2 ] Simplify by cancelling out (3R^2) on both sides: [ 0 = 3OG^2 ] This implies: [ OG^2 = 0 implies OG = 0 ] Therefore, the centroid (G) coincides with the circumcenter (O). 6. **Conclusion**: It’s well-known that the centroid (G) and the circumcenter (O) of a triangle coincide if and only if the triangle is equilateral. Hence, the triangle (ABC) must be equilateral.

Because it is an odd function, we have frac{pi}{3} + phi = kpi where k in mathbb{Z}. Therefore, phi = kpi - frac{pi}{3}, which implies phi = -frac{pi}{3}.

Jeanine bought 250 pencils. 2. Clare bought -3/5 as many pencils as Jeanine, so Clare bought: -3/5 * 250 = -150 pencils (since we're dealing with a negative amount, it's like Clare owes pencils or has a deficit of pencils). 3. Jeanine gave 2/7 of her pencils to Abby, so she gave away: 2/7 * 250 = 500/7 ≈ 71.43 pencils (since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, we'll consider this as 71 pencils). 4. Jeanine then subtracted another 5/11 of her pencils to Lea, so she gave away: 5/11 * 250 = 1250/11 ≈ 113.64 pencils (again, considering whole pencils, this would be 113 pencils). 5. After giving pencils to Abby and Lea, Jeanine has: 250 - 71 - 113 = 66 pencils left. 6. Clare squared her amount, which is a negative number, so squaring it will make it positive: (-150)^2 = 22500 pencils. 7. Clare then added a negative one-quarter of Jeanine's pencils to her amount: -1/4 * 250 = -62.5 pencils (since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, we'll consider this as -62 pencils). Clare's new total is: 22500 - 62 = 22438 pencils. 8. Now, we compare how many pencils Jeanine has to how many Clare has: Jeanine has 66 pencils, and Clare has 22438 pencils. 9. To find out how many more pencils Jeanine has than Clare, we subtract Clare's amount from Jeanine's: 66 - 22438 = -22372 pencils.

We are given a quadratic equation of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), where ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are natural numbers and do not exceed 100. We want to find the largest rational root of this equation. 2. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of the equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ) must be of the form ( frac{p}{q} ), where ( p ) is a factor of ( c ) and ( q ) is a factor of ( a ). 3. To maximize the rational root, note that since ( a ) and ( c ) are natural numbers not exceeding 100, the denominator ( q ) can take any value up to 100. Therefore, the largest possible rational root in magnitude would occur when ( q = 1 ). However, since we are looking for the largest rational *negative* root (as it will be negative based on the combination of natural coefficients), we consider the smallest feasible ( q ). 4.

The digits at odd positions are ( a_1, a_3, a_5 ) and the digits at even positions are ( a_2, a_4, a_6 ). - We have four 3s and two 5s. 3. **Sum Validation:** - For the numbers to be divisible by 11, the sum of the odd-positioned digits must differ from the sum of the even-positioned digits by a multiple of 11. - Since we only have six digits in total and all must be used, the sums we deal with must be between 9 and 21 (since (3 times 3 = 9) and (5 times 3 = 15)). 4. **Possible Arrangements:** - The only possible way we can balance the sum without creating an invalid combination is to equally distribute the 3s and 5s. - Hence, 2 of the 3s and 1 of the 5 should be placed in odd positions, and the remaining 2 of the 3s and 1 of the 5 should be placed in even positions. 5. **Calculating Combinations:** - We now calculate the number of ways to place 2 of the 3s and 1 of the 5 in the odd positions and 2 of the 3s and 1 of the 5 in the even positions. **Odd Positions**: [ binom{3}{2, 1} = frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3 ] (ways to arrange 2 threes and 1 five in 3 positions) **Even Positions**: [ binom{3}{2, 1} = frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3 ] (ways to arrange 2 threes and 1 five in the remaining 3 positions) 6. **Total Arrangements:** - Since the arrangement of odd and even positions are independent, multiply the number of arrangements: [ 3 times 3 = 9 ] # Conclusion: Thus, the total number of ways to arrange four 3s and two 5s into a six-digit number divisible by 11 is: [ boxed{9} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the simple interest on a certain amount at 25/4% per annum for the period from 4th Feb 2005 to 18th April 2005, if the interest earned is Rs. 25.

The period is from 4th February 2005 to 18th April 2005.

Speed of train in m/s = (Speed in km/hr) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed of train in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of train in m/s = 60000 / 3600 Speed of train in m/s = 16.6666666667 m/s (approximately) Now, let's calculate the relative speed between the train and the man.

During this time, the train covers its own length of 220 meters. So, the relative speed can also be calculated by dividing the distance by the time taken. Relative speed = Distance / Time Relative speed = 220 m / 11.999040076793857 s Relative speed ≈ 18.334 m/s (approximately) Now we can set up the equation with the relative speed: 16.6666666667 m/s + v m/s = 18.334 m/s Solving for v (speed of the man): v = 18.334 m/s - 16.6666666667 m/s v ≈ 1.6673333333 m/s So, the speed of the man is approximately 1.6673333333 m/s.

Substituting ( x = 150 ) into the product formula, the greatest product is: [ (150)(300-150) = 150 times 150 = 22500 ] Thus, the greatest product obtainable is (boxed{22500})."},{"prompt":"Given an isosceles triangle (XYZ) with (XY = YZ) and an angle at the vertex equal to (96^{circ}).

Set y' < 0 to find decreasing intervals of y: [ y' < 0 Rightarrow 2x^2 - 1 < 0 Rightarrow 0 < x < frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] Thus, y is decreasing on the interval (0, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}).

Since we are rotating by (60^circ), both (triangle AA'C) and (triangle PP'C) are equilateral triangles. 4. This implies (PC = PP').

According to the problem's conditions, any three planes determine exactly one vertex. 2. **Formation of Tetrahedrons**: Note that any four given planes enclose exactly one tetrahedron. The verification of this assertion is left to the reader. It should be noted that another plane can intersect this tetrahedron, and thus, generally, this tetrahedron might not be among the considered spatial regions. 3. **Constructing a Tetrahedron**: Let ( S ) be a given plane, and let ( P ) be a vertex not lying on ( S ) but being the closest to ( S ) among those vertices lying on the same side of ( S ) as ( P ). Let ( S_1, S_2, S_3 ) be the planes determining ( P ). Then ( S, S_1, S_2, S_3 ) enclose a tetrahedron ( T ). We claim that no further given plane intersects ( T ), and thus ( T ) is one of the spatial regions divided by the ( n ) planes. 4. **Proof by Contradiction**: Assume that another given plane ( S^{prime} ) intersects the tetrahedron ( T ). Let ( A, B, C ) be the vertices of the tetrahedron different from ( P ); these lie in the plane ( S ). The plane ( S^{prime} ) must intersect one of the segments ( AP, BP, CP ). Suppose ( S^{prime} ) intersects ( AP ) at a point ( Q ). Then ( Q ) is also a vertex, as ( AP ) is the intersection line of two given planes and hence ( Q ) is the intersection of three given planes. But ( Q ) is closer to ( S ) than ( P ), which contradicts the choice of ( P ). 5. **Counting Tetrahedrons**: From the above, we can find a tetrahedron corresponding to each given plane. Furthermore, if a plane ( S ) has vertices on both sides, then two tetrahedrons rely on ( S ). 6. **Maximum Planes on One Side**: We assert that there can be at most three planes such that all vertices are on the same side. Suppose there were four such planes, ( S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4 ). Let ( ABCD ) be the tetrahedron formed by ( S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4 ), where ( S_1 ) encompasses ( ABC ), ( S_2 ) encompasses ( ABD ), ( S_3 ) encompasses ( ACD ), and ( S_4 ) encompasses ( BCD ). Given ( n geq 5 ), there's an additional plane ( S ). The plane ( S ) does not intersect all edges of the tetrahedron ( ABCD ), and thus touches an edge at a non-included point ( E ). Let ( E ) be on the half-line starting from ( A ) but not intersecting ( B ). Now, ( E ) and ( B ), being on opposite sides of ( S_3 = ACD ), lead to a contradiction. 7. **Tetrahedron Count Argument**: We now count the tetrahedrons formed by the planes by assigning each plane the tetrahedrons associated with it. As seen before, at most three planes can have all vertices on their side, implying that almost every plane supports at least two tetrahedrons, while these exceptional planes support at least one. Thus, at least ( 2n - 3 ) tetrahedrons exist.

The recursion formula suggests a relationship that is common in trigonometric sequences. Specifically, since the recurrence relation resembles the tangent addition formula, we can exploit this characteristic. 1. **Analyzing the Recurrence Relation**: The relation (a_{n} = frac{a_{1} + a_{n-1}}{1 - a_{1}a_{n-1}}) is reminiscent of the tangent angle addition formula: [ tan(A + B) = frac{tan A + tan B}{1 - tan A cdot tan B}. ] Therefore, let us assume (a_n = tan theta_n) for some angles (theta_n). 2. **Initial Angle Interpretation**: Let (theta_1 = phi), thus (a_1 = tan phi). Similarly, if (a_{n-1} = tan theta_{n-1}), then: [ a_n = frac{tan phi + tan theta_{n-1}}{1 - tan phi cdot tan theta_{n-1}} = tan(phi + theta_{n-1}). ] Subsequently, [ theta_n = phi + theta_{n-1}. ] 3. **Construct the General Term**: For (n geq 2), the pattern shows that: [ theta_n = nphi. ] Thus, [ a_n = tan(nphi). ] 4. **Finding the Minimal Period**: We are given that the sequence has the smallest positive period of (2008).

Therefore, this property always holds for a rectangle. 3. **Property C: angle ABC=90^{circ}** - A fundamental property of rectangles is that all four angles are right angles. This means angle ABC=90^{circ}, along with all other angles in the rectangle. Therefore, this property always holds for a rectangle. 4. **Property D: AC=BD** - Another characteristic of rectangles is that the diagonals are equal in length. This means AC=BD.

This means we extend the table periodically in both the horizontal and vertical directions. 3. **Finding the First Hit Corner:** Because the ball follows a straight line (y=x), we follow this line until it reaches another corner of a reflected rectangle.

Assume the pentagon is positioned such that it is centered at the origin ( O ) with a circumradius ( R ). Let the vectors from the origin to these points be given by: [ mathbf{a} = overrightarrow{OA}, quad mathbf{b} = overrightarrow{OB}, quad mathbf{c} = overrightarrow{OC}, quad mathbf{d} = overrightarrow{OD}, quad mathbf{e} = overrightarrow{OE} ] Let ( K ) be a point inside the pentagon, and let: [ mathbf{k} = overrightarrow{OK} ] 2. **Cross Product Interpretation**: The cross product ( (mathbf{a} - mathbf{k}) times (mathbf{a} - mathbf{b}) ) represents a vector orthogonal to the plane of the pentagon with magnitude equal to the product of the length of ( AB ) and the perpendicular distance from ( K ) to ( AB ).

The magnitude of this is related directly to a fixed characteristic of the pentagon. Considering the symmetry and sum of these perpendicular distances for a regular pentagon, which is balanced around the circumradius ( R ), this constant value can be found geometrically or by using the pentagon's symmetrical properties.

For the expected value: 0 cdot m + 1 cdot frac{1}{2} + 2 cdot n = 1. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: - From the first equation, m + n = frac{1}{2}. - Substituting the value of m + n into the second equation, we find that 2n = frac{1}{2}, which simplifies to n = frac{1}{4}. - Knowing n = frac{1}{4} and substituting back into m + n = frac{1}{2}, we find m = frac{1}{4}. Therefore, we have m = n = frac{1}{4}, which makes option A correct: n = frac{1}{4}. Next, we calculate the variance D(X), which is given by E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2.

Let's correct the calculation for D(X): - D(X) = frac{1}{4} cdot (0 - 1)^2 + frac{1}{2} cdot (1 - 1)^2 + frac{1}{4} cdot (2 - 1)^2 = frac{1}{4} + 0 + frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2}.

Given D(X) = frac{1}{2}, we have D(2X+1) = 4 cdot frac{1}{2} = 2, making option C incorrect. Finally, for option D, the expected value of a transformed variable Y = 2X + 1 is given by E(Y) = 2E(X) + 1. Since E(X) = 1, we have E(2X+1) = 2 cdot 1 + 1 = 3, making option D correct.

This line is along the height of the frustum. 3. **Symmetry Argument:** Points (B) and (B_1) are symmetric to points (C) and (C_1) with respect to the line (DD_1). Thus, the distances (BB_1 = CC_1). 4. **Perpendicular Projection:** We drop a perpendicular from point (A_1) to the plane (ABC), meeting it at point (E). 5. **Lengths of the Bases:** Let (BC = x) and (B_1C_1 = y). The projections of (BB_1) and (CC_1) onto the plane are both equal to (frac{x - y}{2}). 6. **Finding the Projection:** Using the properties of projections and the given angle ( alpha ), we have: [ A D = frac{x sqrt{3}}{2}, quad E D = A_{1} D_{1} = frac{y sqrt{3}}{2} ] Therefore, the projection (A E) in the plane is: [ A E = AD - ED = frac{(x - y) sqrt{3}}{2} ] 7. **Using Trigonometry:** The side (AA_1) is the larger lateral edge and (AA_1 = l). The angle between (AA_1) and the base plane, (angle A_1AE = alpha), gives: [ AA_1 = l, quad AE = l cos alpha, quad D D_1 = l sin alpha ] 8. **Height of the Centers:** We consider the projection of (O_1F) parallel to (A_1E). Here, (O_1F perp AD), thus making: [ O_1F = l sin alpha ] 9. **Calculating Distance (OO_1):** Thus, the distance (OF) is determined by: [ OF = OD - FD = OD - O_1D_1 = frac{1}{3} (AD - A_1D_1) = frac{1}{3} AE = frac{l cos alpha}{3} ] 10. **Using Pythagorean Theorem:** Working in the right triangle ( O F O_1 ): [ OO_1 = sqrt{OF^2 + O_1F^2} = sqrt{left(frac{l cos alpha}{3}right)^2 + (l sin alpha)^2} ] Simplifying: [ OO_1 = sqrt{frac{l^2 cos^2 alpha}{9} + l^2 sin^2 alpha} = frac{l}{3} sqrt{cos^2 alpha + 9 sin^2 alpha} ] Next, using trigonometric identities: [ cos^2 alpha + 9 sin^2 alpha = 1 + 8 sin^2 alpha = 1 + 4 (1 - cos 2 alpha) = 5 - 4 cos 2 alpha ] 11. **Final Expression for Distance (OO_1):** [ OO_1 = frac{l}{3} sqrt{5 - 4 cos 2 alpha} ] # Conclusion: The length of the segment connecting the centers of the upper and lower bases is [ boxed{frac{l}{3} sqrt{5 - 4 cos 2 alpha}} ]"},{"prompt":"George was selling some of his old toys on the internet.

This gives us the equation: [2x + 3y = 20] We can rearrange this equation to solve for x in terms of y: [x = 10 - frac{3}{2}y] Since x and y must be positive integers (because you can't buy a fraction of a flower), we can substitute different integer values for y to see which ones give us an integer value for x. 1. When y = 2, we substitute into the equation to get x = 10 - frac{3}{2}(2) = 10 - 3 = 7. So, one option is x = 7 carnations and y = 2 lilies. 2. When y = 4, substituting gives x = 10 - frac{3}{2}(4) = 10 - 6 = 4. Thus, another option is x = 4 carnations and y = 4 lilies. 3. When y = 6, we find x = 10 - frac{3}{2}(6) = 10 - 9 = 1.
