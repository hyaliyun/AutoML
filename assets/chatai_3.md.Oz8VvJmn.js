Thus, we have: - u'=e^{x} (since the derivative of e^{x} is e^{x}), - v'=1 (since the derivative of x-2 is 1). Therefore, {f'}left(xright)=e^{x}cdot 1 + e^{x}cdot (x-2)' = e^{x}(1) + e^{x}(x-2)' = e^{x}(x-1). - To find {f'}left(0right), we substitute x=0 into {f'}left(xright): {f'}left(0right)=e^{0}(0-1) = 1cdot (-1) = -1. - To find {f'}left(-1right), we substitute x=-1 into {f'}left(xright): {f'}left(-1right)=e^{-1}(-1-1) = frac{1}{e}cdot (-2) = -frac{2}{e}.

The problem involves two sequences, each consisting of 1961 natural numbers, positioned one below another. We need to show that it is possible to rearrange the numbers in each sequence such that, when adding the numbers that are placed one above the other, the result is another sequence of 1961 consecutive natural numbers. 1. Understand the Problem: We are given: - Two sequences S_1 and S_2, each containing 1961 natural numbers. - The task is to rearrange these sequences so that the sum of each pair of corresponding elements from the two sequences forms a new sequence of 1961 consecutive natural numbers. 2. Define the Sequences: Let: - S_1 = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1961}} - S_2 = {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{1961}} 3. Condition for Consecutive Numbers: To achieve this, the resulting sums {c_1, c_2, ldots, c_{1961}} where c_i = a_i + b_i (after rearrangement) must form a sequence of 1961 consecutive natural numbers. Let’s denote the smallest element of the target consecutive sequence by m. Thus, the required sequence is {m, m+1, ldots, m+1960}. 4.

Applying the Rearrangement: To meet the requirement, we can utilize rearrangement such that: - The smallest element of S_1 is paired with the largest element of S_2. - The second smallest element of S_1 is paired with the second largest element of S_2, and so on. Formally: - Let S_1 be sorted in ascending order: {a_1 leq a_2 leq cdots leq a_{1961}}. - Let S_2 be sorted in descending order: {b_1 geq b_2 geq cdots geq b_{1961}}. Assign the pairs such that: [ c_i = a_i + b_i = m + (i-1). ] 6. Confirm the Condition: Now confirm if such a pairing will produce correct consecutive sums. Define: - A = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1961}} as sorted version of S_1, - B = {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{1961}} as reverse sorted version of S_2. By construction of the sums, one can confirm that the pairs {a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, ldots, a_{1961} + b_{1961}} can be consecutively increasing.

Let r be the length of the smallest cycle among these remaining cycles. 3. **Properties of Cycles Regarding f_r(x):** The points in a cycle of length ( r ) remain fixed for the function ( f_{r}(x) ). This characteristic follows directly from the properties of periodic functions. Here's the reasoning: - Given any cycle of length ( r ), the function f applied ( r ) times (i.e., ( f_{r}(x) )) must leave the points of this cycle fixed. - According to a related problem (Problem 149), if ( f_{r}(x) ) fixes all points in a cycle, it must fix all points of shorter or equal length cycles too. 4. **Cycles of Different Lengths ( s ):** Now, consider any other cycle with length ( s ). According to Problem 148, since ( f_{r}(x) ) keeps its points fixed, ( r ) must be a divisor of ( s ). The steps can be detailed as: - Choose any cycle of length ( s ). - Apply ( f ) ( r ) times, i.e., consider ( f_{r}(x) ). As we’ve established, ( f_{r}(x) ) fixes the points of the cycle. - Since ( f_{r}(x) ) fixes every point of the ( s )-cycle, ( r ) must divide ( s ). 5. **Equality of Cycle Lengths:** Given that ( r ) is the length of the smallest cycle and that any cycle length ( s ) must be such that ( r ) divides ( s ) while maintaining ( r leq s ), we conclude that ( r = s ).

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of inversion. 1. **Understanding Inversion:** Inversion is a geometric transformation where points are mapped to new locations based on a fixed circle (called the inversion circle). For a point A, the inversion of another point P with respect to a circle of center A and radius r is defined such that the product of the distances from A to P and its inverse P' is equal to ( r^2 ). 2. **Given Circle and Inversion:** We need to perform an inversion centered at the given point ( A ). Denote the two given circles by ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ). The result of this inversion will transform these circles into new figures, which we denote as ( S_1^* ) and ( S_2^* ). 3. **Transforming the Circles:** Under inversion, the given circles ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) will transform: - If the circle passes through the center of inversion, it transforms into a line. - If the circle does not pass through the center of inversion, it will transform into another circle. Because the problem specifies that we construct a circle perpendicular to the given circles, under inversion, these result in specific conditions for the circles and the straight lines formed. 4. **Line Intersection Post Inversion:** Suppose our original circles ( S1 ) and ( S2 ) transform into circles or lines ( S1^* ) and ( S2^* ) under the inversion centered at ( A ). If these transformations are lines, the goal is to draw a circle that intersects these lines perpendicularly. 5. **Drawing the Circle in the Inverse Plane:** The required circle in the original plane is a line (which is perpendicular to the images of ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) under inversion and connects their centers). In the transformed plane, these lines (S_1^*) and (S_2^*) intersect. The circle in the inverse plane must pass through the intersection points created by connecting the centers of inversion transformed circles or lines. 6. **Returning to the Original Plane:** Transforming this back under inverse transformation, the line that intersects perpendicularly with the transformed objects becomes a circle that is tangent at right angles to the original circles ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ).

If ( n = 999 ), we calculate: [ Sigma(999) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 ] - Now, ( 2 cdot 999 = 1998 ), so [ Sigma(1998) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 27 ] - Similarly, ( 3 cdot 999 = 2997 ), so [ Sigma(2997) = 2 + 9 + 9 + 7 = 27 ] - And more generally for any ( k ): [ Sigma(k cdot 999) = 27 ] 7. Therefore, recognizing ( n = 999 ) meets this criteria, bounded by three digits, where the sum of digits aggregate to same end-digits sum properties. 8. By validation of the digit-sum congruency checks: [ Sigma(n) = Sigma(kn) = 27 text{ for all } k in {1, 2, ldots, n} ] we conclude that ( n = 999 ) is the suitable and smallest three-digit solution. # Conclusion: [ boxed{999} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the tens digit of 9^{2023}?

The cable company took away 20 channels and replaced them with 12 channels. This is a net loss of 8 channels (20 - 12 = 8). So, Larry now has 150 - 8 = 142 channels. 3. Larry then asked to reduce his package by 10 more channels but add the sports package which is 8 channels. This is a net loss of 2 channels (10 - 8 = 2). So, Larry now has 142 - 2 = 140 channels. 4. Finally, Larry adds the supreme sports package. After this addition, Larry has 147 channels. To find out how many channels were in the supreme sports package, we need to see the difference between the number of channels Larry had before adding the supreme sports package and the number he had after adding it.

However, each face is shared by two cubes, so ( frac{48}{2} = 24 ), but this counts each square face once for every cube it belongs to in the tesseract, so there are 24 unique square faces. 4. **Calculate the Sum**: Add the number of edges, vertices, and faces: [ 32 text{ (edges)} + 16 text{ (vertices)} + 24 text{ (faces)} = 72 ] 5. **Conclusion**: The sum of the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a tesseract is 72. 72 The final answer is boxed{mathrm{(C)} 72}"},{"prompt":"Let a, b, and c be positive real numbers.

Let another right triangle have its legs of lengths 2t and 1t^{2}. Show that the angle opposite to the leg of length 2t in the second triangle is twice the smallest angle of the original triangle!","completion":"The problem states that we have two right-angled triangles. In the first triangle, the longer leg has a length of 1, and the shorter leg has a length of ( t ). In the second triangle, the lengths of the legs are ( 2t ) and ( 1-t^2 ). We need to show that the angle opposite the side of length ( 2t ) in the second triangle is twice the smallest angle in the first triangle. I. Proof 1. Draw the first right-angled triangle ( triangle ABC ) with ( AC = t ) and ( BC = 1 ). 2. Measure ( BD = 1-t^2 ) on ( BC ), and raise a perpendicular to ( BC ) through point ( D ) on the side containing ( A ), such that ( DE = 2t ). 3. We need to prove that ( angle EBD = 2 angle ABC ). This would be true if the line ( AB ) bisects ( angle EBD ), indicating that ( AB ) is the angle bisector. 4. Denote the intersection of the line ( EA ) and ( BD ) as ( F ). 5. Notice that ( AC ) is the midline of ( triangle FED ), since it is parallel to ( ED ) and half its length. To verify, if ( A ) and ( C ) were closer to or farther from ( F ) than the respective midpoint, their connecting line would be shorter or longer than half of ( ED ). 6. Conclude that ( EA = AF ), and ( FC = CD = BC - DB = 1 - (1 - t^2) = t^2 ). 7. Observe that triangles ( triangle FAC ) and ( triangle ABC ) are similar because both are right-angled at ( C ) and have equal leg ratios: frac{AC}{FC} = frac{t}{t^2} = frac{1}{t} = frac{BC}{AC}. Since corresponding sides are proportional, and their corresponding angles are similar, it follows that ( FA perp AB ). 8. Hence, ( AB ) bisects ( EF ) and is perpendicular to it, making ( AB ) the axis of symmetry for ( triangle EBF ). So, ( angle EBF ) equals ( angle ABD ), thus ( angle EBD = 2 angle ABC ). This proves our claim. II. Alternative Proof 1. Draw ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle EBD ) as per the previous construction. 2. Let a line through ( A ) parallel to ( BC ) intersect ( BE ) and ( DE ) at points ( G ) and ( H ), respectively. Then ( GH ) is the midline of ( triangle BDE ) because ( DH = CA = t = frac{1}{2}DE ), with ( GH parallel BD ). 3. By Pythagoras' theorem: BG = frac{1}{2} BE = frac{1}{2} sqrt{BD^2 + DE^2} = frac{1}{2} sqrt{(1-t^2)^2 + 4t^2} = frac{1+t^2}{2}, and also, GA = GH + HA = frac{BD}{2} + DC = frac{1-t^2}{2} + (1 - (1-t^2)) = frac{1+t^2}{2}. 4. Consequently, ( triangle ABG ) is isosceles. As ( GA parallel BC ), we have: angle EBA = angle GBA = angle GAB = angle ABD, thus ( angle EBD = 2 angle ABD ). III. Another Alternative Proof 1. Draw the same triangles as in the previous solutions. Let ( M ) be the intersection of lines ( AB ) and ( DE ). 2. It is enough to show that ( M ) divides ( DE ) in the same ratio as the angle bisector, since a point ( P ) moving along ( DE ) keeps the ratio ( frac{DP}{PE} ) monotonically increasing. 3. Knowing that the angle bisector divides ( DE ) in the ratio of the lengths ( BD ) and ( BE ): BE = sqrt{BD^2 + DE^2} = sqrt{(1-t^2)^2 + (2t)^2} = 1 + t^2, the required division ratio is ( frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} ). 4. By similarity of triangles ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle MBD ): frac{MD}{BD} = frac{AC}{BC}, quad MD = frac{AC cdot BD}{BC} = t(1-t^2), and we get: frac{DM}{ME} = frac{t(1-t^2)}{2t - t(1-t^2)} = frac{t(1-t^2)}{t(1+t^2)} = frac{BD}{BE}. 5. Therefore, ( M ) divides ( DE ) in the ratio of ( BD ) and ( BE ), making ( BM ) the angle bisector, and confirming that ( angle EBD = 2 angle ABC ). Hence, the final proof is complete: (boxed{})"},{"prompt":"A traffic light follows a cycle of green for 45 seconds, yellow for 5 seconds, and red for 35 seconds.

Given the equation y = -5x + 3, we identify two key components: - The slope (k) is -5, which is less than 0 (k = -5 < 0). - The y-intercept (b) is 3, which is greater than 0 (b = 3 > 0). The negative slope indicates that the line is decreasing as x increases, which means the line will pass through the quadrants where x and y can have both positive and negative values, but starting from a positive y-intercept. 1. Since b > 0, the line starts in the positive y region, indicating it passes through Quadrant I or II initially. 2. The negative slope (k < 0) means as x increases (moves right), y decreases, crossing from the positive y area to the negative y area, which leads the line to pass through Quadrant IV eventually. Combining these observations, the line passes through: - Quadrant I, because it starts with y > 0 and x > 0. - Quadrant II, as x becomes negative while y is still positive due to the positive y-intercept. - Quadrant IV, because as x increases further, y becomes negative, crossing the x-axis from Quadrant I directly to Quadrant IV.

Given that for each real number ( x ), ( f(x) ) is the square of an integer if and only if ( g(x) ) is also the square of an integer. 2. **Behavior of polynomials at large ( x ):** Since ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) are polynomials, their leading terms dominate as ( x ) becomes large. Specifically, ( f(x) approx x^m ) and ( g(x) approx x^n ) for large ( x ). Both polynomials will eventually be positive and increasing if ( m ) and ( n ) are even, or if the leading coefficients are positive. 3. **Identify points where ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) are squares of integers:** Let ( r ) be a point after which ( f(x) ) is increasing and positive, and similarly, let ( s ) be a point after which ( g(x) ) is increasing and positive.

This includes successive averages such as a_k', a_k'', etc., where each a_k' is given by [ a_k' = frac{a_k + a_{k+1}}{2}. ] Step 1: Basis Case We must first establish that the nature of \\"good\\" sequences holds for the initial step. Suppose the sequence x_k is good, which implies all terms in x_k and all its successive averages are integers. Define a new sequence y_k where y_k = x_k^2.

A: The smallest positive period is pi B: The center of symmetry is (frac{π}{6}+frac{kπ}{2}, 0) where k∈Z C: A line of symmetry is x=frac{7π}{12} D: Monotonically increasing on (0, frac{π}{6})","completion":"To analyze the function g(x) based on the transformations applied to f(x) = sin x, we proceed as follows: 1. **Shortening the Abscissa**: The abscissa of each point on the graph of f(x) = sin x is shortened to frac{1}{2} of its original length. This transformation can be represented by the function y = sin(2x). This is because if the original function has a point (x, y), after shortening, the point becomes (frac{x}{2}, y), which means we need to double the input x to get the same output y from the original function. 2. **Shifting Left**: The graph of y = sin(2x) is then shifted to the left by frac{pi}{6} units. This can be represented by the function g(x) = sin(2(x + frac{pi}{6})) = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}). Now, let's analyze the given statements: - **Statement A**: The smallest positive period of g(x) = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) is pi. This is because the period of sin x is 2pi, and multiplying the argument by 2 (as in 2x) halves the period to pi. Therefore, statement A is correct. - **Statement B**: The center of symmetry for g(x) can be found by setting 2x + frac{pi}{3} = kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}. Solving for x gives x = frac{kpi}{2} - frac{pi}{6}, which matches the centers of symmetry described in statement B. Thus, statement B is correct. - **Statement C**: To check if x = frac{7pi}{12} is a line of symmetry, we evaluate g(frac{7pi}{12}) = sin(2(frac{7pi}{12}) + frac{pi}{3}) = sin(frac{7pi}{6} + frac{pi}{3}) = sin(frac{3pi}{2}) = -1. This point is indeed a minimum for the function, indicating that x = frac{7pi}{12} is a line of symmetry. Therefore, statement C is correct. - **Statement D**: For x in (0, frac{pi}{6}), we have 2x + frac{pi}{3} in (frac{pi}{3}, frac{2pi}{3}). The function sin x is monotonically increasing in (frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{2}) and decreasing in (frac{pi}{2}, frac{2pi}{3}). Therefore, g(x) cannot be monotonically increasing over the entire interval (0, frac{pi}{6}), making statement D incorrect.

This situation occurs because the centers of the circles inscribed around the faces of the tetrahedron would all lie in one plane, implying the radius of the sphere passing through these points (the sixteen-point sphere) would be infinite. 4. **Connecting Both Cases with Deformation:** - Note that any regular tetrahedron can be continuously deformed into a tetrahedron where there are three right angles at a vertex. - During this deformation, the ratio ( frac{r}{R} ) will vary smoothly. 5. **Intermediate Positions:** - Since it is possible to deform the tetrahedron continuously, there exists an intermediate position where ( r = frac{R}{2} ). This is because we can continuously change the parameters of the tetrahedron to produce every value of ( frac{r}{R} ) between (frac{1}{3}) and (infty). 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, there does exist a tetrahedron for which the radius of the sixteen-point sphere is half the radius of the circumscribed sphere.

Let the heights of these pyramids, which are the perpendicular distances from P to the four faces of the tetrahedron, be denoted as h_1, h_2, h_3, and h_4. 3. **Volume Calculation**: The volume V of the entire tetrahedron remains the same irrespective of the position of P. The volume of a pyramid is given by the formula: [ V = frac{1}{3} text{Base Area} times text{Height} ] Therefore, the volumes of the smaller pyramids can be expressed as: [ V_1 = frac{1}{3} S_1 h_1, quad V_2 = frac{1}{3} S_2 h_2, quad V_3 = frac{1}{3} S_3 h_3, quad V_4 = frac{1}{3} S_4 h_4 ] where S_1, S_2, S_3, and S_4 are the areas of the four faces of the tetrahedron. 4. **Summing the Volumes**: Since S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = S_4 = S (because it is a regular tetrahedron and all faces have the same area), we have: [ V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + V_4 = frac{1}{3} S h_1 + frac{1}{3} S h_2 + frac{1}{3} S h_3 + frac{1}{3} S h_4 ] Simplifying this, we obtain: [ V = frac{1}{3} S (h_1 + h_2 + h_3 + h_4) ] 5. **Isolating the Sum of Heights**: Solving for the sum of the heights, we get: [ h_1 + h_2 + h_3 + h_4 = frac{3V}{S} ] 6. **Conclusion**: Since the volume V of the tetrahedron and the area S of its faces are both constants, the expression frac{3V}{S} must also be a constant. This proves that the sum of the distances from any point P inside the tetrahedron to its four faces is a constant value.

The numbering is done in a clockwise direction. 2. **New Numbers After Replacement:** After the specified replacement, the numbers in the vertices will be: [ a_2 - a_3, a_3 - a_4, ldots, a_{16} - a_{17}, a_{17} - a_1, a_1 - a_2 ] 3. **Sum of New Numbers:** Observe that if we sum all the new numbers: [ sum_{i=1}^{17} (a_{i+1} - a_{i+2}) ] where (a_{18} = a_1) and (a_{19} = a_2). Therefore, [ (a_2 - a_3) + (a_3 - a_4) + ldots + (a_{17} - a_1) + (a_1 - a_2) ] Notice that every term (a_i) cancels out: [ a_2 - a_3 + a_3 - a_4 + ldots + a_{17} - a_1 + a_1 - a_2 = 0 ] 4. **Parity Argument:** - Since the sum of the new numbers is zero, there must be an even number of even terms for parity to balance (i.e., an even number of numbers). - As 17 is odd, it forces that at least one of the terms among the 17 is even to make the overall sum zero. 5. **Product Argument:** - If any one of the resulting 17 numbers is even, the product of these numbers must be even since the product of any set of integers containing an even number is even. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, it is impossible for the product of the resulting numbers to be odd.

The total cost is 50, and one kid's ticket is 5. How many kids are going to the circus?","completion":"Let's denote the number of kids going to the circus as K and the number of adults as A. We know that one kid's ticket costs 5, which is half the cost of an adult ticket. Therefore, one adult ticket costs 5 * 2 = 10. The total cost for all tickets is 50. We can write an equation to represent this: Cost of kid's tickets + Cost of adult's tickets = Total cost (5 * K) + (10 * A) = 50 We don't know the number of adults, but we can express the number of adults in terms of the number of kids using the total cost. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for A: 10 * A = 50 - (5 * K) A = (50 - 5K) / 10 A = 5 - (1/2)K Since we can't have a fraction of a person, A must be a whole number. This means that K must be an even number for (1/2)K to be a whole number. Now, let's find the number of kids by trying different even values for K and checking if A is a whole number: If K = 2 (which would mean 5 * 2 = 10 for kids' tickets), then: A = 5 - (1/2)*2 A = 5 - 1 A = 4 The total cost would be (2 * 5) + (4 * 10) = 10 + 40 = 50, which matches the total cost.

Rewriting: [ 4 pi v^2 = (pi r^2) left( S - pi r^2 right)^2 ] This identity follows from substituting expressions of surface area and volume (v). 5. Now observe: The sum of the two surface areas: [ pi r^2 + left( S - pi r^2 right) = S ] is constant. Hence the maximum volume ( v ) occurs when: [ frac{pi r^2}{1} = frac{S - pi r^2}{2} ] 6.

There is always a possibility of variation due to chance. - Therefore, saying the frequency will \\"definitely\\" be 0.6 after 10000 picks is incorrect.

This is a reasonable estimation of the probability, given the data. - In probability and statistics, when the observed frequency of an event stabilizes around a certain value with a large number of trials, it is a common practice to estimate the probability of that event as being approximately equal to that stable frequency. 4. **Conclusion:** - Judgment 1 is incorrect because it assumes certainty in the outcome of a probabilistic event. - Judgment 2 is correct because it makes a reasonable estimation of the probability based on the observed data.

The vector overrightarrow{OC} is simply the position vector of point C since O is the origin: overrightarrow{OC} = C - O = (cosalpha, sinalpha) = (cosalpha, sinalpha). As overrightarrow{OC} is parallel to overrightarrow{AB}, the corresponding components must be proportional. Thus, we have the following proportionality condition: frac{cosalpha}{-3} = frac{sinalpha}{3}. Cross-multiply to find the relationship between sinalpha and cosalpha: 3cosalpha = -3sinalpha. Simplify the equation: cosalpha = -sinalpha. Dividing both sides by cosalpha (since alpha is not an angle where cosalpha would be zero due to the domain restriction), we have: 1 = -tanalpha. This tells us that the tangent of alpha is -1: tanalpha = -1.

For any column a in A, let S(a) be the sum of the numbers in that column. We will use the following claims to analyze the problem. 3. **Claim 1:** There does not exist a step that can change S(a) for an arbitrary a in A. - **Proof:** Each step affects two squares in a column by adding 1 to each. Since we are working in mathbb{F}_2, adding 1 twice to any number results in no change (i.e., S(a) + 1 + 1 = S(a)). Therefore, S(a) remains unchanged under the given operation. square 4. **Claim 2:** In order for all squares to be labeled with the same number, S(a) = S(b) must be true for all choices of a, b in A. - **Proof:** If every square on the board is to be the same number, then every column must be identical. Consequently, their sums must also be identical. square 5. **Claim 3:** If n is even, in order for all of the unit squares to be labeled the same number, S(a) = 0 must be true for all a in A. - **Proof:** If n is even, each column contains an even number of squares.

By surjectivity, ( A_{a-1} ) is nonempty. Let ( x in A_{a-1} ). - Since ( f(x) = f(1) iff a-1 = a ) does not hold, we must have ( f(x+1) = min{ f(x), f(1) } = min{ a-1, a } = a-1 ). - Therefore, ( x in A_{a-1} implies x+1 in A_{a-1} ).

Since ( 1 ) occurs in ( A_1 ), all odd numbers are in ( A_1 ), and none of the even numbers are in ( A_1 ).

This is valid because ( 2^m n notin B_i ) for any ( 1 leq i leq m ), so ( f(2^m n) > m ). - ( g ) is surjective since ( f ) takes all integer values ( > m ) for arguments divisible by ( 2^m ). - For any ( (a, b) in mathbb{N}^2 ), exactly one of ( g(a) = g(b) ) or ( g(a+b) = min{ g(a), g(b) } ) holds. 7. **Induction Step:** - By the same analysis as the base case, ( g(n) = 1 iff n ) is odd, i.e., ( f(n) = m+1 iff nu_2(n) = m ).

(i) When a=0, h(x)=-x+1 (x > 0), for x in (0,1), h(x) > 0 and f'(x) < 0 so the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing; for x in (1,+infty), h(x) < 0 and f'(x) > 0 so the function f(x) is monotonically increasing. (ii) When aneq 0, by setting f'(x)=0 we get ax^2-x+1-a=0, with solutions x_1=1 and x_2=frac{1}{a}. (iii) If a=frac{1}{2}, x_1=x_2 and h(x)geq 0 always holds.

Therefore, statement A is correct. - **Statement B**: The greater the height h of the support, the shorter the time taken by the car to slide. - Observing the table, as the height h increases from 10 cm to 70 cm, the time t decreases from 4.23 s to 1.59 s. This shows that as h increases, t decreases, confirming that statement B is correct. - **Statement C**: If the height of the support increases by 10 cm each time, the corresponding changes in the time taken by the car to slide are the same. - To verify this, we look at the differences in time for each 10 cm increase in height: - From 10 cm to 20 cm, t decreases by 4.23 - 3.00 = 1.23 s. - From 20 cm to 30 cm, t decreases by 3.00 - 2.45 = 0.55 s. - The pattern of decrease in time t for each 10 cm increase in height varies, showing that the changes in time are not the same. Thus, statement C is incorrect. - **Statement D**: If the time taken by the car to slide is 2.5 s, then the height of the support is between 20 cm and 30 cm. - From the table, the time t is 3.00 s for h = 20 cm and 2.45 s for h = 30 cm. Since 2.5 s falls between these two times, it implies that the height of the support for a time of 2.5 s would indeed be between 20 cm and 30 cm. Therefore, statement D is correct.

[ P_{N2O5} = X_{N2O5} times P ] Where: - P = total pressure of the gas mixture - P_N2O5 = partial pressure of N2O5 So, if you know the total pressure (P) and the mole fraction of N2O5 (X_N2O5), you can calculate the partial pressure of N2O5.

In this case, we have a = 4 and b = 3, so [ c = sqrt{16 - 9} = sqrt{7}. ] For an ellipse, the shortest chord through a focus is perpendicular to the major axis. Here, the major axis is along the x-axis, so the shortest chord through focus F is vertical. Now, let's substitute x = sqrt{7} into the ellipse equation to find the corresponding y-values for the endpoints of this chord: [ frac{(sqrt{7})^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{9} = 1 implies frac{7}{16} + frac{y^2}{9} = 1. ] Subtracting frac{7}{16} from both sides, we get [ frac{y^2}{9} = 1 - frac{7}{16} = frac{9}{16}. ] Multiplying both sides by 9, we have [ y^2 = frac{9}{16} times 9 = frac{81}{16}. ] Taking the square root gives us [ y = pm frac{9}{4}. ] Since we are looking for the length of the chord, we take the positive difference between the two y-values (which are equal and opposite), so the shortest chord length is [ 2 times frac{9}{4} = frac{9}{2}. ] Thus, the length of the shortest chord passing through the focus F is boxed{frac{9}{2}}."},{"prompt":"Let A={x|x^2+4x=0}, and B={x|x^2+2(a1)x+a^21=0}.

However, since it's stated as a binomial, the coefficient of x must be simplified to zero due to the condition provided. This leads to a contradiction in terms, indicating that the term involving x must actually be present, and the initial interpretation was incorrect. The correct interpretation is that for A to be a quadratic binomial, the coefficient of x must not vanish, which was mistakenly considered. Therefore, the correct step is: Given A=-2x^{2}-(k-1)x+1 is a quadratic binomial, it means all terms are present, but for clarification, the term involving x is specifically focused on, which should not disappear. Thus, the condition for A to be a quadratic binomial doesn't directly imply k-1=0 based on the disappearance of the x term but rather ensures that the coefficient of x is defined and non-zero. The mistake was in the interpretation of the binomial condition. However, following the original solution's logic without introducing new ideas but clarifying: - The condition for A to be a quadratic binomial doesn't inherently require any term to vanish but to ensure clarity and correctness in the explanation, we proceed with the solution provided without the misinterpretation: Since A is given as a quadratic binomial, and no terms are meant to vanish for it to remain as such, the original statement aimed to find the value of k that satisfies a certain condition related to the polynomial's structure. The mistake in interpretation does not alter the mathematical steps but the explanation's clarity. Therefore, we correct the explanation as follows: Given A=-2x^{2}-(k-1)x+1, for A to be a quadratic binomial, we consider the condition that affects its structure. The original solution directly finds k without explaining the disappearance or presence of terms, which was the point of confusion. **For part (2):** Given k=-1, we have C+2A=B.

We need to find the measure of these remaining dihedral angles. 1. **Step 1: Label the vertices and the angles** Let the vertices of the tetrahedron be ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). Suppose the dihedral angles at edges ( AB, AC, ) and ( AD ) are equal to ( frac{pi}{2} ). These are the edges that form three right angles. 2. **Step 2: Understand the geometric constraints** Since ( angle (B-A-C) = frac{pi}{2} ), ( angle (B-A-D) = frac{pi}{2} ), and ( angle (C-A-D) = frac{pi}{2} ), this means in the coordinate system, ( B, C, ) and ( D ) lie along three mutually perpendicular axes with ( A ) as the origin. 3. **Step 3: Consider the properties of a right-angled tetrahedron** The key property here is to understand how it simplifies the structure of the tetrahedron.

Prove that among them, it is possible to choose several nonoverlapping segments whose total length is not less than 1/2.","completion":"To prove the given statement, we utilize the principle of mathematical induction on the number of line segments that cover the interval [0, 1]. 1. **Base Case**: - If the interval [0, 1] is covered by only one segment, the statement is trivially true because that single segment itself will cover [0, 1]. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: - Assume the statement is true for n segments, i.e., amongst n segments covering [0, 1], we can find a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) segments such that the sum of their lengths is at least frac{1}{2}. 3. **Induction Step**: - Consider that the interval [0, 1] is covered by (n+1) segments. - There are two possible cases: 1. One of the (n+1) segments, say (I_{k} = [a_{k}, b_{k}]), is covered by other segments. In this case, we can safely remove (I_k) and still cover the interval [0, 1] with the remaining n segments. 2. If no segment is completely covered by the other segments, we proceed as follows: - Sort the segments by their left endpoints, resulting in (I_{1}, I_{2}, ldots, I_{n+1}) such that (a_{1} < a_{2} < ldots < a_{n+1}). - Since no segment is fully covered by any other, it implies that the right endpoints (b_{i}) must also be sorted, i.e., (b_1 < b_2 < ldots < b_{n+1}). - For each (i), (b_{i}) is not just a tiny bit after (a_i); otherwise, the segments could be very small and not effectively cover the interval. Consequently, it must be that: [ b_i < a_{i+2} quad text{(otherwise (I_i) and (I_{i+2}) would cover (I_{i+1}))} ] 4. **Choosing Non-Overlapping Segments**: - Consider the set of segments with odd indices and set of segments with even indices: - Segments with odd indices (I_1, I_3, I_5, ldots) are mutually disjoint. - Similarly, segments with even indices (I_2, I_4, I_6, ldots) are mutually disjoint. - The sum of lengths of the segments covering [0, 1] is at least 1 because they cover this entire interval. - Therefore, either the sum of the lengths of the segments with odd indices or the sum of the lengths of the segments with even indices must be at least frac{1}{2}. Let us denote the lengths as (L_{odd}) and (L_{even}): [ L_{odd} + L_{even} geq 1 implies text{either } L_{odd} geq frac{1}{2} text{ or } L_{even} geq frac{1}{2} ] Hence, we can find a collection of non-overlapping segments such that their total length is at least frac{1}{2}.

Therefore, frac{XD}{XY} = frac{XA}{XE}, which implies XD cdot XE = XA cdot XY. 2. **Use Power of a Point Theorem**: - By the Power of a Point theorem at point X, we have XG cdot XC = XD cdot XB. 3. **Combine Equations**: - From the similarity and Power of a Point, we have: [ XF cdot XG = frac{XE}{XA} cdot XD cdot XB ] - Substituting XD = frac{XA cdot XY}{XE} from the similarity of triangles, we get: [ XF cdot XG = frac{XE}{XA} cdot frac{XA cdot XY}{XE} cdot XB = XY cdot XB ] 4. **Calculate XY and XB**: - Given frac{DX}{BD} = frac{1}{4}, so DX = frac{1}{4}BD and XB = frac{3}{4}BD. - Given frac{BY}{BD} = frac{11}{36}, so BY = frac{11}{36}BD and XY = BD - BY = frac{25}{36}BD. 5. **Calculate BD Using Ptolemy's Theorem**: - Ptolemy's theorem for cyclic quadrilateral ABCD gives: [ AC cdot BD = AB cdot CD + BC cdot DA ] - Substituting the given side lengths: [ AC cdot BD = 3 cdot 6 + 2 cdot 8 = 18 + 16 = 34 ] - Since AC and BD are diagonals, we need to find BD.

Let (r) be the radius of the large circle. 1. Considering the geometry, since circles A and B are internally tangent to the larger circle, the distances from their centers to the center (O) of the large circle are (r - 3) (for Circle A) and (r - 2) (for Circle B). 2. Since circles A and B are 6 units apart, a triangle can be formed by (O_A), (O_B), and (O).

The ratio of large, medium, and small stores is 1:5:9. This means for every 15 stores (1+5+9=15), there is 1 large store, 5 medium stores, and 9 small stores. Given there are a total of 1500 stores, we can calculate the number of medium stores as follows: The total parts of the ratio are 1+5+9=15. The proportion of medium stores is frac{5}{15} = frac{1}{3}. Therefore, the number of medium stores in the city is frac{1}{3} times 1500 = 500. When we are sampling 30 stores out of the total 1500, the proportion should remain the same. Therefore, the number of medium stores to be sampled is frac{1}{3} times 30 = 10.

This alternation ensures that the faces switch color attributes synchronously with the moves. 4. **Returning to the Starting Position:** When the cube returns to its original position, the square it rests on (the black cell of the imaginary chessboard) and the orientation of the faces (which alternates geometrically) should both return to their initial states. 5. **The Invariance of Orientation:** Since the vertex coloring resets and the cube is on its original spot on the chessboard, the top face must look exactly the same as it did at the beginning.

This implies that the function f(x) exhibits symmetry about the point (1,0). Therefore, we can rewrite this as f(x) = -f(2-x).

Therefore, f(3) = 0. 4. **Relationship between f(0) and f(4)**: From equation (2), substituting x=0 gives us f(0) = f(4).

In other words, ( |a - b| leq 1 ) is a losing position; the player who receives it has no winning strategy.

The number of cookies becomes ( a' = frac{t + 2 - 2n}{2} ) and ( b' = frac{t + 2n}{2} ). - Ivica takes ( 2n ) cookies from the ( b )-cookie pile. The number of cookies becomes ( a' = frac{t + 2 + 2n}{2} ) and ( b' = frac{t - 2n}{2} ). - In both sub-cases, ( |a' - b'| > 1 ) and ( a' + b' leq t ). By the induction hypothesis, this is a winning position for Marica. 4. **When ( |a - b| > 1 ) and ( a + b = t + 1 ):** - Without loss of generality, let ( a > b ). Let ( a = b + k ), where ( k > 1 ). - Ivica can take ( 2m = 2 leftlfloor frac{k + 1}{3} rightrfloor ) cookies from the ( a )-cookie pile. - This yields ( |a' - b'| = |(b + k - 2m) - (b + m)| = |k - 3m| in { -1, 0, 1 } ) and ( a' + b' = t + 1 - m leq t ). - By the induction hypothesis, this is a losing position for the player to move, so Ivica has the winning strategy.

To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Relative speed in m/s = 66 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr Relative speed in m/s = 66 * 5/18 Relative speed in m/s = 330/18 Relative speed in m/s = 18.33 m/s (approximately) Now that we have the relative speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance to be covered is the length of the train, which is 110 m. Time = Distance / Relative speed Time = 110 m / 18.33 m/s Time ≈ 6 seconds So, it will take approximately boxed{6} seconds for the train to pass the man."},{"prompt":"Given that tan alpha = 2, find the value of sin^{2} alpha + 2 sin alpha cos alpha + 3 cos^{2} alpha = ______.","completion":"First, we simplify the expression using trigonometric identities: begin{aligned} sin^{2} alpha + 2 sin alpha cos alpha + 3 cos^{2} alpha &= frac{sin^{2} alpha + 2 sin alpha cos alpha + 3 cos^{2} alpha}{sin^{2} alpha + cos^{2} alpha} &= frac{tan^{2} alpha + 2tan alpha + 3}{tan^{2} alpha + 1} end{aligned} Then, we substitute the given value tan alpha = 2: frac{(2)^{2} + 2(2) + 3}{(2)^{2} + 1} = frac{4 + 4 + 3}{4 + 1} = boxed{frac{11}{5}} So, the answer is frac{11}{5}.

Therefore, C_{1} F parallel A G. 4. Also, since F is the midpoint of A A_{1} and the face A C C_{1} A_{1} is a parallelogram, G is the midpoint of C C_{1}.

For plane A_{1} A G, the normal vector boldsymbol{m}=(0,1,0) (since it is parallel to AB). 4.

Each face is a square bordered by 4 edges. 2. **New Black Edge Requirement**: Each face must have at least two black edges.

This arrangement covers the bottom face fully. - For the side faces sharing these edges, place additional black edges on their other two sides to meet the requirement (e.g., for the face sharing the edge (0,0,0)-(1,0,0), place a black edge on two edges not sharing with the bottom). - Similarly, place black edges on the top face and ensure the side faces have their two edges in black without overlapping. 4. **Minimum Black Edges Calculation**: - Each face needs an independent set of at least two black edges, accounting for shared edges. Use a configuration that minimizes overlap while satisfying the two-edge condition. - Upon examination, a configuration where each of the 12 edges is used efficiently is challenging without exceeding the original problem's solution, hence the minimum number of black edges increases. 5. **Verification**: - Check all faces to confirm each has two black edges. Since each edge contributes to two faces and each face must have independent dual coverage, the minimum possible configuration results in more black edges. 6. **Conclusion with boxed answer**: Upon trial and error configuration, and efficient placement strategy, the least number of black edges required turns out to be 8. 8 The final answer is boxed{C}"},{"prompt":"Susie and Britney each keep chickens, of two different breeds.

To find out how many 2/5 mile increments are in 3.6 miles, we divide 3.6 by 2/5 (or 0.4): 3.6 miles / (2/5 miles) = 3.6 / 0.4 = 9 increments of 2/5 mile The rate per 2/5 mile during nighttime hours on weekends is 0.55.

Since the polygon in question is regular, all of its exterior angles are equal.

After pulling out 65 balls at random, Calvin has pulled out 5 more red balls than blue balls. We want to find the probability that the next ball he pulls out is red. Step-by-step Solution 1. **Determine the Expected Number of Yellow Balls Left:** We start by noting that there are initially 30 yellow balls. After pulling out 65 balls, there are 15 balls left in the bag. The exact distribution of these balls matters but we'll begin by considering the symmetry between the number of yellow balls left. Given that the total colors involved have a bijection which balances between the change in counts of red and blue balls, we analyze that the expected number of yellow balls left must be evenly distributed. Hence, the expected number of yellow balls left can be calculated using the expected value considerations. Given 30 yellow balls, the expected number of yellow balls left would be: [ frac{30}{2} = 15 ] 2. **Calculate the Expected Number of Red Balls Left:** Calculating the number of red and blue balls involves the condition that the pulled out balls consist of five more red balls than blue balls. Suppose ( r ) is the number of red balls pulled and ( b ) is the number of blue balls pulled. Hence: [ r = b + 5 ] To maintain this condition while factoring in the total pulled balls, the equation is: [ r + b + text{yellow balls} = 65 ] Let ( y ) denote the yellow balls pulled. To find the yellow balls, note: [ y = 65 - (b + b + 5) = 65 - 2b - 5 = 60 - 2b ] Also notice: [ text{Remaining blue balls} = 50 - b ] [ text{Remaining red balls} = 50 - (b + 5) ] 3. **Formulate the Overall Expected Numbers:** Taking into account the expected remaining total balls = 15 (total balls left): [ text{Remaining Red balls} = 50 - (b + 5) = 45 - b ] [ text{Remaining Blue balls} = 50 - b ] Thus, we need to effectively calculate: [ left[text{Remaining Red balls}right] + left[text{Remaining Blue balls}right] + left[text{Remaining Yellow balls}right] = 15 ] On calculating: [ left[22.5right] = left[ frac{45}{2}right] text{(Expected remaining per symmetry of distribution)} ] 4. **Compute the Probability:** Next, the probability of drawing a red ball: [ P(text{Red}) = frac{text{Expected Red Balls Remaining}}{text{Total Remaining Balls}} text{ given 15 total} ] Substituting the number: [ = frac{22.5}{65} ] 5. **Simplify the Fraction:** Further fraction combination from symmetry leads to refining, [ frac{45}{2} cdot frac{1}{65} = frac{45}{130} = frac{9}{26} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{9}{26}} ]"},{"prompt":"Triangles triangle PQR and triangle SQR share side QR.

The dealer offers a cash discount of 20%, so the selling price after the discount is 80% of the original selling price. Let's assume the original selling price is x. After the discount, the selling price becomes 0.8x. Since the dealer still makes a profit of 20% on the cost price, the selling price after the discount (0.8x) must be 120% of the cost price (100). So, we have: 0.8x = 120% of 100 0.8x = 1.2 * 100 0.8x = 120 Now, to solve for x (the original selling price before the discount), we divide both sides by 0.8: x = 120 / 0.8 x = 150 This means the original selling price was 150, which is 50% above the cost price (100).

In each turn, it is possible to choose integers ( c_1, ldots, c_n ), and rotate each dial by its corresponding ( c_i ). That means ( d_i ) is replaced by ( d_i' ) such that ( d_i' equiv d_i + c_i mod c ). After each turn, a button is pressed. If all the dials are in the zero state, the safe opens. Otherwise, the diabolical safe decides on an integer ( k ) and cyclically shifts the values of the dials by ( k ). Specifically, the dial ( i ) then takes the value that was taken by dial ( ik ), with the indices taken modulo ( n ). Show that it is possible to open the safe regardless of the initial state of the dials and the integers ( k ) chosen by the safe if and only if ( n ) and ( c ) are both powers of the same prime number.

For clarity, we start with the \\"only if\\" direction: 1. **Only If:** Suppose n and c are not both powers of the same prime. Then, there exist two distinct primes p and q such that p divides n and q divides c. - Consider the states of the dials modulo p. This reduces the problem to when ( n = p ). Hence, without loss of generality assume ( n = p ). - For the strategy to work, the diabolic safe can choose k multiple of frac{c}{q}. This allows us to consider only those dials whose positions are multiples of frac{c}{q}, reducing the number of dials to q. Hence, we assume c = q. - The safe's initial configuration is where all dials are 0 except one which is 1. Let dials be ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_n ). We will argue by contradiction that no strategy can guarantee opening the safe. - Suppose there is a successful strategy that reaches a stage where all dials show the same value. We focus on the first such step, step ( t ). - Before step t, dials are at positions ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_n ). After a k-shift, the dials are still non-equal. The strategy ensures if all d_i+c_i equiv d_{i+1}+c_{i+1} equiv ldots equiv d_{i-k}+c_{i-k} mod{c} for each k chosen by the safe: [ d_1 + c_1 equiv d_2 + c_2 equiv ldots equiv d_n + c_n pmod{c} ] [ d_2 + c_1 equiv d_3 + c_2 equiv ldots equiv d_1 + c_n pmod{c} ] - Subtract from the first set: [ c_2 - c_1 equiv c_3 - c_2 equiv ldots equiv c_1 - c_n pmod{c} ] - Thus, differences ( d_{i+1} - d_i ) mod ( c ) become equal. Sum these: [ n(d_{i+1} - d_i) equiv left(d_2 - d_1 right) + left(d_3 - d_2 right) + ldots + left(d_1 - d_n right) equiv 0 pmod{c} ] - Since ( n ) and ( c ) are co-prime, differences become zero modulo ( c ), implying all ( d_i equiv 0 pmod{c} ), contradicting non-equality. 2. **If:** Suppose n and c are both powers of the same prime p. That is, ( n = p^a ) and ( c = p^b ). - We first consider the base case ( b = 1 ) where ( c ) is a prime. Then, by iterating choices that simulate modulo ( p ) strategies ( S ), we combine polynomials to show results reproducible even after cyclic shifts manipulate dials. - Using recursive techniques, assume strategy ( S_b ) works for ( c = p^b ). Define pS_b and S_b to develop a strategy for c = p^{b+1}. - Apply p S_b , followed by s_i', then again p S_b sequentially constructing solutions incrementally. Establish that S_{b+1} is effective up to higher powers. 3. **Base Case (c = p)** - Encode dials polynomially. Let P represent dials d_1, d_2, ldots, d_n . Then manipulation of dials represents polynomial additions and multiplications modulo p . - Shifts of k correspond to multiplying P by X^k , noting polynomial P mod X^n-1 simplifies as X^n equiv (X-1)^n pmod{p}. - Maintain invariants: (operatorname{val}(P)), the division by (X-1)^n, results to achieve remainder zero thus making P null. - Typical step s_i = (X-1)^{n-1-v_p(i)}, fine tunes shifts handling operatorname{val}(P) and ensuring zero polynomial endpoint ensuring safe opens. **Conclusion:** After dealing with steps and polynomial invariants, the strategies give the coffin's opening condition.

This can be represented by the equation: 3V + D + PL = 14 We also know that the team needs to win at least 6 of the remaining 15 matches to reach the 40-point mark. This means that the team needs to score at least 40 - 14 = 26 more points in the remaining 15 matches. If the team wins exactly 6 of the remaining matches, they will earn 6 * 3 = 18 points from those victories. This means they need to earn 26 - 18 = 8 more points from the remaining 9 matches. Since the team can only earn points from draws or defeats in the remaining matches (assuming they win exactly 6), and since a draw is worth 1 point, the maximum number of points they can earn from draws in the remaining 9 matches is 9 points (if all 9 are draws). However, they only need 8 more points, which means they could afford to lose one of those matches and still reach the 40-point mark.

In 3 minutes, it would walk: (200 meters / 4 minutes) * 90% * 3 minutes = 150 meters * 90% = 135 meters On gravel terrain (20% slower): The ant's speed decreases by 20%, so it walks at 80% of its flat terrain speed. In 5 minutes, it would walk: (200 meters / 4 minutes) * 80% * 5 minutes = 250 meters * 80% = 200 meters Now, let's calculate the total distance the ant walks: 200 meters (flat) + 135 meters (sandy) + 200 meters (gravel) = 535 meters The beetle walks 15% less distance than the ant on flat terrain, so on flat terrain, the beetle walks: 200 meters * 85% = 170 meters On sandy terrain (5% slower): The beetle's speed decreases by 5%, so it walks at 95% of its flat terrain speed.

We can split one ( 10 ) ruble coin into two ( 5 ) ruble coins: [ 10 = 5 + 5 ] - By doing this, we effectively add one coin to the total count, thus changing the parity (e.g., from even to odd or vice versa). 3. **Sums less than 11 rubles**: - For sums less than 11 rubles: - We can use coins of 1 ruble to construct any sum ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, 10). - If the number of ( 1) ruble coins used results in an undesirable parity: - We can adjust by replacing two ( 1 ) ruble coins with one ( 2 ) ruble coin to swap the parity. 4. **Examples for clarity**: - **Sum of 1 ruble**: [ text{Odd number of coins: } 1 times 1 = 1 text{ coin} ] - **Sum of 2 rubles**: [ text{Odd number of coins: } 1 + 1 = 2 text{ coins} ] [ text{Even number of coins: } 1 times 2 = 1 text{ coin} ] - **Sum of 3 rubles**: [ text{Odd number of coins: } 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 text{ coins} ] - **Sum of 11 rubles (an extended example)**: [ text{Using all 1 ruble coins: } 11 text{ coins} quad (text{Odd}) ] [ text{Using } 10 + 1 = 10 + 1 = text{ 2 coins} quad (text{Even by breaking 10 into } 5 + 5) ] In conclusion, any sum of money greater than 1 ruble can be paid using either an even number of coins or an odd number of coins, regardless of the instruments available.

Secondly, the points ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ) are defined as the midpoints of the segments ( AD ), ( BE ), and ( CF ) respectively. We need to prove that the triangles ( PQR ) and ( DEF ) are similar. 2. **Key observations**: Since ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ) are the midpoints of the segments ( AD ), ( BE ), and ( CF ) respectively, ( AP = PD ), ( BQ = QE ), and ( CR = RF ). This implies that ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ) divide ( AD ), ( BE ), and ( CF ) into equal segments. 3. **Inscribed angles and semicircle property**: Because ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ) are points where the angle bisectors of ( angle BAC ), ( angle ABC ), and ( angle ACB ) meet the circumcircle, they are precisely those points such that each arc between two of these points on the circumcircle represents half of the major arc. 4. **Properties of perpendicular angles**: When angle bisectors meet the circle, the arcs are divided equally into two parts, where the resulting arc sums form a semicircle (half of the total circumference of the circle). This implies that the direct lines (the bisectors, in this case) are perpendicular to any tangent at the points on the circle where they intersect. 5. **Height and orthocenter properties**: Hence, the perpendicularity property means that lines ( AP ), ( BQ ), and ( CR ) act as heights (altitudes) of the formed triangle. The intersection point of these perpendiculars corresponds to the orthocenter of triangle ( DEF ). 6. **Projection of the center**: Using properties of the circumcircle and the orthic triangle (formed by the feet of the altitudes), we infer that the points ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ) are the projections of the center of the circumcircle to the respective altitudes of triangle ( DEF ). # Conclusion: Since the projections and properties of the orthocenter and circumcircle hold, along with symmetry in the construction of midpoints and altitudes, the triangles ( PQR ) and ( DEF ) must satisfy standard properties of similarity by angle-angle (AA) similarity criterion, because each corresponding pair of angles between the triangles must be equal.

If the candies were to be equally distributed among 300 children, each child would have received C/300 candies. However, since 150 children were absent, the candies were distributed among 300 - 150 = 150 children. Because of the reduced number of children, each child got 24 extra candies than they would have if all 300 children were present. So, each child now received (C/300) + 24 candies. We also know that the total number of candies didn't change, so the amount of candies that would have been given to 300 children is now being given to 150 children. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: C/150 = (C/300) + 24 To solve for C, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 300 to get rid of the denominators: 2C = C + 7200 Now, we subtract C from both sides to solve for C: C = 7200 Now that we have the total number of candies, we can find out how many candies each child received on that day by dividing the total number of candies by the number of children present (150): Candies per child = C / 150 Candies per child = 7200 / 150 Candies per child = 48 So, each child received boxed{48} candies on that day."},{"prompt":"Rewrite the equation 2x+y=3 in terms of x to express y as ( ).

Assume the intersection of this line and the circle is at ( O ). - Construct a perpendicular line through ( O ), designating it as the ( x )-axis. - This gives us a coordinate system where each vertex of the polygon has coordinates ( (x_i, y_i) ) for ( i=1, 2, ldots, n ). 2. **Placing Non-Zero Real Numbers ( x_i )**: - At each vertex of the ( n )-gon, we place a non-zero real number ( x_i ). - We specifically use the x-coordinates of the vertices of the regular ( n )-gon in the constructed coordinate system. 3. **Properties of the Regular ( n )-gon**: - In a regular ( n )-gon, each vertex is uniformly distributed around the origin in the coordinate system. - This symmetry implies that the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices is zero. 4. **Consideration of ( k )-gon Subsets**: - Consider any subset of ( k ) vertices forming a smaller regular ( k )-gon within the original ( n )-gon. - Since ( k ) vertices of a regular ( k )-gon maintain similar uniform distribution with respect to their centroid as the original ( n )-gon does to its center. - Therefore, the sum of the x-coordinates of these ( k ) vertices must also be zero, respecting the inherent symmetrical property of regular polygons. 5. **Summing Over Non-Zero Coordinates**: - Because the sum of the x-coordinates for the whole n-gon vertices is zero, i.e., [ sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 0, ] and this holds for any symmetric subsection (like our ( k )-sized subsets), we conclude that for any ( k )-vertex subset, [ sum_{i in I(k)} x_i = 0, ] where ( I(k) ) is any subset of indices of size ( k ) corresponding to the vertices of a regular ( k )-gon.

Therefore, we also have a_{n+1}a_{n+2}+1 = tS_{n+1}. Subtracting these two equations, we obtain: [ a_{n+1}(a_{n+2} - a_n) = t(a_{n+1}) ] Since a_n is an arithmetic sequence, a_{n+2} - a_n = 2d, giving us the relationship: [ a_{n+1}(2d) = t(a_{n+1}) ] Setting n=1, we have: [ 2(a_1a_2+1) = t(1+a_1) ] Given that a_1 = 1, we can find a_2: [ 2(a_2+1) = t(2) Rightarrow a_2 = t-1 ] Again, since it's an arithmetic sequence with the common difference d, we get a_3 = a_2 + d = t + 1 - d. However, we also have a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 1 + 2d, equating the two expressions for a_3, we have: [ t + 1 - d = 1 + 2d Rightarrow t = 3d + 1 ] From our previous deduction with n=1, and knowing that a_2 = t - 1, we substitute a_2 = d and get: [ 2(d + 1) = (3d+1)(2) ] Solving the equation yields: [ 2d + 2 = 6d + 2 Rightarrow 4d = 0 ] This implies that d = 0, but given that the common difference d must be a positive number, we must have made an error. Let's correct our approach. Using a_1 = 1, we have: [ 2(a_1a_2+1) = t(1+a_1) Rightarrow 2(1cdot a_2+1) = t(1+1) Rightarrow 2a_2 + 2 = 2t Rightarrow a_2 = t - 1 ] Since a_{n+2} - a_n=2d, and we have a_2 as t-1, it means that 2d = d, as this is true for all terms in the arithmetic sequence. This means d must equal to t due to the structure of the sequence that involves all terms a_n, a_{n+1}, a_{n+2} continuously. Now evaluating the sum to the first term: [ begin{align*} 2(a_1 cdot a_2 + 1) & = t(1 + a_1), 2(1 cdot (t - 1) + 1) & = t(1 + 1), 2t & = 2t, end{align*} ] This is an identity, given that for any t the equation holds true. From this we can see that we actually don't need the identity t = 3d + 1. We already have enough information to find all terms. If we rethink the logic, considering a_3 = a_2 + d = (t-1) + d and a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 1 + 2d, we equate these: [ t - 1 + d = 1 + 2d Rightarrow t = 2d + 2. ] Since we have an arithmetic sequence, by setting n = 1 in the original equation, we get a_2 = t - 1.

The horizontal axis and all markers on this axis were erased, leaving only the graph of the function and the axis, without scale or origin marker. Explain how to retrieve the original horizontal axis using only a compass and a straightedge. 1. **Identify an Arbitrary Point:** - Select an arbitrary point ( A ) on the graph ( y = e^x ). - Let's denote the coordinates of ( A ) by ( (b, e^b) ), where ( b ) is some real number. 2. **Constructing a Perpendicular:** - Draw a perpendicular line from point ( A ) down to the horizontal axis. Let the intersection point of this perpendicular with the horizontal axis be ( B ).

If each person's age increases by 5 years, the total sum of ages increases by 5 times 3 = 15 years. Since the number of individuals remains the same, the mean age also increases by 5 years. 2. **Median**: The median is the middle value when the ages are arranged in order. Adding 5 years to each age does not change the order of the ages, but it does increase the median age by 5 years. 3. **Mode**: The mode is the most frequently occurring age. If all ages are distinct initially, adding 5 years to each age will not change the mode. However, if there is a mode, it will also increase by 5 years since all ages are increased uniformly. 4. **Variance**: Variance measures the spread of the ages around the mean. When each age is increased by 5 years, the distances between the ages remain the same. Therefore, the variance does not change. From the analysis above, we see that the mean, median, and mode all increase by 5 years, indicating a change in their values.

For a number ( n ), when divided by 9, the remainder ( r ) gives the digital root, where ( r ) can be any of 1, 2, 3, ..., 9. - Specifically, numbers ( 9k + 1, 9k + 2, ..., 9k + 9 ) for ( k ) in {0, 1, 2, ..., (frac{10^9}{9} - 1)} give remainders 1, 2, 3, ..., 9 respectively. - For every nine consecutive numbers, there is exactly one number that gives each possible remainder from 1 to 9. 4. **Counting Frequencies:** - There are: [ leftlfloor frac{10^9 - 1}{9} rightrfloor + 1 = leftlfloor frac{999,999,999}{9} rightrfloor + 1 = 111,111,111 + 1 = 111,111,112 ] sets of nine numbers within (10^9) numbers. - Each set of nine numbers contains exactly one number whose digital root is 1 and one whose digital root is 2. 5. **Including the Last Number:** - The number (10^9) itself (which is 1,000,000,000) must be considered specifically: [ text{Sum of digits of } 10^9 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 ] Thus, 10^9 has a digital root of 1. 6. **Final Comparison:** - So in the first (10^9 - 1) numbers, the count of numbers with digital root 1 equals the count of numbers with digital root 2. - Including (10^9) itself, the count of numbers with digital root 1 exceeds those with digital root 2 by exactly one. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{Yes}} ]"},{"prompt":"A train that is 560 meters long is running at a speed of 45 km/hour.

For the first equation, a^2 - 3a + 2 = a - 1, we simplify and solve for a: a^2 - 4a + 3 = 0, which factors into: (a - 1)(a - 3) = 0. The solutions to this equation are a = 1 and a = 3. For the second equation, a^2 - 3a + 2 = -(a - 1), we simplify and solve for a: a^2 - 2a + 1 = 0, which factors into: (a - 1)^2 = 0. The solution to this equation is a = 1. However, since f(x) is even, we also know that f(0) = f(1) = f(-1). Thus, when a = 2, the condition f(a^2 - 3a + 2) = f(a - 1) is also satisfied.

Let m'(x)=0, we have x=frac{a+1}{2a}. When 0 < x < frac{a+1}{2a}, m'(x) < 0; when x > frac{a+1}{2a}, m'(x) > 0.

The largest integer k less than sqrt{5000} is approximately 70. Therefore, k ranges from 1 to 70, giving us 70 possible values of k. Each k corresponds to a unique a, and hence a unique perfect square a^2. Thus, there are boxed{70} perfect squares less than 20,000 that can be represented as the difference of squares of two integers differing by 2."},{"prompt":"A thin rope with a length of 18 cm is used to form an isosceles triangle.

Since the rope forms an isosceles triangle and one of its sides is 5 cm, we can express the total length of the rope as the sum of the lengths of all three sides. This gives us the equation: [x + x + 5 = 18] Simplifying this equation, we combine like terms: [2x + 5 = 18] Subtracting 5 from both sides to isolate the terms with x: [2x = 13] Dividing both sides by 2 to solve for x: [x = frac{13}{2}] [x = 6.5] Therefore, the length of the other two sides of the isosceles triangle is 6.5 cm. However, it's important to note that the problem allows for the possibility that the given 5 cm side could also be one of the equal sides in another scenario. In that case, the other two sides (one being 5 cm and the other being the remaining length) would also form an isosceles triangle.

The certain number is 169.","completion":"To find the value of n when the sum of consecutive odd integers from 1 to n equals 169, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Since we are dealing with odd integers, the common difference (d) is 2. The sum of the first k terms of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula: Sum = (k/2) * (first term + last term) In this case, the first term (a1) is 1, and the sum is 169. We are looking for the last term, which is the value of n, and the number of terms, which is k. Let's denote the last term as n and the number of terms as k. Since the terms are consecutive odd integers, the k-th term (n) can be expressed as: n = 1 + (k - 1) * 2 Now, let's use the sum formula: 169 = (k/2) * (1 + n) We can substitute n from the second equation into the first equation: 169 = (k/2) * (1 + (1 + (k - 1) * 2)) Simplify the equation: 169 = (k/2) * (1 + 1 + 2k - 2) 169 = (k/2) * (2k) 169 = k^2 Now, we need to find the value of k that satisfies this equation. Since 169 is a perfect square, we can take the square root of both sides: √169 = √(k^2) 13 = k So, there are 13 terms in the series. Now we can find the value of n (the last term) using the equation for the k-th term: n = 1 + (k - 1) * 2 n = 1 + (13 - 1) * 2 n = 1 + 12 * 2 n = 1 + 24 n = 25 Therefore, the value of n is boxed{25} when the sum of consecutive odd integers from 1 to n equals 169."},{"prompt":"The negation of the proposition exists x gt 1, x^{2}x gt 0 is ( ).

The circumscribed sphere (S) passes through all four vertices (A, B, C, D). 3. **Midpoints of edges:** Let (B_1, C_1, D_1) be the midpoints of the edges (AB, AC, AD) respectively. These points are the midpoints of the edges outgoing from vertex (A). 4. **Contraction transformation:** Consider a contraction (homothety) with center at (A) and ratio (frac{1}{2}).

Since b can complete the work in 60 days, we can say that ( b = frac{1}{60} ) (work per day). When a and b work together, they can complete the work in 12 days. Therefore, the combined speed of a and b is ( a + b = frac{1}{12} ) (work per day). We want to find the ratio of a's speed to b's speed, which is ( frac{a}{b} ). First, we need to find the speed of a. We can do this by subtracting b's speed from the combined speed: ( a = frac{1}{12} - frac{1}{60} ) To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60: ( a = frac{5}{60} - frac{1}{60} ) ( a = frac{4}{60} ) Now we simplify the fraction: ( a = frac{1}{15} ) (work per day) Now we have both speeds: ( a = frac{1}{15} ) ( b = frac{1}{60} ) The ratio of a's speed to b's speed is: ( frac{a}{b} = frac{frac{1}{15}}{frac{1}{60}} ) To find this ratio, we divide the numerators and multiply the denominators: ( frac{a}{b} = frac{1}{15} times frac{60}{1} ) ( frac{a}{b} = frac{60}{15} ) Now we simplify the fraction: ( frac{a}{b} = 4 ) So the ratio of a's speed to b's speed is boxed{4:1} ."},{"prompt":"the quadrilateral pyramid PABCD, the base ABCD is a rectangle, PD perp the base, and PD = AD = a.

Consider the directional vector ( overrightarrow{D P} + lambda overrightarrow{D A} + mu overrightarrow{D C} ) as the normal vector boldsymbol{n}_1 for the plane ( PBA ). 3. **Orthogonality with overrightarrow{A B} :** We must have: [ boldsymbol{n}_1 cdot overrightarrow{A B} = 0 ] Since ( overrightarrow{A B} ) lies in the base, ( overrightarrow{A B} = overrightarrow{D C} ), therefore: [ (overrightarrow{D P} + lambda overrightarrow{D A} + mu overrightarrow{D C}) cdot overrightarrow{A B} = 0 ] This reduces to: [ mu overrightarrow{D C} cdot overrightarrow{A B} = 0 ] Given ( overrightarrow{D C} cdot overrightarrow{A B} neq 0 ), it must be ( mu = 0 ). 4. **Orthogonality to ( overrightarrow{A P} ):** Next, consider: [ boldsymbol{n}_1 cdot overrightarrow{A P} = 0 ] Expand and substitute mu = 0: [ (overrightarrow{D P} + lambda overrightarrow{D A}) cdot overrightarrow{A P} = 0 ] This implies: [ (overrightarrow{D P} + lambda overrightarrow{D A}) cdot (overrightarrow{D P} - overrightarrow{D A}) = 0 ] Simplifying, we get: [ (overrightarrow{D P})^2 - lambda (overrightarrow{D A})^2 = 0 ] Therefore: [ lambda = frac{a^2}{a^2} = 1 ] Hence, the normal vector boldsymbol{n}_1 is: [ boldsymbol{n}_1 = overrightarrow{D P} + overrightarrow{D A} ] 5. **Normal vector to plane ( boldsymbol{PBC} ):** Consider the directional vector ( overrightarrow{D P} + m overrightarrow{D A} + n overrightarrow{D C} ) as the normal vector boldsymbol{n}_2 for the plane ( PBC ). We must satisfy: [ boldsymbol{n}_2 cdot overrightarrow{B C} = 0 ] And: [ boldsymbol{n}_2 cdot overrightarrow{P C} = 0 ] Solving similar steps, we find: [ boldsymbol{n}_2 = overrightarrow{D P} + frac{a^2}{b^2} overrightarrow{D C} ] 6. **Dot product of the two normals:** Finally, compute: [ boldsymbol{n}_1 cdot boldsymbol{n}_2 = (overrightarrow{D P} + overrightarrow{D A}) cdot left( overrightarrow{D P} + frac{a^2}{b^2} overrightarrow{D C} right) ] Expanding this product: [ = overrightarrow{D P} cdot overrightarrow{D P} + frac{a^2}{b^2} overrightarrow{D P} cdot overrightarrow{D C} + overrightarrow{D A} cdot overrightarrow{D P} + frac{a^2}{b^2} overrightarrow{D A} cdot overrightarrow{D C} ] Since ( overrightarrow{D P} cdot overrightarrow{D A} = 0 ), and ( overrightarrow{D P} cdot overrightarrow{D C} = 0 ), [ = a^2 ] Thus: [ boldsymbol{n}_1 cdot boldsymbol{n}_2 = a^2 neq 0 ] This indicates that the dot product is not zero, and hence the planes are not orthogonal.
