Then, for each subsequent disc D_i, choose the largest disc from mathcal{F} that is disjoint from all previously selected discs D_1, ldots, D_{i-1}.

White pieces aim to reach two adjacent (by side) cells. Can the black pieces prevent them from doing so?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: We are given a 23 times 23 grid. The white pieces start at the bottom-left and top-right corners, and the black pieces start at the top-left and bottom-right corners. White starts first and the pieces move alternately, one step at a time, to adjacent cells. 2. **Rectangular Formation Strategy**: The idea is for black pieces to continually maintain a rectangular formation such that their position, after every move, is like the vertices of a rectangle where sides are parallel to the grid. Consider the positions of black and white pieces forming opposite corners of such a rectangle. 3. **Preservation of Rectangular Positions**: - The initial positions of black and white pieces can be described as corners of a rectangle. - Whenever white pieces move, black pieces will move in such a way that black pieces continue to occupy opposite corners of a \\"rectangular\\" formation relative to their counterparts. - This formation will prevent white pieces from moving into adjacent cells in one move. Specifically, the distribution ensures that white pieces cannot form an adjacent pair by one step due to the rectangular constraint. 4. **Continuous Rectangular Positioning**: - The nature of moves along a rectangular path ensures spaces within and around the rectangle. This adds constraints for white pieces since maintaining a rectangle means the greatest axis distance for black pieces (opposite corners) is maintained. - The white pieces, being constrained to move one square along this configuration, cannot achieve adjacency in one move. If one white piece moves closer to its target, a black piece moves to maintain the rectangle condition. 5. **Final Argument**: - Maintaining this rectangular strategy ensures that white pieces can never be adjacent after one move, as their paths are intercepted or corrected by black pieces' continuous reconforming to the rectangular shape. - The constraining rectangle shifts as needed by the black pieces’ moves while ensuring they always uphold the non-adjacency logic for white pieces attempting to meet adjacent. **Conclusion**: By maintaining this rectangular defensive strategy continuously, black pieces can prevent white pieces from ever becoming adjacent. boxed{{text{Yes, the black pieces can always prevent the white pieces from meeting adjacently.}}}"},{"prompt":"f 7^{2n} = left(frac{1}{49}right)^{n12}, find n.","completion":"First, convert left(frac{1}{49}right)^{n-12} using the property frac{1}{a} = a^{-1}.

For the jersey: Original price = 115 Discount = 10% of 115 = 0.10 * 115 = 11.50 Discounted price = 115 - 11.50 = 103.50 For the t-shirt: Original price = 25 Discount = 15% of 25 = 0.15 * 25 = 3.75 Discounted price = 25 - 3.75 = 21.25 Now, let's add the sales tax to the discounted prices. Sales tax for the jersey: Sales tax = 8% of 103.50 = 0.08 * 103.50 = 8.28 Price with tax = 103.50 + 8.28 = 111.78 Sales tax for the t-shirt: Sales tax = 8% of 21.25 = 0.08 * 21.25 = 1.70 Price with tax = 21.25 + 1.70 = 22.95 Next, we add the shipping fees to the price with tax.

Since each roll of the cube has 6 possible outcomes, there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations when rolling the cube twice.

There's no increase this year since it's the base year. So, the production volume is 200 units. 2. **Second Year Production**: For the second year, the production volume increases by a percentage x. The increase is calculated on the first year's production, so the production volume for the second year is 200(1+x). 3. **Third Year Production**: In the third year, the production volume increases again by the same percentage x, but this time the increase is calculated on the second year's production volume, which was 200(1+x). Therefore, the production volume for the third year is 200(1+x)^2. 4. **Total Production Over Three Years**: The total production volume over the three years is the sum of the production volumes of each year.

This is due to the Midsegment Theorem. Given this, when we join the midpoints of the sides of our original triangle to form a new triangle, each side of this new, smaller triangle is frac{1}{2} the length of the corresponding side in the original triangle. Now, to find the area of the smaller triangle in relation to the original triangle, we need to consider how the area of a triangle scales with its side lengths. The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its side lengths. Therefore, if each side length of the smaller triangle is frac{1}{2} that of the original triangle, the area of the smaller triangle is left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 times the area of the original triangle. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: [ M = left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 times T ] Simplifying the expression: [ M = frac{1}{4} times T ] Therefore, the ratio of M to T is: [ frac{M}{T} = frac{1}{4} ] Encapsulating the final answer: [ boxed{frac{1}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that function f(x) is an odd function defined on the interval [1,1] and f(1)=1.

Which is greater now: the probability of randomly drawing a green ball from the red box or a red ball from the green box?","completion":"Firstly, let's clarify the part about the colored balls. 1. Initially, we have two boxes: - The red box contains 100 red balls. - The green box contains 100 green balls. 2. We transfer 8 red balls from the red box to the green box. Now: - The red box has (100 - 8 = 92) red balls. - The green box has (100) green balls and (8) red balls. 3. Next, we transfer 8 balls from the green box back to the red box.

Find the analytical expression of y in terms of x and determine the maximum profit.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution: Part 1: Finding the Cost Price of Each Type of Helmet Let's denote: - a as the cost price of each type A helmet in yuan, - b as the cost price of each type B helmet in yuan. From the given information, we have two equations: 1. For 3 type A helmets and 4 type B helmets, the total cost is 288 yuan, which gives us the equation: 3a + 4b = 288. 2. For 6 type A helmets and 2 type B helmets, the total cost is 306 yuan, which gives us the equation: 6a + 2b = 306. Solving these equations simultaneously: - Multiplying the second equation by 2 gives us 12a + 4b = 612. - Subtracting the first equation from this result gives 9a = 324. - Therefore, a = 36. Substituting a = 36 into the first equation: - 3(36) + 4b = 288, - 108 + 4b = 288, - 4b = 180, - b = 45. Thus, the cost price of each type A helmet is boxed{36} yuan, and the cost price of each type B helmet is boxed{45} yuan.

Given one angle is 90 degrees and another is 120 degrees, the remaining angles must sum to (360 - 90 - 120 = 150) degrees. - **Diagonal Properties**: The diagonals are equal and intersect at 90 degrees, meaning the figure symmetrically splits. Thus, two interpretations arise depending whether angles are adjacent or opposite and each option influences triangle types. We consider both configurations. - **Triangle type feasibility**: - **Acute Isosceles Triangle**: If diagonals split the angles evenly, triangles formed will have side lengths and angles changing. At least one triangle can be formed with two angles less than 90 degrees and equal, making it acute and isosceles. - **Isosceles Right Triangle**: This requires the two equal angles to be each 45 degrees, possible if the diagonals cut a right angle in the quadrilateral symmetrically. - **Acute Scalene Triangle**: With divisions creating unequal smaller angles from the original 90 degrees and 120 degrees, an acute scalene triangle can form. - **Right Triangle**: As diagonals intersect at 90 degrees, one of the triangles formed at the intersection can be a right triangle. - **Obtuse Isosceles Triangle**: Given that there is only one obtuse angle (120 degrees) and if a diagonal cuts through this obtusely, forming two equal angles over 90 is mathematically infeasible. Conclusion: From the analysis above, the type of triangle that cannot be formed in this scenario is an **Obtuse Isosceles Triangle** due to the division of the known 120-degree angle.

Now, let's square both sides of equation 1 to get a new equation that will help us relate it to equation 2: (a + b + c)^2 = 24^2 a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 576 We know that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 392 from equation 2, so we can substitute that into the above equation: 392 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 576 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 576 - 392 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 184 ab + ac + bc = 92 Now we have an expression for the sum of the products of the pairs of numbers.

We know that a + b + c = 24 and a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 2760, so we can substitute these into the equation: 24^3 = 2760 + 3(a^2b + ab^2 + a^2c + ac^2 + b^2c + bc^2) + 6abc 13824 = 2760 + 3(2ab(a + b) + 2ac(a + c) + 2bc(b + c)) + 6abc We can simplify this further by using the fact that a + b + c = 24: 13824 = 2760 + 3(2ab(24 - c) + 2ac(24 - b) + 2bc(24 - a)) + 6abc 13824 = 2760 + 6ab(24 - c) + 6ac(24 - b) + 6bc(24 - a) + 6abc Now we can use the fact that ab + ac + bc = 92: 13824 = 2760 + 6(92 - ac - bc - ab) + 6abc 13824 = 2760 + 552 - 6ac - 6bc - 6ab + 6abc Now we can simplify and solve for abc: 11064 = 552 - 6(ab + ac + bc) + 6abc 11064 = 552 - 6(92) + 6abc 11064 = 552 - 552 + 6abc 11064 = 6abc Finally, we can solve for abc: abc = 11064 / 6 abc = 1844 Therefore, the product of the numbers is boxed{1844} ."},{"prompt":"Given P: |x2| leq 3, and Q: x geq 1 or x leq 5, P is the ( ) condition for Q.

Substituting this in gives: [ fleft(-frac{3b}{2}right) = 0 - frac{9b^2}{4} + 5b = 5b - frac{9b^2}{4}. ] Setting this equal to 5 (the edge of our strip where the parabola just touches): [ 5b - frac{9b^2}{4} = 5 ] [ 20b - 9b^2 = 20 ] [ 9b^2 - 20b + 20 = 0. ] Using the quadratic formula: [ b = frac{-(-20) pm sqrt{(-20)^2 - 4 cdot 9 cdot 20}}{2 cdot 9} = frac{20 pm sqrt{400 - 720}}{18} = frac{20 pm sqrt{-320}}{18}. ] Since this equation yields no real solutions for b (as the discriminant is negative), there are no real numbers b that satisfy the conditions of the problem.

Given ( f(6) = 2 ): [ f(6+n) = f(2+n) ] This equation is valid for all integers ( n geq 1 ). To further verify periodicity, check particular values: - ( n = 1 implies f(7) = f(3) ) - ( n = 2 implies f(8) = f(4) ) - ( n = 3 implies f(9) = f(5) ) - ( n = 4 implies f(10) = f(6) = 2 ) - and so on. This indicates a period of 4 starting from ( n = 3 ). Thus, ( f(n) ) is periodic with period 4 for ( n geq 3 ). 2. **Identifying distinct values**: Given ( f(6), f(9), f(12), ) and ( f(15) ) are distinct values. Identify these values in terms of ( f ): - ( f(6) = 2 ) - ( f(9) ) is different from 2 and distinct - ( f(12) ) is also distinct and different from the previous values - ( f(15) ) similarly must be distinct from all previous values Because of the periodicity, each ( f(n) ) in every group of 4 will map to one of these four distinct values. 3. **Finding the number of satisfying positive integers**: We need the count of 3-digit integers ( n ) such that ( f(n) = f(2005) ). Since ( f(n) ) has a period of 4, we can express any three-digit integer ( n ) as: [ f(n) = f(3 + k cdot 4) ] for ( k ) a non-negative integer. This period implies within any block of 4 integers, exactly one will map to ( f(2005) ). **Step 2: Counting the groups**: The range of three-digit integers is from 100 to 999. Compute the total number of such integers: [ 999 - 100 + 1 = 900 ] We divide this by the period (4): [ frac{900}{4} = 225 ] Therefore, there are exactly 225 groups of 4 integers each in the three-digit number range. 4. **Conclusion**: So, there are ( 225 ) three-digit positive integers ( n ) that satisfy ( f(n) = f(2005) ).

Consider a right circular cone with a height (SO) and base radius (R). Inside this cone, a regular triangular pyramid (SABC) is inscribed such that its base (ABC) lies in the plane of the cone's base, and its apex (S) aligns with the apex of the cone. The given pyramid has an apothem (SM = k), and the lateral face (SBC) forms an angle (alpha) with the plane of the base. 2. We know that: - (SO) is also the height of the cone. - Each lateral edge of the pyramid (SBC) is a generating line of the cone. Let's denote: - (M) as the midpoint of the edge (AB) of the triangle (ABC). 3. Since (SM = k), it is the apothem of the pyramid, and (angle OMS = alpha) represents the angle between the lateral face (SBC) and the base plane. 4.

Therefore, the equation of parabola C is y^2 = x. Since circle M is tangent to line l at x = 1 and its center is at M(2,0), the radius of circle M is 1.

Every pair of vertices is connected by one of these lengths, and these connections result in a pattern of repetition in the distances between vertices. 2. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**: When we select five vertices from the regular 15-gon, we form binom{5}{2} = 10 segments connecting these vertices. Since there are only seven possible lengths, at least two of these segment lengths must repeat. The pigeonhole principle dictates that some lengths must appear at least twice. 3. **Analyzing Segment Lengths**: Among the ten segments, there are various scenarios of repeating lengths: - **Three Segments of Equal Length**: If the same distance repeats among three of these segments, then we can select two of these segments which share a common vertex due to the triangular nature of the connections. With segments sharing a vertex, they form the legs of an isosceles triangle. 4. **Continuing with Different Pairs**: Suppose we only have pairs of equal lengths, without any triple repetitions. There are at least three pairs of equal length segments due to the ten segments covering five vertices. Here’s what happens in this scenario: - Consider two segments, say mathrm{AB} and mathrm{CD}, both equal by length. The quadrilateral formed by vertices A, B, C, and D must feature another pair (either its sides or diagonals) that repeats in length due to length constraints and the nature of cyclic polygons. - Within this quadrilateral structure, the diagonals or alternate segments must also share length characteristics dictated by symmetry, resulting in more pair repetitions across any subset of vertices. 5. **Forming Isosceles Triangles**: In any triangular subset formed from this grouping of segments, there will exist at least one common set of distances due to the symmetrical properties and inherent repetition among the subsets. Given at least three pairs of equal-length segments connect five vertices, some configuration must provide an isosceles triangle. # Conclusion: Given the constraints and repetitions dictated by both the properties of a regular 15-gon and the pigeonhole principle, any selection of five vertices from this structure will invariably provide three vertices that form an isosceles triangle. Therefore, it is proven that among any five vertices of a regular 15-gon, there will always be three vertices that form an isosceles triangle. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"What is the minimum value of z if z = x^2 + 2y^2 + y^3 + 6x 4y + 30?","completion":"First, we rewrite the expression grouping terms of x and y similarly as in the original problem: z = left(x^2 + 6xright) + 2left(y^2 - 2yright) + y^3 + 30.

D: If nonzero vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} satisfy |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|=|overrightarrow{a}overrightarrow{b}|, then the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is frac{π}{2}.","completion":"To determine which statements are correct, we examine each statement in detail: **Statement A**: Suggests that any two unit vectors are equal. However, unit vectors only require that their magnitudes are equal to 1; their directions can be completely different. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. **Statement B**: States that two non-zero vectors with opposite directions must be collinear. This is true by the definition of collinearity and opposite vectors. If two vectors have opposite directions, they lie on the same line, thus are collinear. So, B is correct. **Statement C**: Involves vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,2) and overrightarrow{b}=(m,1). The condition for the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} to be acute is that their dot product, overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}, is greater than 0. Calculating the dot product gives: [ overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = (1)(m) + (2)(1) = m + 2 > 0 ] This implies m > -2. However, the statement also needs to satisfy the condition that the angle is acute without any other restrictions, but given m > -2, this doesn't inherently make C incorrect or correct just based on the acute condition; the misunderstanding in the standard solution appears to be in assuming an extra condition that isn't provided in the statement C itself. Thus, the interpretation of C as incorrect based on additional conditions (m neq frac{1}{2}) is not aligned with the given statement's focus on the acuteness of the angle alone. Given the misinterpretation, let's correct our approach: Since we only need m + 2 > 0 to ensure the angle is acute and that condition is satisfied with m > -2, statement C is, based on the corrected understanding, inaccurately evaluated in the provided solution. However, following the original solution's logic without adding or assuming beyond what's given, the direct implication of m > -2 is correct under the acute angle condition alone. **Statement D**: Given |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}| = |overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|, squaring both sides gives: [ |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|^2 = |overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|^2 ] This simplifies to: [ overrightarrow{a}^2 + overrightarrow{b}^2 + 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = overrightarrow{a}^2 + overrightarrow{b}^2 - 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} ] Which further simplifies to 4overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 0, implying that overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 0. This means vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are perpendicular, so the angle between them is frac{pi}{2}. Thus, statement D is correct. Given the analysis, the correct statements, as per the standard solution, are B and D.

For the given equation x^{2}-(2k+1)x+k^{2}+k=0, we identify a=1, b=-(2k+1), and c=k^{2}+k. Thus, [ Delta = (-(2k+1))^{2} - 4(1)(k^{2}+k) = (2k+1)^{2} - 4k^{2} - 4k. ] Expanding and simplifying, [ Delta = 4k^{2} + 4k + 1 - 4k^{2} - 4k = 1. ] Since Delta = 1 > 0, the equation always has two distinct real roots, regardless of the value of k. Part (2) Finding the Value of k When triangle ABC is an Isosceles Triangle Given that Delta = 1 > 0, the roots of the equation, which represent the lengths of sides AB and AC, are distinct. Therefore, one of these sides must be equal to the third side, BC = 5, to form an isosceles triangle. Substituting x = 5 into the original equation, [ 25 - 5(2k+1) + k^{2} + k = 0, ] which simplifies to [ k^{2} - 9k + 20 = 0. ] Solving this quadratic equation for k, we find [ k_{1} = 4 quad text{and} quad k_{2} = 5. ] - When k = 4, the original equation becomes x^{2} - 9x + 20 = 0, yielding roots x_{1} = 4 and x_{2} = 5.

This gives us the relationship between a and b as frac{b}{a} = sqrt{3}. Additionally, the distance from the center to the focus is given by sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2. From frac{b}{a} = sqrt{3}, we can express b in terms of a as b = asqrt{3}.

The midpoint M of AB has coordinates x_M = frac{x_A + x_B}{2} and y_M = frac{y_A + y_B}{2}, which simplifies to x_M = frac{2k^2}{k^2 - 3} and y_M = frac{6k}{k^2 - 3}.

The total number of votes for candidate Y from Republicans will be (3x * (100-R)/100) and from Democrats will be (2x * (100-15)/100). Candidate X is expected to win the election by 20.000000000000004 percent, which means that the percentage of votes for candidate X is 50% + 20.000000000000004/2 = 60.000000000000002%. So, the equation representing the total percentage of votes for candidate X is: (3x * R/100 + 2x * 15/100) / (3x + 2x) = 60.000000000000002/100 Simplifying the equation: (3R + 30) / 5 = 60.000000000000002 Multiplying both sides by 5: 3R + 30 = 300.0000000000001 Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3R = 270.0000000000001 Dividing both sides by 3: R = 90.00000000000003 Therefore, approximately boxed{90%} of Republicans are expected to vote for candidate X."},{"prompt":"Colin can skip at six times the speed that Brandon can.

Colin can skip at six times the speed that Brandon can: C = 6Br 4. Daniel can skip at one-fourth the speed that Colin can: D = (1/4) * C We are given that Bruce skips at 1 mile per hour, so B = 1 mph.

By the Two Tangent Theorem, which states that the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length, we have: - AP = AQ = 23 - BP = BR = 27 Let CQ = CR = x. This means that each side of the triangle can be expressed in terms of x: AC = 23 + x, BC = 27 + x, and AB = 23 + 27 = 50. The semi-perimeter of the triangle, denoted as s, is calculated as: [ s = frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = frac{50 + (23 + x) + (27 + x)}{2} = 50 + x ] The area of the triangle, A, can be found using the formula A = rs, where r is the radius of the inscribed circle and s is the semi-perimeter. Substituting the given values: [ A = 21(50 + x) ] Alternatively, the area of the triangle can also be calculated using Heron's formula, A = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Substituting the expressions for the sides in terms of x: [ A = sqrt{(50+x)(x)(23)(27)} ] Equating the two expressions for the area of the triangle and squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives: [ [21(50+x)]^2 = (50+x)(x)(621) ] Simplifying this equation: [ 441(50+x) = 621x ] Solving for x: [ 180x = 441 cdot 50 Longrightarrow x = frac{245}{2} ] The perimeter of the triangle is twice the semi-perimeter, 2s.

Since pipes a and b can each fill the tank in 20 minutes, their rates of filling the tank are ( frac{1}{20} ) of the tank per minute. The rate of pipe c is ( frac{1}{t} ) of the tank per minute. When all three pipes are opened together, their combined rate is ( frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{t} ).

Since i^2 = -1, we can rewrite the expression by distributing and combining like terms: (1+i)(a+i) = a + ai + i - 1.

Rearrange the right-hand side to the following form: [ (a cdot x)^x = (a^x) cdot x^x ] 4. Now we have: [ lambda^{a cdot x} = a^x cdot x^x ] 5. Equating the exponents of (x) on both sides, and rewriting it for clarity: [ a cdot x = x log_x(a) + x log_x(x) ] This simplifies to: [ a = log_x(a) + log_x(x) ] Given (x log_x(x) = 1) (since (log_x(x)) is always 1), we simplify further to get: [ a = log_x(a) + 1 ] 6.

In chess, a horse (knight) moves in an \\"L\\" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular. 2. **Initial Consideration:** Let's consider the maximum number of black horses that can be placed on the board. We need to ensure that each black horse can attack at most one other black horse. 3. **Strategy:** We can use a pattern to place the black horses. One effective way is to place the black horses in a checkerboard pattern, but we need to ensure that no two black horses can attack more than one other black horse. 4. **Checkerboard Pattern:** Place black horses on every other square in a checkerboard pattern. This means placing black horses on all squares of one color (say, black squares) and white horses on the other color (white squares). 5. **Verification:** In a checkerboard pattern, each black horse is surrounded by white squares, and thus cannot attack another black horse. However, we need to ensure that no black horse can attack more than one other black horse. 6. **Detailed Placement:** Let's place black horses on the following positions: - (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (1,7) - (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (3,7) - (5,1), (5,3), (5,5), (5,7) - (7,1), (7,3), (7,5), (7,7) This gives us a total of 16 black horses. 7. **Checking the Condition:** Each black horse can attack at most one other black horse. For example, the black horse at (1,1) can attack the black horse at (3,2) and vice versa. Similarly, the black horse at (1,3) can attack the black horse at (3,4) and vice versa. This pattern ensures that no black horse can attack more than one other black horse. 8. **Proof of Maximum:** To prove that more than 16 black horses cannot be placed without violating the condition, consider any 4x4 subgrid. If we place more than 4 black horses in any 4x4 subgrid, at least one black horse will be able to attack more than one other black horse due to the density of placement.

What is the maximum number of gangsters that can be in Chicago?","completion":"To determine the largest possible number of gangsters in Chicago under the given conditions, we need to perform a detailed analysis. 1. **Representing the Problem with Graph Theory**: - We are given 36 gangs, and each gangster belongs to several gangs. - Each pair of gangs with no common gangster must be conflicting (i.e., at least one gangster being in each of the two gangs would prevent them from being enemies). 2. **Identifying the Structure of Gangs and Gangsters**: - Let's denote gangs as ( G_1, G_2, ldots, G_{36} ). - Each gangster can be represented by a set of gangs they belong to. 3. **Optimal Set Representation (Error-Correcting Codes)**: - The given conditions suggest modeling the problem using combinatorial designs or error-correcting codes, where we have a finite number of sets (gangs) with specific overlapping properties. 4. **Using Binary Representation**: - Consider representing each gangster by a 36-bit binary string, where each bit corresponding to a gang (1 if the gangster is in that gang, 0 otherwise). - Given the conditions, each pair of gangsters must have a distinct set of gangs they belong to. This property is closely related to the properties of a binary Hamming code. 5. **Bound by Property and Constraints**: - To satisfy the conditions, each binary string (representing a gangster) must be able to differ in at least one bit position when compared to any other string. - The most famous and effective method that corresponds to distinct sets with the minimal overlap is using the properties of **Hamming codes** or some design theory. 6. **Calculation Using Combinatorial Design Constructions**: - A Hamming code of 11 bits can encode up to (2^{11} = 2048) distinct codewords, but given more constraints in this problem (which can be seen as hypercubes of unit BC): - Constructing code sets within each bit length still remains the optimal method. We use the powersets for each combinatorial design in 36 sets, leading to considering subsets by ranks. 7. **Maximum Calculation**: - Each subset in the power set of the 36 possibilities up to rank (2^{12}) (basis subset) indicates our combinations. - Hence the calculation boils down to: (2^n), where (n) is the total distinctive subsets achievable without overlap under basic constraints. Thus, given a more drilled combinatoric through distinct selection without violate constraints, Consequently, the largest number of gangsters each in unique gang selections can model computed effectively as shown: 3^{12} = 531441 Thus, [boxed{531441}] is the maximum number of gangsters possible in accordance with the given constraints."},{"prompt":"What is the least common multiple of 18 and 30?","completion":"First, factorize 18 and 30 into their prime factors: - 18 = 2 cdot 3^2 - 30 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in any of the numbers.

Let ( F ) be the midpoint of ( CB ). 3. **Parallel Lines and Properties**: - Given ( MO parallel AD ), and since both are perpendicular to ( CB ), the quadrilateral ( MODA ) forms a parallelogram. - Hence, ( MA = OD ). 4. **Reflection and Symmetry**: - Reflect point ( C ) across ( O ) to get point ( C^* ). - Triangle ( CBC^* ) is a right triangle and congruent to triangle ( CFO ). - Since ( BC = 2CF ), it follows ( BC^* = 2OF ). 5. **Formation of Parallelogram**: - The quadrilateral ( MAC^*B ) is also a parallelogram: - Sides ( MA parallel FD parallel BC^* ) and ( CA perp AC^* ). - Given ( C ) and ( C^* ) are equidistant from ( O ) along a diameter, ( CC^* ) is a diameter. - Because ( MB perp AC ), ( MB parallel AC^* ). - Therefore, ( MA = OD = BC^* ) and since ( OD = 2OF ), point ( O ) is also the centroid of triangle ( BCD ). 6. **Isosceles and Equilateral Properties**: - Triangle ( CBD ) is isosceles, since ( OB = OD ). - The centroid property and the circumcenter property imply triangle ( CBD ) is equilateral. - Therefore, ( angle CDB = 60^circ ). 7. **Calculation of Angle at ( A )**: - Since ( A ) lies on the circumcircle, on the opposite arc of ( CB ) from ( D ), line ( AD ) bisects ( angle CAB ). - Given ( angle CDB = 60^circ ), we find ( angle CAB = 2 times angle CDB = 120^circ ). **Conclusion**: Thus, the angle at vertex ( A ) is: [ boxed{120^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"right triangle ABC with angle C = 90^circ, medians overline{AD} and overline{BE} are perpendicular.

By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one ( y_k ) such that: [ y_k ge frac{165}{10} = 16.5 ] Since ( y_k ) must be an integer, it follows that: [ y_k ge 17 ] Therefore, ( a ge 17 ). 4.

Specifically: [ widehat{QPA} = 180^circ - widehat{QPB} ] - Here, widehat{QPB} is the angle in the triangle formed by points Q, P, and B. 6. **Angles in Cyclic Quadrilateral**: - Since B and C lie on Gamma_2, and considering points Q, P, B, and C form cyclic quadrilaterals, the angles widehat{QPA} and widehat{BCQ} are thus equal because they are subtended by the same arc BQ: [ widehat{QPA} = widehat{BCQ} ] 7. **Angle Equality and Conclusion**: - From steps 4 and 6, we have: [ widehat{DQC} = widehat{BCQ} ] - Considering that widehat{BCQ} and widehat{DCQ} are angles in the same triangle at D, this implies that: [ widehat{DQC} = widehat{DCQ} ] - Hence, triangle QDC is isosceles at D. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{QDC text{ is isosceles at } D} ]"},{"prompt":"A penny, nickel, dime, quarter, halfdollar, and dollar coin are simultaneously flipped.

Calculate ( sin alpha ) using the Pythagorean identity: [ sin^2 alpha = 1 - cos^2 alpha ] Substituting ( cos alpha ): [ sin^2 alpha = 1 - left(frac{12}{13}right)^2 ] Square ( cos alpha ): [ sin^2 alpha = 1 - frac{144}{169} ] Subtract the fractions: [ sin^2 alpha = frac{169 - 144}{169} ] Complete the subtraction: [ sin^2 alpha = frac{25}{169} ] Take the square root of both sides: [ sin alpha = frac{5}{13} ] 5.

This year, the Li family sold watermelons after they ripened. In the 30 days of sales, they sold 200 kilograms on the first day. In order to increase sales, they implemented a price reduction strategy, selling 40 kilograms more each day than the previous day. Let the price of watermelon on day x be y yuan per kilogram. The function expression of y in terms of x is given by y=mx62m. The price on the 12th day is 5 yuan per kilogram, and on the 26th day, it is 3.5 yuan per kilogram. It is known that the cost of growing watermelons is 2.5 yuan per kilogram, and the daily profit is W yuan (profit = sales revenue cost). Find:<br/>(1)m=______,n=______.<br/>(2)On which day of selling watermelons is the profit maximized? What is the maximum profit?","completion":"Let's break down the solution into detailed steps: **(1) Finding m and n:** Given the function expression of price y in terms of day x is y=mx-62m. - For x=12 and y=5 (12th day, 5 yuan/kg), substituting into the equation gives: [ 5 = 12m - 62m ] Simplifying, we find: [ 5 = -50m Rightarrow m = -frac{1}{10} ] Therefore, m = -frac{1}{10}. - For x=26 and y=3.5 (26th day, 3.5 yuan/kg), the price is given as n=3.5 directly without needing to substitute into the equation. Thus, n = 3.5. So, we have m = -frac{1}{10} and n = 3.5. Therefore, the answers for part (1) are: [ m = -frac{1}{10}, quad n = 3.5 ] **(2) Maximizing Profit:** Given the sales volume on day x is 200+40(x-1)=40x+160. - When 1 leqslant x < 20, the profit W can be calculated as: [ W = (40x + 160)(-0.1x + 6.2 - 2.5) = -4x^2 + 132x + 592 ] This simplifies to: [ W = -4(x - 16.5)^2 + 1681 ] The maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 16.5. Since x must be an integer, the maximum profit occurs at x = 16 or x = 17, with W_{max} = 1680 yuan. - When 20 leqslant x leqslant 30, the profit W is given by: [ W = (40x + 160)(3.5 - 2.5) = 40x + 160 ] Since this is a linear function with a positive slope, W increases with x. Therefore, at x = 30, W_{max} = 1360 yuan. Comparing the two maximum profits, 1680 yuan is greater than 1360 yuan. Thus, the maximum profit is achieved on the 16th or 17th day. Therefore, the profit is maximized on the 16th or 17th day of selling watermelons, with a maximum of boxed{1680} yuan."},{"prompt":"an acute isosceles triangle (ABC) ((AB = BC)), altitudes (AD) and (CE) intersect at point (H).

First, calculate the magnitude of (z): [ |z| = sqrt{1^2 + (2sqrt{6})^2} = sqrt{1 + 24} = sqrt{25} = 5 ] Therefore, the magnitude of (z^n) is: [ |z^n| = |z|^n = 5^n ] Since (z^n = a_n + b_n i), the magnitude of (z^n) is also given by: [ |z^n| = sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2} ] Equating the two expressions for (|z^n|), we get: [ sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2} = 5^n ] Squaring both sides, we obtain: [ a_n^2 + b_n^2 = 5^{2n} ] 2. **Step 2: Find the constants (p, q) such that (a_{n+2} = p a_{n+1} + q a_n)** Observe the polynomial (P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 25) has roots (z) and (overline{z}).

Given that one side of the coop is against a wall, and the total length of the fence used for the other three sides is 24m, we can express the dimensions of the coop in terms of a single variable. Let's denote: - The length of the chicken coop (the side parallel to the wall) as x meters. - The width of the chicken coop (the two sides perpendicular to the wall) as frac{1}{2}(24-x) meters, since these two sides together with the opposite side of the length must sum up to 24m. The area S of the chicken coop can be calculated as the product of its length and width, which gives us: [S = x cdot frac{1}{2}(24 - x)] [= frac{1}{2}x(24 - x)] [= frac{1}{2}(24x - x^2)] [= -frac{1}{2}x^2 + 12x] [= -frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 24x + 144) + 72] [= -frac{1}{2}(x - 12)^2 + 72] This equation represents a parabola that opens downwards, indicating that the maximum value of S occurs at the vertex of the parabola.

We need to prove that there exist two points such that the midpoint of the segment connecting these two points also has integer coordinates. **Step 2: Understanding Midpoint Calculation** Let the coordinates of two points be ((x_1, y_1)) and ((x_2, y_2)). The coordinates of the midpoint (M) of the segment connecting these points are given by: (M) = left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}right) For (M) to have integer coordinates, both (frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) and (frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}) must be integers. This is possible if and only if (x_1 + x_2) is even and (y_1 + y_2) is even. **Step 3: Parity Conditions** The sum (x_1 + x_2) is even if both (x_1) and (x_2) are either even or both are odd. Similarly, (y_1 + y_2) is even if both (y_1) and (y_2) are either even or both are odd.

According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if you distribute 5 items into 4 containers, at least one container must contain at least 2 items. Thus, at least two of the five points must share the same parity pair. **Step 6: Conclusion of Proof** Since at least two points share the same parity pair, the coordinates of their midpoint will both be integers (since both coordinates are either both even or both odd). Therefore, there exist at least two points among the given five points such that the midpoint of the segment connecting them has integer coordinates. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Eddy and Freddy start simultaneously from city A and they travel to city B and city C respectively.

If x > 0, then multiplying both sides of the inequality a < b by x maintains the inequality, so ax < bx. However, if x < 0, the inequality direction would flip, making ax > bx. Since the value of x is not specified, we cannot determine that ax < bx must always be true. Therefore, option A cannot be determined as always true without additional information about x. **Option B: 3a < 2b** Starting from the given a < b, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get 3a < 3b. However, this does not directly relate to 3a < 2b. To compare 3a and 2b, we note that if a < b, then certainly 3a < 3b, but this does not necessarily mean 3a < 2b without knowing the specific values of a and b. Therefore, we cannot conclude that option B must be true based solely on a < b. **Option C: -a + 3 > -b + 3** Given a < b, we multiply both sides by -1 to reverse the inequality, yielding -a > -b. Adding 3 to both sides gives -a + 3 > -b + 3. This manipulation does not change the direction of the inequality, so if a < b, then it must be true that -a + 3 > -b + 3. Therefore, option C must be true. **Option D: 2 - a < 2 - b** Given a < b, we subtract a and b from 2, respectively, to get 2 - a and 2 - b. Since subtracting a larger number results in a smaller result, 2 - a would be greater than 2 - b because a < b. This means that 2 - a > 2 - b, not 2 - a < 2 - b as stated.

Furthermore, the cross-section plane (P) passes through vertex (A) and intersects the lateral edges (B B_1), (C C_1), and (D D_1) at points (K), (L), and (M) respectively. The shapes formed by the intersections, (AKB, AMD, DMLC), and the base (ABCD) form a geometric progression. 2. Note that each face of the parallelepiped is a rhombus. Let the side length of each rhombus be (a) and height (h). 3. Denote (BK = x), (DM = y), and (CL = z). Since the triangles ( triangle AKB), ( triangle AMD), and ( triangle DMLC) form a geometric progression with the base (ABCD): [ S_{triangle AKB} = frac{1}{2} x h, quad S_{triangle AMD} = frac{1}{2} y h, quad S_{DMLC} = frac{1}{2} (y + z) h, quad S_{ABCD} = a h ] 4.

We’ll start by expanding and manipulating the given equation. 1. Let’s make specific choices for ( x ) and ( y ). Suppose: [ x = n + k quad text{and} quad y = n + b ] where ( k ) is an integer we will determine later. Then we can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as follows: [ x^2 - y^2 + ax + by = (n + k)^2 - (n + b)^2 + a(n + k) + b(n + b) ] 2. Expand the squares and simplify: [ (n + k)^2 - (n + b)^2 = (n^2 + 2kn + k^2) - (n^2 + 2bn + b^2) ] This simplifies to: [ (n^2 + 2kn + k^2) - (n^2 + 2bn + b^2) = n^2 + 2kn + k^2 - n^2 - 2bn - b^2 = 2kn - 2bn + k^2 - b^2 ] 3. Next, incorporate the linear terms: [ x^2 - y^2 + ax + by = (2kn - 2bn + k^2 - b^2) + a(n + k) + b(n + b) ] Simplify the entire expression: [ = 2kn - 2bn + k^2 - b^2 + an + ak + bn + b^2 ] Combine like terms: [ = n(2k + a - 2b + b) + k^2 + ak ] Thus, it reduces to: [ = n(2k + a - b) + k^2 + ak ] 4. Since ( a + b ) is odd, it follows that ( a - b ) is also odd. We need to determine ( k ) such that: [ 2k + a - b = 1 ] Since ( a - b ) is odd, we can always find an integer ( k ) that satisfies this equation. 5. Solving for ( k ): [ 2k = 1 - (a - b) ] Let ( k = frac{1 - (a - b)}{2} ). This ( k ) is an integer because ( 1 - (a - b) ) is even. 6. Substituting ( 2k + a - b = 1 ) back into our simplified equation: [ n(1) + k^2 + ak = n + k^2 + ak ] 7. By adjusting ( n ), ( c = k^2 + ak ) can take any integer value, and thus every integer ( n ) can be expressed in the desired form. Therefore, we have shown that for every integer ( n ), we can find integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that: [ n = x^2 - y^2 + ax + by ] Hence, the proof concludes.

Our goal is to determine if we can mark all integer points on this segment using the following rule: - You can mark the midpoint of any segment if its coordinates are integers and both endpoints are already marked. 2. **Step-by-Step Verification:** - Since (d) is coprime with 1001, it implies ( gcd(d, 1001) = 1 ). - Consider the key insight: If you iteratively mark midpoints, the process can emulate a series of binary divisions across the segment. 3. **Understanding the Properties of d:** - Given (1001 = 7 times 11 times 13), the number (d) cannot share any of these prime factors. - Since (d) is coprime to 1001, by properties of coprime numbers, (d) retains specific sequences of divisibility. 4. **Divide and Conquer Strategy:** - If (d) is positioned and can be repeatedly halved (ensuring integrality), all points theoretically develop an arithmetic relationship influenced by the repeated operation of dividing by 2. 5. **Focus on the Numerator-Conditions:** - If we can successfully mark points (frac{d}{2}) and (frac{d + 2002}{2}) since half-way sits within the integral span.

Consider two transmission schemes: single transmission and triple transmission. Single transmission means each signal is sent only once, and triple transmission means each signal is repeated three times. The received signal needs to be decoded according to the following rules: for single transmission, the received signal is the decoded signal; for triple transmission, the signal with the highest frequency in the received signals is the decoded signal (for example, if the received signals are 1, 0, 1 in sequence, then the decoded signal is 1).

Multiplying these probabilities together gives the probability of receiving the sequence 1, 0, 1 as sent, which is: (1-beta) times (1-alpha) times (1-beta) = (1-alpha)(1-beta)^2.

So, option B is correct as it correctly represents the probability of receiving 1, 0, 1 when sending 1 in a triple transmission scheme. **For option C:** Considering the transmission of 1 using the triple transmission scheme, to decode as 1, the received sequence must predominantly contain 1s.

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by the formula (x-2) times 180^{circ}. According to the problem, this sum is 1800^{circ}. Therefore, we set up the equation: [ (x-2) times 180 = 1800 ] Solving this equation for x involves dividing both sides by 180: [ x - 2 = frac{1800}{180} x - 2 = 10 x = 10 + 2 x = 12 ] So, the polygon has 12 sides. To find the number of diagonals that can be drawn from one vertex, we subtract the sides adjacent to the vertex and the vertex itself from the total number of vertices. Since a vertex cannot form a diagonal with itself or with its two adjacent vertices, the calculation is: [ 12 - 3 = 9 ] Therefore, the number of diagonals that can be drawn from one vertex of this polygon is 9 diagonals.

This number can be expressed in a different format using the formula for a geometric series: [ S = frac{10^{5^n} - 1}{9} ] 4.

If ( r mid k ) for all ( k ) such that ( p mid 10^k - 1 ), induction would suffice: - Base case: If ( k = r ), the statement is trivially true since ( r mid r ). - Inductive step: Assume ( m mid 10^v - 1 ) implies ( r mid v ) for ( v < k ). For ( k ): - Note that ( p ) divides both ( 10^k - 1 ) and ( 10^r - 1 ), so: [ p mid 10^k - 10^r = 10^r(10^{k-r} - 1) ] - Since ( p mid 10^k - 1 ) and ( 10^k equiv 1 pmod{p} ), it follows ( 10^{k-r} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). - By the inductive hypothesis, ( r mid k - r ), hence ( r mid k ). 7.

Applying Fermat's Little Theorem, ( p mid 10^{p-1} - 1 ), we get ( p - 1 ) is divisible by ( r ): [ p - 1 mid 5^s ] and since ( r geq 5 ), ( p-1 ) must be divisible by 10 due to our previous results (as ( p ) must prevent direct division by powers of prime less than or equal to 5). 10.

To compute the given limit, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Recall that in polar coordinates, we have: [ x = r cos varphi, quad y = r sin varphi. ] 2. Substituting ( x ) and ( y ) in terms of ( r ) and ( varphi ) into the function ( f(x,y) ), we get: [ f(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2)^2 x^2 y^2 = (r^2)^2 (r cos varphi)^2 (r sin varphi)^2. ] 3. Simplify the expression: [ f(x, y) = r^4 (r^2 cos^2 varphi sin^2 varphi) = r^4 r^4 cos^2 varphi sin^2 varphi = r^8 cos^2 varphi sin^2 varphi. ] 4. Notice that we need to find [ lim_{r to 0} r^8 cos^2 varphi sin^2 varphi. ] 5. The expression can be rewritten in a more convenient form: [ lim_{r to 0} left( r^2 right)^{4} cos^2 varphi sin^2 varphi. ] 6. Factor out the trigonometric part: [ lim_{r to 0} r^8 cos^2 varphi sin^2 varphi. ] 7. Recognizing that ( cos^2 varphi sin^2 varphi leq 1 ), we get: [ lim_{r to 0} r^8 cos^2 varphi sin^2 varphi = 0, ] because ( r^8 ) goes to 0 as ( r ) approaches 0 regardless of the values of ( varphi ). 8. Using the exponential form to verify, observe that we have: [ lim_{r to 0} exp left( r^4 sin^2 2varphi ln r right), ] where ( sin 2varphi ) is bounded and the term ( r^4 ln r ) tends to ( 0 ) as ( r ) approaches 0. 9. Calculating ( lim_{r to 0} r^4 ln r ) using L'Hôpital's rule: [ lim_{r to 0} frac{ln r}{r^{-4}} = lim_{r to 0} frac{1/r}{-4r^{-5}} = lim_{r to 0} -frac{r^4}{4} = 0. ] 10.

Let their projections be denoted as A^*, B_2^*, C_2^*, and F^* respectively. 2. **Identifying Projections:** - Since the squares are constructed outwardly, B_2^* and C_2^* lie on the extensions of BC beyond C and B respectively. - Consider right triangles C_2C_2^*B and BA^*A. These triangles are congruent because C_2B = BA, and the respective angles are equal as they are right angles formed by the squares. 3. **Using Congruence:** - Similarly, triangles AA^*C and CB_2^*B_2 are congruent. - Thus, the trapezoid C_2C_2^*B_2^*B_2 has two pairs of congruent parallel sides. 4. **Calculating the Midline:** C_2C_2^* + B_2B_2^* = BA^* + A^*C = BC F F^* = frac{BC}{2} - Therefore, the length of the midline FF^* of the trapezoid is half the length of BC. 5. **Perpendicularity:** - The midline FF^* is perpendicular to BC. This signifies that point F is at a distance of BC/2 from both the F^* point on BC and the line BC itself. 6. **Midpoint Verification:** - We will now show that F^* is the midpoint of segment BC. - Owing to congruent triangles as discussed, segment F^*C is smaller than F^*B_2^* by the same amount BF^*.

In graph theory terms, we need a connected graph where each edge is a bridge. This property is inherently satisfied by a tree, where every edge is a cut-edge (removal of any edge increases the number of connected components by one). 3. **Construct a Solution:** - Consider a tree structure such as a \\"chain\\" or \\"path.\\" In this structure, we arrange the five points in a linear sequence where each point (except the endpoints) connects to two other points, forming a linked chain. - Label the points as ( A, B, C, D, ) and ( E ). - Connect the points sequentially: ( A ) to ( B ), ( B ) to ( C ), ( C ) to ( D ), and ( D ) to ( E ). - This creates a graph with the edges ( A-B, B-C, C-D, ) and ( D-E ). 4. **Verification:** - The resulting structure is a path (a type of tree) which is inherently connected. - Removing any segment (edge) breaks the path into exactly two connected sub-paths. For example, if the segment connecting ( B ) and ( C ) is removed, points ( A ) and ( B ) will form one connected component (chain), and points ( C, D, ) and ( E ) will form another connected component. 5. **Conclusion:** Based on the steps above, we can indeed connect five points in a connected system that turns into exactly two connected, but isolated subsystems upon the removal of any single edge, as required by the problem statement.

The sum [ sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{2i}(x_{2i+1} - x_{2i-1}) ] can be interpreted as the sum of the areas of rectangles with base ( x_{2i+1} - x_{2i-1} ) and height ( x_{2i} ). 2. **Upper and Lower Bounds**: The total area under the line ( y = x ) from ( x = 0 ) to ( x = 1 ) is the area of the triangle with base 1 and height 1, which is [ frac{1}{2}. ] The sum of the areas of the rectangles approximates this area. However, due to the condition ( x_{i+1} - x_i leq h ), the rectangles may overestimate or underestimate the area slightly. 3. **Bounding the Sum**: - **Upper Bound**: The maximum possible overestimation occurs when each interval ( x_{i+1} - x_i ) is exactly ( h ).

Since the remaining groups are fixed, the total number of distinct distribution plans for this case is: [ binom{6}{3} = 20 ] Case 2: If we distribute the staff such that two groups have 2 members each, and the other two groups have 1 member each, we can choose the first group of 2 in binom{6}{2} ways and the second group of 2 in binom{4}{2} ways.

The net can be arranged in a T-shape, a cross, or any other valid cube unfolding. - Place the 10 squares in such a manner on the net ensuring no two squares share an edge.

The train needs to cover the distance equal to its own length plus the distances between the poles.

The distances between the poles are given as 150 meters, 250 meters, 400 meters, 500 meters, and 700 meters. However, we need to consider that the train will start crossing from before the first pole and will end after crossing the last pole. So, we need to add the length of the train to the distance after the last pole. The total distance the train will cover is the sum of the distances between the poles plus the length of the train: Total distance = Distance between first and second pole + Distance between second and third pole + Distance between third and fourth pole + Distance between fourth and fifth pole + Length of the train after the last pole Total distance = 150m + 250m + 400m + 500m + 700m + 300m (length of the train) Total distance = 2300m + 300m Total distance = 2600m Now, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s to match the units of distance: Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 h / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 200 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 200,000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 55.56 m/s (rounded to two decimal places) Now we can calculate the time taken by the train to cover the total distance: Time = Total distance / Speed Time = 2600m / 55.56 m/s Time ≈ 46.78 seconds So, the train will take approximately boxed{46.78} seconds to cross the five electric poles."},{"prompt":"an n times n table, some 2n cells are marked.

Let’s denote the position of the leftmost marked cell in the ( i )-th row as ( k_i ). For each row, shift the marked cells to the left by ( k_i - 1 ) cells, so that the leftmost marked cell in each row is positioned in the first column. 3. **Shifting Cells:** Performing this shift does not alter the overall structure or property of the table concerning the existence of a parallelogram formed by marked cells. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:** After the shift, in the first column of the new table, the number of marked cells may be ( leq n ). Since there are ( 2n ) marked cells in total: [ 2n - n = n ] This means that there are still ( n ) marked cells distributed over the remaining ( n-1 ) columns. 5. **Ensuring Overlap in Columns:** By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these second marked cells must share a column (after the first one). This is because distributing ( n ) remaining cells in ( n-1 ) columns guarantees at least one column will have at least two marked cells. 6. **Forming the Parallelogram:** Let’s denote the rows as ( i ) and ( j ) for the two marked cells in one such column (not first column) and its corresponding leftmost cells in the first column: - ( (i, k_{i}') ) - ( (i, 1) ) - ( (j, k_{j}') ) - ( (j, 1) ) These cells form a rectangle in the original table due to the columns and rows determining their positions. 7. **Conclusion:** The above configuration ensures that the vertices of the rectangle align perfectly via parallel rows and corresponding columns, meeting the required condition of parallelogram formation.

This means the selling price (SP) for 20 articles is the same as the CP for 15 articles, which is 15. Since the dealer still makes a profit of 35%, we can calculate the actual SP for 20 articles that would give the dealer a 35% profit. The CP for 20 articles is 20, so a 35% profit on this would be 20 + 35% of 20 = 20 + 7 = 27. The dealer actually sold the 20 articles for 15 instead of 27, so the discount given on the SP is 27 - 15 = 12. The discount percentage on the SP is calculated as (Discount / Original SP) * 100. The original SP for 20 articles, based on the MP, would be 20 articles * 2/article = 40. So the cash discount percentage is (12 / 40) * 100 = 30%.

On the first day, Vehicle A transports frac{1}{4} of the total goods. This leaves frac{3}{4} of the goods to be transported. 2. On the second day, both Vehicle A and Vehicle B work together for frac{1}{2} day. In this time, Vehicle A continues to transport frac{1}{4} of the total goods because it transports frac{1}{4} of the goods per day.

Vehicle B, working together with Vehicle A for frac{1}{2} day, helps complete the transportation of all goods. We are trying to find out how long it would take for Vehicle B to transport all the goods alone, represented by x days. 4. To represent the work done by both vehicles in the frac{1}{2} day, we consider the work done by Vehicle A and Vehicle B together. Since Vehicle A does frac{1}{8} of the total work in this time, the remaining work done must be attributed to Vehicle B.

Pass a line GT through point G such that GT perp O_1G. 2. This perpendicular intersects the circle centered at O_1 at point T. 3. From the given problem, angle AGT = angle ADG = angle ACB , we know that TG parallel BC. 4. Therefore, O_1G perp BC. 5. Since O_1G perp BC and OO_2 perp BC, it must follow that O_1G parallel OO_2. 6. Similarly, OO_1 parallel GO_2 can be deduced. 7. Hence, O_1OO_2G forms a parallelogram. As a result, point N is the midpoint of both OG and O_1O_2. **Step 2: Establish midpoint on the secant line:** 1. Select a point M' on the secant line HG such that (HG cdot HM' = HA cdot HB). 2. From this, we know that G, A, B, M' are cyclic quadrilateral points. 3. Further, since (HD cdot HC = HA cdot HB), it indicates that C,D,G, M' are also cyclic quadrilateral points. **Step 3: Construct other perpendiculars and midpoints:** 1.

Notice that E is the midpoint of PG, and F is the midpoint of GQ, hence, S is the midpoint of EF. **Step 4: Demonstrate perpendicularity and midpoint properties:** 1. Compute the angle angle BOC = 2 angle BAC. Since angle measures add up cyclically, ( angle BAC + angle BDC = angle BM'Q + angle QM'C = angle BM'C ). Therefore, B, C, M', O are also cyclic quadrilateral points. 2. Therefore, ( angle OM'B = angle OCB = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - angle BOC) = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - angle BM'C) = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - 2 angle BM'Q) = 90^circ - angle BM'Q ). 3. Hence, OM' perp PQ, establishing that NO = NM'. 4. Considering the symmetry, S being at the midpoint of GM', we can conclude: [ PM' = PG + GM' = 2EG + 2GS = 2ES ] [ QM' = QG - GM' = 2FG - 2GS = 2FS = 2ES ] So, M' is the midpoint of PQ, which re-emphasizes M' equiv M.

Therefore, the minimum diameter (and radius) of the cylindrical container must be (8) inches to accommodate the base of the lampshade. - The volume (V) of the cylindrical container is calculated using the formula (V = pi r^2 h), where (r) is the radius and (h) is the height. Substituting (r = 4) inches and (h = 15) inches, we get: [ V = pi times (4)^2 times 15 = 240pi text{ cubic inches} ] Therefore, the volume of the container is (boxed{240pi}) cubic inches."},{"prompt":"A subset of the integers 1,2,cdots,200 has the property that none of its members is 4 times another.

If an integer n is included in the subset, then 4n cannot be included. We start by considering the largest numbers and checking if they can be included: - The integers from 151 to 200 can be included because 4 times 150 = 600, which is outside our range, and including these numbers does not violate the constraint. This gives us 200 - 150 + 1 = 51 numbers. - For integers from 1 to 150, we avoid those that, when multiplied by 4, stay within the range of 1 to 200. Specifically: - We can include integers from 38 to 150 because 4 times 37 = 148, and hence numbers from 38 and above do not violate the constraint when their multiples are considered. This gives us 150 - 37 = 113 numbers. - Finally, for numbers from 1 to 37, we need to exclude every fourth number to meet the constraint.

For the numerator, the first term a is 1 and the common ratio r is frac{1}{3}. For the denominator, the first term a is also 1, but the common ratio r here is frac{1}{2}.

Thus, the function attains its maximum value when x = 1. Substituting x = 1 into the function yields the maximum value: y(1) = 3 + 2(1) - (1)^2 = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4. Since f(x) = log_{frac{1}{2}}(y) and the base frac{1}{2} is less than 1, f(x) is a decreasing function with respect to y. Therefore, as y reaches its maximum at y = 4, f(x) reaches its minimum value.

Since he rides at 10 miles per hour, in 30 minutes (which is half an hour), he would cover half of 10 miles, which is 5 miles. Next, he rides for another 15 miles. To find out how long this takes, we divide the distance by his speed: 15 miles / 10 miles per hour = 1.5 hours To convert 1.5 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes per hour: 1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes Then, he rests for 30 minutes.

Thus, the statement holds for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that the statement holds for all positive integers up to ( n-1 ). That is, for any integer ( m < n ), the number of divisors of ( m ) of the form ( 3k+1 ) is at least as many as those of the form ( 3k-1 ). 3. **Induction Step:** We need to show that the statement holds for ( n ). - **Case 1: ( n ) has no prime divisor ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ):** If ( n ) has no prime divisor ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then all prime divisors of ( n ) are either ( equiv 1 pmod{3} ) or ( equiv 0 pmod{3} ). Therefore, all divisors of ( n ) must be of the form ( 3k+1 ).

Using the first equation (T = L/2), we can substitute T in the second equation: L = (L/2) + 15. Now, let's solve for L: L - L/2 = 15 L/2 = 15 L = 15 * 2 L = 30. Now that we know Lisa earned 30, we can find out how much Tommy earned: T = L/2 T = 30/2 T = 15. Now we know: Lisa earned 30. Tommy earned 15. Since the total amount earned by all three (Lisa, Jack, and Tommy) is 60, we can find out how much Jack earned by subtracting Lisa and Tommy's earnings from the total: Jack's earnings = Total earnings - (Lisa's earnings + Tommy's earnings) Jack's earnings = 60 - (30 + 15) Jack's earnings = 60 - 45 Jack's earnings = 15.

For the denominator: - sin(3pi - alpha) = -sin(alpha) due to the sin function being odd and periodic. - cosleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight) = -cos(alpha) by the same co-function reasoning as above. - sinleft(frac{9pi}{2} + alpharight) = sin(alpha) using sine's periodicity (sin(theta + 2pi k) = sin(theta) for any integer k).

For this to happen, the length of one period, frac{2pi}{omega}, must fit into the interval [0, 2pi] more than twice but less than three times. This is because each period of the cosine function has exactly two points where cos omega x = 1 (at the start and end of each period), but since we are considering the interval starting from 0, the first zero is at x=0. Therefore, we need two full periods and a part of the third period within [0, 2pi] to have exactly 3 zeros. 4. **Translate this condition into an inequality**: This requirement translates into the inequality 2 cdot frac{2pi}{omega} leq 2pi < 3 cdot frac{2pi}{omega}. Simplifying this inequality gives us the range for omega. 5. **Solve the inequality for omega**: Solving 2 cdot frac{2pi}{omega} leq 2pi leads to omega geq 2, and solving 2pi < 3 cdot frac{2pi}{omega} leads to omega < 3. Combining these gives 2 leq omega < 3.

What's critical here is recognizing that ( 1999! ) contains multiple factors of 9 (since ( 1999! ) includes all numbers from 1 to 1999, and many of these are multiples of 3 and 9). 5. **Reduction to a single digit:** - The process mentioned in the reference involves reducing the sum of digits repeatedly until a single digit is achieved. This is a form of digital root: text{Digital Root}(n) = 1 + ((n - 1) mod 9) - For ( 1999! ), since it contains numerous factors of 9, the sum of its digits will also be multiple of 9. 6. **Final single-digit result:** - The sum of the digits of ( 1999! ), when reduced repeatedly by summing the digits, must ultimately be a number between 1 and 9. Given that ( 1999! ) is divisible by 9, this single final digit must also be divisible by 9. 7. **Conclusion drawn:** - Since 9 is the only single-digit number divisible by 9, the process will ultimately yield the digit 9.

We reorder them such that a_1 leq a_2 leq ldots leq a_{100}, and if a_i = a_j for some i < j, then b_i < b_j. 3. **Claim**: The maximum value of N, the number of good pairs, is boxed{197}. 4. **Upper Bound Proof**: - **Key Claim**: For any fixed integer m, 1 leq m leq 100, there are at most 2 values of i with 1 leq i < m such that the pair (i, m) is good. - **Proof by Contradiction**: Assume there exist three integers i, j, and k with 1 leq i, j, k < m such that (i, m), (j, m), and (k, m) are all good. - **Congruence Relations**: From |a_ib_j - a_jb_i| = 1, we have: [ a_ib_m equiv pm 1 pmod{a_m}, quad a_jb_m equiv pm 1 pmod{a_m}, quad a_kb_m equiv pm 1 pmod{a_m} ] - **Analysis of Congruences**: Since i, j, k < m, and a_i, a_j, a_k < a_m, we conclude that a_i = a_j = a_k or a_i = a_m - a_j = a_m - a_k. This implies at least two of a_i, a_j, a_k are equal, say a_i = a_j. - **Case Analysis**: - **Case 1**: a_m > 2. We derive a_mb_i - a_mb_j = pm 2, 0, leading to b_i = b_j, contradicting the distinctness of pairs. - **Case 2**: a_m = 2. Subcases lead to contradictions either by forcing b_i = b_j or by violating the condition |a_ib_m - a_mb_i| = 1. - **Case 3**: a_m = 1. Similar analysis leads to contradictions in subcases. - **Case 4**: a_m = 0. This directly contradicts |a_ib_m - a_mb_i| = 1 since the expression evaluates to 0. 5. **Counting Good Pairs**: - For m = 1, no good pairs exist. - For m = 2, at most one good pair exists. - For 2 < m leq 100, at most 2 good pairs exist per m. - Summing up, we get at most 2 times 98 + 1 = 197 good pairs. 6. **Achievability**: - Consider the sequence (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), ldots, (99,100). Here, (1, n) is good for all 1 < n leq 100, and (i, i+1) is good for all 1 < i < 100. This gives a total of 197 good pairs.

If her average speed along the whole journey is 3 kilometers per hour, what was her average speed (in kilometers per hour) while climbing to the top, taking into account the slippery terrain?","completion":"To find Natasha's average speed while climbing to the top, we first need to determine the total distance of the journey. Since we know her average speed for the entire trip and the total time it took, we can calculate the total distance. The total time taken for the journey (up and down the hill) is 5 hours (up) + 3 hours (down) = 8 hours. Given that her average speed for the entire journey is 3 kilometers per hour, we can calculate the total distance covered as follows: Total distance = Average speed × Total time Total distance = 3 km/h × 8 h Total distance = 24 kilometers Since she climbs up and then descends the same path, the distance to the top is half the total distance: Distance to the top = Total distance / 2 Distance to the top = 24 km / 2 Distance to the top = 12 kilometers Now we can calculate her average speed while climbing to the top: Average speed (climbing) = Distance to the top / Time taken to climb Average speed (climbing) = 12 km / 5 h Average speed (climbing) = 2.4 km/h Therefore, Natasha's average speed while climbing to the top was boxed{2.4} kilometers per hour."},{"prompt":"Determine the sum of values of k for which the area of the triangle with vertices at (2, 8), (14, 17), and (6, k) (where k is an integer) is minimized.","completion":"First, we find the equation of the line ell containing (2, 8) and (14, 17). The slope of ell is calculated as follows: [ m = frac{17 - 8}{14 - 2} = frac{9}{12} = frac{3}{4}. ] The line equation using point-slope form is: [ y - 8 = frac{3}{4}(x - 2). ] Expanding and simplifying gives: [ y = frac{3}{4}x + 5. ] Substituting x = 6 (the x-coordinate of the third vertex), we find: [ y = frac{3}{4} times 6 + 5 = 9.5. ] This implies that (6, 9.5) lies on line ell. Since k must be an integer, the closest values are k = 9 or k = 10. This is similar to original problem reasoning that to minimize the area, the triangle becomes degenerate if k = 9.5. Therefore, k must be those integers close to 9.5, which are 9 and 10. Calculating the area for each, just as in the original problem through vertical drops and checking minimum heights, we conclude that: - For k=9, the height relative to line ell is 0.5. - For k=10, the height relative to line ell is 0.5 as well, since both are 0.5 units away but in opposite directions from 9.5. Thus, both triangles have minimal area triangles, similarly to the original solution. Summing these values we find: [ boxed{19} ]"},{"prompt":"The maximum safe amount of caffeine you can consume per day is 500 mg. If each energy drink has a certain amount of caffeine and Brandy drinks 4 of them, she can safely consume 20 mg more caffeine that day. How much caffeine is in each energy drink?","completion":"Let's denote the amount of caffeine in each energy drink as ( x ) mg. Brandy drinks 4 of these energy drinks, so the total amount of caffeine she consumes from the energy drinks is ( 4x ) mg. According to the information given, Brandy can safely consume 20 mg more caffeine that day after drinking the 4 energy drinks. This means that the total amount of caffeine from the energy drinks plus the additional 20 mg should not exceed the maximum safe amount of 500 mg. So we can set up the following equation: [ 4x + 20 = 500 ] Now, we solve for ( x ): [ 4x = 500 - 20 ] [ 4x = 480 ] [ x = frac{480}{4} ] [ x = 120 ] Therefore, each energy drink contains boxed{120} mg of caffeine."},{"prompt":"rectangle ABCD, AB = 4 and BC = 10.

Since A and G match, triangle CGA is now a right triangle, with AG = 4 and CG = 7. We apply the Pythagorean Theorem: [ AG^2 + CG^2 = AC^2 Rightarrow 4^2 + 7^2 = AC^2 Rightarrow 16 + 49 = AC^2 Rightarrow AC = sqrt{65} ] Now, consider triangle AEC: - Since AE = AB + BE = 4 + 4 = 8 (because AB was extended by BE, which equals AB). - We already know AC = sqrt{65}. - Angle angle AEC is a right angle because AB and BC are sides of the original rectangle. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle AEC, we have: [ AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2 Rightarrow 8^2 + CE^2 = 65 Rightarrow 64 + CE^2 = 65 Rightarrow CE^2 = 1 Rightarrow CE = sqrt{1} = 1 ] Hence, the length of segment CE is boxed{1}."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],W={key:0},G={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
